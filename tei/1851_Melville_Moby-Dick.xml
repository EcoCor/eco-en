     CHAPTER 1
    </head>
    <p>
     Loomings
    </p>
    <p>
     Call me Ishmael.  Some years ago--never mind how long precisely--
    </p>
    <p>
     having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular
    </p>
    <p>
     to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little
    </p>
    <p>
     and see the watery part of the world.  It is a way I have
    </p>
    <p>
     of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth;
    </p>
    <p>
     whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I
    </p>
    <p>
     find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses,
    </p>
    <p>
     and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet;
    </p>
    <p>
     and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me,
    </p>
    <p>
     that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from
    </p>
    <p>
     deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking
    </p>
    <p>
     people's hats off--then, I account it high time to get to sea
    </p>
    <p>
     as soon as I can.  This is my substitute for pistol and ball.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword;
    </p>
    <p>
     I quietly take to the ship.  There is nothing surprising in this.
    </p>
    <p>
     If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time
    </p>
    <p>
     or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards
    </p>
    <p>
     the ocean with me.
    </p>
    <p>
     There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves
    </p>
    <p>
     as Indian isles by coral reefs--commerce surrounds it with her surf.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right and left, the streets take you waterward.  Its extreme downtown
    </p>
    <p>
     is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled
    </p>
    <p>
     by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land.
    </p>
    <p>
     Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon.  Go from
    </p>
    <p>
     Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward.
    </p>
    <p>
     What do you see?--Posted like silent sentinels all around the town,
    </p>
    <p>
     stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads;
    </p>
    <p>
     some looking over the bulwarks glasses! of ships from China; some high
    </p>
    <p>
     aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep.
    </p>
    <p>
     But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster--
    </p>
    <p>
     tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks.
    </p>
    <p>
     How then is this?  Are the green fields gone?  What do they here?
    </p>
    <p>
     But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water,
    </p>
    <p>
     and seemingly bound for a dive.  Strange!  Nothing will content
    </p>
    <p>
     them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady
    </p>
    <p>
     lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice.  No. They must get
    </p>
    <p>
     just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in.
    </p>
    <p>
     And there they stand--miles of them--leagues.  Inlanders all,
    </p>
    <p>
     they come from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues,--
    </p>
    <p>
     north, east, south, and west.  Yet here they all unite.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses
    </p>
    <p>
     of all those ships attract them thither?
    </p>
    <p>
     Once more.  Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you
    </p>
    <p>
     down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is magic in it.  Let the most absent-minded of men be
    </p>
    <p>
     plunged in his deepest reveries--stand that man on his legs,
    </p>
    <p>
     set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water,
    </p>
    <p>
     if water there be in all that region.  Should you ever be athirst
    </p>
    <p>
     in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your
    </p>
    <p>
     caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
     But here is an artist.  He desires to paint you the dreamiest,
    </p>
    <p>
     shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all
    </p>
    <p>
     the valley of the Saco.  What is the chief element he employs?
    </p>
    <p>
     There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit
    </p>
    <p>
     and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there
    </p>
    <p>
     sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping
    </p>
    <p>
     spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue.  But though
    </p>
    <p>
     the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down
    </p>
    <p>
     its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd's head, yet all were vain,
    </p>
    <p>
     unless the shepherd's eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you
    </p>
    <p>
     wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies--what is the one charm wanting?--
    </p>
    <p>
     Water there is not a drop of water there!  Were Niagara but a
    </p>
    <p>
     cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it?
    </p>
    <p>
     Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls
    </p>
    <p>
     of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed,
    </p>
    <p>
     or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach?  Why is
    </p>
    <p>
     almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him,
    </p>
    <p>
     at some time or other crazy to go to sea?  Why upon your first voyage
    </p>
    <p>
     as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration,
    </p>
    <p>
     when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land?
    </p>
    <p>
     Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy?  Why did the Greeks
    </p>
    <p>
     give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove?  Surely all this
    </p>
    <p>
     is not without meaning.  And still deeper the meaning of that story
    </p>
    <p>
     of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting,
    </p>
    <p>
     mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned.
    </p>
    <p>
     But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key
    </p>
    <p>
     to it all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin
    </p>
    <p>
     to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs,
    </p>
    <p>
     I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger.
    </p>
    <p>
     For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but
    </p>
    <p>
     a rag unless you have something in it.  Besides, passengers get sea-sick--
    </p>
    <p>
     grow quarrelsome--don't sleep of nights--do not enjoy themselves much,
    </p>
    <p>
     as a general thing;--no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though I am
    </p>
    <p>
     something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain,
    </p>
    <p>
     or a Cook.  I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices
    </p>
    <p>
     to those who like them.  For my part, I abominate all honorable
    </p>
    <p>
     respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking
    </p>
    <p>
     care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not.  And as for
    </p>
    <p>
     going as cook,--though I confess there is considerable glory in that,
    </p>
    <p>
     a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board--yet, somehow, I never
    </p>
    <p>
     fancied broiling fowls;--though once broiled, judiciously buttered,
    </p>
    <p>
     and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more
    </p>
    <p>
     respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled
    </p>
    <p>
     ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures
    </p>
    <p>
     in their huge bakehouses the pyramids.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,
    </p>
    <p>
     plumb down into the fore-castle, aloft there to the royal
    </p>
    <p>
     mast-head. True, they rather order me about some, and make me
    </p>
    <p>
     jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow.
    </p>
    <p>
     And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     It touches one's sense of honor, particularly if you come
    </p>
    <p>
     of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers,
    </p>
    <p>
     or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes.  And more than all, if just
    </p>
    <p>
     previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been
    </p>
    <p>
     lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys
    </p>
    <p>
     stand in awe of you.  The transition is a keen one, I assure you,
    </p>
    <p>
     from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction
    </p>
    <p>
     of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it.
    </p>
    <p>
     But even this wears off in time.
    </p>
    <p>
     What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get
    </p>
    <p>
     a broom and sweep down the decks?  What does that indignity amount to,
    </p>
    <p>
     weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament?  Do you think
    </p>
    <p>
     the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly
    </p>
    <p>
     and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance?
    </p>
    <p>
     Who ain't a slave?  Tell me that.  Well, then, however the old
    </p>
    <p>
     sea-captains may order me about--however they may thump and punch
    </p>
    <p>
     me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right;
    </p>
    <p>
     that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way--
    </p>
    <p>
     either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is;
    </p>
    <p>
     and so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub
    </p>
    <p>
     each other's shoulder-blades, and be content.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make
    </p>
    <p>
     a point of paying me for my trouble, whereas they never
    </p>
    <p>
     pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the contrary, passengers themselves must pay.  And there is
    </p>
    <p>
     all the difference in the world between paying and being paid.
    </p>
    <p>
     The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction
    </p>
    <p>
     that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us.  But being paid,--
    </p>
    <p>
     what will compare with it?  The urbane activity with which a
    </p>
    <p>
     man receives money is really marvellous, considering that we
    </p>
    <p>
     so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills,
    </p>
    <p>
     and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the
    </p>
    <p>
     wholesome exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck.
    </p>
    <p>
     For as in this world, head winds are far more prevalent than winds
    </p>
    <p>
     from astern (that is, if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim),
    </p>
    <p>
     so for the most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his
    </p>
    <p>
     atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle.
    </p>
    <p>
     He thinks he breathes it first; but not so.  In much the same
    </p>
    <p>
     way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things,
    </p>
    <p>
     at the same time that the leaders little suspect it.
    </p>
    <p>
     But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt
    </p>
    <p>
     the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my
    </p>
    <p>
     head to go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible police
    </p>
    <p>
     officer of the Fates, who has the constant surveillance of me,
    </p>
    <p>
     and secretly dogs me, and influences me in some unaccountable way--
    </p>
    <p>
     he can better answer than any one else.  And, doubtless,
    </p>
    <p>
     my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand
    </p>
    <p>
     programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more
    </p>
    <p>
     extensive performances.  I take it that this part of the bill
    </p>
    <p>
     must have run something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
     "WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL."
    </p>
    <p>
     "BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN."
    </p>
    <p>
     Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage,
    </p>
    <p>
     when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies,
    </p>
    <p>
     and short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces--
    </p>
    <p>
     though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall
    </p>
    <p>
     all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and
    </p>
    <p>
     motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises,
    </p>
    <p>
     induced me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me
    </p>
    <p>
     into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased
    </p>
    <p>
     freewill and discriminating judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great
    </p>
    <p>
     whale himself.  Such a portentous and mysterious monster
    </p>
    <p>
     roused all my curiosity.  Then the wild and distant seas where
    </p>
    <p>
     he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils
    </p>
    <p>
     of the whale; these, with all the attending marvels of a thousand
    </p>
    <p>
     Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish.
    </p>
    <p>
     With other men, perhaps, such things would not have been inducements;
    </p>
    <p>
     but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote.
    </p>
    <p>
     I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a horror,
    </p>
    <p>
     and could still be social with it--would they let me--since it is
    </p>
    <p>
     but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place
    </p>
    <p>
     one lodges in.
    </p>
    <p>
     By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome;
    </p>
    <p>
     the great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild
    </p>
    <p>
     conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into my
    </p>
    <p>
     inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them all,
    </p>
    <p>
     one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.

     CHAPTER 2
    </head>
    <p>
     The Carpet-Bag
    </p>
    <p>
     I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm,
    </p>
    <p>
     and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific.  Quitting the good city
    </p>
    <p>
     of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford.  It was on a Saturday
    </p>
    <p>
     night in December.  Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little
    </p>
    <p>
     packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching
    </p>
    <p>
     that place would offer, till the following Monday.
    </p>
    <p>
     As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling
    </p>
    <p>
     stop at this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage,
    </p>
    <p>
     it may as well be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing.
    </p>
    <p>
     For my mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft,
    </p>
    <p>
     because there was a fine, boisterous something about everything
    </p>
    <p>
     connected with that famous old island, which amazingly pleased me.
    </p>
    <p>
     Besides though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolizing
    </p>
    <p>
     the business of whaling, and though in this matter poor old Nantucket
    </p>
    <p>
     is now much behind her, yet Nantucket was her great original--
    </p>
    <p>
     the Tyre of this Carthage;--the place where the first dead
    </p>
    <p>
     American whale was stranded.  Where else but from Nantucket did
    </p>
    <p>
     those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes
    </p>
    <p>
     to give chase to the Leviathan?  And where but from Nantucket,
    </p>
    <p>
     too, did that first adventurous little sloop put forth,
    </p>
    <p>
     partly laden with imported cobblestones--so goes the story--
    </p>
    <p>
     to throw at the whales, in order to discover when they were nigh
    </p>
    <p>
     enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit?
    </p>
    <p>
     Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me
    </p>
    <p>
     in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became
    </p>
    <p>
     a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night,
    </p>
    <p>
     bitingly cold and cheerless.  I knew no one in the place.
    </p>
    <p>
     With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few
    </p>
    <p>
     pieces of silver,--So, wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself,
    </p>
    <p>
     as I stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag,
    </p>
    <p>
     and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards
    </p>
    <p>
     the south--wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge
    </p>
    <p>
     for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire the price,
    </p>
    <p>
     and don't be too particular.
    </p>
    <p>
     With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of
    </p>
    <p>
     "The Crossed Harpoons"--but it looked too expensive and jolly there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Further on, from the bright red windows of the "Sword-Fish Inn,"
    </p>
    <p>
     there came such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted
    </p>
    <p>
     the packed snow and ice from before the house, for everywhere
    </p>
    <p>
     else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard,
    </p>
    <p>
     asphaltic pavement,--rather weary for me, when I struck
    </p>
    <p>
     my foot against the flinty projections, because from hard,
    </p>
    <p>
     remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most
    </p>
    <p>
     miserable plight.  Too expensive and jolly, again thought I,
    </p>
    <p>
     pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street,
    </p>
    <p>
     and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within.
    </p>
    <p>
     But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don't you hear? get away
    </p>
    <p>
     from before the door; your patched boots are stopping the way.
    </p>
    <p>
     So on I went.  I now by instinct followed the streets that
    </p>
    <p>
     took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest,
    </p>
    <p>
     if not the cheeriest inns.
    </p>
    <p>
     Such dreary streets!  Blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand,
    </p>
    <p>
     and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
     At this hour of the night, of the last day of the week,
    </p>
    <p>
     that quarter of the town proved all but deserted.  But presently
    </p>
    <p>
     I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low, wide building,
    </p>
    <p>
     the door of which stood invitingly open.  It had a careless look,
    </p>
    <p>
     as if it were meant for the uses of the public; so, entering,
    </p>
    <p>
     the first thing I did was to stumble over an ash-box in the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying particles almost choked me, are these
    </p>
    <p>
     ashes from that destroyed city, Gomorrah?  But "The Crossed Harpoons,"
    </p>
    <p>
     and the "The Sword-Fish?"--this, then must needs be the sign
    </p>
    <p>
     of "The Trap."  However, I picked myself up and hearing a loud
    </p>
    <p>
     voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior door.
    </p>
    <p>
     It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet.  A hundred
    </p>
    <p>
     black faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond,
    </p>
    <p>
     a black Angel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a negro church; and the preacher's text was about
    </p>
    <p>
     the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing and
    </p>
    <p>
     teeth-gnashing there.  Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing out,
    </p>
    <p>
     Wretched entertainment at the sign of 'The Trap!'
    </p>
    <p>
     Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from
    </p>
    <p>
     the docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up,
    </p>
    <p>
     saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it,
    </p>
    <p>
     faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray,
    </p>
    <p>
     and these words underneath--"The Spouter Inn:--Peter Coffin."
    </p>
    <p>
     Coffin?--Spouter?--Rather ominous in that particular connexion,
    </p>
    <p>
     thought I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I
    </p>
    <p>
     suppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there.  As the light
    </p>
    <p>
     looked so dim, and the place, for the time, looked quiet enough,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it
    </p>
    <p>
     might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district,
    </p>
    <p>
     and as the swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak
    </p>
    <p>
     to it, I thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the best of pea coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a queer sort of place--a gable-ended old house, one side
    </p>
    <p>
     palsied as it were, and leaning over sadly.  It stood on a sharp
    </p>
    <p>
     bleak corner, where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up
    </p>
    <p>
     a worse howling than ever it did about poor Paul's tossed craft.
    </p>
    <p>
     Euroclydon, nevertheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one
    </p>
    <p>
     in-doors, with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     In judging of that tempestuous wind called Euroclydon,"
    </p>
    <p>
     says an old writer--of whose works I possess the only copy
    </p>
    <p>
     extant--"it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou lookest
    </p>
    <p>
     out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside,
    </p>
    <p>
     or whether thou observest it from that sashless window,
    </p>
    <p>
     where the frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death
    </p>
    <p>
     is the only glazier."  True enough, thought I, as this passage
    </p>
    <p>
     occurred to my mind--old black-letter, thou reasonest well.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is the house.
    </p>
    <p>
     What a pity they didn't stop up the chinks and the crannies though,
    </p>
    <p>
     and thrust in a little lint here and there.  But it's too late
    </p>
    <p>
     to make any improvements now.  The universe is finished;
    </p>
    <p>
     the copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million
    </p>
    <p>
     years ago.  Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against
    </p>
    <p>
     the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters
    </p>
    <p>
     with his shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags,
    </p>
    <p>
     and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep
    </p>
    <p>
     out the tempestuous Euroclydon.  Euroclydon! says old Dives,
    </p>
    <p>
     in his red silken wrapper--(he had a redder one afterwards)
    </p>
    <p>
     pooh, pooh!  What a fine frosty night; how Orion glitters;
    </p>
    <p>
     what northern lights!  Let them talk of their oriental summer
    </p>
    <p>
     climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the privilege
    </p>
    <p>
     of making my own summer with my own coals.
    </p>
    <p>
     But what thinks Lazarus?  Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up
    </p>
    <p>
     to the grand northern lights?  Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra
    </p>
    <p>
     than here?  Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along
    </p>
    <p>
     the line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself,
    </p>
    <p>
     in order to keep out this frost?
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before
    </p>
    <p>
     the door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg
    </p>
    <p>
     should be moored to one of the Moluccas.  Yet Dives himself,
    </p>
    <p>
     he too lives like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs,
    </p>
    <p>
     and being a president of a temperance society, he only drinks
    </p>
    <p>
     the tepid tears of orphans.
    </p>
    <p>
     But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there is
    </p>
    <p>
     plenty of that yet to come.  Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet,
    </p>
    <p>
     and see what sort of a place this "Spouter" may be.

     CHAPTER 3
    </head>
    <p>
     The Spouter-Inn
    </p>
    <p>
     Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself
    </p>
    <p>
     in a wide, low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots,
    </p>
    <p>
     reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft.
    </p>
    <p>
     On one side hung a very large oil painting so thoroughly besmoked,
    </p>
    <p>
     and every way defaced, that in the unequal crosslights by which
    </p>
    <p>
     you viewed it, it was only by diligent study and a series of
    </p>
    <p>
     systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of the neighbors,
    </p>
    <p>
     that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
     Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at
    </p>
    <p>
     first you almost thought some ambitious young artist,
    </p>
    <p>
     in the time of the New England hags, had endeavored to delineate
    </p>
    <p>
     chaos bewitched.  But by dint of much and earnest contemplation,
    </p>
    <p>
     and oft repeated ponderings, and especially by throwing open
    </p>
    <p>
     the little window towards the back of the entry, you at last
    </p>
    <p>
     come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild,
    </p>
    <p>
     might not be altogether unwarranted.
    </p>
    <p>
     But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous,
    </p>
    <p>
     black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over
    </p>
    <p>
     three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast.
    </p>
    <p>
     A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive
    </p>
    <p>
     a nervous man distracted.  Yet was there a sort of indefinite,
    </p>
    <p>
     half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze
    </p>
    <p>
     you to it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself
    </p>
    <p>
     to find out what that marvellous painting meant.  Ever and anon
    </p>
    <p>
     a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would dart you through.--
    </p>
    <p>
     It's the Black Sea in a midnight gale.--It's the unnatural
    </p>
    <p>
     combat of the four primal elements.--It's a blasted heath.--
    </p>
    <p>
     It's a Hyperborean winter scene.--It's the breaking-up of
    </p>
    <p>
     the icebound stream of Time.  But at last all these fancies
    </p>
    <p>
     yielded to that one portentous something in the picture's midst.
    </p>
    <p>
     That once found out, and all the rest were plain.  But stop;
    </p>
    <p>
     does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish? even
    </p>
    <p>
     the great leviathan himself?
    </p>
    <p>
     In fact, the artist's design seemed this:  a final theory of my own,
    </p>
    <p>
     partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons
    </p>
    <p>
     with whom I conversed upon the subject.  The picture represents
    </p>
    <p>
     a Cape-Horner in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship
    </p>
    <p>
     weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible;
    </p>
    <p>
     and an exasperated whale, purposing to spring clean over the craft,
    </p>
    <p>
     is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.
    </p>
    <p>
     The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array
    </p>
    <p>
     of monstrous clubs and spears.  Some were thickly set with glittering
    </p>
    <p>
     teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots of human hair;
    </p>
    <p>
     and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round
    </p>
    <p>
     like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed mower.
    </p>
    <p>
     You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal
    </p>
    <p>
     and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking,
    </p>
    <p>
     horrifying implement.  Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances
    </p>
    <p>
     and harpoons all broken and deformed.  Some were storied weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
     With this once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did
    </p>
    <p>
     Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
     And that harpoon--so like a corkscrew now--was flung in Javan seas,
    </p>
    <p>
     and run away with by a whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape
    </p>
    <p>
     of Blanco.  The original iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless
    </p>
    <p>
     needle sojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet,
    </p>
    <p>
     and at last was found imbedded in the hump.
    </p>
    <p>
     Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way--
    </p>
    <p>
     cut through what in old times must have been a great central
    </p>
    <p>
     chimney with fireplaces all round--you enter the public room.
    </p>
    <p>
     A still duskier place is this, with such low ponderous
    </p>
    <p>
     beams above, and such old wrinkled planks beneath, that you
    </p>
    <p>
     would almost fancy you trod some old craft's cockpits,
    </p>
    <p>
     especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored
    </p>
    <p>
     old ark rocked so furiously.  On one side stood a long, low,
    </p>
    <p>
     shelf-like table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with
    </p>
    <p>
     dusty rarities gathered from this wide world's remotest nooks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Projecting from the further angle of the room stands a
    </p>
    <p>
     dark-looking den--the bar--a rude attempt at a right whale's head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Be that how it may, there stands the vast arched bone of the
    </p>
    <p>
     whale's jaw, so wide, a coach might almost drive beneath it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old decanters,
    </p>
    <p>
     bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction,
    </p>
    <p>
     like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called
    </p>
    <p>
     him), bustles a little withered old man, who, for their money,
    </p>
    <p>
     dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death.
    </p>
    <p>
     Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though true cylinders without--within, the villanous green goggling
    </p>
    <p>
     glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
     Parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass, surround
    </p>
    <p>
     these footpads' goblets.  Fill to this mark, and your charge is
    </p>
    <p>
     but a penny; to this a penny more; and so on to the full glass--
    </p>
    <p>
     the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp down for a shilling.
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about
    </p>
    <p>
     a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of skrimshander.
    </p>
    <p>
     I sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated
    </p>
    <p>
     with a room, received for answer that his house was full--
    </p>
    <p>
     not a bed unoccupied.  "But avast," he added, tapping his forehead,
    </p>
    <p>
     "you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer's blanket, have ye?
    </p>
    <p>
     I s'pose you are goin' a-whalin', so you'd better get used to that
    </p>
    <p>
     sort of thing."
    </p>
    <p>
     I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I
    </p>
    <p>
     should ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be,
    </p>
    <p>
     and that if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather
    </p>
    <p>
     than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night,
    </p>
    <p>
     I would put up with the half of any decent man's blanket.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I thought so.  All right; take a seat.  Supper?--you want supper?
    </p>
    <p>
     Supper'll be ready directly."
    </p>
    <p>
     I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a
    </p>
    <p>
     bench on the Battery.  At one end a ruminating tar was still
    </p>
    <p>
     further adorning it with his jack-knife, stooping over
    </p>
    <p>
     and diligently working away at the space between his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but he didn't
    </p>
    <p>
     make much headway, I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     At last some four or five of us were summoned to our
    </p>
    <p>
     meal in an adjoining room.  It was cold as Iceland--
    </p>
    <p>
     no fire at all--the landlord said he couldn't afford it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a winding sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
     We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold to our
    </p>
    <p>
     lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the fare was of the most substantial kind--not only meat
    </p>
    <p>
     and potatoes, but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper!
    </p>
    <p>
     One young fellow in a green box coat, addressed himself
    </p>
    <p>
     to these dumplings in a most direful manner.
    </p>
    <p>
     "My boy," said the landlord, "you'll have the nightmare
    </p>
    <p>
     to a dead sartainty."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Landlord," I whispered, "that aint the harpooneer is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, no," said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, "the harpooneer
    </p>
    <p>
     is a dark complexioned chap.  He never eats dumplings, he don't--
    </p>
    <p>
     he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes 'em rare."
    </p>
    <p>
     "The devil he does," says I. "Where is that harpooneer?
    </p>
    <p>
     Is he here?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "He'll be here afore long," was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this
    </p>
    <p>
     "dark complexioned" harpooneer.  At any rate, I made up my
    </p>
    <p>
     mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together,
    </p>
    <p>
     he must undress and get into bed before I did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when,
    </p>
    <p>
     knowing not what else to do with myself, I resolved to spend
    </p>
    <p>
     the rest of the evening as a looker on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Presently a rioting noise was heard without.  Starting up,
    </p>
    <p>
     the landlord cried, "That's the Grampus's crew.  I seed her reported
    </p>
    <p>
     in the offing this morning; a three years' voyage, and a full ship.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hurrah, boys; now we'll have the latest news from the Feegees."
    </p>
    <p>
     A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung open,
    </p>
    <p>
     and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough.  Enveloped in their shaggy
    </p>
    <p>
     watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters,
    </p>
    <p>
     all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles,
    </p>
    <p>
     they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador.  They had just
    </p>
    <p>
     landed from their boat, and this was the first house they entered.
    </p>
    <p>
     No wonder, then, that they made a straight wake for the whale's mouth--
    </p>
    <p>
     the bar--when the wrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating,
    </p>
    <p>
     soon poured them out brimmers all round.  One complained of a bad
    </p>
    <p>
     cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion
    </p>
    <p>
     of gin and molasses, which he swore was a sovereign cure for all
    </p>
    <p>
     colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how long standing,
    </p>
    <p>
     or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the weather side
    </p>
    <p>
     of an ice-island.
    </p>
    <p>
     The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally
    </p>
    <p>
     does even with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     and they began capering about most obstreperously.
    </p>
    <p>
     I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof,
    </p>
    <p>
     and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his
    </p>
    <p>
     shipmates by his own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from
    </p>
    <p>
     making as much noise as the rest.  This man interested me at once;
    </p>
    <p>
     and since the sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate
    </p>
    <p>
     (though but a sleeping partner one, so far as this narrative is
    </p>
    <p>
     concerned), I will here venture upon a little description of him.
    </p>
    <p>
     He stood full six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest
    </p>
    <p>
     like a coffer-dam. I have seldom seen such brawn in a man.
    </p>
    <p>
     His face was deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth
    </p>
    <p>
     dazzling by the contrast; while in the deep shadows of his eyes
    </p>
    <p>
     floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.
    </p>
    <p>
     His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his
    </p>
    <p>
     fine stature, I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers
    </p>
    <p>
     from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia.  When the revelry of his
    </p>
    <p>
     companions had mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved,
    </p>
    <p>
     and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates,
    </p>
    <p>
     and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favorite with them,
    </p>
    <p>
     they raised a cry of "Bulkington!  Bulkington! where's Bulkington?"
    </p>
    <p>
     and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was now about nine o'clock, and the room seeming almost
    </p>
    <p>
     supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate
    </p>
    <p>
     myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous
    </p>
    <p>
     to the entrance of the seamen.
    </p>
    <p>
     No man prefers to sleep two in a bed.  In fact, you would
    </p>
    <p>
     a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother.  I don't know
    </p>
    <p>
     how it is, but people like to be private when they are sleeping.
    </p>
    <p>
     And when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger,
    </p>
    <p>
     in a strange inn, in a strange town, and that stranger
    </p>
    <p>
     a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely multiply.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep
    </p>
    <p>
     two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more
    </p>
    <p>
     sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
     To be sure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you
    </p>
    <p>
     have your own hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket,
    </p>
    <p>
     and sleep in your own skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated
    </p>
    <p>
     the thought of sleeping with him.  It was fair to presume that
    </p>
    <p>
     being a harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be,
    </p>
    <p>
     would not be of the tidiest, certainly none of the finest.
    </p>
    <p>
     I began to twitch all over.  Besides, it was getting late,
    </p>
    <p>
     and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at midnight--
    </p>
    <p>
     how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?
    </p>
    <p>
     "Landlord!  I've changed my mind about that harpooneer.--
    </p>
    <p>
     I shan't sleep with him.  I'll try the bench here."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Just as you please; I'm sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for
    </p>
    <p>
     a mattress, and it's a plaguy rough board here"--feeling of the knots
    </p>
    <p>
     and notches.  "But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I've got a carpenter's
    </p>
    <p>
     plane there in the bar--wait, I say, and I'll make ye snug enough."
    </p>
    <p>
     So saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief
    </p>
    <p>
     first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed,
    </p>
    <p>
     the while grinning like an ape.  The shavings flew right and left;
    </p>
    <p>
     till at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot.
    </p>
    <p>
     The landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven's
    </p>
    <p>
     sake to quit--the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know
    </p>
    <p>
     how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank.
    </p>
    <p>
     So gathering up the shavings with another grin, and throwing them into
    </p>
    <p>
     the great stove in the middle of the room, he went about his business,
    </p>
    <p>
     and left me in a brown study.
    </p>
    <p>
     I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was
    </p>
    <p>
     a foot too short; but that could be mended with a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it was a foot too narrow, and the other bench in
    </p>
    <p>
     the room was about four inches higher than the planed one--
    </p>
    <p>
     so there was no yoking them.  I then placed the first bench
    </p>
    <p>
     lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,
    </p>
    <p>
     leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in.
    </p>
    <p>
     But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air
    </p>
    <p>
     over me from under the sill of the window, that this plan would
    </p>
    <p>
     never do at all, especially as another current from the rickety
    </p>
    <p>
     door met the one from the window, and both together formed
    </p>
    <p>
     a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot
    </p>
    <p>
     where I had thought to spend the night.
    </p>
    <p>
     The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop,
    </p>
    <p>
     couldn't I steal a march on him--bolt his door inside, and jump
    </p>
    <p>
     into his bed, not to be wakened by the most violent knockings?
    </p>
    <p>
     It seemed no bad idea but upon second thoughts I dismissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
     For who could tell but what the next morning, so soon as I popped
    </p>
    <p>
     out of the room, the harpooneer might be standing in the entry,
    </p>
    <p>
     all ready to knock me down!
    </p>
    <p>
     Still looking around me again, and seeing no possible chance
    </p>
    <p>
     of spending a sufferable night unless in some other person's bed,
    </p>
    <p>
     I began to think that after all I might be cherishing
    </p>
    <p>
     unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown harpooneer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thinks I, I'll wait awhile; he must be dropping in before long.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll have a good look at him then, and perhaps we may become
    </p>
    <p>
     jolly good bedfellows after all--there's no telling.
    </p>
    <p>
     But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes,
    </p>
    <p>
     and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Landlord! said I, "what sort of a chap is he--does he always
    </p>
    <p>
     keep such late hours?"  It was now hard upon twelve o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
     The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     to be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No," he answered, "generally he's an early bird--airley to bed
    </p>
    <p>
     and airley to rise--yea, he's the bird what catches the worm.
    </p>
    <p>
     But to-night he went out a peddling, you see, and I don't see
    </p>
    <p>
     what on airth keeps him so late, unless, may be, he can't
    </p>
    <p>
     sell his head."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can't sell his head?--What sort of a bamboozingly story
    </p>
    <p>
     is this you are telling me?" getting into a towering rage.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you pretend to say, landlord, that this harpooneer is actually
    </p>
    <p>
     engaged this blessed Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning,
    </p>
    <p>
     in peddling his head around this town?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's precisely it," said the landlord, "and I told him he couldn't
    </p>
    <p>
     sell it here, the market's overstocked."
    </p>
    <p>
     "With what?" shouted I.
    </p>
    <p>
     "With heads to be sure; ain't there too many heads in the world?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I tell you what it is, landlord," said I quite calmly,
    </p>
    <p>
     "you'd better stop spinning that yarn to me--I'm not green."
    </p>
    <p>
     "May be not," taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick,
    </p>
    <p>
     "but I rayther guess you'll be done brown if that ere harpooneer
    </p>
    <p>
     hears you a slanderin' his head."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'll break it for him," said I, now flying into a passion again
    </p>
    <p>
     at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord's.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's broke a'ready," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Broke," said I--"broke, do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sartain, and that's the very reason he can't sell it, I guess."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Landlord," said I, going up to him as cool as Mt.  Hecla in a
    </p>
    <p>
     snowstorm--"landlord, stop whittling.  You and I must understand
    </p>
    <p>
     one another, and that too without delay.  I come to your house
    </p>
    <p>
     and want a bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one;
    </p>
    <p>
     that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer.
    </p>
    <p>
     And about this harpooneer, whom I have not yet seen, you persist
    </p>
    <p>
     in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending
    </p>
    <p>
     to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you
    </p>
    <p>
     design for my bedfellow--a sort of connexion, landlord, which is
    </p>
    <p>
     an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree.
    </p>
    <p>
     I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this
    </p>
    <p>
     harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe
    </p>
    <p>
     to spend the night with him.  And in the first place, you will
    </p>
    <p>
     be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head,
    </p>
    <p>
     which if true I take to be good evidence that this harpooneer
    </p>
    <p>
     is stark mad, and I've no idea of sleeping with a madman;
    </p>
    <p>
     and you, sir, you I mean, landlord, you, sir, by trying to induce
    </p>
    <p>
     me to do so knowingly would thereby render yourself liable
    </p>
    <p>
     to a criminal prosecution."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wall," said the landlord, fetching a long breath, "that's a
    </p>
    <p>
     purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
     But be easy, be easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin'
    </p>
    <p>
     you of has just arrived from the south seas, where he bought up
    </p>
    <p>
     a lot of 'balmed New Zealand heads (great curios, you know),
    </p>
    <p>
     and he's sold all on 'em but one, and that one he's trying to sell
    </p>
    <p>
     to-night, cause to-morrow's Sunday, and it would not do to be sellin'
    </p>
    <p>
     human heads about the streets when folks is goin' to churches.
    </p>
    <p>
     He wanted to last Sunday, but I stopped him just as he was goin'
    </p>
    <p>
     out of the door with four heads strung on a string, for all
    </p>
    <p>
     the airth like a string of inions."
    </p>
    <p>
     This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery,
    </p>
    <p>
     and showed that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me--
    </p>
    <p>
     but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed
    </p>
    <p>
     out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such
    </p>
    <p>
     a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators?
    </p>
    <p>
     "Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man."
    </p>
    <p>
     "He pays reg'lar," was the rejoinder.  "But come, it's getting
    </p>
    <p>
     dreadful late, you had better be turning flukes--it's a nice bed:
    </p>
    <p>
     Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced.
    </p>
    <p>
     There's plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed;
    </p>
    <p>
     it's an almighty big bed that.  Why, afore we give it up,
    </p>
    <p>
     Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the foot of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and somehow,
    </p>
    <p>
     Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
     After that, Sal said it wouldn't do.  Come along here,
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll give ye a glim in a jiffy;" and so saying he lighted
    </p>
    <p>
     a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way.
    </p>
    <p>
     But I stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner,
    </p>
    <p>
     he exclaimed "I vum it's Sunday--you won't see that harpooneer to-night;
    </p>
    <p>
     he's come to anchor somewhere--come along then; do come;
    </p>
    <p>
     won't ye come?"
    </p>
    <p>
     I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went,
    </p>
    <p>
     and I was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished,
    </p>
    <p>
     sure enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed
    </p>
    <p>
     for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There," said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old
    </p>
    <p>
     sea chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table;
    </p>
    <p>
     "there, make yourself comfortable now; and good night to ye."
    </p>
    <p>
     I turned round from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
     Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though none of the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny
    </p>
    <p>
     tolerably well.  I then glanced round the room; and besides
    </p>
    <p>
     the bedstead and centre table, could see no other furniture
    </p>
    <p>
     belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four walls,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of things not properly belonging to the room, there was a
    </p>
    <p>
     hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner;
    </p>
    <p>
     also a large seaman's bag, containing the harpooneer's wardrobe,
    </p>
    <p>
     no doubt in lieu of a land trunk.  Likewise, there was a parcel
    </p>
    <p>
     of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     But what is this on the chest?  I took it up, and held it close
    </p>
    <p>
     to the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way
    </p>
    <p>
     possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it.
    </p>
    <p>
     I can compare it to nothing but a large door mat,
    </p>
    <p>
     ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something
    </p>
    <p>
     like the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as you see
    </p>
    <p>
     the same in South American ponchos.  But could it be possible
    </p>
    <p>
     that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade
    </p>
    <p>
     the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise?
    </p>
    <p>
     I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper,
    </p>
    <p>
     being uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp,
    </p>
    <p>
     as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it
    </p>
    <p>
     of a rainy day.  I went up in it to a bit of glass stuck
    </p>
    <p>
     against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my life.
    </p>
    <p>
     I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself
    </p>
    <p>
     a kink in the neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking
    </p>
    <p>
     about this head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat.
    </p>
    <p>
     After thinking some time on the bed-side, I got up and took off my
    </p>
    <p>
     monkey jacket, and then stood in the middle of the room thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
     I then took off my coat, and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
     But beginning to feel very cold now, half undressed as I was,
    </p>
    <p>
     and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer's
    </p>
    <p>
     not coming home at all that night, it being so very late,
    </p>
    <p>
     I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots,
    </p>
    <p>
     and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended
    </p>
    <p>
     myself to the care of heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether that mattress was stuffed with corncobs or broken crockery,
    </p>
    <p>
     there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could
    </p>
    <p>
     not sleep for a long time.  At last I slid off into a light doze,
    </p>
    <p>
     and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod,
    </p>
    <p>
     when I heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer
    </p>
    <p>
     of light come into the room from under the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer,
    </p>
    <p>
     the infernal head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still,
    </p>
    <p>
     and resolved not to say a word till spoken to.  Holding a light
    </p>
    <p>
     in one hand, and that identical New Zealand head in the other,
    </p>
    <p>
     the stranger entered the room, and without looking towards
    </p>
    <p>
     the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor
    </p>
    <p>
     in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords
    </p>
    <p>
     of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted
    </p>
    <p>
     for some time while employed in unlacing the bag's mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     This accomplished, however, he turned round--when, good heavens;
    </p>
    <p>
     what a sight!  Such a face!  It was of a dark, purplish, yellow color,
    </p>
    <p>
     here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, it's just as I thought, he's a terrible bedfellow;
    </p>
    <p>
     he's been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is,
    </p>
    <p>
     just from the surgeon.  But at that moment he chanced to turn
    </p>
    <p>
     his face so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not
    </p>
    <p>
     be sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were stains of some sort or other.  At first I knew not what
    </p>
    <p>
     to make of this; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me.
    </p>
    <p>
     I remembered a story of a white man--a whaleman too--
    </p>
    <p>
     who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them.
    </p>
    <p>
     I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his
    </p>
    <p>
     distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
     And what is it, thought I, after all!  It's only his outside;
    </p>
    <p>
     a man can be honest in any sort of skin.  But then, what to make of
    </p>
    <p>
     his unearthly complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about,
    </p>
    <p>
     and completely independent of the squares of tattooing.
    </p>
    <p>
     To be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning;
    </p>
    <p>
     but I never heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man into a
    </p>
    <p>
     purplish yellow one.  However, I had never been in the South Seas;
    </p>
    <p>
     and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the skin.  Now, while all these ideas were passing
    </p>
    <p>
     through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me
    </p>
    <p>
     at all.  But, after some difficulty having opened his bag,
    </p>
    <p>
     he commenced fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort
    </p>
    <p>
     of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room,
    </p>
    <p>
     he then took the New Zealand head--a ghastly thing enough--
    </p>
    <p>
     and crammed it down into the bag.  He now took off his hat--
    </p>
    <p>
     a new beaver hat--when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was no hair on his head--none to speak of at least--
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead.  His bald
    </p>
    <p>
     purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull.
    </p>
    <p>
     Had not the stranger stood between me and the door, I would
    </p>
    <p>
     have bolted out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of
    </p>
    <p>
     the window, but it was the second floor back.  I am no coward,
    </p>
    <p>
     but what to make of this headpeddling purple rascal altogether
    </p>
    <p>
     passed my comprehension.  Ignorance is the parent of fear,
    </p>
    <p>
     and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger,
    </p>
    <p>
     I confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil
    </p>
    <p>
     himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night.
    </p>
    <p>
     In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough
    </p>
    <p>
     just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer
    </p>
    <p>
     concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at
    </p>
    <p>
     last showed his chest and arms.  As I live, these covered
    </p>
    <p>
     parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face,
    </p>
    <p>
     his back, too, was all over the same dark squares;
    </p>
    <p>
     he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years' War, and just
    </p>
    <p>
     escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark
    </p>
    <p>
     green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage
    </p>
    <p>
     or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas,
    </p>
    <p>
     and so landed in this Christian country.  I quaked to think of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     A peddler of heads too--perhaps the heads of his own brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
     He might take a fancy to mine--heavens! look at that tomahawk!
    </p>
    <p>
     But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went
    </p>
    <p>
     about something that completely fascinated my attention,
    </p>
    <p>
     and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or dreadnaught,
    </p>
    <p>
     which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the pockets,
    </p>
    <p>
     and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch
    </p>
    <p>
     on its back, and exactly the color of a three days' old Congo baby.
    </p>
    <p>
     Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought that this
    </p>
    <p>
     black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner.
    </p>
    <p>
     But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened
    </p>
    <p>
     a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must
    </p>
    <p>
     be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be.
    </p>
    <p>
     For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place,
    </p>
    <p>
     and removing the papered fire-board, sets up this little
    </p>
    <p>
     hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the andirons.
    </p>
    <p>
     The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty,
    </p>
    <p>
     so that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little
    </p>
    <p>
     shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.
    </p>
    <p>
     I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image,
    </p>
    <p>
     feeling but ill at ease meantime--to see what was next to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
     First he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket,
    </p>
    <p>
     and places them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship
    </p>
    <p>
     biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled
    </p>
    <p>
     the shavings into a sacrificial blaze.  Presently, after many hasty
    </p>
    <p>
     snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers
    </p>
    <p>
     (whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded
    </p>
    <p>
     in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes
    </p>
    <p>
     a little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all;
    </p>
    <p>
     he never moved his lips.  All these strange antics were accompanied
    </p>
    <p>
     by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be
    </p>
    <p>
     praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other,
    </p>
    <p>
     during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.
    </p>
    <p>
     At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very unceremoniously,
    </p>
    <p>
     and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were
    </p>
    <p>
     a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.
    </p>
    <p>
     All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness,
    </p>
    <p>
     and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding
    </p>
    <p>
     his business operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought
    </p>
    <p>
     it was high time, now or never, before the light was put out,
    </p>
    <p>
     to break the spell in which I had so long been bound.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.
    </p>
    <p>
     Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it
    </p>
    <p>
     for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth
    </p>
    <p>
     at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     The next moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal,
    </p>
    <p>
     tomahawk between his teeth, sprang into bed with me.  I sang out,
    </p>
    <p>
     I could not help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment
    </p>
    <p>
     he began feeling me.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him
    </p>
    <p>
     against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might be,
    </p>
    <p>
     to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again.
    </p>
    <p>
     But his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill
    </p>
    <p>
     comprehended my meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Who-e debel you?"--he at last said--"you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e."
    </p>
    <p>
     And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Landlord, for God's sake, Peter Coffin!" shouted
    </p>
    <p>
     I. "Landlord!  Watch!  Coffin!  Angels! save me!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!" again growled
    </p>
    <p>
     the cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered
    </p>
    <p>
     the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire.
    </p>
    <p>
     But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light
    </p>
    <p>
     in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't be afraid now," said he, grinning again, "Queequeg here wouldn't
    </p>
    <p>
     harm a hair of your head."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Stop your grinning," shouted I, "and why didn't you tell me
    </p>
    <p>
     that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I thought ye know'd it;--didn't I tell ye, he was a peddlin'
    </p>
    <p>
     heads around town?--but turn flukes again and go to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg, look here--you sabbee me, I sabbee--you this man
    </p>
    <p>
     sleepe you--you sabbee?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Me sabbee plenty"--grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe
    </p>
    <p>
     and sitting up in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You gettee in," he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk,
    </p>
    <p>
     and throwing the clothes to one side.  He really did this
    </p>
    <p>
     in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way.
    </p>
    <p>
     I stood looking at him a moment.  For all his tattooings
    </p>
    <p>
     he was on the whole a clean, comely looking cannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
     What's all this fuss I have been making about, thought I
    </p>
    <p>
     to myself--the man's a human being just as I am:  he has just
    </p>
    <p>
     as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Landlord," said I, "tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe,
    </p>
    <p>
     or whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will
    </p>
    <p>
     turn in with him.  But I don't fancy having a man smoking in bed with me.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's dangerous.  Besides, I ain't insured."
    </p>
    <p>
     This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely
    </p>
    <p>
     motioned me to get into bed--rolling over to one side as much as to say--
    </p>
    <p>
     I won't touch a leg of ye."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good night, landlord," said I, "you may go."
    </p>
    <p>
     I turned in, and never slept better in my life.

     CHAPTER 4
    </head>
    <p>
     The Counterpane
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm
    </p>
    <p>
     thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner.
    </p>
    <p>
     You had almost thought I had been his wife.  The counterpane was
    </p>
    <p>
     of patchwork, full of odd little parti-colored squares and triangles;
    </p>
    <p>
     and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan
    </p>
    <p>
     labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one precise shade--
    </p>
    <p>
     owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun
    </p>
    <p>
     and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times--
    </p>
    <p>
     this same arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like a strip
    </p>
    <p>
     of that same patchwork quilt.  Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm
    </p>
    <p>
     did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the quilt,
    </p>
    <p>
     they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the sense
    </p>
    <p>
     of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging me.
    </p>
    <p>
     My sensations were strange.  Let me try to explain them.  When I was
    </p>
    <p>
     a child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;
    </p>
    <p>
     whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle.
    </p>
    <p>
     The circumstance was this.  I had been cutting up some caper or other--
    </p>
    <p>
     I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little
    </p>
    <p>
     sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other,
    </p>
    <p>
     was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,--
    </p>
    <p>
     my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off
    </p>
    <p>
     to bed, though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon of the 21st June,
    </p>
    <p>
     the longest day in the year in our hemisphere.  I felt dreadfully.
    </p>
    <p>
     But there was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room
    </p>
    <p>
     in the third floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to
    </p>
    <p>
     kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.
    </p>
    <p>
     I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours
    </p>
    <p>
     must elapse before I could hope for a resurrection.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sixteen hours in bed! the small of my back ached to think of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     And it was so light too; the sun shining in at the window,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a great rattling of coaches in the streets, and the sound
    </p>
    <p>
     of gay voices all over the house.  I felt worse and worse--
    </p>
    <p>
     at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my
    </p>
    <p>
     stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw
    </p>
    <p>
     myself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favor to give
    </p>
    <p>
     me a good slippering for my misbehaviour:  anything indeed but
    </p>
    <p>
     condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers,
    </p>
    <p>
     and back I had to go to my room.  For several hours I lay
    </p>
    <p>
     there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than I have ever
    </p>
    <p>
     done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
     At last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze;
    </p>
    <p>
     and slowly waking from it--half steeped in dreams--I opened my eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the before sunlit room was now wrapped in outer darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instantly I felt a shock running through all my frame;
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard;
    </p>
    <p>
     but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.  My arm hung
    </p>
    <p>
     over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form
    </p>
    <p>
     or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely
    </p>
    <p>
     seated by my bed-side. For what seemed ages piled on ages,
    </p>
    <p>
     I lay there, frozen with the most awful fears, not daring
    </p>
    <p>
     to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that if I could but
    </p>
    <p>
     stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be broken.
    </p>
    <p>
     I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me;
    </p>
    <p>
     but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all,
    </p>
    <p>
     and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself
    </p>
    <p>
     in confounding attempts to explain the mystery.  Nay, to this
    </p>
    <p>
     very hour, I often puzzle myself with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at
    </p>
    <p>
     feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar,
    </p>
    <p>
     in their strangeness, to those which I experienced on waking
    </p>
    <p>
     up and seeing Queequeg's pagan arm thrown round me.
    </p>
    <p>
     But at length all the past night's events soberly recurred,
    </p>
    <p>
     one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to
    </p>
    <p>
     the comical predicament.  For though I tried to move his arm--
    </p>
    <p>
     unlock his bridegroom clasp--yet, sleeping as he was, he still
    </p>
    <p>
     hugged me tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain.
    </p>
    <p>
     I now strove to rouse him--"Queequeg!"--but his only answer
    </p>
    <p>
     was a snore.  I then rolled over, my neck feeling as if it
    </p>
    <p>
     were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a slight scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping
    </p>
    <p>
     by the savage's side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby.
    </p>
    <p>
     A pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange
    </p>
    <p>
     house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Queequeg!--in the name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!"  At length,
    </p>
    <p>
     by dint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant expostulations
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that
    </p>
    <p>
     matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in extracting a grunt;
    </p>
    <p>
     and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all over
    </p>
    <p>
     like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed,
    </p>
    <p>
     stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes
    </p>
    <p>
     as if he did not altogether remember how I came to be there,
    </p>
    <p>
     though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     slowly dawning over him.  Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him,
    </p>
    <p>
     having no serious misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly observing
    </p>
    <p>
     so curious a creature.  When, at last, his mind seemed made
    </p>
    <p>
     up touching the character of his bedfellow, and he became,
    </p>
    <p>
     as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon the floor,
    </p>
    <p>
     and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that,
    </p>
    <p>
     if it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me
    </p>
    <p>
     to dress afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances, this is a very
    </p>
    <p>
     civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages have an
    </p>
    <p>
     innate sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous
    </p>
    <p>
     how essentially polite they are.  I pay this particular
    </p>
    <p>
     compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much
    </p>
    <p>
     civility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;
    </p>
    <p>
     staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions;
    </p>
    <p>
     for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nevertheless, a man like Queequeg you don't see every day,
    </p>
    <p>
     he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding.
    </p>
    <p>
     He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat,
    </p>
    <p>
     a very tall one, by the by, and then--still minus his trowsers--
    </p>
    <p>
     he hunted up his boots.  What under the heavens he did it for,
    </p>
    <p>
     I cannot tell, but his next movement was to crush himself--
    </p>
    <p>
     boots in hand, and hat on--under the bed; when, from sundry
    </p>
    <p>
     violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he was hard at work
    </p>
    <p>
     booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I ever heard of,
    </p>
    <p>
     is any man required to be private when putting on his boots.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition state--
    </p>
    <p>
     neither caterpillar nor butterfly.  He was just enough civilized
    </p>
    <p>
     to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manner.
    </p>
    <p>
     His education was not yet completed.  He was an undergraduate.
    </p>
    <p>
     If he had not been a small degree civilized, he very probably
    </p>
    <p>
     would not have troubled himself with boots at all; but then,
    </p>
    <p>
     if he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt
    </p>
    <p>
     of getting under the bed to put them on.  At last, he emerged
    </p>
    <p>
     with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
     and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not being
    </p>
    <p>
     much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones--
    </p>
    <p>
     probably not made to order either--rather pinched and tormented
    </p>
    <p>
     him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that
    </p>
    <p>
     the street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view
    </p>
    <p>
     into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on;
    </p>
    <p>
     I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat,
    </p>
    <p>
     and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     He complied, and then proceeded to wash himself.  At that time in
    </p>
    <p>
     the morning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg,
    </p>
    <p>
     to my amazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions
    </p>
    <p>
     to his chest, arms, and hands.  He then donned his waistcoat,
    </p>
    <p>
     and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table,
    </p>
    <p>
     dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face.
    </p>
    <p>
     I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold,
    </p>
    <p>
     he takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long
    </p>
    <p>
     wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot,
    </p>
    <p>
     and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall,
    </p>
    <p>
     begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers's best cutlery with a vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came to know
    </p>
    <p>
     of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly
    </p>
    <p>
     sharp the long straight edges are always kept.
    </p>
    <p>
     The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched
    </p>
    <p>
     out of the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket,
    </p>
    <p>
     and sporting his harpoon like a marshal's baton.

    <p>
     Breakfast
    </p>
    <p>
     I quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted
    </p>
    <p>
     the grinning landlord very pleasantly.  I cherished no malice
    </p>
    <p>
     towards him, though he had been skylarking with me not a little
    </p>
    <p>
     in the matter of my bedfellow.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too
    </p>
    <p>
     scarce a good thing; the more's the pity.  So, if any one man,
    </p>
    <p>
     in his own proper person, afford stuff for a good joke
    </p>
    <p>
     to anybody, let him not be backward, but let him cheerfully
    </p>
    <p>
     allow himself to spend and to be spent in that way.
    </p>
    <p>
     And the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him,
    </p>
    <p>
     be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for.
    </p>
    <p>
     The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping
    </p>
    <p>
     in the night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates,
    </p>
    <p>
     and third mates, and sea carpenters, and sea coopers,
    </p>
    <p>
     and sea blacksmiths, and harpooneers, and ship keepers;
    </p>
    <p>
     a brown and brawny company, with bosky beards; an unshorn,
    </p>
    <p>
     shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns.
    </p>
    <p>
     You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
     This young fellow's healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted
    </p>
    <p>
     pear in hue, and would seem to smell almost as musky;
    </p>
    <p>
     he cannot have been three days landed from his Indian voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
     That man next him looks a few shades lighter; you might say
    </p>
    <p>
     a touch of satin wood is in him.  In the complexion of a third
    </p>
    <p>
     still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly bleached withal;
    </p>
    <p>
     he doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore.  But who could
    </p>
    <p>
     show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various tints,
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed like the Andes' western slope, to show forth in one array,
    </p>
    <p>
     contrasting climates, zone by zone.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Grub, ho!" now cried the landlord, flinging open a door,
    </p>
    <p>
     and in we went to breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
     They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become
    </p>
    <p>
     quite at ease in manner, quite self-possessed in company.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not always, though:  Ledyard, the great New England traveller,
    </p>
    <p>
     and Mungo Park, the Scotch one; of all men, they possessed
    </p>
    <p>
     the least assurance in the parlor.  But perhaps the mere
    </p>
    <p>
     crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did,
    </p>
    <p>
     or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in the negro
    </p>
    <p>
     heart of Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo's performances--
    </p>
    <p>
     this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best mode
    </p>
    <p>
     of attaining a high social polish.  Still, for the most part,
    </p>
    <p>
     that sort of thing is to be had anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
     These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance
    </p>
    <p>
     that after we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing
    </p>
    <p>
     to hear some good stories about whaling; to my no small
    </p>
    <p>
     surprise nearly every man maintained a profound silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     And not only that, but they looked embarrassed.  Yes, here were
    </p>
    <p>
     a set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the slightest bashfulness
    </p>
    <p>
     had boarded great whales on the high seas--entire strangers to them--
    </p>
    <p>
     and duelled them dead without winking; and yet, here they
    </p>
    <p>
     sat at a social breakfast table--all of the same calling,
    </p>
    <p>
     all of kindred tastes--looking round as sheepishly at each other
    </p>
    <p>
     as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold
    </p>
    <p>
     among the Green Mountains.  A curious sight; these bashful bears,
    </p>
    <p>
     these timid warrior whalemen!
    </p>
    <p>
     But as for Queequeg--why, Queequeg sat there among them--
    </p>
    <p>
     at the head of the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle.
    </p>
    <p>
     To be sure I cannot say much for his breeding.  His greatest
    </p>
    <p>
     admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon
    </p>
    <p>
     into breakfast with him, and using it there without ceremony;
    </p>
    <p>
     reaching over the table with it, to the imminent jeopardy
    </p>
    <p>
     of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
     But that was certainly very coolly done by him, and every one
    </p>
    <p>
     knows that in most people's estimation, to do anything coolly
    </p>
    <p>
     is to do it genteelly.
    </p>
    <p>
     We will not speak of all Queequeg's peculiarities here;
    </p>
    <p>
     how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided
    </p>
    <p>
     attention to beefsteaks, done rare.  Enough, that when breakfast
    </p>
    <p>
     was over he withdrew like the rest into the public room,
    </p>
    <p>
     lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was sitting there quietly
    </p>
    <p>
     digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on, when I
    </p>
    <p>
     sallied out for a stroll.

     The Street
    </p>
    <p>
     If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish
    </p>
    <p>
     an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society
    </p>
    <p>
     of a civilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking
    </p>
    <p>
     my first daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford.
    </p>
    <p>
     In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will frequently
    </p>
    <p>
     offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners will
    </p>
    <p>
     sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies.  Regent Street is not unknown
    </p>
    <p>
     to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live Yankees
    </p>
    <p>
     have often scared the natives.  But New Bedford beats all Water Street
    </p>
    <p>
     and Wapping.  In these last-mentioned haunts you see only sailors;
    </p>
    <p>
     but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners;
    </p>
    <p>
     savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
     It makes a stranger stare.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians,
    </p>
    <p>
     and Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft
    </p>
    <p>
     which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still
    </p>
    <p>
     more curious, certainly more comical.  There weekly arrive in this town
    </p>
    <p>
     scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain
    </p>
    <p>
     and glory in the fishery.  They are mostly young, of stalwart frames;
    </p>
    <p>
     fellows who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and snatch
    </p>
    <p>
     the whale-lance. Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence
    </p>
    <p>
     they came.  In some things you would think them but a few hours old.
    </p>
    <p>
     Look there! that chap strutting round the corner.  He wears a beaver hat
    </p>
    <p>
     and swallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and a sheath-knife.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here comes another with a sou'-wester and a bombazine cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
     No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one--I mean
    </p>
    <p>
     a downright bumpkin dandy--a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow
    </p>
    <p>
     his two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now when a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make
    </p>
    <p>
     a distinguished reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you
    </p>
    <p>
     should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport.
    </p>
    <p>
     In bespeaking his sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats;
    </p>
    <p>
     straps to his canvas trowsers.  Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly
    </p>
    <p>
     will burst those straps in the first howling gale, when thou
    </p>
    <p>
     art driven, straps, buttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest.
    </p>
    <p>
     But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers,
    </p>
    <p>
     cannibals, and bumpkins to show her visitors.  Not at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still New Bedford is a queer place.  Had it not been for us whalemen,
    </p>
    <p>
     that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in as howling
    </p>
    <p>
     condition as the coast of Labrador.  As it is, parts of her
    </p>
    <p>
     back country are enough to frighten one, they look so bony.
    </p>
    <p>
     The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in,
    </p>
    <p>
     in all New England.  It is a land of oil, true enough:
    </p>
    <p>
     but not like Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine.
    </p>
    <p>
     The streets do not run with milk; nor in the spring-time
    </p>
    <p>
     do they pave them with fresh eggs.  Yet, in spite of this,
    </p>
    <p>
     nowhere in all America will you find more patrician-like houses;
    </p>
    <p>
     parks and gardens more opulent, than in New Bedford.  Whence came
    </p>
    <p>
     they? how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country?
    </p>
    <p>
     Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty
    </p>
    <p>
     mansion, and your question will be answered.  Yes; all these brave houses
    </p>
    <p>
     and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans.
    </p>
    <p>
     One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom
    </p>
    <p>
     of the sea.  Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that?
    </p>
    <p>
     In New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their
    </p>
    <p>
     daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece.
    </p>
    <p>
     You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say,
    </p>
    <p>
     they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly
    </p>
    <p>
     burn their lengths in spermaceti candles.
    </p>
    <p>
     In summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples--
    </p>
    <p>
     long avenues of green and gold.  And in August, high in air,
    </p>
    <p>
     the beautiful and bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer
    </p>
    <p>
     the passer-by their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms.
    </p>
    <p>
     So omnipotent is art; which in many a district of New Bedford has
    </p>
    <p>
     superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse
    </p>
    <p>
     rocks thrown aside at creation's final day.
    </p>
    <p>
     And the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses.
    </p>
    <p>
     But roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation
    </p>
    <p>
     of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
     Elsewhere match that bloom of theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem,
    </p>
    <p>
     where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk, their sailor
    </p>
    <p>
     sweethearts smell them miles off shore, as though they were drawing
    </p>
    <p>
     nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the Puritanic sands.

    <p>
     The Chapel
    </p>
    <p>
     In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman's Chapel,
    </p>
    <p>
     and few are the moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean
    </p>
    <p>
     or Pacific, who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
     I am sure that I did not.
    </p>
    <p>
     Returning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out
    </p>
    <p>
     upon this special errand.  The sky had changed from clear,
    </p>
    <p>
     sunny cold, to driving sleet and mist.  Wrapping myself in my
    </p>
    <p>
     shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin, I fought my way
    </p>
    <p>
     against the stubborn storm.  Entering, I found a small scattered
    </p>
    <p>
     congregation of sailors, and sailors' wives and widows.  A muffled
    </p>
    <p>
     silence reigned, only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
     Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other,
    </p>
    <p>
     as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable.
    </p>
    <p>
     The chaplain had not yet arrived; and there these silent islands
    </p>
    <p>
     of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets,
    </p>
    <p>
     with black borders, masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Three of them ran something like the following, but I do not
    </p>
    <p>
     pretend to quote:

     August 3d, 1833.

     THIS TABLET
    </p>
    <p>
     Is erected to his Memory
    </p>
    <p>
     BY
    </p>
    <p>
     HIS WIDOW.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated
    </p>
    <p>
     myself near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg near me.  Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was
    </p>
    <p>
     a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
     This savage was the only person present who seemed to notice
    </p>
    <p>
     my entrance; because he was the only one who could not read,
    </p>
    <p>
     and, therefore, was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names
    </p>
    <p>
     appeared there were now among the congregation, I knew not;
    </p>
    <p>
     but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery,
    </p>
    <p>
     and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance
    </p>
    <p>
     if not the trappings of some unceasing grief, that I feel sure
    </p>
    <p>
     that here before me were assembled those, in whose unhealing
    </p>
    <p>
     hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused
    </p>
    <p>
     the old wounds to bleed afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass;
    </p>
    <p>
     who standing among flowers can say--here, here lies my beloved;
    </p>
    <p>
     ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these.
    </p>
    <p>
     What bitter blanks in those black-bordered marbles which cover
    </p>
    <p>
     no ashes!  What despair in those immovable inscriptions!
    </p>
    <p>
     What deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines
    </p>
    <p>
     that seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and refuse resurrections
    </p>
    <p>
     to the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave.
    </p>
    <p>
     As well might those tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as here.
    </p>
    <p>
     In what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included;
    </p>
    <p>
     why it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no tales,
    </p>
    <p>
     though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands! how it is
    </p>
    <p>
     that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world, we prefix
    </p>
    <p>
     so significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle him,
    </p>
    <p>
     if he but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth;
    </p>
    <p>
     why the Life Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon immortals;
    </p>
    <p>
     in what eternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly, hopeless trance,
    </p>
    <p>
     yet lies antique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago;
    </p>
    <p>
     how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we
    </p>
    <p>
     nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss;
    </p>
    <p>
     why all the living so strive to hush all the dead; wherefore but
    </p>
    <p>
     the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city.
    </p>
    <p>
     All these things are not without their meanings.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from
    </p>
    <p>
     these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.
    </p>
    <p>
     It needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve
    </p>
    <p>
     of a Nantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets,
    </p>
    <p>
     and by the murky light of that darkened, doleful day read
    </p>
    <p>
     the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me.  Yes, Ishmael,
    </p>
    <p>
     the same fate may be thine.  But somehow I grew merry again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Delightful inducements to embark, fine chance for promotion,
    </p>
    <p>
     it seems--aye, a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, there is death in this business of whaling--a speechlessly
    </p>
    <p>
     quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity.  But what then?
    </p>
    <p>
     Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life
    </p>
    <p>
     and Death.  Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth
    </p>
    <p>
     is my true substance.  Methinks that in looking at things spiritual,
    </p>
    <p>
     we are too much like oysters observing the sun through
    </p>
    <p>
     the water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air.
    </p>
    <p>
     Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being.
    </p>
    <p>
     In fact take my body who will, take it I say, it is not me.
    </p>
    <p>
     And therefore three cheers for Nantucket; and come a stove
    </p>
    <p>
     boat and stove body when they will, for stave my soul,
    </p>
    <p>
     Jove himself cannot.

     CHAPTER 8
    </head>
    <p>
     The Pulpit
    </p>
    <p>
     I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable
    </p>
    <p>
     robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew
    </p>
    <p>
     back upon admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all
    </p>
    <p>
     the congregation, sufficiently attested that this fine old
    </p>
    <p>
     man was the chaplain.  Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple,
    </p>
    <p>
     so called by the whalemen, among whom he was a very great favorite.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for
    </p>
    <p>
     many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy winter
    </p>
    <p>
     of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging into
    </p>
    <p>
     a second flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his wrinkles,
    </p>
    <p>
     there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom--
    </p>
    <p>
     the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath February's snow.
    </p>
    <p>
     No one having previously heard his history, could for the first time
    </p>
    <p>
     behold Father Mapple without the utmost interest, because there
    </p>
    <p>
     were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him,
    </p>
    <p>
     imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led.
    </p>
    <p>
     When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella,
    </p>
    <p>
     and certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin
    </p>
    <p>
     hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth
    </p>
    <p>
     jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight
    </p>
    <p>
     of the water it had absorbed.  However, hat and coat and
    </p>
    <p>
     overshoes were one by one removed, and hung up in a little
    </p>
    <p>
     space in an adjacent corner; when, arrayed in a decent suit,
    </p>
    <p>
     he quietly approached the pulpit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since
    </p>
    <p>
     a regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with
    </p>
    <p>
     the floor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel,
    </p>
    <p>
     the architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple,
    </p>
    <p>
     and finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular
    </p>
    <p>
     side ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome
    </p>
    <p>
     pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself
    </p>
    <p>
     nicely headed, and stained with a mahogany color, the whole contrivance,
    </p>
    <p>
     considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means
    </p>
    <p>
     in bad taste.  Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder,
    </p>
    <p>
     and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man-ropes,
    </p>
    <p>
     Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly sailor-like
    </p>
    <p>
     but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the steps
    </p>
    <p>
     as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
     The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case
    </p>
    <p>
     with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds
    </p>
    <p>
     were of wood, so that at every step there was a joint.  At my first
    </p>
    <p>
     glimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient
    </p>
    <p>
     for a ship, these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p>
     For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height,
    </p>
    <p>
     slowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag
    </p>
    <p>
     up the ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited within,
    </p>
    <p>
     leaving him impregnable in his little Quebec.
    </p>
    <p>
     I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.
    </p>
    <p>
     Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity,
    </p>
    <p>
     that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere
    </p>
    <p>
     tricks of the stage.  No, thought I, there must be some sober reason
    </p>
    <p>
     for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation,
    </p>
    <p>
     he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward
    </p>
    <p>
     worldly ties and connexions?  Yes, for replenished with the meat
    </p>
    <p>
     and wine of the word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit,
    </p>
    <p>
     I see, is a self-containing stronghold--a lofty Ehrenbreitstein,
    </p>
    <p>
     with a perennial well of water within the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,
    </p>
    <p>
     borrowed from the chaplain's former sea-farings. Between the marble
    </p>
    <p>
     cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back was
    </p>
    <p>
     adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against
    </p>
    <p>
     a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers.
    </p>
    <p>
     But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there floated
    </p>
    <p>
     a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel's face;
    </p>
    <p>
     and this bright face shed a distant spot of radiance upon the ship's
    </p>
    <p>
     tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into
    </p>
    <p>
     the Victory's plank where Nelson fell.  "Ah, noble ship," the angel
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to say, "beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy helm;
    </p>
    <p>
     for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds are rolling off--
    </p>
    <p>
     serenest azure is at hand."
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same
    </p>
    <p>
     sea-taste that had achieved the ladder and the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
     Its panelled front was in the likeness of a ship's bluff bows,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the Holy Bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll work,
    </p>
    <p>
     fashioned after a ship's fiddle-headed beak.
    </p>
    <p>
     What could be more full of meaning?--for the pulpit is ever this
    </p>
    <p>
     earth's foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit
    </p>
    <p>
     leads the world.  From thence it is the storm of God's quick wrath
    </p>
    <p>
     is first descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt.
    </p>
    <p>
     From thence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked
    </p>
    <p>
     for favorable winds.  Yes, the world's a ship on its passage out,
    </p>
    <p>
     and not a voyage complete; and the pulpit is its prow.

     CHAPTER 9
    </head>
    <p>
     The Sermon
    </p>
    <p>
     Father Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority
    </p>
    <p>
     ordered the scattered people to condense.  "Star board gangway,
    </p>
    <p>
     there! side away to larboard--larboard gangway to starboard!
    </p>
    <p>
     Midships! midships!"
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a still slighter shuffling of women's shoes, and all was quiet again,
    </p>
    <p>
     and every eye on the preacher.
    </p>
    <p>
     He paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit's bows, folded his
    </p>
    <p>
     large brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
     and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling
    </p>
    <p>
     and praying at the bottom of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     This ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual
    </p>
    <p>
     tolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog--
    </p>
    <p>
     in such tones he commenced reading the following hymn;
    </p>
    <p>
     but changing his manner towards the concluding stanzas,
    </p>
    <p>
     burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy--
    </p>
    <p>
     The ribs and terrors in the whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     Arched over me a dismal gloom,
    </p>
    <p>
     While all God's sun-lit waves rolled by,
    </p>
    <p>
     And lift me deepening down to doom.
    </p>
    <p>
     I saw the opening maw of hell,
    </p>
    <p>
     With endless pains and sorrows there;
    </p>
    <p>
     Which none but they that feel can tell--
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, I was plunging to despair.
    </p>
    <p>
     In black distress, I called my God,
    </p>
    <p>
     When I could scarce believe him mine,
    </p>
    <p>
     He bowed his ear to my complaints--
    </p>
    <p>
     No more the whale did me confine.
    </p>
    <p>
     With speed he flew to my relief,
    </p>
    <p>
     As on a radiant dolphin borne;
    </p>
    <p>
     Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone
    </p>
    <p>
     The face of my Deliverer God.
    </p>
    <p>
     My song for ever shall record
    </p>
    <p>
     That terrible, that joyful hour;
    </p>
    <p>
     I give the glory to my God,
    </p>
    <p>
     His all the mercy and the power.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high
    </p>
    <p>
     above the howling of the storm.  A brief pause ensued;
    </p>
    <p>
     the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the Bible,
    </p>
    <p>
     and at last, folding his hand down upon the proper page, said:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Beloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the first chapter
    </p>
    <p>
     of Jonah--'And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.'"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters--
    </p>
    <p>
     four yarns--is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Scriptures.  Yet what depths of the soul does Jonah's deep
    </p>
    <p>
     sealine sound! what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet!
    </p>
    <p>
     What a noble thing is that canticle in the fish's belly!
    </p>
    <p>
     How billow-like and boisterously grand!  We feel the floods surging
    </p>
    <p>
     over us, we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters;
    </p>
    <p>
     sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us!  But what is
    </p>
    <p>
     this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches?  Shipmates, it is
    </p>
    <p>
     a two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God.  As sinful men,
    </p>
    <p>
     it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the sin,
    </p>
    <p>
     hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift punishment,
    </p>
    <p>
     repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy
    </p>
    <p>
     of Jonah.  As with all sinners among men, the sin of this son
    </p>
    <p>
     of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of God--
    </p>
    <p>
     never mind now what that command was, or how conveyed--
    </p>
    <p>
     which he found a hard command.  But all the things that God
    </p>
    <p>
     would have us do are hard for us to do--remember that--
    </p>
    <p>
     and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade.
    </p>
    <p>
     And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this
    </p>
    <p>
     disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God consists.
    </p>
    <p>
     "With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further
    </p>
    <p>
     flouts at God, by seeking to flee from Him.  He thinks
    </p>
    <p>
     that a ship made by men, will carry him into countries
    </p>
    <p>
     where God does not reign but only the Captains of this earth.
    </p>
    <p>
     He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks a ship that's
    </p>
    <p>
     bound for Tarshish.  There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded
    </p>
    <p>
     meaning here.  By all accounts Tarshish could have been no other
    </p>
    <p>
     city than the modern Cadiz.  That's the opinion of learned men.
    </p>
    <p>
     And where is Cadiz, shipmates?  Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water,
    </p>
    <p>
     from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those
    </p>
    <p>
     ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most
    </p>
    <p>
     easterly coast of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish
    </p>
    <p>
     or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from that,
    </p>
    <p>
     just outside the Straits of Gibraltar.  See ye not then, shipmates,
    </p>
    <p>
     that Jonah sought to flee worldwide from God?  Miserable man!
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with slouched
    </p>
    <p>
     hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling among
    </p>
    <p>
     the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas.
    </p>
    <p>
     So disordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there
    </p>
    <p>
     been policemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion
    </p>
    <p>
     of something wrong, had been arrested ere he touched a deck.
    </p>
    <p>
     How plainly he's a fugitive! no baggage, not a hat-box, valise,
    </p>
    <p>
     or carpet-bag,--no friends accompany him to the wharf with
    </p>
    <p>
     their adieux.  At last, after much dodging search, he finds
    </p>
    <p>
     the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo;
    </p>
    <p>
     and as he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin,
    </p>
    <p>
     all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods,
    </p>
    <p>
     to mark the stranger's evil eye.  Jonah sees this; but in vain
    </p>
    <p>
     he tries to look all ease and confidence; in vain essays his
    </p>
    <p>
     wretched smile.  Strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners
    </p>
    <p>
     he can be no innocent.  In their gamesome but still serious way,
    </p>
    <p>
     one whispers to the other--"Jack, he's robbed a widow;"
    </p>
    <p>
     or, "Joe, do you mark him; he's a bigamist;" or, "Harry lad,
    </p>
    <p>
     I guess he's the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah,
    </p>
    <p>
     or belike, one of the missing murderers from Sodom."  Another runs
    </p>
    <p>
     to read the bill that's stuck against the spile upon the wharf
    </p>
    <p>
     to which the ship is moored, offering five hundred gold coins
    </p>
    <p>
     for the apprehension of a parricide, and containing a description
    </p>
    <p>
     of his person.  He reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill;
    </p>
    <p>
     while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah,
    </p>
    <p>
     prepared to lay their hands upon him.  Frighted Jonah trembles.
    </p>
    <p>
     and summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so much
    </p>
    <p>
     the more a coward.  He will not confess himself suspected;
    </p>
    <p>
     but that itself is strong suspicion.  So he makes the best of it;
    </p>
    <p>
     and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised,
    </p>
    <p>
     they let him pass, and he descends into the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Who's there?' cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making
    </p>
    <p>
     out his papers for the Customs--'Who's there?'  Oh! how that harmless
    </p>
    <p>
     question mangles Jonah!  For the instant he almost turns to flee again.
    </p>
    <p>
     But he rallies.  'I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish;
    </p>
    <p>
     how soon sail ye, sir?'  Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up
    </p>
    <p>
     to Jonah, though the man now stands before him; but no sooner does
    </p>
    <p>
     he hear that hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance.
    </p>
    <p>
     'We sail with the next coming tide,' at last he slowly answered,
    </p>
    <p>
     still intently eyeing him.  'No sooner, sir?'--'Soon enough for any
    </p>
    <p>
     honest man that goes a passenger.'  Ha!  Jonah, that's another stab.
    </p>
    <p>
     But he swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent.
    </p>
    <p>
     'I'll sail with ye,'--he says,--'the passage money how much is that?--
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll pay now.'  For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it
    </p>
    <p>
     were a thing not to be overlooked in this history, 'that he paid
    </p>
    <p>
     the fare thereof' ere the craft did sail.  And taken with the context,
    </p>
    <p>
     this is full of meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now Jonah's Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects
    </p>
    <p>
     crime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless.
    </p>
    <p>
     In this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel
    </p>
    <p>
     freely and without a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper,
    </p>
    <p>
     is stopped at all frontiers.  So Jonah's Captain prepares
    </p>
    <p>
     to test the length of Jonah's purse, ere he judge him openly.
    </p>
    <p>
     He charges him thrice the usual sum; and it's assented to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive; but at the same
    </p>
    <p>
     time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions still
    </p>
    <p>
     molest the Captain.  He rings every coin to find a counterfeit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is put down for his passage.
    </p>
    <p>
     'Point out my state-room, Sir,' says Jonah now, 'I'm travel-weary;
    </p>
    <p>
     I need sleep."  "Thou look'st like it,' says the Captain,
    </p>
    <p>
     'there's thy room.'  Jonah enters, and would lock the door,
    </p>
    <p>
     but the lock contains no key.  Hearing him foolishly fumbling there,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about
    </p>
    <p>
     the doors of convicts' cells being never allowed to be locked within.
    </p>
    <p>
     All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth,
    </p>
    <p>
     and finds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
     The air is close, and Jonah gasps.  Then, in that contracted hole,
    </p>
    <p>
     sunk, too, beneath the ship's water-line, Jonah feels the heralding
    </p>
    <p>
     presentiment of that stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him
    </p>
    <p>
     in the smallest of his bowels' wards.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly
    </p>
    <p>
     oscillates in Jonah's room; and the ship, heeling over towards the wharf
    </p>
    <p>
     with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and all,
    </p>
    <p>
     though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity with
    </p>
    <p>
     reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight itself,
    </p>
    <p>
     it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it hung.
    </p>
    <p>
     The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth
    </p>
    <p>
     his tormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far
    </p>
    <p>
     successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance.
    </p>
    <p>
     But that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him.
    </p>
    <p>
     The floor, the ceiling, and the side, are all awry.
    </p>
    <p>
     'Oh! so my conscience hangs in me!' he groans, "straight upward,
    </p>
    <p>
     so it burns; but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness!'
    </p>
    <p>
     "Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed,
    </p>
    <p>
     still reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags
    </p>
    <p>
     into him; as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns
    </p>
    <p>
     in giddy anguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed;
    </p>
    <p>
     and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him,
    </p>
    <p>
     as over the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound,
    </p>
    <p>
     and there's naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestling in his berth,
    </p>
    <p>
     Jonah's prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables;
    </p>
    <p>
     and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish,
    </p>
    <p>
     all careening, glides to sea.  That ship, my friends,
    </p>
    <p>
     was the first of recorded smugglers! the contraband
    </p>
    <p>
     was Jonah.  But the sea rebels; he will not bear the wicked burden.
    </p>
    <p>
     A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to break.
    </p>
    <p>
     But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her;
    </p>
    <p>
     when boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard;
    </p>
    <p>
     when the wind is shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every
    </p>
    <p>
     plank thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah's head;
    </p>
    <p>
     in all this raging tumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     He sees no black sky and raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers,
    </p>
    <p>
     and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship--
    </p>
    <p>
     a berth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in his dead ear,
    </p>
    <p>
     'What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!'  Startled from his lethargy
    </p>
    <p>
     by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and stumbling
    </p>
    <p>
     to the deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     But at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping
    </p>
    <p>
     over the bulwarks.  Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship,
    </p>
    <p>
     and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft,
    </p>
    <p>
     till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat.
    </p>
    <p>
     And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face from
    </p>
    <p>
     the steep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah
    </p>
    <p>
     sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat
    </p>
    <p>
     downward again towards the tormented deep.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul.  In all his
    </p>
    <p>
     cringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions
    </p>
    <p>
     of him, and at last, fully to test the truth, by referring
    </p>
    <p>
     the whole matter to high Heaven, they all-outward to casting lots,
    </p>
    <p>
     to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
     The lot is Jonah's; that discovered, then how furiously they
    </p>
    <p>
     mob him with their questions.  'What is thine occupation?
    </p>
    <p>
     Whence comest thou?  Thy country?  What people?  But mark now,
    </p>
    <p>
     my shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah.  The eager mariners
    </p>
    <p>
     but ask him who he is, and where from; whereas, they not only
    </p>
    <p>
     receive an answer to those questions, but likewise another answer
    </p>
    <p>
     to a question not put by them, but the unsolicited answer is
    </p>
    <p>
     forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'I am a Hebrew,' he cries--and then--'I fear the Lord
    </p>
    <p>
     the God of Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land!'
    </p>
    <p>
     Fear him, O Jonah?  Aye, well mightest thou fear the Lord God then!
    </p>
    <p>
     Straightway, he now goes on to make a full confession;
    </p>
    <p>
     whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled, but still
    </p>
    <p>
     are pitiful.  For when Jonah, not yet supplicating God for mercy,
    </p>
    <p>
     since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts,--
    </p>
    <p>
     when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast
    </p>
    <p>
     him forth into the sea, for he knew that for his sake this
    </p>
    <p>
     great tempest was upon them; they mercifully turn from him,
    </p>
    <p>
     and seek by other means to save the ship.  But all in vain;
    </p>
    <p>
     the indignant gale howls louder; then, with one hand raised
    </p>
    <p>
     invokingly to God, with the other they not unreluctantly lay
    </p>
    <p>
     hold of Jonah.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea;
    </p>
    <p>
     when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the sea is still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him,
    </p>
    <p>
     leaving smooth water behind.  He goes down in the whirling heart of such
    </p>
    <p>
     a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops
    </p>
    <p>
     seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to
    </p>
    <p>
     all his ivory teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fish's belly.
    </p>
    <p>
     But observe his prayer, and so many white bolts, upon his prison.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Jonah prayed unto learn a weighty lesson.  For sinful
    </p>
    <p>
     as he is, Jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance.
    </p>
    <p>
     He feels that his dreadful punishment is just.  He leaves all his
    </p>
    <p>
     deliverance to God, contenting himself with this, that spite of all
    </p>
    <p>
     his pains and pangs, he will still look towards His holy temple.
    </p>
    <p>
     And here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance;
    </p>
    <p>
     not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
     And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown
    </p>
    <p>
     in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shipmates, I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his
    </p>
    <p>
     sin but I do place him before you as a model for repentance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it like Jonah."
    </p>
    <p>
     While he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking,
    </p>
    <p>
     slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who,
    </p>
    <p>
     when describing Jonah's sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     His deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed the warring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled
    </p>
    <p>
     away from off his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye,
    </p>
    <p>
     made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was
    </p>
    <p>
     strange to them.
    </p>
    <p>
     There now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over
    </p>
    <p>
     the leaves of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless,
    </p>
    <p>
     with closed eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     But again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his
    </p>
    <p>
     head lowly, with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility,
    </p>
    <p>
     he spake these words:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands
    </p>
    <p>
     press upon me.  I have read ye by what murky light may be mine
    </p>
    <p>
     the lesson that Jonah teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye,
    </p>
    <p>
     and still more to me, for I am a greater sinner than ye.
    </p>
    <p>
     And now how gladly would I come down from this mast-head and sit
    </p>
    <p>
     on the hatches there where you sit, and listen as you listen,
    </p>
    <p>
     while some one of you reads me that other and more awful lesson
    </p>
    <p>
     which Jonah teaches to me, as a pilot of the living God.  How being
    </p>
    <p>
     an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true things and bidden
    </p>
    <p>
     by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a
    </p>
    <p>
     wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should raise,
    </p>
    <p>
     fled from his mission, and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking
    </p>
    <p>
     ship at Joppa.  But God is everywhere; Tarshish he never reached.
    </p>
    <p>
     As we have seen, God came upon him in the whale, and swallowed
    </p>
    <p>
     him down to living gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore
    </p>
    <p>
     him along 'into the midst of the seas,' where the eddying depths
    </p>
    <p>
     sucked him ten thousand fathoms down, and 'the weeds were wrapped
    </p>
    <p>
     about his head,' and all the watery world of woe bowled over him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet--'out of the belly
    </p>
    <p>
     of hell'--when the whale grounded upon the ocean's utmost bones,
    </p>
    <p>
     even then, God heard the engulphed, repenting prophet when he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then God spake unto the fish; and from the shuddering cold
    </p>
    <p>
     and blackness of the sea, the whale came breeching up towards
    </p>
    <p>
     the warm and pleasant sun, and all the delights of air and earth;
    </p>
    <p>
     and 'vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;' when the word of the Lord
    </p>
    <p>
     came a second time; and Jonah, bruised and beaten--his ears,
    </p>
    <p>
     like two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean--
    </p>
    <p>
     Jonah did the Almighty's bidding.  And what was that, shipmates?
    </p>
    <p>
     To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood!  That was it!
    </p>
    <p>
     "This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that
    </p>
    <p>
     pilot of the living God who slights it.  Woe to him whom this
    </p>
    <p>
     world charms from Gospel duty!  Woe to him who seeks to pour
    </p>
    <p>
     oil upon the waters when God has brewed them into a gale!
    </p>
    <p>
     Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal!
    </p>
    <p>
     Woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness!
    </p>
    <p>
     Woe to him who, in this world, courts not dishonor!
    </p>
    <p>
     Woe to him who would not be true, even though to be false
    </p>
    <p>
     were salvation!  Yea, woe to him who as the great Pilot Paul
    </p>
    <p>
     has it, while preaching to others is himself a castaway!
    </p>
    <p>
     He drooped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting
    </p>
    <p>
     his face to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
     as he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm,--"But oh! shipmates!
    </p>
    <p>
     on the starboard hand of every woe, there is a sure delight;
    </p>
    <p>
     and higher the top of that delight, than the bottom of the woe
    </p>
    <p>
     is deep.  Is not the main-truck higher than the kelson is low?
    </p>
    <p>
     Delight is to him--a far, far upward, and inward delight--
    </p>
    <p>
     who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth,
    </p>
    <p>
     ever stands forth his own inexorable self.  Delight is to him
    </p>
    <p>
     whose strong arms yet support him, when the ship of this base
    </p>
    <p>
     treacherous world has gone down beneath him.  Delight is to him,
    </p>
    <p>
     who gives no quarter in the truth, and kills, burns, and destroys
    </p>
    <p>
     all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of Senators
    </p>
    <p>
     and Judges.  Delight,--top-gallant delight is to him, who acknowledges
    </p>
    <p>
     no law or lord, but the Lord his God, and is only a patriot to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
     Delight is to him, whom all the waves of the billows of the seas
    </p>
    <p>
     of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure Keel
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Ages.  And eternal delight and deliciousness will be his,
    </p>
    <p>
     who coming to lay him down, can say with his final breath--O Father!--
    </p>
    <p>
     chiefly known to me by Thy rod--mortal or immortal, here I die.
    </p>
    <p>
     I have striven to be Thine, more than to be this world's, or mine own.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet this is nothing:  I leave eternity to Thee; for what is man
    </p>
    <p>
     that he should live out the lifetime of his God?"
    </p>
    <p>
     He said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with
    </p>
    <p>
     his hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had departed,
    </p>
    <p>
     and he was left alone in the place.

     CHAPTER 10
    </head>
    <p>
     A Bosom Friend
    </p>
    <p>
     Returning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there
    </p>
    <p>
     quite alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some time.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on
    </p>
    <p>
     the stove hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his
    </p>
    <p>
     face that little negro idol of his; peering hard into its face,
    </p>
    <p>
     and with a jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose,
    </p>
    <p>
     meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way.
    </p>
    <p>
     But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going to
    </p>
    <p>
     the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap began
    </p>
    <p>
     counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth page--
    </p>
    <p>
     as I fancied--stopping for a moment, looking vacantly around him,
    </p>
    <p>
     and giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
     He would then begin again at the next fifty; seeming to commence at
    </p>
    <p>
     number one each time, as though he could not count more than fifty,
    </p>
    <p>
     and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found together,
    </p>
    <p>
     that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited.
    </p>
    <p>
     With much interest I sat watching him.  Savage though he was,
    </p>
    <p>
     and hideously marred about the face--at least to my taste--
    </p>
    <p>
     his countenance yet had a something in it which was by no
    </p>
    <p>
     means disagreeable.  You cannot hide the soul.  Through all his
    </p>
    <p>
     unearthly tattooings, I thought I saw the traces of a simple
    </p>
    <p>
     honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes, fiery black and bold,
    </p>
    <p>
     there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils.
    </p>
    <p>
     And besides all this, there was a certain lofty bearing about
    </p>
    <p>
     the Pagan, which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim.
    </p>
    <p>
     He looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether it was, too, that his head being shaved, his forehead was
    </p>
    <p>
     drawn out in freer and brighter relief, and looked more expansive
    </p>
    <p>
     than it otherwise would, this I will not venture to decide;
    </p>
    <p>
     but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent one.
    </p>
    <p>
     It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me of General Washington's head,
    </p>
    <p>
     as seen in the popular busts of him.  It had the same long regularly
    </p>
    <p>
     graded retreating slope from above the brows, which were likewise
    </p>
    <p>
     very projecting, like two long promontories thickly wooded on top.
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be
    </p>
    <p>
     looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my presence,
    </p>
    <p>
     never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but appeared
    </p>
    <p>
     wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book.
    </p>
    <p>
     Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous,
    </p>
    <p>
     and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found thrown
    </p>
    <p>
     over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this indifference
    </p>
    <p>
     of his very strange.  But savages are strange beings; at times you
    </p>
    <p>
     do not know exactly how to take them.  At first they are overawing;
    </p>
    <p>
     their calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems as Socratic wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
     I had noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very
    </p>
    <p>
     little, with the other seamen in the inn.  He made no advances whatever;
    </p>
    <p>
     appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances.
    </p>
    <p>
     All this struck me as mighty singular; yet, upon second thoughts,
    </p>
    <p>
     there was something almost sublime in it.  Here was a man some
    </p>
    <p>
     twenty thousand miles from home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is--
    </p>
    <p>
     which was the only way he could get there--thrown among people
    </p>
    <p>
     as strange to him as though he were in the planet Jupiter; and yet
    </p>
    <p>
     he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the utmost serenity;
    </p>
    <p>
     content with his own companionship; always equal to himself.  Surely this
    </p>
    <p>
     was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt he had never heard
    </p>
    <p>
     there was such a thing as that.  But, perhaps, to be true philosophers,
    </p>
    <p>
     we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving.
    </p>
    <p>
     So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives himself out for
    </p>
    <p>
     a philosopher, I conclude that, like the dyspeptic old woman,
    </p>
    <p>
     he must have "broken his digester."
    </p>
    <p>
     As I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low,
    </p>
    <p>
     in that mild stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air,
    </p>
    <p>
     it then only glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms
    </p>
    <p>
     gathering round the casements, and peering in upon us silent,
    </p>
    <p>
     solitary twain; the storm booming without in solemn swells;
    </p>
    <p>
     I began to be sensible of strange feelings.  I felt a melting in me.
    </p>
    <p>
     No more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against
    </p>
    <p>
     the wolfish world.  This soothing savage had redeemed it.
    </p>
    <p>
     There he sat, his very indifference speaking a nature in which
    </p>
    <p>
     there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wild he was; a very sight of sights to see; yet I began to feel
    </p>
    <p>
     myself mysteriously drawn towards him.  And those same things
    </p>
    <p>
     that would have repelled most others, they were the very magnets
    </p>
    <p>
     that thus drew me.  I'll try a pagan friend, thought I,
    </p>
    <p>
     since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
     I drew my bench near him, and made some friendly signs
    </p>
    <p>
     and hints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile.
    </p>
    <p>
     At first he little noticed these advances; but presently,
    </p>
    <p>
     upon my referring to his last night's hospitalities,
    </p>
    <p>
     he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows.
    </p>
    <p>
     I told him yes; whereat I thought he looked pleased,
    </p>
    <p>
     perhaps a little complimented.
    </p>
    <p>
     We then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain
    </p>
    <p>
     to him the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few
    </p>
    <p>
     pictures that were in it.  Thus I soon engaged his interest;
    </p>
    <p>
     and from that we went to jabbering the best we could about
    </p>
    <p>
     the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town.
    </p>
    <p>
     Soon I proposed a social smoke; and, producing his pouch
    </p>
    <p>
     and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff.  And then we sat
    </p>
    <p>
     exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it
    </p>
    <p>
     regularly passing between us.
    </p>
    <p>
     If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me
    </p>
    <p>
     in the Pagan's breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had,
    </p>
    <p>
     soon thawed it out, and left us cronies.  He seemed to take
    </p>
    <p>
     to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as I to him;
    </p>
    <p>
     and when our smoke was over, he pressed his forehead against mine,
    </p>
    <p>
     clasped me round the waist, and said that henceforth we
    </p>
    <p>
     were married; meaning, in his country's phrase, that we were
    </p>
    <p>
     bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should be.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a countryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed far too premature, a thing to be much distrusted;
    </p>
    <p>
     but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply.
    </p>
    <p>
     After supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our
    </p>
    <p>
     room together.  He made me a present of his embalmed head;
    </p>
    <p>
     took out his enormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco,
    </p>
    <p>
     drew out some thirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on
    </p>
    <p>
     the table, and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions,
    </p>
    <p>
     pushed one of them towards me, and said it was mine.
    </p>
    <p>
     I was going to remonstrate; but he silenced me by pouring
    </p>
    <p>
     them into my trowsers' pockets.  I let them stay.
    </p>
    <p>
     He then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol,
    </p>
    <p>
     and removed the paper firebrand.  By certain signs and symptoms,
    </p>
    <p>
     I thought he seemed anxious for me to join him; but well
    </p>
    <p>
     knowing what was to follow, I deliberated a moment whether,
    </p>
    <p>
     in case he invited me, I would comply or otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
     I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible
    </p>
    <p>
     Presbyterian Church.  How then could I unite with this wild idolator
    </p>
    <p>
     in worshipping his piece of wood?  But what is worship? thought
    </p>
    <p>
     I. Do you suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven
    </p>
    <p>
     and earth--pagans and all included--can possibly be jealous of an
    </p>
    <p>
     insignificant bit of black wood?  Impossible!  But what is worship?--
    </p>
    <p>
     to do the will of God? that is worship.  And what is the will of God?--
    </p>
    <p>
     to do to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me--
    </p>
    <p>
     that is the will of God.  Now, Queequeg is my fellow man.
    </p>
    <p>
     And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me?  Why, unite with me
    </p>
    <p>
     in my particular Presbyterian form of worship.  Consequently, I must
    </p>
    <p>
     then unite with him in his; ergo, I must turn idolator.
    </p>
    <p>
     So I kindled the shavings; helped prop up the innocent little idol;
    </p>
    <p>
     offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg; salamed before him twice
    </p>
    <p>
     or thrice; kissed his nose; and that done, we undressed and went
    </p>
    <p>
     to bed, at peace with our own consciences and all the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     But we did not go to sleep without some little chat.
    </p>
    <p>
     How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for
    </p>
    <p>
     confidential disclosures between friends.  Man and wife, they say,
    </p>
    <p>
     there open the very bottom of their souls to each other; and some
    </p>
    <p>
     old couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus, then, in our hearts' honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg--
    </p>
    <p>
     a cosy, loving pair.

    <p>
     Nightgown
    </p>
    <p>
     We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals,
    </p>
    <p>
     and Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown
    </p>
    <p>
     tattooed legs over mine, and then drawing them back;
    </p>
    <p>
     so entirely sociable and free and easy were we; when, at last,
    </p>
    <p>
     by reason of our confabulations, what little nappishness remained
    </p>
    <p>
     in us altogether departed, and we felt like getting up again,
    </p>
    <p>
     though day-break was yet some way down the future.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent
    </p>
    <p>
     position began to grow wearisome, and by little and little we
    </p>
    <p>
     found ourselves sitting up; the clothes well tucked around us,
    </p>
    <p>
     leaning against the headboard with our four knees drawn up
    </p>
    <p>
     close together, and our two noses bending over them, as if
    </p>
    <p>
     our knee-pans were warming-pans. We felt very nice and snug,
    </p>
    <p>
     the more so since it was so chilly out of doors; indeed out
    </p>
    <p>
     of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth,
    </p>
    <p>
     some small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality
    </p>
    <p>
     in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nothing exists in itself.  If you flatter yourself that you
    </p>
    <p>
     are all over comfortable, and have been so a long time,
    </p>
    <p>
     then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more.  But if,
    </p>
    <p>
     like Queequeg and me in the bed, the tip of your nose or the crown
    </p>
    <p>
     of your head be slightly chilled, why then, indeed, in the general
    </p>
    <p>
     consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm.
    </p>
    <p>
     For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished
    </p>
    <p>
     with a fire, which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     but the blankets between you and your snugness and the cold
    </p>
    <p>
     of the outer air.  Then there you lie like the one warm spark
    </p>
    <p>
     in the heart of an arctic crystal.
    </p>
    <p>
     We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time,
    </p>
    <p>
     when all at once I thought I would open my eyes; for when
    </p>
    <p>
     between sheets, whether by day or by night, and whether
    </p>
    <p>
     asleep or awake, I have a way of always keeping my eyes shut,
    </p>
    <p>
     in order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except his
    </p>
    <p>
     eyes be closed; as if, darkness were indeed the proper element
    </p>
    <p>
     of our essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey part.
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon opening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant
    </p>
    <p>
     and self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom
    </p>
    <p>
     of the unilluminated twelve-o'clock-at-night, I experienced
    </p>
    <p>
     a disagreeable revulsion.  Nor did I at all object to the hint
    </p>
    <p>
     from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light,
    </p>
    <p>
     seeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he felt a strong
    </p>
    <p>
     desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk.  Be it said,
    </p>
    <p>
     that though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking
    </p>
    <p>
     in the bed the night before, yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices
    </p>
    <p>
     grow when love once comes to bend them.  For now I liked
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed,
    </p>
    <p>
     because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then.
    </p>
    <p>
     I no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord's policy of insurance.
    </p>
    <p>
     I was only alive to the condensed confidential comfortableness
    </p>
    <p>
     of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend.
    </p>
    <p>
     With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed
    </p>
    <p>
     the Tomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew
    </p>
    <p>
     over us a blue hanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame
    </p>
    <p>
     of the new-lit lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage
    </p>
    <p>
     away to far distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke
    </p>
    <p>
     of his native island; and, eager to hear his history,
    </p>
    <p>
     I begged him to go on and tell it.  He gladly complied.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of his words,
    </p>
    <p>
     yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become more familiar
    </p>
    <p>
     with his broken phraseology, now enable me to present the whole
    </p>
    <p>
     story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give.

     CHAPTER 12
    </head>
    <p>
     Biographical
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg was a native of Kokovoko, an island far away to the West
    </p>
    <p>
     and South.  It is not down on any map; true places never are.
    </p>
    <p>
     When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands
    </p>
    <p>
     in a grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were
    </p>
    <p>
     a green sapling; even then, in Queequeg's ambitious soul,
    </p>
    <p>
     lurked a strong desire to see something more of Christendom
    </p>
    <p>
     than a specimen whaler or two.  His father was a High Chief,
    </p>
    <p>
     a King; his uncle a High Priest; and on the maternal side
    </p>
    <p>
     he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was excellent blood in his veins--royal stuff;
    </p>
    <p>
     though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity
    </p>
    <p>
     he nourished in his untutored youth.
    </p>
    <p>
     A Sag Harbor ship visited his father's bay, and Queequeg sought
    </p>
    <p>
     a passage to Christian lands.  But the ship, having her full
    </p>
    <p>
     complement of seamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King
    </p>
    <p>
     his father's influence could prevail.  But Queequeg vowed a vow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alone in his canoe, he paddled off to a distant strait, which he
    </p>
    <p>
     knew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island.
    </p>
    <p>
     On one side was a coral reef; on the other a low tongue of land,
    </p>
    <p>
     covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with its
    </p>
    <p>
     prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand;
    </p>
    <p>
     and when the ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out;
    </p>
    <p>
     gained her side; with one backward dash of his foot capsized
    </p>
    <p>
     and sank his canoe; climbed up the chains; and throwing himself
    </p>
    <p>
     at full length upon the deck, grappled a ring-bolt there,
    </p>
    <p>
     and swore not to let it go, though hacked in pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
     In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a
    </p>
    <p>
     cutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King,
    </p>
    <p>
     and Queequeg budged not.  Struck by his desperate dauntlessness,
    </p>
    <p>
     and his wild desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented,
    </p>
    <p>
     and told him he might make himself at home.  But this fine young savage--
    </p>
    <p>
     this sea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain's cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
     They put him down among the sailors, and made a whaleman of him.
    </p>
    <p>
     But like Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities,
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy, if thereby he might
    </p>
    <p>
     happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen.
    </p>
    <p>
     For at bottom--so he told me--he was actuated by a profound
    </p>
    <p>
     desire to learn among the Christians, the arts whereby to make
    </p>
    <p>
     his people still happier than they were; and more than that,
    </p>
    <p>
     still better than they were.  But, alas! the practices of whalemen
    </p>
    <p>
     soon convinced him that even Christians could be both miserable
    </p>
    <p>
     and wicked; infinitely more so, than all his father's heathens.
    </p>
    <p>
     Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and seeing what the sailors
    </p>
    <p>
     did there; and then going on to Nantucket, and seeing how they spent
    </p>
    <p>
     their wages in that place also, poor Queequeg gave it up for lost.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thought he, it's a wicked world in all meridians; I'll die a pagan.
    </p>
    <p>
     And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these Christians,
    </p>
    <p>
     wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hence the queer ways about him, though now some time from home.
    </p>
    <p>
     By hints I asked him whether he did not propose going back,
    </p>
    <p>
     and having a coronation; since he might now consider his father
    </p>
    <p>
     dead and gone, he being very old and feeble at the last accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
     He answered no, not yet; and added that he was fearful Christianity,
    </p>
    <p>
     or rather Christians, had unfitted him for ascending the pure
    </p>
    <p>
     and undefiled throne of thirty pagan Kings before him.
    </p>
    <p>
     But by and by, he said, he would return,--as soon as he felt
    </p>
    <p>
     himself baptized again.  For the nonce, however, he proposed
    </p>
    <p>
     to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans.
    </p>
    <p>
     They had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was
    </p>
    <p>
     in lieu of a sceptre now.
    </p>
    <p>
     I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his
    </p>
    <p>
     future movements.  He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed
    </p>
    <p>
     him of my intention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most
    </p>
    <p>
     promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from.
    </p>
    <p>
     He at once resolved to accompany me to that island, ship aboard
    </p>
    <p>
     the same vessel, get into the same watch, the same boat,
    </p>
    <p>
     the same mess with me, in short to share my every hap; with both
    </p>
    <p>
     my hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of both worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
     To all this I joyously assented; for besides the affection I now
    </p>
    <p>
     felt for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such,
    </p>
    <p>
     could not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me,
    </p>
    <p>
     was wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though well
    </p>
    <p>
     acquainted with the sea, as known to merchant seamen.
    </p>
    <p>
     His story being ended with his pipe's last dying puff,
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg embraced me, pressed his forehead against mine,
    </p>
    <p>
     and blowing out the light, we rolled over from each other,
    </p>
    <p>
     this way and that, and very soon were sleeping.

    <p>
     Wheelbarrow
    </p>
    <p>
     Next morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head
    </p>
    <p>
     to a barber, for a block, I settled my own and comrade's bill;
    </p>
    <p>
     using, however, my comrade's money.  The grinning landlord,
    </p>
    <p>
     as well as the boarders, seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden
    </p>
    <p>
     friendship which had sprung up between me and Queequeg--
    </p>
    <p>
     especially as Peter Coffin's cock and bull stories about him
    </p>
    <p>
     had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person
    </p>
    <p>
     whom I now companied with.
    </p>
    <p>
     We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own poor
    </p>
    <p>
     carpet-bag, and Queequeg's canvas sack and hammock, away we went down
    </p>
    <p>
     to "the Moss," the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf.
    </p>
    <p>
     As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so much--
    </p>
    <p>
     for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets,--
    </p>
    <p>
     but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms.  But we heeded
    </p>
    <p>
     them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg
    </p>
    <p>
     now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs.
    </p>
    <p>
     I asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore,
    </p>
    <p>
     and whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons.
    </p>
    <p>
     To this, in substance, he replied, that though what I hinted was
    </p>
    <p>
     true enough, yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon,
    </p>
    <p>
     because it was of assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat,
    </p>
    <p>
     and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales.  In short, like many
    </p>
    <p>
     inland reapers and mowers, who go into the farmer's meadows armed
    </p>
    <p>
     with their own scythes--though in no wise obliged to furnish them--
    </p>
    <p>
     even so, Queequeg, for his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny
    </p>
    <p>
     story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was in Sag Harbor.  The owners of his ship, it seems, had lent
    </p>
    <p>
     him one, in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not to seem ignorant about the thing--though in truth he was
    </p>
    <p>
     entirely so, concerning the precise way in which to manage
    </p>
    <p>
     the barrow--Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it fast;
    </p>
    <p>
     and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why," said I, "Queequeg, you might have known better than that,
    </p>
    <p>
     one would think.  Didn't the people laugh?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon this, he told me another story.  The people of his island
    </p>
    <p>
     of Rokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant
    </p>
    <p>
     water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl;
    </p>
    <p>
     and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on
    </p>
    <p>
     the braided mat where the feast is held.  Now a certain grand merchant
    </p>
    <p>
     ship once touched at Rokovoko, and its commander--from all accounts,
    </p>
    <p>
     a very stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain--
    </p>
    <p>
     this commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg's sister,
    </p>
    <p>
     a pretty young princess just turned of ten.  Well; when all
    </p>
    <p>
     the wedding guests were assembled at the bride's bamboo cottage,
    </p>
    <p>
     this Captain marches in, and being assigned the post of honor,
    </p>
    <p>
     placed himself over against the punchbowl, and between
    </p>
    <p>
     the High Priest and his majesty the King, Queequeg's father.
    </p>
    <p>
     Grace being said,--for those people have their grace as well as we--
    </p>
    <p>
     though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such times look
    </p>
    <p>
     downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying the ducks,
    </p>
    <p>
     glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts--Grace, I say,
    </p>
    <p>
     being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony
    </p>
    <p>
     of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated and consecrating
    </p>
    <p>
     fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seeing himself placed next the Priest, and noting the ceremony,
    </p>
    <p>
     and thinking himself--being Captain of a ship--as having plain
    </p>
    <p>
     precedence over a mere island King, especially in the King's own house--
    </p>
    <p>
     the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punch bowl;--
    </p>
    <p>
     taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass. "Now," said Queequeg,
    </p>
    <p>
     "what you tink now?--Didn't our people laugh?"
    </p>
    <p>
     At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the schooner.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river.  On one side,
    </p>
    <p>
     New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees all
    </p>
    <p>
     glittering in the clear, cold air.  Huge hills and mountains of casks
    </p>
    <p>
     on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the world-wandering
    </p>
    <p>
     whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last; while from others came
    </p>
    <p>
     a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises of fires and forges
    </p>
    <p>
     to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises were on the start;
    </p>
    <p>
     that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only begins a second;
    </p>
    <p>
     and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on, for ever and for aye.
    </p>
    <p>
     Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all earthly effort.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little
    </p>
    <p>
     Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his snortings.
    </p>
    <p>
     How I snuffed that Tartar air!--how I spurned that turnpike earth!--
    </p>
    <p>
     that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels
    </p>
    <p>
     and hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will
    </p>
    <p>
     permit no records.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me.
    </p>
    <p>
     His dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
     On, on we flew, and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to the blast;
    </p>
    <p>
     ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan.  Sideways leaning,
    </p>
    <p>
     we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a wire;
    </p>
    <p>
     the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes.
    </p>
    <p>
     So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the
    </p>
    <p>
     plunging bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering
    </p>
    <p>
     glances of the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled
    </p>
    <p>
     that two fellow beings should be so companionable; as though
    </p>
    <p>
     a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro.
    </p>
    <p>
     But there were some boobies and bumpkins there, who, by their intense
    </p>
    <p>
     greenness, must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind
    </p>
    <p>
     his back.  I thought the bumpkin's hour of doom was come.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dropping his harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms,
    </p>
    <p>
     and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up
    </p>
    <p>
     bodily into the air; then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset,
    </p>
    <p>
     the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg,
    </p>
    <p>
     turning his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it
    </p>
    <p>
     to me for a puff.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Capting!  Capting! yelled the bumpkin, running toward that officer;
    </p>
    <p>
     "Capting, Capting, here's the devil."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hallo, you sir," cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     stalking up to Queequeg, "what in thunder do you mean by that?
    </p>
    <p>
     Don't you know you might have killed that chap?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "What him say?" said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.
    </p>
    <p>
     "He say," said I, "that you came near kill-e that man there,"
    </p>
    <p>
     pointing to the still shivering greenhorn.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Kill-e," cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an
    </p>
    <p>
     unearthly expression of disdain, "ah! him bevy small-e fish-e;
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Look you," roared the Captain, "I'll kill-e you, you cannibal,
    </p>
    <p>
     if you try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye."
    </p>
    <p>
     But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain
    </p>
    <p>
     to mind his own eye.  The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had
    </p>
    <p>
     parted the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying
    </p>
    <p>
     from side to side, completely sweeping the entire after part
    </p>
    <p>
     of the deck.  The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly,
    </p>
    <p>
     was swept overboard; all hands were in a panic; and to attempt
    </p>
    <p>
     snatching at the boom to stay it, seemed madness.  It flew from
    </p>
    <p>
     right to left, and back again, almost in one ticking of a watch,
    </p>
    <p>
     and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of being done;
    </p>
    <p>
     those on deck rushed toward the bows, and stood eyeing the boom
    </p>
    <p>
     as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale.  In the midst
    </p>
    <p>
     of this consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees,
    </p>
    <p>
     and crawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope,
    </p>
    <p>
     secured one end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other
    </p>
    <p>
     like a lasso, caught it round the boom as it swept over his head,
    </p>
    <p>
     and at the next jerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all was safe.
    </p>
    <p>
     The schooner was run into the wind, and while the hands were
    </p>
    <p>
     clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist,
    </p>
    <p>
     darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap.
    </p>
    <p>
     For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog,
    </p>
    <p>
     throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by turns
    </p>
    <p>
     revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam.
    </p>
    <p>
     I looked at the grand and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.
    </p>
    <p>
     The greenhorn had gone down.  Shooting himself perpendicularly
    </p>
    <p>
     from the water, Queequeg, now took an instant's glance around him,
    </p>
    <p>
     and seeming to see just how matters were, dived down and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
     A few minutes more, and he rose again, one arm still
    </p>
    <p>
     striking out, and with the other dragging a lifeless form.
    </p>
    <p>
     The boat soon picked them up.  The poor bumpkin was restored.
    </p>
    <p>
     All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump; the captain begged his pardon.
    </p>
    <p>
     From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a barnacle; yea, till poor
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg took his last long dive.
    </p>
    <p>
     Was there ever such unconsciousness?  He did not seem to think that he at
    </p>
    <p>
     all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies.  He only
    </p>
    <p>
     asked for water--fresh water--something to wipe the brine off;
    </p>
    <p>
     that done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against
    </p>
    <p>
     the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying
    </p>
    <p>
     to himself--"It's a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians.
    </p>
    <p>
     We cannibals must help these Christians."

     CHAPTER 14
    </head>
    <p>
     Nantucket
    </p>
    <p>
     Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning;
    </p>
    <p>
     so, after a fine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nantucket!  Take out your map and look at it.  See what a real corner
    </p>
    <p>
     of the world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore,
    </p>
    <p>
     more lonely than the Eddystone lighthouse.  Look at it--
    </p>
    <p>
     a mere hillock, and elbow of sand; all beach, without a background.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is more sand there than you would use in twenty years as a
    </p>
    <p>
     substitute for blotting paper.  Some gamesome wights will tell you
    </p>
    <p>
     that they have to plant weeds there, they don't grow naturally;
    </p>
    <p>
     that they import Canada thistles; that they have to send beyond
    </p>
    <p>
     seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask; that pieces of wood
    </p>
    <p>
     in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in Rome;
    </p>
    <p>
     that people there plant toadstools before their houses, to get under
    </p>
    <p>
     the shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an oasis,
    </p>
    <p>
     three blades in a day's walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand shoes,
    </p>
    <p>
     something like Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up,
    </p>
    <p>
     belted about, every way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island
    </p>
    <p>
     of by the ocean, that to their very chairs and tables small clams
    </p>
    <p>
     will sometimes be found adhering as to the backs of sea turtles.
    </p>
    <p>
     But these extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois.
    </p>
    <p>
     Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this
    </p>
    <p>
     island was settled by the red-men. Thus goes the legend.
    </p>
    <p>
     In olden times an eagle swooped down upon the New England
    </p>
    <p>
     coast and carried off an infant Indian in his talons.
    </p>
    <p>
     With loud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight over
    </p>
    <p>
     the wide waters.  They resolved to follow in the same direction.
    </p>
    <p>
     Setting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage they
    </p>
    <p>
     discovered the island, and there they found an empty ivory casket,--
    </p>
    <p>
     the poor little Indian's skeleton.
    </p>
    <p>
     What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should take
    </p>
    <p>
     to the sea for a livelihood!  They first caught crabs and quahogs
    </p>
    <p>
     in the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel;
    </p>
    <p>
     more experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod;
    </p>
    <p>
     and at last, launching a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this
    </p>
    <p>
     watery world; put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it;
    </p>
    <p>
     peeped in at Behring's Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans
    </p>
    <p>
     declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that
    </p>
    <p>
     has survived the flood; most monstrous and most mountainous!
    </p>
    <p>
     That Himmalehan, salt-sea, Mastodon, clothed with such portentousness
    </p>
    <p>
     of unconscious power, that his very panics are more to be dreaded
    </p>
    <p>
     than his most fearless and malicious assaults!
    </p>
    <p>
     And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits,
    </p>
    <p>
     issuing from their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered
    </p>
    <p>
     the watery world like so many Alexanders; parcelling out among
    </p>
    <p>
     them the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, as the three
    </p>
    <p>
     pirate powers did Poland.  Let America add Mexico to Texas,
    </p>
    <p>
     and pile Cuba upon Canada; let the English overswarm all India,
    </p>
    <p>
     and hang out their blazing banner from the sun; two thirds of this
    </p>
    <p>
     terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer's. For the sea is his;
    </p>
    <p>
     he owns it, as Emperors own empires; other seamen having but a right
    </p>
    <p>
     of way through it.  Merchant ships are but extension bridges;
    </p>
    <p>
     armed ones but floating forts; even pirates and privateers,
    </p>
    <p>
     though following the sea as highwaymen the road.  they but plunder
    </p>
    <p>
     other ships, other fragments of the land like themselves,
    </p>
    <p>
     without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Nantucketer, he alone resides and riots on the sea;
    </p>
    <p>
     he alone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships;
    </p>
    <p>
     to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is his home; there lies his business which a Noah's flood
    </p>
    <p>
     would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions
    </p>
    <p>
     in China.  He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie;
    </p>
    <p>
     he hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters
    </p>
    <p>
     climb the Alps.  For years he knows not the land; so that
    </p>
    <p>
     when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world,
    </p>
    <p>
     more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman.  With the
    </p>
    <p>
     landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked
    </p>
    <p>
     to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer,
    </p>
    <p>
     out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest,
    </p>
    <p>
     while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.

     CHAPTER 15
    </head>
    <p>
     Chowder
    </p>
    <p>
     It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly
    </p>
    <p>
     to anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend
    </p>
    <p>
     to no business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     The landlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin
    </p>
    <p>
     Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one
    </p>
    <p>
     of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured
    </p>
    <p>
     us that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders.
    </p>
    <p>
     In short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better
    </p>
    <p>
     than try pot-luck at the Try Pots.  But the directions he had given
    </p>
    <p>
     us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we
    </p>
    <p>
     opened a white church to the larboard, and then keeping that on
    </p>
    <p>
     the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard,
    </p>
    <p>
     and that done, then ask the first man we met where the place was;
    </p>
    <p>
     these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first,
    </p>
    <p>
     especially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse--
    </p>
    <p>
     our first point of departure--must be left on the larboard hand,
    </p>
    <p>
     whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, by dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now
    </p>
    <p>
     and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way,
    </p>
    <p>
     we at last came to something which there was no mistaking.
    </p>
    <p>
     Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses'
    </p>
    <p>
     ears, swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front
    </p>
    <p>
     of an old doorway.  The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the
    </p>
    <p>
     other side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows.
    </p>
    <p>
     Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time,
    </p>
    <p>
     but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
     A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two
    </p>
    <p>
     remaining horns; yes, two of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's ominous, thinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first
    </p>
    <p>
     whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen's chapel,
    </p>
    <p>
     and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too!
    </p>
    <p>
     Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?
    </p>
    <p>
     I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled
    </p>
    <p>
     woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch
    </p>
    <p>
     of the inn, under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much
    </p>
    <p>
     like an injured eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man
    </p>
    <p>
     in a purple woollen shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Get along with ye," said she to the man, "or I'll be combing ye!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come on, Queequeg," said I, "all right.  There's Mrs. Hussey."
    </p>
    <p>
     And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving
    </p>
    <p>
     Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed,
    </p>
    <p>
     Mrs. Hussey, postponing further scolding for the present,
    </p>
    <p>
     ushered us into a little room, and seating us at a table spread
    </p>
    <p>
     with the relics of a recently concluded repast, turned round
    </p>
    <p>
     to us and said--"Clam or Cod?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "What's that about Cods, ma'am?" said I, with much politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Clam or Cod?" she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
     "A clam for supper? a cold clam; is that what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?"
    </p>
    <p>
     says I, "but that's a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time,
    </p>
    <p>
     ain't it, Mrs. Hussey?"
    </p>
    <p>
     But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple
    </p>
    <p>
     shirt who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     but the word "clam," Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading
    </p>
    <p>
     to the kitchen, and bawling out "clam for two," disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Queequeg," said I, "do you think that we can make out a supper
    </p>
    <p>
     for us both on one clam?"
    </p>
    <p>
     However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie
    </p>
    <p>
     the apparently cheerless prospect before us.  But when that
    </p>
    <p>
     smoking chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh! sweet friends, hearken to me.  It was made of small juicy clams,
    </p>
    <p>
     scarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuits,
    </p>
    <p>
     and salted pork cut up into little flakes! the whole enriched
    </p>
    <p>
     with butter, and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular,
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him, and the chowder
    </p>
    <p>
     being surpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great expedition:
    </p>
    <p>
     when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey's clam
    </p>
    <p>
     and cod announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word "cod" with
    </p>
    <p>
     great emphasis, and resumed my seat.  In a few moments the savoury
    </p>
    <p>
     steam came forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good
    </p>
    <p>
     time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.
    </p>
    <p>
     We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I
    </p>
    <p>
     to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head?
    </p>
    <p>
     What's that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people?
    </p>
    <p>
     "But look, Queequeg, ain't that a live eel in your bowl?
    </p>
    <p>
     Where's your harpoon?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved
    </p>
    <p>
     its name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders.
    </p>
    <p>
     Chowder for breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper,
    </p>
    <p>
     till you began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
     The area before the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey
    </p>
    <p>
     wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had
    </p>
    <p>
     his account books bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy
    </p>
    <p>
     flavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for,
    </p>
    <p>
     till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some
    </p>
    <p>
     fishermen's boats, I saw Hosea's brindled cow feeding on fish remnants,
    </p>
    <p>
     and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod's decapitated head,
    </p>
    <p>
     looking very slipshod, I assure ye.
    </p>
    <p>
     Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey
    </p>
    <p>
     concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about
    </p>
    <p>
     to precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm,
    </p>
    <p>
     and demanded his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why not? said I; "every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon--
    </p>
    <p>
     but why not?"  "Because it's dangerous," says she.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfort'nt v'y'ge of his,
    </p>
    <p>
     when he was gone four years and a half, with only three barrels
    </p>
    <p>
     of ile, was found dead in my first floor back, with his harpoon
    </p>
    <p>
     in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich
    </p>
    <p>
     dangerous weepons in their rooms at night.  So, Mr. Queequeg"
    </p>
    <p>
     (for she had learned his name), "I will just take this here iron,
    </p>
    <p>
     and keep it for you till morning.  But the chowder; clam or cod
    </p>
    <p>
     to-morrow for breakfast, men?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Both," says I; "and let's have a couple of smoked herring
    </p>
    <p>
     by way of variety."

    <p>
     The Ship
    </p>
    <p>
     In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow.  But to my surprise
    </p>
    <p>
     and no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had
    </p>
    <p>
     been diligently consulting Yojo--the name of his black little god--
    </p>
    <p>
     and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly
    </p>
    <p>
     insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among
    </p>
    <p>
     the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft;
    </p>
    <p>
     instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection
    </p>
    <p>
     of the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed
    </p>
    <p>
     befriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon
    </p>
    <p>
     a vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly
    </p>
    <p>
     light upon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance;
    </p>
    <p>
     and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present
    </p>
    <p>
     irrespective of Queequeg.
    </p>
    <p>
     I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed
    </p>
    <p>
     great confidence in the excellence of Yojo's judgment and surprising
    </p>
    <p>
     forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem,
    </p>
    <p>
     as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, this plan of Queequeg's or rather Yojo's, touching
    </p>
    <p>
     the selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     I had not a little relied on Queequeg's sagacity to point out
    </p>
    <p>
     the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely.
    </p>
    <p>
     But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was
    </p>
    <p>
     obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this
    </p>
    <p>
     business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor,
    </p>
    <p>
     that should quickly settle that trifling little affair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo
    </p>
    <p>
     in our little bedroom--for it seemed that it was some sort
    </p>
    <p>
     of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer
    </p>
    <p>
     with Queequeg and Yojo that day; how it was I never could
    </p>
    <p>
     find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times,
    </p>
    <p>
     I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles--
    </p>
    <p>
     leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe,
    </p>
    <p>
     and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings,
    </p>
    <p>
     I sallied out among the shipping.  After much prolonged sauntering,
    </p>
    <p>
     and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three ships
    </p>
    <p>
     up for three-years' voyages--The Devil-Dam the Tit-bit,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the Pequod.  Devil-dam, I do not know the origin of;
    </p>
    <p>
     Tit-bit is obvious; Pequod you will no doubt remember,
    </p>
    <p>
     was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians;
    </p>
    <p>
     now extinct as the ancient Medes.  I peered and pryed about
    </p>
    <p>
     the Devil-Dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally,
    </p>
    <p>
     going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment,
    </p>
    <p>
     and then decided that this was the very ship for us.
    </p>
    <p>
     You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know;--
    </p>
    <p>
     square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box galliots,
    </p>
    <p>
     and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old
    </p>
    <p>
     craft as this same rare old Pequod.  She was a ship of the old school,
    </p>
    <p>
     rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed look
    </p>
    <p>
     about her.  Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms
    </p>
    <p>
     of all four oceans, her old hull's complexion was darkened like a French
    </p>
    <p>
     grenadier's, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia.  Her venerable
    </p>
    <p>
     bows looked bearded.  Her masts--cut somewhere on the coast of Japan,
    </p>
    <p>
     where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale--her masts stood
    </p>
    <p>
     stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne.  Her ancient
    </p>
    <p>
     decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone
    </p>
    <p>
     in Canterbury Cathedral where Beckett bled.  But to all these her
    </p>
    <p>
     old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to
    </p>
    <p>
     the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded
    </p>
    <p>
     another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the
    </p>
    <p>
     principal owners of the Pequod,--this old Peleg, during the term of his
    </p>
    <p>
     chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid it,
    </p>
    <p>
     all over, with a quaintness both of material and device, unmatched by
    </p>
    <p>
     anything except it be Thorkill-Hake's carved buckler or bedstead.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck
    </p>
    <p>
     heavy with pendants of polished ivory.  She was a thing of trophies.
    </p>
    <p>
     A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones
    </p>
    <p>
     of her enemies.  All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished
    </p>
    <p>
     like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled
    </p>
    <p>
     over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend
    </p>
    <p>
     helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass,
    </p>
    <p>
     curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe.
    </p>
    <p>
     The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like
    </p>
    <p>
     the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
     A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy!  All noble things are
    </p>
    <p>
     touched with that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority,
    </p>
    <p>
     in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I
    </p>
    <p>
     saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent,
    </p>
    <p>
     or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     only a temporary erection used in port.  It was of a conical shape,
    </p>
    <p>
     some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber
    </p>
    <p>
     black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of
    </p>
    <p>
     the right-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle
    </p>
    <p>
     of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other,
    </p>
    <p>
     and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres
    </p>
    <p>
     waved to and fro like a top-knot on some old Pottowotamie Sachem's head.
    </p>
    <p>
     A triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so that
    </p>
    <p>
     the insider commanded a complete view forward.
    </p>
    <p>
     And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found
    </p>
    <p>
     one who by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who,
    </p>
    <p>
     it being noon, and the ship's work suspended, was now enjoying
    </p>
    <p>
     respite from the burden of command.  He was seated on an
    </p>
    <p>
     old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over with curious carving;
    </p>
    <p>
     and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing
    </p>
    <p>
     of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance
    </p>
    <p>
     of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen,
    </p>
    <p>
     and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style;
    </p>
    <p>
     only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest
    </p>
    <p>
     wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his
    </p>
    <p>
     continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to windward;--
    </p>
    <p>
     for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together.
    </p>
    <p>
     Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is this the Captain of the Pequod?" said I, advancing to the door
    </p>
    <p>
     of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Supposing it be the Captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want
    </p>
    <p>
     of him?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I was thinking of shipping."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thou wast, wast thou?  I see thou art no Nantucketer--
    </p>
    <p>
     ever been in a stove boat?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, Sir, I never have."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say--eh?
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn.
    </p>
    <p>
     I've been several voyages in the merchant service, and I think that-"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Merchant service be damned.  Talk not that lingo to me.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dost see that leg?--I'll take that leg away from thy stern,
    </p>
    <p>
     if ever thou talkest of the merchant service to me again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Marchant service indeed!  I suppose now ye feel considerable
    </p>
    <p>
     proud of having served in those marchant ships.  But flukes! man,
    </p>
    <p>
     what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?--it looks a little
    </p>
    <p>
     suspicious, don't it, eh?--Hast not been a pirate, hast thou?--
    </p>
    <p>
     Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?--Dost not think
    </p>
    <p>
     of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?"
    </p>
    <p>
     I protested my innocence of these things.  I saw that under
    </p>
    <p>
     the mask of these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman,
    </p>
    <p>
     as an insulated Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his
    </p>
    <p>
     insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of all aliens,
    </p>
    <p>
     unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I
    </p>
    <p>
     think of shipping ye."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is.  I want to see the world."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Want to see what whaling is, eh?  Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Who is Captain Ahab, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, aye, I thought so.  Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I am mistaken then.  I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg--that's who ye are speaking to,
    </p>
    <p>
     young man.  It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted
    </p>
    <p>
     out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew.
    </p>
    <p>
     We are part owners and agents.  But as I was going to say, if thou wantest
    </p>
    <p>
     to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way
    </p>
    <p>
     of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has
    </p>
    <p>
     only one leg."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What do you mean, sir?  Was the other one lost by a whale?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Lost by a whale!  Young man, come nearer to me:  it was devoured,
    </p>
    <p>
     chewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped
    </p>
    <p>
     a boat!--ah, ah!"
    </p>
    <p>
     I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched
    </p>
    <p>
     at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly
    </p>
    <p>
     as I could, "What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could
    </p>
    <p>
     I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact
    </p>
    <p>
     of the accident."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d'ye see;
    </p>
    <p>
     thou dost not talk shark a bit.  Sure, ye've been to sea before now;
    </p>
    <p>
     sure of that?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sir," said I, "I thought I told you that I had been four voyages
    </p>
    <p>
     in the merchant-"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hard down out of that!  Mind what I said about the marchant service--
    </p>
    <p>
     don't aggravate me--I won't have it.  But let us understand each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     I have given thee a hint about what whaling is! do ye yet feel
    </p>
    <p>
     inclined for it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I do, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Very good.  Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live
    </p>
    <p>
     whale's throat, and then jump after it?  Answer, quick!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so;
    </p>
    <p>
     not to be got rid of, that is; which I don't take to be the fact."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good again.  Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling,
    </p>
    <p>
     to find out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want
    </p>
    <p>
     to go in order to see the world?  Was not that what ye said?
    </p>
    <p>
     I thought so.  Well then, just step forward there, and take
    </p>
    <p>
     a peep over the weather bow, and then back to me and tell me
    </p>
    <p>
     what ye see there."
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request,
    </p>
    <p>
     not knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
     But concentrating all his crow's feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg
    </p>
    <p>
     started me on the errand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived
    </p>
    <p>
     that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was
    </p>
    <p>
     now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean.  The prospect
    </p>
    <p>
     was unlimited, but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding;
    </p>
    <p>
     not the slightest variety that I could see.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, what's the report?" said Peleg when I came back;
    </p>
    <p>
     "what did ye see?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not much," I replied--"nothing but water; considerable horizon though,
    </p>
    <p>
     and there's a squall coming up, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, what dost thou think then of seeing the world?
    </p>
    <p>
     Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh?
    </p>
    <p>
     Can't ye see the world where you stand?"
    </p>
    <p>
     I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would;
    </p>
    <p>
     and the Pequod was as good a ship as any--I thought the best--
    </p>
    <p>
     and all this I now repeated to Peleg.  Seeing me so determined,
    </p>
    <p>
     he expressed his willingness to ship me.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,"
    </p>
    <p>
     he added--"come along with ye."  And so saying, he led the way
    </p>
    <p>
     below deck into the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and
    </p>
    <p>
     surprising figure.  It turned out to be Captain Bildad who along
    </p>
    <p>
     with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel;
    </p>
    <p>
     the other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports,
    </p>
    <p>
     being held by a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children,
    </p>
    <p>
     and chancery wards; each owning about the value of a timber head,
    </p>
    <p>
     or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
     People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels,
    </p>
    <p>
     the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing
    </p>
    <p>
     in good interest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers,
    </p>
    <p>
     was a Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect;
    </p>
    <p>
     and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon
    </p>
    <p>
     measure the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and
    </p>
    <p>
     anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous.
    </p>
    <p>
     For some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary
    </p>
    <p>
     of all sailors and whale-hunters. They are fighting Quakers;
    </p>
    <p>
     they are Quakers with a vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
     So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with
    </p>
    <p>
     Scripture names--a singularly common fashion on the island--
    </p>
    <p>
     and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee
    </p>
    <p>
     and thou of the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious,
    </p>
    <p>
     daring, and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives,
    </p>
    <p>
     strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand
    </p>
    <p>
     bold dashes of character, not unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king,
    </p>
    <p>
     or a poetical Pagan Roman.  And when these things unite
    </p>
    <p>
     in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular
    </p>
    <p>
     brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness
    </p>
    <p>
     and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters,
    </p>
    <p>
     and beneath constellations never seen here at the north,
    </p>
    <p>
     been led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all
    </p>
    <p>
     nature's sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin
    </p>
    <p>
     voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some
    </p>
    <p>
     help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous
    </p>
    <p>
     lofty language--that man makes one in a whole nation's census--
    </p>
    <p>
     a mighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically regarded,
    </p>
    <p>
     if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems
    </p>
    <p>
     a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature.
    </p>
    <p>
     For all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is
    </p>
    <p>
     but disease.  But, as yet we have not to do with such an one,
    </p>
    <p>
     but with quite another; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar,
    </p>
    <p>
     it only results again from another phase of the Quaker,
    </p>
    <p>
     modified by individual circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman.
    </p>
    <p>
     But unlike Captain Peleg--who cared not a rush for what are called
    </p>
    <p>
     serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things
    </p>
    <p>
     the veriest of all trifles--Captain Bildad had not only been originally
    </p>
    <p>
     educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism,
    </p>
    <p>
     but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad,
    </p>
    <p>
     lovely island creatures, round the Horn--all that had not moved this
    </p>
    <p>
     native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle
    </p>
    <p>
     of his vest.  Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack
    </p>
    <p>
     of common consistency about worthy Captain Bildad.  Though refusing,
    </p>
    <p>
     from conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders,
    </p>
    <p>
     yet himself had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific;
    </p>
    <p>
     and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his
    </p>
    <p>
     straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore.
    </p>
    <p>
     How now in the contemplative evening of his days, the pious Bildad
    </p>
    <p>
     reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not know;
    </p>
    <p>
     but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he had
    </p>
    <p>
     long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man's
    </p>
    <p>
     religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another.
    </p>
    <p>
     This world pays dividends.  Rising from a little cabin boy
    </p>
    <p>
     in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad
    </p>
    <p>
     shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief mate,
    </p>
    <p>
     and captain, and finally a shipowner; Bildad, as I hinted before,
    </p>
    <p>
     had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active
    </p>
    <p>
     life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days
    </p>
    <p>
     to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being
    </p>
    <p>
     an incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter,
    </p>
    <p>
     hard task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it
    </p>
    <p>
     certainly seems a curious story, that when he sailed the old
    </p>
    <p>
     Categut whaleman, his crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all
    </p>
    <p>
     carried ashore to the hospital, sore exhausted and worn out.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was certainly
    </p>
    <p>
     rather hard-hearted, to say the least.  He never used to swear,
    </p>
    <p>
     though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate
    </p>
    <p>
     quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-colored eye
    </p>
    <p>
     intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous,
    </p>
    <p>
     till you could clutch something--a hammer or a marling-spike,
    </p>
    <p>
     and go to work like mad, at something or other, never mind what.
    </p>
    <p>
     Indolence and idleness perished from before him.  His own
    </p>
    <p>
     person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character.
    </p>
    <p>
     On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh,
    </p>
    <p>
     no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it,
    </p>
    <p>
     like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom
    </p>
    <p>
     when I followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
     The space between the decks was small; and there, bolt upright,
    </p>
    <p>
     sat old Bildad, who always sat so, and never leaned, and this
    </p>
    <p>
     to save his coat-tails. His broad-brim was placed beside him;
    </p>
    <p>
     his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was buttoned
    </p>
    <p>
     up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed
    </p>
    <p>
     in reading from a ponderous volume.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bildad," cried Captain Peleg, "at it again, Bildad, eh?  Ye have
    </p>
    <p>
     been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years,
    </p>
    <p>
     to my certain knowledge.  How far ye got, Bildad?"
    </p>
    <p>
     As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,
    </p>
    <p>
     Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,
    </p>
    <p>
     and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.
    </p>
    <p>
     "He says he's our man, Bildad," said Peleg, "he wants to ship."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Dost thee?" said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I dost," said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What do ye think of him, Bildad?" said Peleg.
    </p>
    <p>
     "He'll do," said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling
    </p>
    <p>
     away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.
    </p>
    <p>
     I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg,
    </p>
    <p>
     his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer.
    </p>
    <p>
     But I said nothing, only looking round me sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
     Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the ship's articles,
    </p>
    <p>
     placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at a little table.
    </p>
    <p>
     I began to think it was high time to settle with myself
    </p>
    <p>
     at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
     I was already aware that in the whaling business they
    </p>
    <p>
     paid no wages; but all hands, including the captain,
    </p>
    <p>
     received certain shares of the profits called lays, and that
    </p>
    <p>
     these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance
    </p>
    <p>
     pertaining to the respective duties of the ship's company.
    </p>
    <p>
     I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own
    </p>
    <p>
     lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used
    </p>
    <p>
     to the sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that,
    </p>
    <p>
     I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be offered
    </p>
    <p>
     at least the 275th lay--that is, the 275th part of the clear net
    </p>
    <p>
     proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually amount to.
    </p>
    <p>
     And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather long lay,
    </p>
    <p>
     yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage,
    </p>
    <p>
     might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it,
    </p>
    <p>
     not to speak of my three years' beef and board, for which I
    </p>
    <p>
     would not have to pay one stiver.
    </p>
    <p>
     It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate
    </p>
    <p>
     a princely fortune--and so it was, a very poor way indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
     But I am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes,
    </p>
    <p>
     and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I
    </p>
    <p>
     am putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud.  Upon the whole,
    </p>
    <p>
     I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing,
    </p>
    <p>
     but would not have been surprised had I been offered the 200th,
    </p>
    <p>
     considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.
    </p>
    <p>
     But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about
    </p>
    <p>
     receiving a generous share of the profits was this:  Ashore, I had heard
    </p>
    <p>
     something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad;
    </p>
    <p>
     how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod,
    </p>
    <p>
     therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners,
    </p>
    <p>
     left nearly the whole management of the ship's affairs to these two.
    </p>
    <p>
     And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty
    </p>
    <p>
     deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board
    </p>
    <p>
     the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible
    </p>
    <p>
     as if at his own fireside.  Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend
    </p>
    <p>
     a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise,
    </p>
    <p>
     considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings;
    </p>
    <p>
     Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book,
    </p>
    <p>
     "Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth-"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, Captain Bildad," interrupted Peleg, "what d'ye say,
    </p>
    <p>
     what lay shall we give this young man?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thou knowest best," was the sepulchral reply, "the seven hundred
    </p>
    <p>
     and seventy-seventh wouldn't be too much, would it?--'where moth
    </p>
    <p>
     and rust do corrupt, but lay-'"
    </p>
    <p>
     Lay, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and
    </p>
    <p>
     seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one,
    </p>
    <p>
     shall not lay up many lays here below, where moth and rust do corrupt.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was an exceedingly long lay that, indeed; and though from the magnitude
    </p>
    <p>
     of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet the slightest
    </p>
    <p>
     consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy-seven
    </p>
    <p>
     is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a teenth of it,
    </p>
    <p>
     you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part
    </p>
    <p>
     of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven
    </p>
    <p>
     gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, blast your eyes, Bildad," cried Peleg, Thou dost not want
    </p>
    <p>
     to swindle this young man! he must have more than that."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Seven hundred and seventy-seventh," again said Bildad, without lifting
    </p>
    <p>
     his eyes; and then went on mumbling--"for where your treasure is,
    </p>
    <p>
     there will your heart be also."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I am going to put him down for the three hundredth," said Peleg,
    </p>
    <p>
     "do ye hear that, Bildad!  The three hundredth lay, I say."
    </p>
    <p>
     Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards
    </p>
    <p>
     him said, "Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart;
    </p>
    <p>
     but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other
    </p>
    <p>
     owners of this ship--widows and orphans, many of them--
    </p>
    <p>
     and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man,
    </p>
    <p>
     we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans.
    </p>
    <p>
     The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thou Bildad!" roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these matters,
    </p>
    <p>
     I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy
    </p>
    <p>
     enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Captain Peleg," said Bildad steadily, "thy conscience may be
    </p>
    <p>
     drawing ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can't tell;
    </p>
    <p>
     but as thou art still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly
    </p>
    <p>
     fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end
    </p>
    <p>
     sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing,
    </p>
    <p>
     ye insult me.  It's an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature
    </p>
    <p>
     that he's bound to hell.  Flukes and flames!  Bildad, say that again
    </p>
    <p>
     to me, and start my soulbolts, but I'll--I'll--yes, I'll swallow a live
    </p>
    <p>
     goat with all his hair and horns on.  Out of the cabin, ye canting,
    </p>
    <p>
     drab-colored son of a wooden gun--a straight wake with ye!"
    </p>
    <p>
     As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a
    </p>
    <p>
     marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal
    </p>
    <p>
     and responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind
    </p>
    <p>
     to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably
    </p>
    <p>
     owned and temporarily commanded, I stepped aside from the door
    </p>
    <p>
     to give egress to Bildad, who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness
    </p>
    <p>
     to vanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg.  But to
    </p>
    <p>
     my astonishment, he sat down again on the transom very quietly,
    </p>
    <p>
     and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing.
    </p>
    <p>
     He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways.
    </p>
    <p>
     As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb,
    </p>
    <p>
     though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Whew!" he whistled at last--"the squall's gone off to leeward,
    </p>
    <p>
     I think.  Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance,
    </p>
    <p>
     mend that pen, will ye.  My jack-knife here needs the grindstone.
    </p>
    <p>
     That's he; thank ye, Bildad.  Now then, my young man,
    </p>
    <p>
     Ishmael's thy name, didn't ye say?  Well then, down ye
    </p>
    <p>
     go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth lay."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Captain Peleg," said I, "I have a friend with me who wants to ship too--
    </p>
    <p>
     shall I bring him down to-morrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "To be sure," said Peleg.  "Fetch him along, and we'll look at him."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What lay does he want?" groaned Bildad, glancing up from the Book
    </p>
    <p>
     in which he had again been burying himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad," said Peleg.  "Has he ever
    </p>
    <p>
     whaled it any?" turning to me.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, bring him along then."
    </p>
    <p>
     And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I
    </p>
    <p>
     had done a good morning's work, and that the Pequod was the identical
    </p>
    <p>
     ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.
    </p>
    <p>
     But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me
    </p>
    <p>
     that the Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen
    </p>
    <p>
     by me; though, indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be
    </p>
    <p>
     completely fitted out, and receive all her crew on board,
    </p>
    <p>
     ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command;
    </p>
    <p>
     for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the shore
    </p>
    <p>
     intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain
    </p>
    <p>
     have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort,
    </p>
    <p>
     he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port,
    </p>
    <p>
     but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, it is always as well to have a look at him
    </p>
    <p>
     before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab
    </p>
    <p>
     was to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab?  It's all right enough;
    </p>
    <p>
     thou art shipped."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, but I should like to see him."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But I don't think thou wilt be able to at present.  I don't know
    </p>
    <p>
     exactly what's the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house;
    </p>
    <p>
     a sort of sick, and yet he don't look so.  In fact, he ain't sick;
    </p>
    <p>
     but no, he isn't well either.  Any how, young man, he won't always see me,
    </p>
    <p>
     so I don't suppose he will thee.  He's a queer man, Captain Ahab--
    </p>
    <p>
     so some think--but a good one.  Oh, thou'lt like him well enough;
    </p>
    <p>
     no fear, no fear.  He's a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab;
    </p>
    <p>
     doesn't speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab's above the common; Ahab's been in colleges,
    </p>
    <p>
     as well as 'mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than
    </p>
    <p>
     the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than whales.
    </p>
    <p>
     His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle!
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh! he ain't Captain Bildad; no, and he ain't Captain Peleg;
    </p>
    <p>
     he's Ahab, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "And a very vile one.  When that wicked king was slain, the dogs,
    </p>
    <p>
     did they not lick his blood?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come hither to me--hither, hither," said Peleg,
    </p>
    <p>
     with a significance in his eye that almost startled me.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Look ye, lad; never say that on board the Pequod.  Never say
    </p>
    <p>
     it anywhere.  Captain Ahab did not name himself .'Twas a foolish,
    </p>
    <p>
     ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died when
    </p>
    <p>
     he was only a twelvemonth old.  And yet the old squaw Tistig,
    </p>
    <p>
     at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic.
    </p>
    <p>
     And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     I wish to warn thee.  It's a lie.  I know Captain Ahab well;
    </p>
    <p>
     I've sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is--
    </p>
    <p>
     a good man--not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing
    </p>
    <p>
     good man--something like me--only there's a good deal more
    </p>
    <p>
     of him.  Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly;
    </p>
    <p>
     and I know that on the passage home he was a little out of his
    </p>
    <p>
     mind for a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his
    </p>
    <p>
     bleeding stump that brought that about, as any one might see.
    </p>
    <p>
     I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg last voyage
    </p>
    <p>
     by that accursed whale, he's been a kind of moody--
    </p>
    <p>
     desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass off.
    </p>
    <p>
     And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man,
    </p>
    <p>
     it's better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing
    </p>
    <p>
     bad one.  So good-bye to thee--and wrong not Captain Ahab,
    </p>
    <p>
     because he happens to have a wicked name.  Besides, my boy,
    </p>
    <p>
     he has a wife--not three voyages wedded--a sweet, resigned girl.
    </p>
    <p>
     Think of that; by that sweet girl that old man had a child:
    </p>
    <p>
     hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm in Ahab?  No, no,
    </p>
    <p>
     my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities!"
    </p>
    <p>
     As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had
    </p>
    <p>
     been incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me
    </p>
    <p>
     with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him.
    </p>
    <p>
     And somehow, at the time, I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him,
    </p>
    <p>
     but for I don't know what, unless it was the cruel loss of his leg.
    </p>
    <p>
     And yet I also felt a strange awe of him; but that sort of awe,
    </p>
    <p>
     which I cannot at all describe, was not exactly awe; I do not
    </p>
    <p>
     know what it was.  But I felt it; and it did not disincline
    </p>
    <p>
     me towards him; though I felt impatience at what seemed like
    </p>
    <p>
     mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known to me then.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, my thoughts were at length carried in other directions,
    </p>
    <p>
     so that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.

     CHAPTER 17
    </head>
    <p>
     The Ramadan
    </p>
    <p>
     As Queequeg's Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue
    </p>
    <p>
     all day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall;
    </p>
    <p>
     for I cherish the greatest respect towards everybody's religious
    </p>
    <p>
     obligations, never mind how comical, and could not find it in my heart
    </p>
    <p>
     to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad-stool;
    </p>
    <p>
     or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth, who with
    </p>
    <p>
     a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets,
    </p>
    <p>
     bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely
    </p>
    <p>
     on account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented
    </p>
    <p>
     in his name.
    </p>
    <p>
     I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable
    </p>
    <p>
     in these things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior
    </p>
    <p>
     to other mortals, pagans and what not, because of their half-crazy
    </p>
    <p>
     conceits on these subjects.  There was Queequeg, now, certainly
    </p>
    <p>
     entertaining the most absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;--
    </p>
    <p>
     but what of that?  Queequeg thought he knew what he was about,
    </p>
    <p>
     I suppose; he seemed to be content; and there let him rest.
    </p>
    <p>
     All our arguing with him would not avail; let him be, I say:
    </p>
    <p>
     and Heaven have mercy on us all--Presbyterians and Pagans alike--
    </p>
    <p>
     for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head,
    </p>
    <p>
     and sadly need mending.
    </p>
    <p>
     Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and
    </p>
    <p>
     rituals must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door;
    </p>
    <p>
     but no answer.  I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Queequeg," said I softly through the key-hole:--all silent.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I say, Queequeg! why don't you speak?  It's I--Ishmael."  But all
    </p>
    <p>
     remained still as before.  I began to grow alarmed.  I had allowed him
    </p>
    <p>
     such abundant time; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit.
    </p>
    <p>
     I looked through the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner
    </p>
    <p>
     of the room, the key-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one.
    </p>
    <p>
     I could only see part of the foot-board of the bed and a line of the wall,
    </p>
    <p>
     but nothing more.  I was surprised to behold resting against the wall
    </p>
    <p>
     the wooden shaft of Queequeg's harpoon, which the landlady the evening
    </p>
    <p>
     previous had taken from him, before our mounting to the chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
     That's strange, thought I; but at any rate, since the harpoon
    </p>
    <p>
     stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad without it,
    </p>
    <p>
     therefore he must be inside here, and no possible mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Queequeg!--Queequeg!"--all still.  Something must
    </p>
    <p>
     have happened.  Apoplexy!  I tried to burst open the door;
    </p>
    <p>
     but it stubbornly resisted.  Running down stairs, I quickly
    </p>
    <p>
     stated my suspicions to the first person I met--the chamber-maid.
    </p>
    <p>
     "La! la!" she cried, "I thought something must be the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
     I went to make the bed after breakfast, and the door was locked;
    </p>
    <p>
     and not a mouse to be heard; and it's been just so silent ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
     But I thought, may be, you had both gone off and locked your
    </p>
    <p>
     baggage in for safe keeping.  La!  La, ma'am!--Mistress! murder!
    </p>
    <p>
     Mrs. Hussey! apoplexy!"--and with these cries she ran towards
    </p>
    <p>
     the kitchen, I following.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand
    </p>
    <p>
     and a vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away
    </p>
    <p>
     from the occupation of attending to the castors, and scolding
    </p>
    <p>
     her little black boy meantime.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wood-house!" cried I, "which way to it?  Run for God's sake, and fetch
    </p>
    <p>
     something to pry open the door--the axe!--the axe! he's had a stroke;
    </p>
    <p>
     depend upon it!"--and so saying I was unmethodically rushing up stairs
    </p>
    <p>
     again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the mustard-pot and
    </p>
    <p>
     vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What's the matter with you, young man?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Get the axe!  For God's sake, run for the doctor, some one,
    </p>
    <p>
     while I pry it open!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Look here," said the landlady, quickly putting down
    </p>
    <p>
     the vinegar-cruet, so as to have one hand free; "look here;
    </p>
    <p>
     are you talking about prying open any of my doors?"--
    </p>
    <p>
     and with that she seized my arm.  "What's the matter with you?
    </p>
    <p>
     What's the matter with you, shipmate?"
    </p>
    <p>
     In as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand
    </p>
    <p>
     the whole case.  Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet
    </p>
    <p>
     to one side of her nose, she ruminated for an instant;
    </p>
    <p>
     then exclaimed--"No! I haven't seen it since I put it there."
    </p>
    <p>
     Running to a little closet under the landing of the stairs, she glanced
    </p>
    <p>
     in, and returning, told me that Queequeg's harpoon was missing.
    </p>
    <p>
     "He's killed himself," she cried.  "It's unfort'nate Stiggs done
    </p>
    <p>
     over again there goes another counterpane--God pity his poor mother!--
    </p>
    <p>
     it will be the ruin of my house.  Has the poor lad a sister?
    </p>
    <p>
     Where's that girl?--there, Betty, go to Snarles the Painter,
    </p>
    <p>
     and tell him to paint me a sign, with--"no suicides permitted here,
    </p>
    <p>
     and no smoking in the parlor;"--might as well kill both
    </p>
    <p>
     birds at once.  Kill?  The Lord be merciful to his ghost!
    </p>
    <p>
     What's that noise there?  You, young man, avast there!"
    </p>
    <p>
     And running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force
    </p>
    <p>
     open the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I won't allow it; I won't have my premises spoiled.
    </p>
    <p>
     Go for the locksmith, there's one about a mile from here.  But avast!"
    </p>
    <p>
     putting her hand in her side pocket, "here's a key that'll fit, I guess;
    </p>
    <p>
     let's see."  And with that, she turned it in the lock; but alas!
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg's supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have to burst it open," said I, and was running down the entry
    </p>
    <p>
     a little, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me,
    </p>
    <p>
     again vowing I should not break down her premises; but I tore
    </p>
    <p>
     from her, and with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full
    </p>
    <p>
     against the mark.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob
    </p>
    <p>
     slamming against the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling;
    </p>
    <p>
     and there, good heavens! there sat Queequeg, altogether cool
    </p>
    <p>
     and self-collected; right in the middle of the room;
    </p>
    <p>
     squatting on his hams, and holding Yojo on top of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
     He looked neither one way nor the other way but sat like a carved
    </p>
    <p>
     image with scarce a sign of active life.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Queequeg," said I, going up to him, "Queequeg, what's
    </p>
    <p>
     the matter with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "He hain't been a sittin' so all day, has he?" said the landlady.
    </p>
    <p>
     But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him;
    </p>
    <p>
     I almost felt like pushing him over, so as to change his position,
    </p>
    <p>
     for it was almost intolerable, it seemed so painfully and
    </p>
    <p>
     unnaturally constrained; especially, as in all probability
    </p>
    <p>
     he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours,
    </p>
    <p>
     going too without his regular meals.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mrs. Hussey," said I, "he's alive at all events; so leave us,
    </p>
    <p>
     if you please, and I will see to this strange affair myself."
    </p>
    <p>
     Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail
    </p>
    <p>
     upon Queequeg to take a chair; but in vain.  There he sat;
    </p>
    <p>
     and all he could do--for all my polite arts and blandishments--
    </p>
    <p>
     he would not move a peg, nor say a single word, nor even look
    </p>
    <p>
     at me, nor notice my presence in any the slightest way.
    </p>
    <p>
     I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan;
    </p>
    <p>
     do they fast on their hams that way in his native island.
    </p>
    <p>
     It must be so; yes, it's a part of his creed, I suppose;
    </p>
    <p>
     well, then, let him rest; he'll get up sooner or later, no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
     It can't last for ever, thank God, and his Ramadan only comes
    </p>
    <p>
     once a year; and I don't believe it's very punctual then.
    </p>
    <p>
     I went down to supper.  After sitting a long time listening to the long
    </p>
    <p>
     stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage,
    </p>
    <p>
     as they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or brig,
    </p>
    <p>
     confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only);
    </p>
    <p>
     after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o'clock, I
    </p>
    <p>
     went up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg
    </p>
    <p>
     must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination.  But no;
    </p>
    <p>
     there he was just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch.
    </p>
    <p>
     I began to grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless
    </p>
    <p>
     and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams
    </p>
    <p>
     in a cold room, holding a piece of wood on his head.
    </p>
    <p>
     "For heaven's sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and have
    </p>
    <p>
     some supper.  You'll starve; you'll kill yourself, Queequeg."  But not
    </p>
    <p>
     a word did he reply.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep;
    </p>
    <p>
     and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me.
    </p>
    <p>
     But previous to turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket,
    </p>
    <p>
     and threw it over him, as it promised to be a very cold night;
    </p>
    <p>
     and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on.
    </p>
    <p>
     For some time, do all I would, I could not get into the faintest doze.
    </p>
    <p>
     I had blown out the candle; and the mere thought of Queequeg--
    </p>
    <p>
     not four feet off--sitting there in that uneasy position,
    </p>
    <p>
     stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really wretched.
    </p>
    <p>
     Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide
    </p>
    <p>
     awake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!
    </p>
    <p>
     But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till
    </p>
    <p>
     break of day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg, as if he had been screwed down to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     But as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the window,
    </p>
    <p>
     up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but with a cheerful look;
    </p>
    <p>
     limped towards me where I lay; pressed his forehead again
    </p>
    <p>
     against mine; and said his Ramadan was over.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person's religion,
    </p>
    <p>
     be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult
    </p>
    <p>
     any other person, because that other person don't believe it also.
    </p>
    <p>
     But when a man's religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive
    </p>
    <p>
     torment to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable
    </p>
    <p>
     inn to lodge in; then I think it high time to take that individual
    </p>
    <p>
     aside and argue the point with him.
    </p>
    <p>
     And just so I now did with Queequeg.  "Queequeg," said I,
    </p>
    <p>
     "get into bed now, and lie and listen to me."  I then went on,
    </p>
    <p>
     beginning with the rise and progress of the primitive religions,
    </p>
    <p>
     and coming down to the various religions of the present time,
    </p>
    <p>
     during which time I labored to show Queequeg that all
    </p>
    <p>
     these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings in cold,
    </p>
    <p>
     cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health;
    </p>
    <p>
     useless for the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws
    </p>
    <p>
     of Hygiene and common sense.  I told him, too, that he being
    </p>
    <p>
     in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage,
    </p>
    <p>
     it pained me, very badly pained me, to see him now so deplorably
    </p>
    <p>
     foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his.  Besides, argued I,
    </p>
    <p>
     fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit caves in;
    </p>
    <p>
     and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be
    </p>
    <p>
     half-starved. This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists
    </p>
    <p>
     cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters.
    </p>
    <p>
     In one word, Queequeg, said I, rather digressively;
    </p>
    <p>
     hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple-dumpling;
    </p>
    <p>
     and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias
    </p>
    <p>
     nurtured by Ramadans.
    </p>
    <p>
     I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia;
    </p>
    <p>
     expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it in.
    </p>
    <p>
     He said no; only upon one memorable occasion.  It was after a great feast
    </p>
    <p>
     given by his father the king on the gaining of a great battle wherein
    </p>
    <p>
     fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o'clock in the afternoon,
    </p>
    <p>
     and all cooked and eaten that very evening.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No more, Queequeg," said I, shuddering; "that will do;"
    </p>
    <p>
     for I knew the inferences without his further hinting them.
    </p>
    <p>
     I had seen a sailor who had visited that very island, and he told me
    </p>
    <p>
     that it was the custom, when a great battle had been gained there,
    </p>
    <p>
     to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the victor;
    </p>
    <p>
     and then, one by one, they were placed in great wooden trenchers,
    </p>
    <p>
     and garnished round like a pilau, with breadfruit and cocoanuts;
    </p>
    <p>
     and with some parsley in their mouths, were sent round with
    </p>
    <p>
     the victor's compliments to all his friends, just as though
    </p>
    <p>
     these presents were so many Christmas turkeys.
    </p>
    <p>
     After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made
    </p>
    <p>
     much impression upon Queequeg.  Because, in the first place,
    </p>
    <p>
     he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject,
    </p>
    <p>
     unless considered from his own point of view; and, in the
    </p>
    <p>
     second place, he did not more than one third understand me,
    </p>
    <p>
     couch my ideas simply as I would; and, finally, he no doubt thought
    </p>
    <p>
     he knew a good deal more about the true religion than I did.
    </p>
    <p>
     He looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion,
    </p>
    <p>
     as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young
    </p>
    <p>
     man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety.
    </p>
    <p>
     At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty
    </p>
    <p>
     breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not make
    </p>
    <p>
     much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the Pequod,
    </p>
    <p>
     sauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut bones.

     CHAPTER 18
    </head>
    <p>
     His Mark
    </p>
    <p>
     As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship,
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice
    </p>
    <p>
     loudly hailed us from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected
    </p>
    <p>
     my friend was a cannibal, and furthermore announcing that he let
    </p>
    <p>
     no cannibals on board that craft, unless they previously
    </p>
    <p>
     produced their papers.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?" said I, now jumping
    </p>
    <p>
     on the bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I mean," he replied, "he must show his papers."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from
    </p>
    <p>
     behind Peleg's, out of the wigwam.  "He must show that he's converted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Son of darkness," he added, turning to Queequeg, "art thou at present
    </p>
    <p>
     in communion with any Christian church?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why," said I, "he's a member of the first Congregational Church."
    </p>
    <p>
     Here be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket
    </p>
    <p>
     ships at last come to be converted into the churches.
    </p>
    <p>
     "First Congregational Church," cried Bildad, "what! that worships
    </p>
    <p>
     in Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman's meeting-house?" and so saying,
    </p>
    <p>
     taking out his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow
    </p>
    <p>
     bandana handkerchief, and putting them on very carefully,
    </p>
    <p>
     came out of the wigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks,
    </p>
    <p>
     took a good long look at Queequeg.
    </p>
    <p>
     "How long hath he been a member?" he then said, turning to me;
    </p>
    <p>
     "not very long, I rather guess, young man."
    </p>
    <p>
     "No," said Peleg, "and he hasn't been baptized right either,
    </p>
    <p>
     or it would have washed some of that devil's blue off his face."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do tell, now," cried Bildad, "is this Philistine a regular member
    </p>
    <p>
     of Deacon Deuteronomy's meeting?  I never saw him going there,
    </p>
    <p>
     and I pass it every Lord's day."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting,"
    </p>
    <p>
     said I; "all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the
    </p>
    <p>
     First Congregational Church.  He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Young man," said Bildad sternly, "thou art skylarking with me--
    </p>
    <p>
     explain thyself, thou young Hittite.  What church dost thee
    </p>
    <p>
     mean? answer me."
    </p>
    <p>
     Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied, "I mean, sir, the same
    </p>
    <p>
     ancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there,
    </p>
    <p>
     and Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother's son and soul
    </p>
    <p>
     of us belong; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this
    </p>
    <p>
     whole worshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us
    </p>
    <p>
     cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief;
    </p>
    <p>
     in that we all join hands."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Splice, thou mean'st splice hands," cried Peleg, drawing nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Young man, you'd better ship for a missionary,
    </p>
    <p>
     instead of a fore-mast hand; I never heard a better sermon.
    </p>
    <p>
     Deacon Deuteronomy--why Father Mapple himself couldn't beat it,
    </p>
    <p>
     and he's reckoned something.  Come aboard, come aboard:
    </p>
    <p>
     never mind about the papers.  I say, tell Quohog there--
    </p>
    <p>
     what's that you call him? tell Quohog to step along.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the great anchor, what a harpoon he's got there! looks
    </p>
    <p>
     like good stuff that; and he handles it about right.
    </p>
    <p>
     I say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did you ever stand
    </p>
    <p>
     in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a fish?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats hanging
    </p>
    <p>
     to the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his harpoon,
    </p>
    <p>
     cried out in some such way as this:--
    </p>
    <p>
     "Cap'ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere?  You see him? well,
    </p>
    <p>
     spose him one whale eye, well, den!" and taking sharp aim at it,
    </p>
    <p>
     he darted the iron right over old Bildad's broad brim, clean across
    </p>
    <p>
     the ship's decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now," said Queequeg, quietly, hauling in the line, "spos-ee him
    </p>
    <p>
     whale-e eye; why, dad whale dead."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Quick, Bildad," said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close
    </p>
    <p>
     vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin gangway.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship's papers.
    </p>
    <p>
     We must have Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats.
    </p>
    <p>
     Look ye, Quohog, we'll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that's more
    </p>
    <p>
     than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket."
    </p>
    <p>
     So down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon
    </p>
    <p>
     enrolled among the same ship's company to which I myself belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
     When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready
    </p>
    <p>
     for signing, he turned to me and said, "I guess, Quohog there don't
    </p>
    <p>
     know how to write, does he?  I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign
    </p>
    <p>
     thy name or make thy mark?
    </p>
    <p>
     But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken
    </p>
    <p>
     part in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking
    </p>
    <p>
     the offered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place,
    </p>
    <p>
     an exact counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed
    </p>
    <p>
     upon his arm; so that through Captain Peleg's obstinate mistake
    </p>
    <p>
     touching his appellative, it stood something like this:--
    </p>
    <p>
     Quohog.
    </p>
    <p>
     his X mark.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg,
    </p>
    <p>
     and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets
    </p>
    <p>
     of his broadskirted drab coat took out a bundle of tracts,
    </p>
    <p>
     and selecting one entitled "The Latter Day Coming; or No Time
    </p>
    <p>
     to Lose," placed it in Queequeg's hands, and then grasping them
    </p>
    <p>
     and the book with both his, looked earnestly into his eyes, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
     "Son of darkness, I must do my duty by thee; I am part owner
    </p>
    <p>
     of this ship, and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew;
    </p>
    <p>
     if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways, which I sadly fear,
    </p>
    <p>
     I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial bondsman.
    </p>
    <p>
     Spurn the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from the wrath
    </p>
    <p>
     to come; mind thine eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer
    </p>
    <p>
     clear of the fiery pit!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad's language,
    </p>
    <p>
     heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our harpooneer,
    </p>
    <p>
     cried Peleg.  "Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers--
    </p>
    <p>
     it takes the shark out of 'em; no harpooneer is worth a straw
    </p>
    <p>
     who aint pretty sharkish.  There was young Nat Swaine,
    </p>
    <p>
     once the bravest boat-header out of all Nantucket and
    </p>
    <p>
     the Vineyard; he joined the meeting, and never came to good.
    </p>
    <p>
     He got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he shrinked
    </p>
    <p>
     and sheered away from whales, for fear of after-claps, in case
    </p>
    <p>
     he got stove and went to Davy Jones."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Peleg!  Peleg!" said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands,
    </p>
    <p>
     "thou thyself, as I myself, hast seen many a perilous time;
    </p>
    <p>
     thou knowest, Peleg, what it is to have the fear of death;
    </p>
    <p>
     how, then, can'st thou prate in this ungodly guise.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg.  Tell me, when this same Pequod
    </p>
    <p>
     here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on Japan,
    </p>
    <p>
     that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab,
    </p>
    <p>
     did'st thou not think of Death and the Judgment then?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hear him, hear him now," cried Peleg, marching across the cabin,
    </p>
    <p>
     and thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,--"hear him, all of ye.
    </p>
    <p>
     Think of that!  When every moment we thought the ship would sink!
    </p>
    <p>
     Death and the Judgment then?  What?  With all three masts making such
    </p>
    <p>
     an everlasting thundering against the side; and every sea breaking
    </p>
    <p>
     over us, fore and aft.  Think of Death and the Judgment then?
    </p>
    <p>
     No! no time to think about Death then.  Life was what Captain Ahab
    </p>
    <p>
     and I was thinking of; and how to save all hands how to rig jury-masts
    </p>
    <p>
     how to get into the nearest port; that was what I was thinking of."
    </p>
    <p>
     Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck,
    </p>
    <p>
     where we followed him.  There he stood, very quietly overlooking
    </p>
    <p>
     some sailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now and then he stooped to pick up a patch, or save an end
    </p>
    <p>
     of tarred twine, which otherwise might have been wasted.

     CHAPTER 19
    </head>
    <p>
     The Prophet
    </p>
    <p>
     "Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were sauntering away
    </p>
    <p>
     from the water, for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts,
    </p>
    <p>
     when the above words were put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us,
    </p>
    <p>
     levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers;
    </p>
    <p>
     a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck.  A confluent
    </p>
    <p>
     smallpox had in all directions flowed over his face, and left it
    </p>
    <p>
     like the complicated ribbed bed of a torrent, when the rushing
    </p>
    <p>
     waters have been dried up.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have ye shipped in her?" he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose," said I, trying to gain
    </p>
    <p>
     a little more time for an uninterrupted look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, the Pequod--that ship there," he said, drawing back his whole
    </p>
    <p>
     arm and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him-, with the fixed
    </p>
    <p>
     bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," said I, "we have just signed the articles."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Anything down there about your souls?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "About what?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, perhaps you hav'n't got any," he said quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No matter though, I know many chaps that hav'n't got any,--
    </p>
    <p>
     good luck to 'em; and they are all the better off for it.
    </p>
    <p>
     A soul's a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What are you jabbering about, shipmate?" said I.
    </p>
    <p>
     "He's got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies
    </p>
    <p>
     of that sort in other chaps," abruptly said the stranger,
    </p>
    <p>
     placing a nervous emphasis upon the word he.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Queequeg," said I, "let's go; this fellow has broken loose
    </p>
    <p>
     from somewhere; he's talking about something and somebody
    </p>
    <p>
     we don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Stop!" cried the stranger.  "Ye said true--ye hav'n't seen
    </p>
    <p>
     Old Thunder yet, have ye?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Who's Old Thunder?" said I, again riveted with the insane earnestness
    </p>
    <p>
     of his manner.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Captain Ahab."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ye hav'n't seen him yet, have ye?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, we hav'n't. He's sick they say, but is getting better,
    </p>
    <p>
     and will be all right again before long."
    </p>
    <p>
     "All right again before long!" laughed the stranger, with a solemnly
    </p>
    <p>
     derisive sort of laugh.  "Look ye; when Captain Ahab is all right,
    </p>
    <p>
     then this left arm of mine will be all right; not before."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What do you know about him?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "What did they tell you about him?  Say that!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "They didn't tell much of anything about him; only I've heard that he's
    </p>
    <p>
     a good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew."
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's true, that's true--yes, both true enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     But you must jump when he gives an order.  Step and growl;
    </p>
    <p>
     growl and go--that's the word with Captain Ahab.  But nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     about that thing that happened to him off Cape Horn, long ago,
    </p>
    <p>
     when he lay like dead for three days and nights; nothing about
    </p>
    <p>
     that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard afore the altar in Santa?--
    </p>
    <p>
     heard nothing about that, eh?  Nothing about the silver calabash
    </p>
    <p>
     he spat into?  And nothing about his losing his leg last voyage,
    </p>
    <p>
     according to the prophecy.  Didn't ye hear a word about them
    </p>
    <p>
     matters and something more, eh?  No, I don't think ye did;
    </p>
    <p>
     how could ye?  Who knows it?  Not all Nantucket, I guess.
    </p>
    <p>
     But hows'ever, mayhap, ye've heard tell about the leg,
    </p>
    <p>
     and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of that, I dare say.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, yes, that every one knows a'most--I mean they know he's
    </p>
    <p>
     only one leg; and that a parmacetti took the other off."
    </p>
    <p>
     "My friend," said I, "what all this gibberish of yours
    </p>
    <p>
     is about, I don't know, and I don't much care; for it seems
    </p>
    <p>
     to me that you must be a little damaged in the head.
    </p>
    <p>
     But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab, of that ship there,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know all about the loss
    </p>
    <p>
     of his leg."
    </p>
    <p>
     "All about it, eh--sure you do? all?
    </p>
    <p>
     "Pretty sure."
    </p>
    <p>
     With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like
    </p>
    <p>
     stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting
    </p>
    <p>
     a little, turned and said:--"Ye've shipped, have ye?  Names down on
    </p>
    <p>
     the papers?  Well, well, what's signed, is signed; and what's to be,
    </p>
    <p>
     will be; and then again, perhaps it won't be, after all.  Any how,
    </p>
    <p>
     it's all fixed and arranged a'ready; and some sailors or other must go
    </p>
    <p>
     with him, I suppose; as well these as any other men, God pity 'em!
    </p>
    <p>
     Morning to ye, shipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye;
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm sorry I stopped ye."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Look here, friend," said I, "if you have anything important to tell us,
    </p>
    <p>
     out with it; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you are mistaken
    </p>
    <p>
     in your game; that's all I have to say."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And it's said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up
    </p>
    <p>
     that way; you are just the man for him--the likes of ye.
    </p>
    <p>
     Morning to ye, shipmates, morning!  Oh! when ye get there,
    </p>
    <p>
     tell 'em I've concluded not to make one of 'em."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ah, my dear fellow, you can't fool us that way--you can't fool us.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had
    </p>
    <p>
     a great secret in him."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Morning to ye, shipmates, morning."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Morning it is," said I. "Come along, Queequeg, let's leave this
    </p>
    <p>
     crazy man.  But stop, tell me your name, will you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Elijah."
    </p>
    <p>
     Elijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting,
    </p>
    <p>
     after each other's fashion, upon this ragged old sailor;
    </p>
    <p>
     and agreed that he was nothing but a humbug, trying to be a bugbear.
    </p>
    <p>
     But we had not gone perhaps above a hundred yards, when chancing
    </p>
    <p>
     to turn a corner, and looking back as I did so, who should be seen
    </p>
    <p>
     but Elijah following us, though at a distance.  Somehow, the sight
    </p>
    <p>
     of him struck me so, that I said nothing to Queequeg of his
    </p>
    <p>
     being behind, but passed on with my comrade, anxious to see
    </p>
    <p>
     whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did.
    </p>
    <p>
     He did; and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us,
    </p>
    <p>
     but with what intent I could not for the life of me imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
     This circumstance, coupled with his ambiguous, half-hinting,
    </p>
    <p>
     half-revealing, shrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all
    </p>
    <p>
     kinds of vague wonderments and half-apprehensions, and all
    </p>
    <p>
     connected with the Pequod; and Captain Ahab; and the leg
    </p>
    <p>
     he had lost; and the Cape Horn fit; and the silver calabash;
    </p>
    <p>
     and what Captain Peleg had said of him, when I left the ship
    </p>
    <p>
     the day previous; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig;
    </p>
    <p>
     and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail; and a hundred
    </p>
    <p>
     other shadowy things.
    </p>
    <p>
     I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was
    </p>
    <p>
     really dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way
    </p>
    <p>
     with Queequeg, and on that side of it retraced our steps.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Elijah passed on, without seeming to notice us.
    </p>
    <p>
     This relieved me; and once more, and finally as it seemed to me,
    </p>
    <p>
     I pronounced him in my heart, a humbug.

     CHAPTER 20
    </head>
    <p>
     All Astir
    </p>
    <p>
     A day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard
    </p>
    <p>
     the Pequod.  Not only were the old sails being mended, but new sails
    </p>
    <p>
     were coming on board, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging;
    </p>
    <p>
     in short, everything betokened that the ship's preparations were
    </p>
    <p>
     hurrying to a close.  Captain Peleg seldom or never went ashore,
    </p>
    <p>
     but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands:
    </p>
    <p>
     Bildad did all the purchasing and providing at the stores;
    </p>
    <p>
     and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were working
    </p>
    <p>
     till long after night-fall.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the day following Queequeg's signing the articles,
    </p>
    <p>
     word was given at all the inns where the ship's company
    </p>
    <p>
     were stopping, that their chests must be on board before night,
    </p>
    <p>
     for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing.
    </p>
    <p>
     So Queequeg and I got down our traps, resolving, however, to sleep
    </p>
    <p>
     ashore till the last.  But it seems they always give very long
    </p>
    <p>
     notice in these cases, and the ship did not sail for several days.
    </p>
    <p>
     But no wonder; there was a good deal to be done, and there is
    </p>
    <p>
     no telling how many things to be thought of, before the Pequod
    </p>
    <p>
     was fully equipped.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every one knows what a multitude of things--beds, sauce-pans, knives
    </p>
    <p>
     and forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not,
    </p>
    <p>
     are indispensable to the business of housekeeping.  Just so with whaling,
    </p>
    <p>
     which necessitates a three-years' housekeeping upon the wide ocean,
    </p>
    <p>
     far from all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers.
    </p>
    <p>
     And though this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means
    </p>
    <p>
     to the same extent as with whalemen.  For besides the great length
    </p>
    <p>
     of the whaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution
    </p>
    <p>
     of the fishery, and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote
    </p>
    <p>
     harbors usually frequented, it must be remembered, that of all ships,
    </p>
    <p>
     whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds,
    </p>
    <p>
     and especially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon
    </p>
    <p>
     which the success of the voyage most depends.  Hence, the spare boats,
    </p>
    <p>
     spare spars, and spare lines and harpoons, and spare everythings,
    </p>
    <p>
     almost, but a spare Captain and duplicate ship.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Pequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef,
    </p>
    <p>
     bread, water, fuel, and iron hoops and staves.  But, as before hinted,
    </p>
    <p>
     for some time there was a continual fetching and carrying on board
    </p>
    <p>
     of divers odds and ends of things, both large and small.
    </p>
    <p>
     Chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was
    </p>
    <p>
     Captain Bildad's sister, a lean old lady of a most determined
    </p>
    <p>
     and indefatigable spirit, but withal very kindhearted, who seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     resolved that, if she could help it, nothing should be found
    </p>
    <p>
     wanting in the Pequod, after once fairly getting to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     At one time she would come on board with a jar of pickles
    </p>
    <p>
     for the steward's pantry; another time with a bunch of
    </p>
    <p>
     quills for the chief mate's desk, where he kept his log;
    </p>
    <p>
     a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of some one's
    </p>
    <p>
     rheumatic back.  Never did any woman better deserve her name,
    </p>
    <p>
     which was Charity--Aunt Charity, as everybody called her.
    </p>
    <p>
     And like a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity
    </p>
    <p>
     bustle about hither and thither, ready to turn her hand and heart
    </p>
    <p>
     to anything that promised to yield safety, comfort, and consolation
    </p>
    <p>
     to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother Bildad
    </p>
    <p>
     was concerned, and in which she herself owned a score or two
    </p>
    <p>
     of well-saved dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress
    </p>
    <p>
     coming on board, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle
    </p>
    <p>
     in one hand, and a still longer whaling lance in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor was Bildad himself nor Captain Peleg at all backward.
    </p>
    <p>
     As for Bildad, he carried about with him a long list
    </p>
    <p>
     of the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival,
    </p>
    <p>
     down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every once in a while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den,
    </p>
    <p>
     roaring at the men down the hatchways, roaring up to the
    </p>
    <p>
     riggers at the mast-head, and then concluded by roaring back
    </p>
    <p>
     into his wigwam.
    </p>
    <p>
     During these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited
    </p>
    <p>
     the craft, and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was,
    </p>
    <p>
     and when he was going to come on board his ship.  To these questions
    </p>
    <p>
     they would answer, that he was getting better and better, and was
    </p>
    <p>
     expected aboard every day; meantime, the two Captains, Peleg and Bildad,
    </p>
    <p>
     could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
     If I had been downright honest with myself, I would have seen
    </p>
    <p>
     very plainly in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed
    </p>
    <p>
     this way to so long a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man
    </p>
    <p>
     who was to be the absolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship
    </p>
    <p>
     sailed out upon the open sea.  But when a man suspects any wrong,
    </p>
    <p>
     it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter,
    </p>
    <p>
     he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     And much this way it was with me.  I said nothing, and tried
    </p>
    <p>
     to think nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     At last it was given out that some time next day the ship
    </p>
    <p>
     would certainly sail.  So next morning, Queequeg and I took
    </p>
    <p>
     a very early start.

     CHAPTER 21
    </head>
    <p>
     Going Aboard
    </p>
    <p>
     It was nearly six o'clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn,
    </p>
    <p>
     when we drew nigh the wharf.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right,"
    </p>
    <p>
     said I to Queequeg, "it can't be shadows; she's off by sunrise,
    </p>
    <p>
     I guess; come on!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Avast!" cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming
    </p>
    <p>
     close behind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then
    </p>
    <p>
     insinuating himself between us, stood stooping forward a little,
    </p>
    <p>
     in the uncertain twilight, strangely peering from Queequeg to me.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was Elijah.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Going aboard?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hands off, will you," said I.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Lookee here," said Queequeg, shaking himself, "go 'way!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aint going aboard, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, we are," said I, "but what business is that of yours?
    </p>
    <p>
     Do you know, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, no, no; I wasn't aware of that," said Elijah, slowly and wonderingly
    </p>
    <p>
     looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable glances.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Elijah," said I, "you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing.
    </p>
    <p>
     We are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer
    </p>
    <p>
     not to be detained."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ye be, be ye?  Coming back afore breakfast?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "He's cracked, Queequeg," said I, "come on."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Holloa!" cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed
    </p>
    <p>
     a few paces.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Never mind him," said I, "Queequeg, come on."
    </p>
    <p>
     But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand
    </p>
    <p>
     on my shoulder, said--"Did ye see anything looking like men
    </p>
    <p>
     going towards that ship a while ago?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, "Yes, I
    </p>
    <p>
     thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be sure."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Very dim, very dim," said Elijah.  "Morning to ye."
    </p>
    <p>
     Once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us;
    </p>
    <p>
     and touching my shoulder again, said, "See if you can find
    </p>
    <p>
     'em now, will ye?
    </p>
    <p>
     "Find who?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Morning to ye! morning to ye!" he rejoined, again moving off.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh!  I was going to warn ye against--but never mind, never mind--
    </p>
    <p>
     it's all one, all in the family too;--sharp frost this morning,
    </p>
    <p>
     ain't it?  Good-bye to ye.  Shan't see ye again very soon, I guess;
    </p>
    <p>
     unless it's before the Grand Jury."  And with these cracked words
    </p>
    <p>
     he finally departed, leaving me, for the moment, in no small
    </p>
    <p>
     wonderment at his frantic impudence.
    </p>
    <p>
     At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in
    </p>
    <p>
     profound quiet, not a soul moving.  The cabin entrance was locked within;
    </p>
    <p>
     the hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging.
    </p>
    <p>
     Going forward to the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seeing a light, we went down, and found only an old rigger there,
    </p>
    <p>
     wrapped in a tattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole length upon
    </p>
    <p>
     two chests, his face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms.
    </p>
    <p>
     The profoundest slumber slept upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?"
    </p>
    <p>
     said I, looking dubiously at the sleeper.  But it seemed that,
    </p>
    <p>
     when on the wharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to;
    </p>
    <p>
     hence I would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in
    </p>
    <p>
     that matter, were it not for Elijah's otherwise inexplicable question.
    </p>
    <p>
     But I beat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper,
    </p>
    <p>
     jocularly hinted to Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up
    </p>
    <p>
     with the body; telling him to establish himself accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     He put his hand upon the sleeper's rear, as though feeling if it
    </p>
    <p>
     was soft enough; and then, without more ado, sat quietly down there.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Gracious!  Queequeg, don't sit there," said I.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh; perry dood seat," said Queequeg, "my country way;
    </p>
    <p>
     won't hurt him face."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Face!" said I, "call that his face? very benevolent countenance then;
    </p>
    <p>
     but how hard he breathes, he's heaving himself; get off,
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg, you are heavy, it's grinding the face of the poor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Get off, Queequeg!  Look, he'll twitch you off soon.
    </p>
    <p>
     I wonder he don't wake."
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper,
    </p>
    <p>
     and lighted his tomahawk pipe.  I sat at the feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     We kept the pipe passing over the sleeper, from one to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meanwhile, upon questioning him in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave
    </p>
    <p>
     me to understand that, in his land, owing to the absence of settees
    </p>
    <p>
     and sofas of all sorts, the king, chiefs, and great people generally,
    </p>
    <p>
     were in the custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans;
    </p>
    <p>
     and to furnish a house comfortably in that respect, you had only
    </p>
    <p>
     to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay them round in the piers
    </p>
    <p>
     and alcoves.  Besides, it was very convenient on an excursion;
    </p>
    <p>
     much better than those garden-chairs which are convertible into
    </p>
    <p>
     walking sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant,
    </p>
    <p>
     and desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree,
    </p>
    <p>
     perhaps in some damp marshy place.
    </p>
    <p>
     While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk
    </p>
    <p>
     from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper's head.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What's that for, Queequeg?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!
    </p>
    <p>
     He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe
    </p>
    <p>
     which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed
    </p>
    <p>
     his soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger.
    </p>
    <p>
     The strong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole,
    </p>
    <p>
     it began to tell upon him.  He breathed with a sort of muffledness;
    </p>
    <p>
     then seemed troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice;
    </p>
    <p>
     then sat up and rubbed his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Holloa!" he breathed at last, "who be ye smokers?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Shipped men," answered I, "when does she sail?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye?  She sails to-day. The Captain
    </p>
    <p>
     came aboard last night."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What Captain?--Ahab?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Who but him indeed?"
    </p>
    <p>
     I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab,
    </p>
    <p>
     when we heard a noise on deck.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Holloa!  Starbuck's astir," said the rigger.  "He's a lively chief
    </p>
    <p>
     mate that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn to."
    </p>
    <p>
     And so saying he went on deck, and we followed.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was now clear sunrise.  Soon the crew came on board in twos and threes;
    </p>
    <p>
     the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively engaged;
    </p>
    <p>
     and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various last
    </p>
    <p>
     things on board.  Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly enshrined
    </p>
    <p>
     within his cabin.

     CHAPTER 22
    </head>
    <p>
     Merry Christmas
    </p>
    <p>
     At length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship's riggers,
    </p>
    <p>
     and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and after the
    </p>
    <p>
     ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with her last gift--
    </p>
    <p>
     a nightcap for Stubb, the second mate, her brother-in-law, and a spare
    </p>
    <p>
     Bible for the steward--after all this, the two Captains, Peleg and Bildad,
    </p>
    <p>
     issued from the cabin, and turning to the chief mate, Peleg said:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right?
    </p>
    <p>
     Captain Ahab is all ready--just spoke to him--nothing more
    </p>
    <p>
     to be got from shore, eh?  Well, call all hands, then.
    </p>
    <p>
     Muster 'em aft here--blast 'em!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg," said Bildad,
    </p>
    <p>
     "but away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding."
    </p>
    <p>
     How now!  Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage,
    </p>
    <p>
     Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on
    </p>
    <p>
     the quarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     as well as to all appearances in port.  And, as for Captain Ahab,
    </p>
    <p>
     no sign of him was yet to be seen; Only, they said he was in the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then, the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary
    </p>
    <p>
     in getting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Indeed, as that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot's;
    </p>
    <p>
     and as he was not yet completely recovered--so they said--therefore,
    </p>
    <p>
     Captain Ahab stayed below.  And all this seemed natural enough;
    </p>
    <p>
     especially as in the merchant service many captains never show
    </p>
    <p>
     themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the anchor,
    </p>
    <p>
     but remain over the cabin table, having a farewell merry-making with
    </p>
    <p>
     their shore friends, before they quit the ship for good with the pilot.
    </p>
    <p>
     But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain Peleg
    </p>
    <p>
     was now all alive.  He seemed to do most of the talking and commanding,
    </p>
    <p>
     and not Bildad.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aft here, ye sons of bachelors," he cried, as the sailors lingered
    </p>
    <p>
     at the main-mast. "Mr. Starbuck, drive aft."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Strike the tent there!"--was the next order.  As I hinted before,
    </p>
    <p>
     this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port;
    </p>
    <p>
     and on board the Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike
    </p>
    <p>
     the tent was well known to be the next thing to heaving
    </p>
    <p>
     up the anchor.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Man the capstan!  Blood and thunder!--jump!"--was the next command,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the crew sprang for the handspikes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied
    </p>
    <p>
     by the pilot is the forward part of the ship.  And here Bildad,
    </p>
    <p>
     who, with Peleg, be it known, in addition to his other offices,
    </p>
    <p>
     was one of the licensed pilots of the port--he being suspected
    </p>
    <p>
     to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the Nantucket
    </p>
    <p>
     pilot-fee to all the ships he was concerned in, for he never
    </p>
    <p>
     piloted any other craft--Bildad, I say, might now be seen actively
    </p>
    <p>
     engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor,
    </p>
    <p>
     and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody,
    </p>
    <p>
     to cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some sort
    </p>
    <p>
     of a chorus about the girls in Booble Alley, with hearty good will.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad had told them
    </p>
    <p>
     that no profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod,
    </p>
    <p>
     particularly in getting under weigh; and Charity, his sister,
    </p>
    <p>
     had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each seaman's berth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg
    </p>
    <p>
     ripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner.
    </p>
    <p>
     I almost thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could
    </p>
    <p>
     be got up; involuntarily I paused on my handspike, and told
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg to do the same, thinking of the perils we both ran,
    </p>
    <p>
     in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot.
    </p>
    <p>
     I was comforting myself, however, with the thought that in pious
    </p>
    <p>
     Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred
    </p>
    <p>
     and seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear,
    </p>
    <p>
     and turning round, was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg
    </p>
    <p>
     in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was my first kick.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?" he roared.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Spring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone!  Why don't
    </p>
    <p>
     ye spring, I say, all of ye--spring!  Quohog! spring, thou chap with
    </p>
    <p>
     the red whiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants.
    </p>
    <p>
     Spring, I say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!"  And so saying,
    </p>
    <p>
     he moved along the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely,
    </p>
    <p>
     while imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thinks I, Captain Peleg must have been drinking something to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
     At last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged
    </p>
    <p>
     into night, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean,
    </p>
    <p>
     whose freezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor.
    </p>
    <p>
     The long rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight;
    </p>
    <p>
     and like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving
    </p>
    <p>
     icicles depended from the bows.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon,
    </p>
    <p>
     as the old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering
    </p>
    <p>
     frost all over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang,
    </p>
    <p>
     his steady notes were heard,--
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,
    </p>
    <p>
     Stand dressed in living green.
    </p>
    <p>
     So to the Jews old Canaan stood,
    </p>
    <p>
     While Jordan rolled between."
    </p>
    <p>
     Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were full of hope and fruition.  Spite of this frigid winter night
    </p>
    <p>
     in the boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket,
    </p>
    <p>
     there was yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store;
    </p>
    <p>
     and meads and glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up
    </p>
    <p>
     by the spring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.
    </p>
    <p>
     At last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were
    </p>
    <p>
     needed no longer.  The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us
    </p>
    <p>
     began ranging alongside.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were
    </p>
    <p>
     affected at this juncture, especially Captain Bildad.  For loath
    </p>
    <p>
     to depart, yet; very loath to leave, for good, a ship bound
    </p>
    <p>
     on so long and perilous a voyage--beyond both stormy Capes;
    </p>
    <p>
     a ship in which some thousands of his hardearned dollars
    </p>
    <p>
     were invested; a ship, in which an old shipmate sailed as captain;
    </p>
    <p>
     a man almost as old as he, once more starting to encounter
    </p>
    <p>
     all the terrors of the pitiless jaw; loath to say good-bye
    </p>
    <p>
     to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him,--
    </p>
    <p>
     poor old Bildad lingered long; paced the deck with anxious strides;
    </p>
    <p>
     ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there;
    </p>
    <p>
     again came on deck, and looked to windward; looked towards
    </p>
    <p>
     the wide and endless waters, only bounded by the far-off unseen
    </p>
    <p>
     Eastern Continents; looked towards the land; looked aloft;
    </p>
    <p>
     looked right and left; looked everywhere and nowhere;
    </p>
    <p>
     and at last, mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin,
    </p>
    <p>
     convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand, and holding up
    </p>
    <p>
     a lantern, for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face,
    </p>
    <p>
     as much as to say, "Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can stand it;
    </p>
    <p>
     yes, I can."
    </p>
    <p>
     As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher;
    </p>
    <p>
     but for all his philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye,
    </p>
    <p>
     when the lantern came too near.  And he, too, did not a little
    </p>
    <p>
     run from the cabin to deck--now a word below, and now a word
    </p>
    <p>
     with Starbuck, the chief mate.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look
    </p>
    <p>
     about him,--"Captain Bildad--come, old shipmate, we must go.
    </p>
    <p>
     Back the mainyard there!  Boat ahoy!  Stand by to come
    </p>
    <p>
     close alongside, now!  Careful, careful!--come, Bildad, boy--
    </p>
    <p>
     say your last.  Luck to ye, Starbuck--luck to ye, Mr. Stubb--
    </p>
    <p>
     luck to ye, Mr. Flask--good-bye and good luck to ye all--
    </p>
    <p>
     and this day three years I'll have a hot supper smoking for ye
    </p>
    <p>
     in old Nantucket.  Hurrah and away!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men," murmured old Bildad,
    </p>
    <p>
     almost incoherently.  "I hope ye'll have fine weather now, so that
    </p>
    <p>
     Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye--a pleasant sun is all he needs,
    </p>
    <p>
     and ye'll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go.  Be careful
    </p>
    <p>
     in the hunt, ye mates.  Don't stave the boats needlessly, ye harpooneers;
    </p>
    <p>
     good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent within the year.
    </p>
    <p>
     Don't forget your prayers, either.  Mr. Starbuck, mind that cooper don't
    </p>
    <p>
     waste the spare staves.  Oh! the sail-needles are in the green locker.
    </p>
    <p>
     Don't whale it too much a' Lord's days, men; but don't miss a fair
    </p>
    <p>
     chance either, that's rejecting Heaven's good gifts.  Have an eye
    </p>
    <p>
     to the molasses tierce, Mr. Stubb; it was a little leaky, I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     If ye touch at the islands, Mr. Flask, beware of fornication.
    </p>
    <p>
     Good-bye, good-bye! Don't keep that cheese too long down in the hold,
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Starbuck; it'll spoil.  Be careful with the butter--twenty cents
    </p>
    <p>
     the pound it was, and mind ye, if--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come, come, Captain Bildad; stop palavering,--away!" and with that,
    </p>
    <p>
     Peleg hurried him over the side, and both dropt into the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ship and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between;
    </p>
    <p>
     a screaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled;
    </p>
    <p>
     we gave three heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like fate
    </p>
    <p>
     into the lone Atlantic.

    <p>
     The Lee Shore
    </p>
    <p>
     Some chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall,
    </p>
    <p>
     newlanded mariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
     When on that shivering winter's night, the Pequod thrust her vindictive
    </p>
    <p>
     bows into the cold malicious waves, who should I see standing at her
    </p>
    <p>
     helm but Bulkington!  I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the man, who in mid-winter just landed from a four years'
    </p>
    <p>
     dangerous voyage, could so unrestingly push off again for still
    </p>
    <p>
     another tempestuous term.  The land seemed scorching to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable; deep memories
    </p>
    <p>
     yield no epitaphs; this six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave
    </p>
    <p>
     of Bulkington.  Let me only say that it fared with him as with
    </p>
    <p>
     the storm-tossed ship, that miserably drives along the leeward land.
    </p>
    <p>
     The port would fain give succor; the port is pitiful;
    </p>
    <p>
     in the port is safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper,
    </p>
    <p>
     warm blankets, friends, all that's kind to our mortalities.
    </p>
    <p>
     But in that gale, the port, the land, is that ship's direst jeopardy;
    </p>
    <p>
     she must fly all hospitality; one touch of land, though it
    </p>
    <p>
     but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and through.
    </p>
    <p>
     With all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing,
    </p>
    <p>
     fights 'gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward;
    </p>
    <p>
     seeks all the lashed sea's landlessness again; for refuge's sake
    </p>
    <p>
     forlornly rushing into peril; her only friend her bitterest foe!
    </p>
    <p>
     Know ye now, Bulkington?  Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally
    </p>
    <p>
     intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid
    </p>
    <p>
     effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea;
    </p>
    <p>
     while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on
    </p>
    <p>
     the treacherous, slavish shore?
    </p>
    <p>
     But as in landlessness alone resides the highest truth, shoreless,
    </p>
    <p>
     indefinite as God--so better is it to perish in that howling infinite,
    </p>
    <p>
     than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety!
    </p>
    <p>
     For worm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land!
    </p>
    <p>
     Terrors of the terrible! is all this agony so vain?
    </p>
    <p>
     Take heart, take heart, O Bulkington!  Bear thee grimly, demigod!
    </p>
    <p>
     Up from the spray of thy ocean-perishing--straight up,
    </p>
    <p>
     leaps thy apotheosis!

     CHAPTER 24
    </head>
    <p>
     The Advocate
    </p>
    <p>
     As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling;
    </p>
    <p>
     and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among
    </p>
    <p>
     landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit; therefore, I am
    </p>
    <p>
     all anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of the injustice hereby done
    </p>
    <p>
     to us hunters of whales.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish
    </p>
    <p>
     the fact, that among people at large, the business of whaling is not
    </p>
    <p>
     accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions.
    </p>
    <p>
     If a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society,
    </p>
    <p>
     it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits, were he
    </p>
    <p>
     presented to the company as a harpooneer, say; and if in emulation of the
    </p>
    <p>
     naval officers he should append the initials S.W.F. (Sperm Whale Fishery)
    </p>
    <p>
     to his visiting card, such a procedure would be deemed preeminently
    </p>
    <p>
     presuming and ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
     Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring
    </p>
    <p>
     us whalemen, is this:  they think that, at best, our vocation
    </p>
    <p>
     amounts to a butchering sort of business; and that when actively
    </p>
    <p>
     engaged therein, we are surrounded by all manner of defilements.
    </p>
    <p>
     Butchers we are, that is true.  But butchers, also, and butchers
    </p>
    <p>
     of the bloodiest badge have been all Martial Commanders whom
    </p>
    <p>
     the world invariably delights to honor.  And as for the matter
    </p>
    <p>
     of the alleged uncleanliness of our business, ye shall soon be
    </p>
    <p>
     initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown,
    </p>
    <p>
     and which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm
    </p>
    <p>
     whale-ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth.
    </p>
    <p>
     But even granting the charge in question to be true; what disordered
    </p>
    <p>
     slippery decks of a whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable
    </p>
    <p>
     carrion of those battle-fields from which so many soldiers return
    </p>
    <p>
     to drink in all ladies' plaudits?  And if the idea of peril
    </p>
    <p>
     so much enhances the popular conceit of the soldier's profession;
    </p>
    <p>
     let me assure ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up
    </p>
    <p>
     to a battery, would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm
    </p>
    <p>
     whale's vast tail, fanning into eddies the air over his head.
    </p>
    <p>
     For what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with
    </p>
    <p>
     the interlinked terrors and wonders of God!
    </p>
    <p>
     But, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does it
    </p>
    <p>
     unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding
    </p>
    <p>
     adoration! for almost all the tapers, lamps, and candles
    </p>
    <p>
     that burn round the globe, burn, as before so many shrines,
    </p>
    <p>
     to our glory!
    </p>
    <p>
     But look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of scales;
    </p>
    <p>
     see what we whalemen are, and have been.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why did the Dutch in De Witt's time have admirals of their
    </p>
    <p>
     whaling fleets?  Why did Louis XVI of France, at his own
    </p>
    <p>
     personal expense, fit out whaling ships from Dunkirk, and politely
    </p>
    <p>
     invite to that town some score or two of families from our own island
    </p>
    <p>
     of Nantucket?  Why did Britain between the years 1750 and 1788
    </p>
    <p>
     pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of 1,000,000 pounds?
    </p>
    <p>
     And lastly, how comes it that we whalemen of America now outnumber
    </p>
    <p>
     all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world; sail a navy of
    </p>
    <p>
     upwards of seven hundred vessels; manned by eighteen thousand men;
    </p>
    <p>
     yearly consuming 00824,000,000 of dollars; the ships worth,
    </p>
    <p>
     at the time of sailing, 20,000,000 dollars; and every year importing
    </p>
    <p>
     into our harbors a well reaped harvest of 00847,000,000 dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
     How comes all this, if there be not something puissant in whaling?
    </p>
    <p>
     But this is not the half; look again.
    </p>
    <p>
     I freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot,
    </p>
    <p>
     for his life, point out one single peaceful influence,
    </p>
    <p>
     which within the last sixty years has operated more potentially
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the whole broad world, taken in one aggregate,
    </p>
    <p>
     than the high and mighty business of whaling.  One way
    </p>
    <p>
     and another, it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves,
    </p>
    <p>
     and so continuously momentous in their sequential issues,
    </p>
    <p>
     that whaling may well be regarded as that Egyptian mother,
    </p>
    <p>
     who bore offspring themselves pregnant from her womb.
    </p>
    <p>
     It would be a hopeless, endless task to catalogue all these things.
    </p>
    <p>
     Let a handful suffice.  For many years past the whale-ship has
    </p>
    <p>
     been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least known
    </p>
    <p>
     parts of the earth.  She has explored seas and archipelagoes
    </p>
    <p>
     which had no chart, where no Cooke or Vancouver had ever sailed.
    </p>
    <p>
     If American and European men-of-war now peacefully ride
    </p>
    <p>
     in once savage harbors, let them fire salutes to the honor
    </p>
    <p>
     and glory of the whale-ship, which originally showed them
    </p>
    <p>
     the way, and first interpreted between them and the savages.
    </p>
    <p>
     They may celebrate as they will the heroes of Exploring Expeditions,
    </p>
    <p>
     your Cookes, Your Krusensterns; but I say that scores of anonymous
    </p>
    <p>
     Captains have sailed out of Nantucket, that were as great,
    </p>
    <p>
     and greater, than your Cooke and your Krusenstern.  For in
    </p>
    <p>
     their succorless empty-handedness, they, in the heathenish
    </p>
    <p>
     sharked waters, and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin islands,
    </p>
    <p>
     battled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cooke with all his
    </p>
    <p>
     marines and muskets would not willingly have willingly dared.
    </p>
    <p>
     All that is made such a flourish of in the old South Sea Voyages,
    </p>
    <p>
     those things were but the life-time commonplaces of our
    </p>
    <p>
     heroic Nantucketers.  Often, adventures which Vancouver
    </p>
    <p>
     dedicates three chapters to, these men accounted unworthy
    </p>
    <p>
     of being set down in the ship's common log.  Ah, the world!
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, the world!
    </p>
    <p>
     Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial,
    </p>
    <p>
     scarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe
    </p>
    <p>
     and the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific coast.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the whalemen who first broke through the jealous policy of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Spanish crown, touching those colonies; and, if space permitted,
    </p>
    <p>
     it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated
    </p>
    <p>
     the liberation of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts.
    </p>
    <p>
     That great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia,
    </p>
    <p>
     was given to the enlightened world by the whaleman.
    </p>
    <p>
     After its first blunder-born discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships,
    </p>
    <p>
     long shunned those shores as pestiferously barbarous;
    </p>
    <p>
     but the whale-ship touched there.  The whale-ship is the true
    </p>
    <p>
     mother of that now mighty colony.  Moreover, in the infancy
    </p>
    <p>
     of the first Australian settlement, the emigrants were several
    </p>
    <p>
     times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of
    </p>
    <p>
     the whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters.
    </p>
    <p>
     The uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth,
    </p>
    <p>
     and do commercial homage to the whale-ship, that cleared the way
    </p>
    <p>
     for the missionary and the merchant, and in many cases carried
    </p>
    <p>
     the primitive missionaries to their first destinations.
    </p>
    <p>
     If that double-bolted land, Japan, is ever to become hospitable,
    </p>
    <p>
     it is the whale-ship alone to whom the credit will be due;
    </p>
    <p>
     for already she is on the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
     But if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling
    </p>
    <p>
     has no aesthetically noble associations connected with it,
    </p>
    <p>
     then am I ready to shiver fifty lances with you there,
    </p>
    <p>
     and unhorse you with a split helmet every time.
    </p>
    <p>
     The whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler,
    </p>
    <p>
     you will say.
    </p>
    <p>
     The whale no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler?
    </p>
    <p>
     Who wrote the first account of our Leviathan?  Who but mighty Job?
    </p>
    <p>
     And who composed the first narrative of a whaling-voyage? Who,
    </p>
    <p>
     but no less a prince than Alfred the Great, who, with his own
    </p>
    <p>
     royal pen, took down the words from Other, the Norwegian
    </p>
    <p>
     whale-hunter of those times!  And who pronounced our glowing
    </p>
    <p>
     eulogy in Parliament?  Who, but Edmund Burke!
    </p>
    <p>
     True enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils;
    </p>
    <p>
     they have no good blood in their veins.
    </p>
    <p>
     No good blood in their veins?  They have something better
    </p>
    <p>
     than royal blood there.  The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin
    </p>
    <p>
     was Mary Morrel; afterwards, by marriage, Mary Folger, one of
    </p>
    <p>
     the old settlers of Nantucket, and the ancestress to a long line
    </p>
    <p>
     of Folgers and harpooneers--all kith and kin to noble Benjamin--
    </p>
    <p>
     this day darting the barbed iron from one side of the world
    </p>
    <p>
     to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     Good again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not respectable.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whaling not respectable?  Whaling is imperial!  By old English
    </p>
    <p>
     statutory law, the whale is declared "a royal fish."
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, that's only nominal!  The whale himself has never figured
    </p>
    <p>
     in any grand imposing way.
    </p>
    <p>
     The whale never figured in any grand imposing way?  In one of the mighty
    </p>
    <p>
     triumphs given to a Roman general upon his entering the world's capital,
    </p>
    <p>
     the bones of a whale, brought all the way from the Syrian coast,
    </p>
    <p>
     were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession.*
    </p>
    <p>
     *See subsequent chapters for something more on this head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Grant it, since you cite it; but say what you will, there is no real
    </p>
    <p>
     dignity in whaling.
    </p>
    <p>
     No dignity in whaling?  The dignity of our calling the very
    </p>
    <p>
     heavens attest.  Cetus is a constellation in the South!  No more!
    </p>
    <p>
     Drive down your hat in presence of the Czar, and take it off
    </p>
    <p>
     to Queequeg!  No more!  I know a man that, in his lifetime
    </p>
    <p>
     has taken three hundred and fifty whales.  I account that man
    </p>
    <p>
     more honorable than that great captain of antiquity who boasted
    </p>
    <p>
     of taking as many walled towns.
    </p>
    <p>
     And, as for me, if, by any possibility, there be any as yet undiscovered
    </p>
    <p>
     prime thing in me; if I shall ever deserve any real repute in that small
    </p>
    <p>
     but high hushed world which I might not be unreasonably ambitious of;
    </p>
    <p>
     if hereafter I shall do anything that, upon the whole, a man might rather
    </p>
    <p>
     have done than to have left undone; if, at my death, my executors,
    </p>
    <p>
     or more properly my creditors, find any precious MSS.  in my desk,
    </p>
    <p>
     then here I prospectively ascribe all the honor and the glory to whaling;
    </p>
    <p>
     for a whale-ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.

    <p>
     Postscript
    </p>
    <p>
     In behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance naught
    </p>
    <p>
     but substantiated facts.  But after embattling his facts,
    </p>
    <p>
     an advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise,
    </p>
    <p>
     which might tell eloquently upon his cause--such an advocate,
    </p>
    <p>
     would he not be blame-worthy?
    </p>
    <p>
     It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens,
    </p>
    <p>
     even modern ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them
    </p>
    <p>
     for their functions is gone through.  There is a saltcellar
    </p>
    <p>
     of state, so called, and there may be a caster of state.
    </p>
    <p>
     How they use the salt, precisely--who knows?  Certain I am,
    </p>
    <p>
     however, that a king's head is solemnly oiled at his coronation,
    </p>
    <p>
     even as a head of salad.  Can it be, though, that they
    </p>
    <p>
     anoint it with a view of making its interior run well,
    </p>
    <p>
     as they anoint machinery?  Much might be ruminated here,
    </p>
    <p>
     concerning the essential dignity of this regal process,
    </p>
    <p>
     because in common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow
    </p>
    <p>
     who anoints his hair, and palpably smells of that anointing.
    </p>
    <p>
     In truth, a mature man who uses hairoil, unless medicinally,
    </p>
    <p>
     that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
     As a general rule, he can't amount to much in his totality.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the only thing to be considered here is this--what kind of oil is used
    </p>
    <p>
     at coronations?  Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar oil,
    </p>
    <p>
     nor castor oil, nor bear's oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil.
    </p>
    <p>
     What then can it possibly be, but the sperm oil in its unmanufactured,
    </p>
    <p>
     unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?
    </p>
    <p>
     Think of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings
    </p>
    <p>
     and queens with coronation stuff!

     CHAPTER 26
    </head>
    <p>
     Knights and Squires
    </p>
    <p>
     The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a Quaker by descent.  He was a long, earnest man,
    </p>
    <p>
     and though born on an icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure
    </p>
    <p>
     hot latitudes, his flesh being hard as twice-baked biscuit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Transported to the Indies, his live blood would not spoil like
    </p>
    <p>
     bottled ale.  He must have been born in some time of general
    </p>
    <p>
     drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which his
    </p>
    <p>
     state is famous.  Only some thirty arid summers had he seen;
    </p>
    <p>
     those summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness.
    </p>
    <p>
     But this, his thinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token
    </p>
    <p>
     of wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed the indication
    </p>
    <p>
     of any bodily blight.  It was merely the condensation of the man.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was by no means ill-looking; quite the contrary.
    </p>
    <p>
     His pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped
    </p>
    <p>
     up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength,
    </p>
    <p>
     like a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared
    </p>
    <p>
     to endure for long ages to come, and to endure always, as now;
    </p>
    <p>
     for be it Polar snow or torrid sun, like a patent chronometer,
    </p>
    <p>
     his interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates.
    </p>
    <p>
     Looking into his eyes, you seemed to see there the yet lingering
    </p>
    <p>
     images of those thousand-fold perils he had calmly confronted
    </p>
    <p>
     through life.  A staid, steadfast man, whose life for the most
    </p>
    <p>
     part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a tame chapter
    </p>
    <p>
     of sounds.  Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude,
    </p>
    <p>
     there were certain qualities in him which at times affected,
    </p>
    <p>
     and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep
    </p>
    <p>
     natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did
    </p>
    <p>
     therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that sort
    </p>
    <p>
     of superstition, which in some organizations seems rather
    </p>
    <p>
     to spring, somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Outward portents and inward presentiments were his.
    </p>
    <p>
     And if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul,
    </p>
    <p>
     much more did his far-away domestic memories of his young Cape
    </p>
    <p>
     wife and child, tend to bend him still more from the original
    </p>
    <p>
     ruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to those latent
    </p>
    <p>
     influences which, in some honest-hearted men, restrain the gush
    </p>
    <p>
     of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more
    </p>
    <p>
     perilous vicissitudes of the fishery.  "I will have no man
    </p>
    <p>
     in my boat," said Starbuck, "who is not afraid of a whale."
    </p>
    <p>
     By this, he seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable
    </p>
    <p>
     and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation
    </p>
    <p>
     of the encountered peril, but that an utterly fearless man
    </p>
    <p>
     is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, aye," said Stubb, the second mate, "Starbuck, there,
    </p>
    <p>
     is as careful a man as you'll find anywhere in this fishery."
    </p>
    <p>
     But we shall ere long see what that word "careful" precisely means
    </p>
    <p>
     when used by a man like Stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a sentiment;
    </p>
    <p>
     but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon all mortally
    </p>
    <p>
     practical occasions.  Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in this business
    </p>
    <p>
     of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship,
    </p>
    <p>
     like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly wasted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sun-down;
    </p>
    <p>
     nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in
    </p>
    <p>
     fighting him.  For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this critical ocean
    </p>
    <p>
     to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by them for theirs;
    </p>
    <p>
     and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew.
    </p>
    <p>
     What doom was his own father's? Where, in the bottomless deeps,
    </p>
    <p>
     could he find the torn limbs of his brother?
    </p>
    <p>
     With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain
    </p>
    <p>
     superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck,
    </p>
    <p>
     which could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized,
    </p>
    <p>
     and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he had;
    </p>
    <p>
     it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently
    </p>
    <p>
     engendering an element in him, which, under suitable circumstances,
    </p>
    <p>
     would break out from its confinement, and burn all his courage up.
    </p>
    <p>
     And brave as he might be, it was that sort of bravery chiefly,
    </p>
    <p>
     visible in some intrepid men, which, while generally abiding firm
    </p>
    <p>
     in the conflict with seas, or winds, or whales, or any of the ordinary
    </p>
    <p>
     irrational horrors of the world, yet cannot withstand those more terrific,
    </p>
    <p>
     because more spiritual terrors, which sometimes menace you from
    </p>
    <p>
     the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man.
    </p>
    <p>
     But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance,
    </p>
    <p>
     the complete abasement of poor Starbuck's fortitude, scarce might
    </p>
    <p>
     I have the heart to write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful,
    </p>
    <p>
     nay shocking, to expose the fall of valor in the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
     Men may seem detestable as joint stock-companies and nations;
    </p>
    <p>
     knaves, fools, and murderers there may be; men may have mean and
    </p>
    <p>
     meagre faces; but, man, in the ideal, is so noble and so sparkling,
    </p>
    <p>
     such a grand and glowing creature, that over any ignominious blemish
    </p>
    <p>
     in him all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes.
    </p>
    <p>
     That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves, so far within us,
    </p>
    <p>
     that it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone;
    </p>
    <p>
     bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a
    </p>
    <p>
     valor-ruined man.  Nor can piety itself, at such a shameful sight,
    </p>
    <p>
     completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars.
    </p>
    <p>
     But this august dignity I treat of, is not the dignity of kings
    </p>
    <p>
     and robes, but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields a pick or
    </p>
    <p>
     drives a spike; that democratic dignity which, on all hands,
    </p>
    <p>
     radiates without end from God; Himself!  The great God absolute!
    </p>
    <p>
     The centre and circumference of all democracy!  His omnipresence,
    </p>
    <p>
     our divine equality!
    </p>
    <p>
     If, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways,
    </p>
    <p>
     I shall hereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark;
    </p>
    <p>
     weave round them tragic graces; if even the most mournful,
    </p>
    <p>
     perchance the most abased, among them all, shall at times lift
    </p>
    <p>
     himself to the exalted mounts; if I shall touch that workman's
    </p>
    <p>
     arm with some ethereal light; if I shall spread a rainbow
    </p>
    <p>
     over his disastrous set of sun; then against all mortal
    </p>
    <p>
     critics bear me out in it, thou just Spirit of Equality,
    </p>
    <p>
     which hast spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kind!
    </p>
    <p>
     Bear me out in it, thou great democratic God! who didst not
    </p>
    <p>
     refuse to the swart convict, Bunyan, the pale, poetic pearl;
    </p>
    <p>
     Thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest gold,
    </p>
    <p>
     the stumped and paupered arm of old Cervantes; Thou who didst
    </p>
    <p>
     pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles; who didst hurl him
    </p>
    <p>
     upon a war-horse; who didst thunder him higher than a throne!
    </p>
    <p>
     Thou who, in all Thy mighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest
    </p>
    <p>
     Thy selectest champions from the kingly commoners; bear me
    </p>
    <p>
     out in it, O God!

     CHAPTER 27
    </head>
    <p>
     Knights and Squires
    </p>
    <p>
     Stubb was the second mate.  He was a native of Cape Cod;
    </p>
    <p>
     and hence, according to local usage, was called a
    </p>
    <p>
     Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky; neither craven nor valiant;
    </p>
    <p>
     taking perils as they came with an indifferent air; and while
    </p>
    <p>
     engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase, toiling away,
    </p>
    <p>
     calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year.
    </p>
    <p>
     Good-humored, easy, and careless, he presided over his
    </p>
    <p>
     whaleboat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner,
    </p>
    <p>
     and his crew all invited guests.  He was as particular
    </p>
    <p>
     about the comfortable arrangements of his part of the boat,
    </p>
    <p>
     as an old stage-driver is about the snugness of his box.
    </p>
    <p>
     When close to the whale, in the very death-lock of the fight,
    </p>
    <p>
     he handled his unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly, as a
    </p>
    <p>
     whistling tinker his hammer.  He would hum over his old rigadig
    </p>
    <p>
     tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster.
    </p>
    <p>
     Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted the jaws of death
    </p>
    <p>
     into an easy chair.  What he thought of death itself,
    </p>
    <p>
     there is no telling.  Whether he ever thought of it at all,
    </p>
    <p>
     might be a question; but, if he ever did chance to cast his mind
    </p>
    <p>
     that way after a comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor,
    </p>
    <p>
     he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft,
    </p>
    <p>
     and bestir themselves there, about something which he would
    </p>
    <p>
     find out when he obeyed the order, and not sooner.
    </p>
    <p>
     What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going,
    </p>
    <p>
     unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a
    </p>
    <p>
     world full of grave peddlers, all bowed to the ground with their packs;
    </p>
    <p>
     what helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of his;
    </p>
    <p>
     that thing must have been his pipe.  For, like his nose, his short,
    </p>
    <p>
     black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
     You would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk
    </p>
    <p>
     without his nose as without his pipe.  He kept a whole row of pipes
    </p>
    <p>
     there ready loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand;
    </p>
    <p>
     and, whenever he turned in, he smoked them all out in succession,
    </p>
    <p>
     lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter; then loading
    </p>
    <p>
     them again to be in readiness anew.  For, when Stubb dressed,
    </p>
    <p>
     instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe
    </p>
    <p>
     into his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     I say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least of
    </p>
    <p>
     his peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air,
    </p>
    <p>
     whether ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless
    </p>
    <p>
     miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it;
    </p>
    <p>
     and as in time of the cholera, some people go about with a
    </p>
    <p>
     camphorated handkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise, against all
    </p>
    <p>
     mortal tribulations, Stubb's tobacco smoke might have operated
    </p>
    <p>
     as a sort of disinfecting agent.
    </p>
    <p>
     The third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha's Vineyard.
    </p>
    <p>
     A short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales,
    </p>
    <p>
     who somehow seemed to think that the great Leviathans had personally
    </p>
    <p>
     and hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort
    </p>
    <p>
     of point of honor with him, to destroy them whenever encountered.
    </p>
    <p>
     So utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels
    </p>
    <p>
     of their majestic bulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything
    </p>
    <p>
     like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them;
    </p>
    <p>
     that in his poor opinion, the wondrous whale was but a species
    </p>
    <p>
     of magnified mouse, or at least water-rat, requiring only a little
    </p>
    <p>
     circumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order
    </p>
    <p>
     to kill and boil.  This ignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his
    </p>
    <p>
     made him a little waggish in the matter of whales; he followed
    </p>
    <p>
     these fish for the fun of it; and a three years' voyage round
    </p>
    <p>
     Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time.
    </p>
    <p>
     As a carpenter's nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails;
    </p>
    <p>
     so mankind may be similarly divided.  Little Flask was one
    </p>
    <p>
     of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long.
    </p>
    <p>
     They called him King-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form,
    </p>
    <p>
     he could be well likened to the short, square timber known by that name
    </p>
    <p>
     in Arctic whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side
    </p>
    <p>
     timbers inserted into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy
    </p>
    <p>
     concussions of those battering seas.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now these three mates--Starbuck, Stubb and Flask, were momentous men.
    </p>
    <p>
     They it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the Pequod's
    </p>
    <p>
     boats as headsmen.  In that grand order of battle in which Captain Ahab
    </p>
    <p>
     would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales, these three
    </p>
    <p>
     headsmen were as captains of companies.  Or, being armed with their
    </p>
    <p>
     long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio of lancers;
    </p>
    <p>
     even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.
    </p>
    <p>
     And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman,
    </p>
    <p>
     like a Gothic Knight of old, is always accompanied by his
    </p>
    <p>
     boat-steerer or harpooneer, who in certain conjunctures provides
    </p>
    <p>
     him with a fresh lance, when the former one has been badly twisted,
    </p>
    <p>
     or elbowed in the assault; and moreover, as there generally
    </p>
    <p>
     subsists between the two, a close intimacy and friendliness;
    </p>
    <p>
     it is therefore but meet, that in this place we set down
    </p>
    <p>
     who the Pequod's harpooneers were, and to what headsman each
    </p>
    <p>
     of them belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
     First of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate,
    </p>
    <p>
     had selected for his squire.  But Queequeg is already known.
    </p>
    <p>
     Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly
    </p>
    <p>
     promontory of Martha's Vineyard, where there still exists the last
    </p>
    <p>
     remnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the neighboring
    </p>
    <p>
     island of Nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the fishery, they usually go by the generic name of
    </p>
    <p>
     Gay-Headers. Tashtego's long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek bones,
    </p>
    <p>
     and black rounding eyes--for an Indian, Oriental in their largeness,
    </p>
    <p>
     but Antarctic in their glittering expression--all this sufficiently
    </p>
    <p>
     proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud
    </p>
    <p>
     warrior hunters, who, in quest of the great New England moose,
    </p>
    <p>
     had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of the main.
    </p>
    <p>
     But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland,
    </p>
    <p>
     Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea;
    </p>
    <p>
     the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow
    </p>
    <p>
     of the sires.  To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs,
    </p>
    <p>
     you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier
    </p>
    <p>
     Puritans and half-believed this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Powers of the Air.  Tashtego was Stubb the second mate's squire.
    </p>
    <p>
     Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black
    </p>
    <p>
     negro-savage, with a lion-like tread--an Ahasuerus to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors
    </p>
    <p>
     called them ringbolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail
    </p>
    <p>
     halyards to them.  In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped
    </p>
    <p>
     on board of a whaler, lying in a lonely bay on his native coast.
    </p>
    <p>
     And never having been anywhere in the world but in Africa, Nantucket,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the pagan harbors most frequented by the whalemen; and having
    </p>
    <p>
     now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the ships
    </p>
    <p>
     of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped;
    </p>
    <p>
     Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues, and erect as a giraffe,
    </p>
    <p>
     moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him; and a white man
    </p>
    <p>
     standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress.
    </p>
    <p>
     Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus Daggoo, was the
    </p>
    <p>
     Squire of little Flask, who looked like a chess-man beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
     As for the residue of the Pequod's company, be it said,
    </p>
    <p>
     that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand
    </p>
    <p>
     men before the mast employed in the American whale fishery,
    </p>
    <p>
     are Americans born, though pretty nearly all the officers are.
    </p>
    <p>
     Herein it is the same with the American whale fishery as with the
    </p>
    <p>
     American army and military and merchant navies, and the engineering
    </p>
    <p>
     forces employed in the construction of the American Canals
    </p>
    <p>
     and Railroads.  The same, I say, because in all these cases
    </p>
    <p>
     the native American literally provides the brains, the rest
    </p>
    <p>
     of the world as generously supplying the muscles.  No small number
    </p>
    <p>
     of these whaling seamen belong to the Azores, where the outward
    </p>
    <p>
     bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews
    </p>
    <p>
     from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores.  In like manner,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London, put in at
    </p>
    <p>
     the Shetland Islands, to receive the full complement of their crew.
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon the passage homewards, they drop them there again.  How it is,
    </p>
    <p>
     there is no telling, but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were nearly all Islanders in the Pequod, Isolatoes too,
    </p>
    <p>
     I call such, not acknowledging the common continent of men,
    </p>
    <p>
     but each Isolato living on a separate continent of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet now, federated along one keel, what a set these Isolatoes were!
    </p>
    <p>
     An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     and all the ends of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in
    </p>
    <p>
     the Pequod to lay the world's grievances before that bar from
    </p>
    <p>
     which not very many of them ever come back.  Black Little Pip--
    </p>
    <p>
     he never did--oh, no! he went before.  Poor Alabama boy!
    </p>
    <p>
     On the grim Pequod's forecastle, ye shall ere long see him,
    </p>
    <p>
     beating his tambourine; prelusive of the eternal time, when sent for,
    </p>
    <p>
     to the great quarter-deck on high, he was bid strike in with angels,
    </p>
    <p>
     and beat his tambourine in glory; called a coward here,
    </p>
    <p>
     hailed a hero there!

     CHAPTER 28
    </head>
    <p>
     Ahab
    </p>
    <p>
     For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches
    </p>
    <p>
     was seen of Captain Ahab.  The mates regularly relieved each other
    </p>
    <p>
     at the watches, and for aught that could be seen to the contrary,
    </p>
    <p>
     they seemed to be the only commanders of the ship; only they
    </p>
    <p>
     sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory,
    </p>
    <p>
     that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, their supreme lord and dictator was there, though hitherto
    </p>
    <p>
     unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred
    </p>
    <p>
     retreat of the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below,
    </p>
    <p>
     I instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible;
    </p>
    <p>
     for my first vague disquietude touching the unknown captain,
    </p>
    <p>
     now in the seclusion of the sea became almost a perturbation.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was strangely heightened at times by the ragged Elijah's
    </p>
    <p>
     diabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me,
    </p>
    <p>
     with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived of.
    </p>
    <p>
     But poorly could I withstand them, much as in other moods
    </p>
    <p>
     I was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities
    </p>
    <p>
     of that outlandish prophet of the wharves.  But whatever
    </p>
    <p>
     it was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness--to call it so--
    </p>
    <p>
     which I felt, yet whenever I came to look about me in the ship,
    </p>
    <p>
     it seemed against all warranty to cherish such emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
     For though the harpooneers, with the great body of the crew,
    </p>
    <p>
     were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than any
    </p>
    <p>
     of the tame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences
    </p>
    <p>
     had made me acquainted with, still I ascribed this--and rightly
    </p>
    <p>
     ascribed it--to the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild
    </p>
    <p>
     Scandinavian vocation in which I had so abandonedly embarked.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it was especially the aspect of the three chief officers
    </p>
    <p>
     of the ship, the mates, which was most forcibly calculated
    </p>
    <p>
     to allay these colorless misgivings, and induce confidence
    </p>
    <p>
     and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
     Three better, more likely sea-officers and men, each in his
    </p>
    <p>
     own different way, could not readily be found, and they were
    </p>
    <p>
     every one of them Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder,
    </p>
    <p>
     a Cape man.  Now, it being Christmas when the ship shot
    </p>
    <p>
     from out her harbor, for a space we had biting Polar weather,
    </p>
    <p>
     though all the time running away from it to the southward;
    </p>
    <p>
     and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed,
    </p>
    <p>
     gradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable
    </p>
    <p>
     weather behind us.  It was one of those less lowering,
    </p>
    <p>
     but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition,
    </p>
    <p>
     when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water
    </p>
    <p>
     with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity,
    </p>
    <p>
     that as I mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch,
    </p>
    <p>
     so soon as I levelled my glance towards the taffrail,
    </p>
    <p>
     foreboding shivers ran over me.  Reality outran apprehension;
    </p>
    <p>
     Captain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck.
    </p>
    <p>
     There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him,
    </p>
    <p>
     nor of the recovery from any.  He looked like a man cut away
    </p>
    <p>
     from the stake, when the fire has overrunningly wasted all
    </p>
    <p>
     the limbs without consuming them, or taking away one particle
    </p>
    <p>
     from their compacted aged robustness.  His whole high, broad form,
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an unalterable mould,
    </p>
    <p>
     like Cellini's cast Perseus.  Threading its way out from among
    </p>
    <p>
     his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his tawny
    </p>
    <p>
     scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing,
    </p>
    <p>
     you saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish.
    </p>
    <p>
     It resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight,
    </p>
    <p>
     lofty trunk of a great tree, when the upper lightning tearingly
    </p>
    <p>
     darts down it, and without wrenching a single twig, peels and
    </p>
    <p>
     grooves out the bark from top to bottom ere running off into
    </p>
    <p>
     the soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether that mark was born with him, or whether it was the scar
    </p>
    <p>
     left by some desperate wound, no one could certainly say.
    </p>
    <p>
     By some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little
    </p>
    <p>
     or no allusion was made to it, especially by the mates.
    </p>
    <p>
     But once Tashtego's senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the crew,
    </p>
    <p>
     superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years
    </p>
    <p>
     old did Ahab become that way branded, and then it came upon him,
    </p>
    <p>
     not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife
    </p>
    <p>
     at sea.  Yet, this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived,
    </p>
    <p>
     by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral man,
    </p>
    <p>
     who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never
    </p>
    <p>
     ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab.  Nevertheless, the old
    </p>
    <p>
     sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested
    </p>
    <p>
     this old Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment.
    </p>
    <p>
     So that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said
    </p>
    <p>
     that if ever Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out--
    </p>
    <p>
     which might hardly come to pass, so he muttered--then, whoever should
    </p>
    <p>
     do that last office for the dead, would find a birth-mark on him
    </p>
    <p>
     from crown to sole.
    </p>
    <p>
     So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the livid brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments
    </p>
    <p>
     I hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness
    </p>
    <p>
     was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been
    </p>
    <p>
     fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whale's jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, he was dismasted off Japan," said the old Gay-Head Indian once;
    </p>
    <p>
     "but like his dismasted craft, he shipped another mast without
    </p>
    <p>
     coming home for it.  He has a quiver of 'em."
    </p>
    <p>
     I was struck with the singular posture he maintained.
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon each side of the Pequod's quarter deck, and pretty close
    </p>
    <p>
     to the mizzen shrouds, there was an auger hole, bored about half
    </p>
    <p>
     an inch or so, into the plank.  His bone leg steadied in that hole;
    </p>
    <p>
     one arm elevated, and holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect,
    </p>
    <p>
     looking straight out beyond the ship's ever-pitching prow.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was an infinity of firmest fortitude, a determinate,
    </p>
    <p>
     unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and fearless,
    </p>
    <p>
     forward dedication of that glance.  Not a word he spoke;
    </p>
    <p>
     nor did his officers say aught to him; though by all their
    </p>
    <p>
     minutest gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy,
    </p>
    <p>
     if not painful, consciousness of being under a troubled
    </p>
    <p>
     master-eye. And not only that, but moody stricken Ahab stood
    </p>
    <p>
     before them with a crucifixion in his face; in all the nameless
    </p>
    <p>
     regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
     But after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew;
    </p>
    <p>
     either standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had;
    </p>
    <p>
     or heavily walking the deck.  As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began
    </p>
    <p>
     to grow a little genial, he became still less and less a recluse;
    </p>
    <p>
     as if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry
    </p>
    <p>
     bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded.  And, by and by,
    </p>
    <p>
     it came to pass, that he was almost continually in the air;
    </p>
    <p>
     but, as yet, for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at
    </p>
    <p>
     last sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the Pequod was only making a passage now; not regularly cruising;
    </p>
    <p>
     nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully
    </p>
    <p>
     competent to, so that there was little or nothing, out of himself,
    </p>
    <p>
     to employ or excite Ahab, now; and thus chase away, for that one interval,
    </p>
    <p>
     the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his brow, as ever
    </p>
    <p>
     all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant,
    </p>
    <p>
     holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him from his mood.
    </p>
    <p>
     For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and May, trip home
    </p>
    <p>
     to the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest, ruggedest, most
    </p>
    <p>
     thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts,
    </p>
    <p>
     to welcome such gladhearted visitants; so Ahab did, in the end,
    </p>
    <p>
     a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air.
    </p>
    <p>
     More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look, which, in any
    </p>
    <p>
     other man, would have soon flowered out in a smile.

     Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod
    </p>
    <p>
     now went rolling through the bright Quito spring, which at sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Tropic.  The warmly cool, clear, ringing perfumed, overflowing,
    </p>
    <p>
     redundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped up--
    </p>
    <p>
     flaked up, with rose-water snow.  The starred and stately nights seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely pride,
    </p>
    <p>
     the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted suns!
    </p>
    <p>
     For sleeping man, 'twas hard to choose between such winsome days and
    </p>
    <p>
     such seducing nights.  But all the witcheries of that unwaning weather
    </p>
    <p>
     did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward world.
    </p>
    <p>
     Inward they turned upon the soul, especially when the still mild
    </p>
    <p>
     hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals as the clear ice
    </p>
    <p>
     most forms of noiseless twilights.  And all these subtle agencies,
    </p>
    <p>
     more and more they wrought on Ahab's texture.
    </p>
    <p>
     Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life,
    </p>
    <p>
     the less man has to do with aught that looks like death.
    </p>
    <p>
     Among sea-commanders, the old greybeards will oftenest
    </p>
    <p>
     leave their berths to visit the night-cloaked deck.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he seemed so much
    </p>
    <p>
     to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits
    </p>
    <p>
     were more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the planks.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It feels like going down into one's tomb,"--he would mutter
    </p>
    <p>
     to himself--"for an old captain like me to be descending this
    </p>
    <p>
     narrow scuttle, to go to my grave-dug berth."
    </p>
    <p>
     So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night
    </p>
    <p>
     were set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below;
    </p>
    <p>
     and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors
    </p>
    <p>
     flung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt it
    </p>
    <p>
     to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when this
    </p>
    <p>
     sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the silent
    </p>
    <p>
     steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old man
    </p>
    <p>
     would emerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some considering touch of humanity was in him; for at times like these,
    </p>
    <p>
     he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because to his
    </p>
    <p>
     wearied mates, seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel,
    </p>
    <p>
     such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step,
    </p>
    <p>
     that their dreams would have been of the crunching teeth of sharks.
    </p>
    <p>
     But once, the mood was on him too deep for common regardings;
    </p>
    <p>
     and as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from
    </p>
    <p>
     taffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate, came up from below,
    </p>
    <p>
     and with a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if
    </p>
    <p>
     Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say nay;
    </p>
    <p>
     but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting something
    </p>
    <p>
     indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the insertion
    </p>
    <p>
     into it, of the ivory heel.  Ah!  Stubb, thou didst not know Ahab then.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb," said Ahab, "that thou wouldst
    </p>
    <p>
     wad me that fashion?  But go thy ways; I had forgot.
    </p>
    <p>
     Below to thy nightly grave; where such as ye sleep between shrouds,
    </p>
    <p>
     to use ye to the filling one at last.--Down, dog, and kennel!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Starting at the unforeseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly
    </p>
    <p>
     scornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly,
    </p>
    <p>
     "I am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half
    </p>
    <p>
     like it, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Avast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving away,
    </p>
    <p>
     as if to avoid some passionate temptation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, sir; not yet," said Stubb, emboldened, "I will not tamely
    </p>
    <p>
     be called a dog, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass,
    </p>
    <p>
     and begone, or I'll clear the world of thee!"
    </p>
    <p>
     As he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing
    </p>
    <p>
     terrors in his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,"
    </p>
    <p>
     muttered Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's very queer.  Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don't well
    </p>
    <p>
     know whether to go back and strike him, or--what's that?--
    </p>
    <p>
     down here on my knees and pray for him?  Yes, that was the thought
    </p>
    <p>
     coming up in me; but it would be the first time I ever did pray.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's queer; very queer; and he's queer too; aye, take him fore
    </p>
    <p>
     and aft, he's about the queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with.
    </p>
    <p>
     How he flashed at me!--his eyes like powder-pans! is he mad!
    </p>
    <p>
     Anyway there's something's on his mind, as sure as there
    </p>
    <p>
     must be something on a deck when it cracks.  He aint in his
    </p>
    <p>
     bed now, either, more than three hours out of the twenty-four;
    </p>
    <p>
     and he don't sleep then.  Didn't that Dough-Boy, the steward,
    </p>
    <p>
     tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man's hammock
    </p>
    <p>
     clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at the foot,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort
    </p>
    <p>
     of frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on it?
    </p>
    <p>
     A hot old man!  I guess he's got what some folks ashore
    </p>
    <p>
     call a conscience; it's a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say--
    </p>
    <p>
     worse nor a toothache.  Well, well; I don't know what it is,
    </p>
    <p>
     but the Lord keep me from catching it.  He's full of riddles;
    </p>
    <p>
     I wonder what he goes into the after hold for, every night,
    </p>
    <p>
     as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what's that for, I should
    </p>
    <p>
     like to know?  Who's made appointments with him in the hold?
    </p>
    <p>
     Ain't that queer, now?  But there's no telling, it's the old game--
    </p>
    <p>
     Here goes for a snooze.  Damn me, it's worth a fellow's
    </p>
    <p>
     while to be born into the world, if only to fall right asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     And now that I think of it, that's about the first thing
    </p>
    <p>
     babies do, and that's a sort of queer, too.  Damn me,
    </p>
    <p>
     but all things are queer, come to think of 'em.  But that's
    </p>
    <p>
     against my principles.  Think not, is my eleventh commandment;
    </p>
    <p>
     and sleep when you can, is my twelfth--So here goes again.
    </p>
    <p>
     But how's that? didn't he call me a dog? blazes! he called me ten
    </p>
    <p>
     times a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of that!
    </p>
    <p>
     He might as well have kicked me, and done with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe he did kick me, and I didn't observe it, I was so taken all
    </p>
    <p>
     aback with his brow, somehow.  It flashed like a bleached bone.
    </p>
    <p>
     What the devil's the matter with me?  I don't stand right on my legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the Lord, I must have been dreaming, though--How? how? how?--
    </p>
    <p>
     but the only way's to stash it; so here goes to hammock again;
    </p>
    <p>
     and in the morning, I'll see how this plaguey juggling thinks
    </p>
    <p>
     over by daylight."

    <p>
     The Pipe
    </p>
    <p>
     When Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks;
    </p>
    <p>
     and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a sailor of
    </p>
    <p>
     the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on
    </p>
    <p>
     the weather side of the deck, he sat and smoked.
    </p>
    <p>
     In old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings
    </p>
    <p>
     were fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale.
    </p>
    <p>
     How could one look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones,
    </p>
    <p>
     without bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized?
    </p>
    <p>
     For a Khan of the plank, and a king of the sea and a great lord
    </p>
    <p>
     of Leviathans was Ahab.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some moments passed, during which the thick vapor came
    </p>
    <p>
     from his mouth in quick and constant puffs, which blew back
    </p>
    <p>
     again into his face.  "How now," he soliloquized at last,
    </p>
    <p>
     withdrawing the tube, "this smoking no longer soothes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone!
    </p>
    <p>
     Here have I been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring--
    </p>
    <p>
     aye, and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward,
    </p>
    <p>
     and with such nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
     What business have I with this pipe?  This thing that is
    </p>
    <p>
     meant for sereneness, to send up mild white vapors among
    </p>
    <p>
     mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks like mine.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll smoke no more-"
    </p>
    <p>
     He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea.  The fire hissed
    </p>
    <p>
     in the waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble
    </p>
    <p>
     the sinking pipe made.  With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly
    </p>
    <p>
     paced the planks.

     CHAPTER 31

    <p>
     Queen Mab
    </p>
    <p>
     Next morning Stubb accosted Flask.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had.  You know the old man's
    </p>
    <p>
     ivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried
    </p>
    <p>
     to kick back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off!
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, presto!  Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I like a blazing fool,
    </p>
    <p>
     kept kicking at it.  But what was still more curious, Flask--you know
    </p>
    <p>
     how curious all dreams are--through all this rage that I was in,
    </p>
    <p>
     I somehow seemed to be thinking to myself, that after all,
    </p>
    <p>
     it was not much of an insult, that kick from Ahab.  'Why,' thinks I,
    </p>
    <p>
     'what's the row?  It's not a real leg, only a false one.'
    </p>
    <p>
     And there's a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump.
    </p>
    <p>
     That's what makes a blow from the hand, Flask, fifty times
    </p>
    <p>
     more savage to bear than a blow from a cane.  The living member--
    </p>
    <p>
     that makes the living insult, my little man.  And thinks I to myself
    </p>
    <p>
     all the while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly toes against
    </p>
    <p>
     that cursed pyramid--so confoundedly contradictory was it all,
    </p>
    <p>
     all the while, I say, I was thinking to myself, 'what's his leg now,
    </p>
    <p>
     but a cane-. a whale-bone cane.  Yes,' thinks I, 'it was only
    </p>
    <p>
     a playful cudgelling--in fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me--
    </p>
    <p>
     not a base kick.  Besides,' thinks I, 'look at it once; why, the end
    </p>
    <p>
     of it--the foot part--what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a
    </p>
    <p>
     broad footed farmer kicked me, there's a devilish broad insult.
    </p>
    <p>
     But this insult is whittled down to a point only.'  But now comes
    </p>
    <p>
     the greatest joke of the dream, Flask.  While I was battering away
    </p>
    <p>
     at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired old merman, with a hump
    </p>
    <p>
     on his back, takes me by the shoulders, and slews me round.
    </p>
    <p>
     'What are you 'bout?' says he.  Slid! man, but I was frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
     Such a phiz!  But, somehow, next moment I was over the fright.
    </p>
    <p>
     'What am I about?' says I at last.  'And what business is that of yours,
    </p>
    <p>
     I should like to know, Mr. Humpback?  Do you want a kick?'
    </p>
    <p>
     By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned
    </p>
    <p>
     round his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed
    </p>
    <p>
     he had for a clout--what do you think, I saw?--why thunder alive,
    </p>
    <p>
     man, his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Says I on second thought, 'I guess I won't kick you, old fellow.'
    </p>
    <p>
     'Wise Stubb,' said he, 'wise Stubb;' and kept muttering it all
    </p>
    <p>
     the time, a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seeing he wasn't going to stop saying over his 'wise Stubb,
    </p>
    <p>
     wise Stubb,' I thought I might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again.
    </p>
    <p>
     But I had only just lifted my foot for it, when he roared out,
    </p>
    <p>
     'Stop that kicking!'  'Halloa,' says I, 'what's the matter now,
    </p>
    <p>
     old fellow?'  'Look ye here,' says he; 'let's argue the insult.
    </p>
    <p>
     Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn't he?'  'Yes, he did,' says I--'right here
    </p>
    <p>
     it was.'  'Very good,' says he--'he used his ivory leg, didn't he?'
    </p>
    <p>
     'Yes, he did,' says I. 'Well then,' says he, 'wise Stubb, what have
    </p>
    <p>
     you to complain of?  Didn't he kick with right good will? it wasn't
    </p>
    <p>
     a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it?  No, you were kicked
    </p>
    <p>
     by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb.  It's an honor;
    </p>
    <p>
     I consider it an honor.  Listen, wise Stubb.  In old England
    </p>
    <p>
     the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen,
    </p>
    <p>
     and made garter-knights of; but, be your boast, Stubb, that ye were
    </p>
    <p>
     kicked by old Ahab, and made a wise man of.  Remember what I say;
    </p>
    <p>
     be kicked by him; account his kicks honors; and on no account kick back;
    </p>
    <p>
     for you can't help yourself, wise Stubb.  Don't you see that pyramid?'
    </p>
    <p>
     With that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion,
    </p>
    <p>
     to swim off into the air.  I snored; rolled over; and there I was
    </p>
    <p>
     in my hammock!  Now, what do you think of that dream, Flask?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.'"
    </p>
    <p>
     "May be; may be.  But it's made a wise man of me, Flask.  D'ye see Ahab
    </p>
    <p>
     standing there, sideways looking over the stern?  Well, the best thing
    </p>
    <p>
     you can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to him,
    </p>
    <p>
     whatever he says.  Halloa!  What's that he shouts?  Hark!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mast-head, there!  Look sharp, all of ye!  There are whales hereabouts!
    </p>
    <p>
     If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!
    </p>
    <p>
     "What do you think of that now, Flask? ain't there a small
    </p>
    <p>
     drop of something queer about that, eh?  A white whale--did ye
    </p>
    <p>
     mark that, man?  Look ye--there's something special in the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stand by for it, Flask.  Ahab has that that's bloody on his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, mum; he comes this way."

     It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera,
    </p>
    <p>
     that I would now fain put before you.  Yet is it no easy task.
    </p>
    <p>
     The classification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less
    </p>
    <p>
     is here essayed.  Listen to what the best and latest authorities
    </p>
    <p>
     have laid down.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is
    </p>
    <p>
     entitled Cetology," says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the inquiry
    </p>
    <p>
     as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and
    </p>
    <p>
     families.... Utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal"
    </p>
    <p>
     (sperm whale), says Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea."
    </p>
    <p>
     "A field strewn with thorns."  "All these incomplete indications
    </p>
    <p>
     but serve to torture us naturalists."
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and Lesson,
    </p>
    <p>
     those lights of zoology and anatomy.  Nevertheless, though of real
    </p>
    <p>
     knowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty;
    </p>
    <p>
     and so in some small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many are the men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen,
    </p>
    <p>
     who have at large or in little, written of the whale.  Run over a few:--
    </p>
    <p>
     The Authors of the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne;
    </p>
    <p>
     Gesner; Ray; Linnaeus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green; Artedi; Sibbald;
    </p>
    <p>
     Brisson; Marten; Lacepede; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron Cuvier; Frederick
    </p>
    <p>
     Cuvier; John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross Browne;
    </p>
    <p>
     the Author of Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and the Rev. T. Cheever.  But to
    </p>
    <p>
     what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written, the above
    </p>
    <p>
     cited extracts will show.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of the names in this list of whale authors only those following Owen ever
    </p>
    <p>
     saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer
    </p>
    <p>
     and whaleman.  I mean Captain Scoresby.  On the separate subject
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing authority.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning.
    </p>
    <p>
     And here be it said, that the Greenland whale is an usurper upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the throne of the seas.  He is not even by any means the largest
    </p>
    <p>
     of the whales.  Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the profound ignorance which till some seventy years back,
    </p>
    <p>
     invested the then fabulous and utterly unknown sperm-whale, and which
    </p>
    <p>
     ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific
    </p>
    <p>
     retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation has been every way complete.
    </p>
    <p>
     Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great
    </p>
    <p>
     poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas.  But the time
    </p>
    <p>
     has at last come for a new proclamation.  This is Charing Cross;
    </p>
    <p>
     hear ye! good people all,--the Greenland whale is deposed,--
    </p>
    <p>
     the great sperm whale now reigneth!
    </p>
    <p>
     There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living
    </p>
    <p>
     sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest degree
    </p>
    <p>
     succeed in the attempt.  Those books are Beale's and Bennett's;
    </p>
    <p>
     both in their time surgeons to the English South-Sea whale-ships,
    </p>
    <p>
     and both exact and reliable men.  The original matter touching
    </p>
    <p>
     the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small;
    </p>
    <p>
     but so far as it goes, it is of excellent quality, though mostly
    </p>
    <p>
     confined to scientific description.  As yet, however, the sperm whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     scientific or poetic, lives not complete in any literature.
    </p>
    <p>
     Far above all other hunted whales, his is an unwritten life.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular
    </p>
    <p>
     comprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for
    </p>
    <p>
     the present, hereafter to be filled in all-outward its departments
    </p>
    <p>
     by subsequent laborers.  As no better man advances to take
    </p>
    <p>
     this matter in hand, I hereupon offer my own poor endeavors.
    </p>
    <p>
     I promise nothing complete; because any human thing supposed
    </p>
    <p>
     to be complete must for that very reason infallibly be faulty.
    </p>
    <p>
     I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description
    </p>
    <p>
     of the various species, or--in this space at least--
    </p>
    <p>
     to much of any description.  My object here is simply
    </p>
    <p>
     to project the draught of a systematization of cetology.
    </p>
    <p>
     I am the architect, not the builder.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the Post-Office
    </p>
    <p>
     is equal to it.  To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them;
    </p>
    <p>
     to have one's hands among the unspeakable foundations, ribs,
    </p>
    <p>
     and very pelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     What am I that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan!
    </p>
    <p>
     The awful tauntings in Job might well appal me.  "Will he (the leviathan)
    </p>
    <p>
     make a covenant with thee?  Behold the hope of him is vain!
    </p>
    <p>
     But I have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans;
    </p>
    <p>
     I have had to do with whales with these visible hands; I am in earnest;
    </p>
    <p>
     and I will try.  There are some preliminaries to settle.
    </p>
    <p>
     First:  The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science
    </p>
    <p>
     of Cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact,
    </p>
    <p>
     that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether
    </p>
    <p>
     a whale be a fish.  In his System of Nature, A.D. 1776,
    </p>
    <p>
     Linnaeus declares, "I hereby separate the whales from the fish."
    </p>
    <p>
     But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850,
    </p>
    <p>
     sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against Linnaeus's
    </p>
    <p>
     express edict, were still found dividing the possession
    </p>
    <p>
     of the same seas with the Leviathan.
    </p>
    <p>
     The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished
    </p>
    <p>
     the whales from the waters, he states as follows:  "On account
    </p>
    <p>
     of their warm bilocular heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids,
    </p>
    <p>
     their hollow ears, penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,"
    </p>
    <p>
     and finally, "ex lege naturae jure meritoque."  I submitted all
    </p>
    <p>
     this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket,
    </p>
    <p>
     both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and they united in
    </p>
    <p>
     the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
     Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.
    </p>
    <p>
     Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned
    </p>
    <p>
     ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.
    </p>
    <p>
     This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal
    </p>
    <p>
     respect does the whale differ from other fish.  Above, Linnaeus has given
    </p>
    <p>
     you those items.  But in brief they are these:  lungs and warm blood;
    </p>
    <p>
     whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.
    </p>
    <p>
     Next:  how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals,
    </p>
    <p>
     so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come.
    </p>
    <p>
     To be short, then, a whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail.
    </p>
    <p>
     There you have him.  However contracted, that definition is the result
    </p>
    <p>
     of expanded meditation.  A walrus spouts much like a whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     but the walrus is not a fish, because he is amphibious.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the last term of the definition is still more cogent,
    </p>
    <p>
     as coupled with the first.  Almost any one must have noticed
    </p>
    <p>
     that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat,
    </p>
    <p>
     but a vertical, or up-and-down tail.  Whereas, among spouting fish
    </p>
    <p>
     the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes
    </p>
    <p>
     a horizontal position.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude
    </p>
    <p>
     from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified
    </p>
    <p>
     with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other hand,
    </p>
    <p>
     link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.* Hence,
    </p>
    <p>
     all the smaller, spouting and horizontal tailed fish must be included
    </p>
    <p>
     in this ground-plan of Cetology.  Now, then, come the grand divisions
    </p>
    <p>
     of the entire whale host.
    </p>
    <p>
     *I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled
    </p>
    <p>
     Lamatins and Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins
    </p>
    <p>
     of Nantucket) are included by many naturalists among the whales.
    </p>
    <p>
     But as these pig-fish are a noisy, contemptible set,
    </p>
    <p>
     mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on wet hay,
    </p>
    <p>
     and especially as they do not spout, I deny their credentials
    </p>
    <p>
     as whales; and have presented them with their passports to quit
    </p>
    <p>
     the Kingdom of Cetology.
    </p>
    <p>
     First:  According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary BOOKS
    </p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>
     (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them all,
    </head>
    <p>
     both small and large.
    </p>
    <p>
     I. THE FOLIO WHALE; II.  the OCTAVO WHALE; III.  the DUODECIMO WHALE.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the type of the FOLIO I present the Sperm Whale; of the OCTAVO,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Grampus; of the DUODECIMO, the Porpoise.
    </p>
    <p>
     FOLIOS.  Among these I here include the following chapters:--
    </p>
    <p>
     I. The Sperm Whale; II.  the Right Whale; III.  the Fin Back Whale; IV.
    </p>
    <p>
     the Humpbacked Whale; V. the Razor Back Whale; VI.
    </p>
    <p>
     the Sulphur Bottom Whale.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>
     BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER I. (Sperm Whale).--This whale,
    </head>
    <p>
     among the English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale and
    </p>
    <p>
     the Physeter whale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present
    </p>
    <p>
     Cachalot of the French, and the Pottsfich of the Germans,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words.  He is, without doubt,
    </p>
    <p>
     the largest inhabitant of the globe; the most formidable of all
    </p>
    <p>
     whales to encounter; the most majestic in aspect; and lastly,
    </p>
    <p>
     by far the most valuable in commerce; he being the only creature
    </p>
    <p>
     from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
     All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged upon.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     Philologically considered, it is absurd.  Some centuries ago,
    </p>
    <p>
     when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own
    </p>
    <p>
     proper individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally
    </p>
    <p>
     obtained from the stranded fish; in those days spermaceti,
    </p>
    <p>
     it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from
    </p>
    <p>
     a creature identical with the one then known in England as
    </p>
    <p>
     the Greenland or Right Whale.  It was the idea also, that this
    </p>
    <p>
     same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale
    </p>
    <p>
     which the first syllable of the word literally expresses.
    </p>
    <p>
     In those times, also, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce,
    </p>
    <p>
     not being used for light, but only as an ointment and medicament.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy
    </p>
    <p>
     an ounce of rhubarb.  When, as I opine, in the course of time,
    </p>
    <p>
     the true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name
    </p>
    <p>
     was still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its
    </p>
    <p>
     value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity.
    </p>
    <p>
     And so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>
     BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER II.  (Right Whale).--In one respect this
    </head>
    <p>
     is the most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first
    </p>
    <p>
     regularly hunted by man.  It yields the article commonly known
    </p>
    <p>
     as whalebone or baleen; and the oil specially known as "whale oil,"
    </p>
    <p>
     an inferior article in commerce.  Among the fishermen,
    </p>
    <p>
     he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles:
    </p>
    <p>
     The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black Whale; the Great Whale;
    </p>
    <p>
     the True Whale; the Right Whale.  There is a deal of obscurity
    </p>
    <p>
     concerning the Identity of the species thus multitudinously baptized.
    </p>
    <p>
     What then is the whale, which I include in the second species of
    </p>
    <p>
     my Folios?  It is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists;
    </p>
    <p>
     the Greenland Whale of the English Whalemen; the Baliene Ordinaire
    </p>
    <p>
     of the French whalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the Swedes.  It is
    </p>
    <p>
     the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted
    </p>
    <p>
     by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas; it is the whale
    </p>
    <p>
     which the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean,
    </p>
    <p>
     on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor' West Coast, and various other parts
    </p>
    <p>
     of the world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale
    </p>
    <p>
     of the English and the right whale of the Americans.  But they
    </p>
    <p>
     precisely agree in all their grand features; nor has there yet
    </p>
    <p>
     been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground
    </p>
    <p>
     a radical distinction.  It is by endless subdivisions based
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the most inconclusive differences, that some departments
    </p>
    <p>
     of natural history become so repellingly intricate.
    </p>
    <p>
     The right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length,

    <p>
     with reference to elucidating the sperm whale.

     BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER III.  (Fin-Back).--Under this head I reckon
    </head>
    <p>
     a monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout,
    </p>
    <p>
     and Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly
    </p>
    <p>
     the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers
    </p>
    <p>
     crossing the Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In
    </p>
    <p>
     the length he attains, and in his baleen, the Fin-back
    </p>
    <p>
     resembles the right whale, but is of a less portly girth,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a lighter color, approaching to olive.  His great lips present
    </p>
    <p>
     a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds
    </p>
    <p>
     of large wrinkles.  His grand distinguishing feature, the fin,
    </p>
    <p>
     from which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object.
    </p>
    <p>
     This fin is some three or four feet long, growing vertically
    </p>
    <p>
     from the hinder part of the back, of an angular shape,
    </p>
    <p>
     and with a very sharp pointed end.  Even if not the slightest
    </p>
    <p>
     other part of the creature be visible, this isolated fin will,
    </p>
    <p>
     at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with
    </p>
    <p>
     spherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts
    </p>
    <p>
     shadows upon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed
    </p>
    <p>
     that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial,
    </p>
    <p>
     with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on it.  On that Ahaz-dial
    </p>
    <p>
     the shadow often goes back.  The Fin-Back is not gregarious.
    </p>
    <p>
     He seems a whale-hater, as some men are man-haters. Very shy;
    </p>
    <p>
     always going solitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface
    </p>
    <p>
     in the remotest and most sullen waters; his straight and
    </p>
    <p>
     single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon
    </p>
    <p>
     a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity
    </p>
    <p>
     in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man;
    </p>
    <p>
     this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain
    </p>
    <p>
     of his race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back.
    </p>
    <p>
     From having the baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes
    </p>
    <p>
     included with the right whale, among a theoretic species
    </p>
    <p>
     denominated Whalebone whales, that is, whales with baleen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of these so-called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be
    </p>
    <p>
     several varieties, most of which, however, are little known.
    </p>
    <p>
     Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-headed whales;
    </p>
    <p>
     bunched whales; under-jawed whales and rostrated whales,
    </p>
    <p>
     are the fisherman's names for a few sorts.
    </p>
    <p>
     In connexion with this appellative of "Whalebone whales,"
    </p>
    <p>
     it is of great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature
    </p>
    <p>
     may be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales,
    </p>
    <p>
     yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan,
    </p>
    <p>
     founded upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth;
    </p>
    <p>
     notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously
    </p>
    <p>
     seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system
    </p>
    <p>
     of Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions,
    </p>
    <p>
     which the whale, in his kinds, presents.  How then?
    </p>
    <p>
     The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose
    </p>
    <p>
     peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales,
    </p>
    <p>
     without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure
    </p>
    <p>
     in other and more essential particulars.  Thus, the sperm whale and
    </p>
    <p>
     the humpbacked whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     each of these has baleen; but there again the similitude ceases.
    </p>
    <p>
     And it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
     In various sorts of whales, they form such irregular combinations;
    </p>
    <p>
     or, in the case of any one of them detached, such an irregular isolation;
    </p>
    <p>
     as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis.
    </p>
    <p>
     On this rock every one of the whale-naturalists has split.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts
    </p>
    <p>
     of the whale, in his anatomy--there, at least, we shall
    </p>
    <p>
     be able to hit the right classification.  Nay; what thing,
    </p>
    <p>
     for example, is there in the Greenland whale's anatomy more
    </p>
    <p>
     striking than his baleen?  Yet we have seen that by his baleen
    </p>
    <p>
     it is impossible correctly to classify the Greenland whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     And if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans,
    </p>
    <p>
     why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available
    </p>
    <p>
     to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated.
    </p>
    <p>
     What then remains? nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily,
    </p>
    <p>
     in their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that way.
    </p>
    <p>
     And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted;
    </p>
    <p>
     and it is the only one that can possibly succeed, for it alone
    </p>
    <p>
     is practicable.  To proceed.

     *Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those
    </p>
    <p>
     of the former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness
    </p>
    <p>
     to them in figure, yet the bookbinder's Quarto volume in its
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
     But possessing all the grand distinctive features of

     the leviathan, most naturalists have recognised him for one.

     He is of moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to twenty-five

     feet in length, and of corresponding dimensions round the waist.

    </p>
    <p>
     Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so,
    </p>
    <p>
     and suggest another.  I do so now touching the Black Fish,
    </p>
    <p>
     so called because blackness is the rule among almost
    </p>
    <p>
     all whales.  So, call him the Hyena Whale, if you please.
    </p>
    <p>
     His voracity is well known and from the circumstance
    </p>
    <p>
     that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards,
    </p>
    <p>
     he carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
     This whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length.
    </p>
    <p>
     He is found in almost all latitudes.  He has a peculiar way
    </p>
    <p>
     of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming, which looks
    </p>
    <p>
     something like a Roman nose.  When not more profitably employed,
    </p>
    <p>
     the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment--
    </p>
    <p>
     as some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite
    </p>
    <p>
     alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will
    </p>
    <p>
     yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil.

    <p>
     Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose
    </p>
    <p>
     from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose.
    </p>
    <p>
     The creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages
    </p>
    <p>
     five feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Strictly speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out
    </p>
    <p>
     from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it is only found on the sinister side, which has an ill effect,
    </p>
    <p>
     giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy
    </p>
    <p>
     left-handed man.  What precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers,
    </p>
    <p>
     it would be hard to say.  It does not seem to be used like the blade
    </p>
    <p>
     of the sword-fish and bill-fish; though some sailors tell me that
    </p>
    <p>
     the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of
    </p>
    <p>
     the sea for food.  Charley Coffin said it was used for an ice-piercer;
    </p>
    <p>
     for the Narwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar Sea, and finding
    </p>
    <p>
     it sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so breaks through.
    </p>
    <p>
     But you cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct.
    </p>
    <p>
     My own opinion is, that however this one-sided horn may really
    </p>
    <p>
     be used by the Narwhale--however that may be--it would certainly
    </p>
    <p>
     be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the Horned whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the Unicorn whale.  He is certainly a curious example of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature.
    </p>
    <p>
     From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same
    </p>
    <p>
     sea-unicorn's horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote
    </p>
    <p>
     against poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies the same
    </p>
    <p>
     way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn.
    </p>
    <p>
     Originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Black Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that
    </p>
    <p>
     voyage, when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from
    </p>
    <p>
     a window of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the Thames;
    </p>
    <p>
     "when Sir Martin returned from that voyage," saith Black Letter,
    </p>
    <p>
     "on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Narwhale, which for a long period after hung in the castle
    </p>
    <p>
     at Windsor."  An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester,
    </p>
    <p>
     on bended knees, did likewise present to her highness another horn,
    </p>
    <p>
     pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a
    </p>
    <p>
     milk-white ground color, dotted with round and oblong spots of black.
    </p>
    <p>
     His oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it,
    </p>
    <p>
     and he is seldom hunted.  He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.

    <p>
     of him at a distance, I should say that he was about the bigness

    <p>
     and something must be done to distinguish them.  I call him thus,

     exceedingly valuable.  It is in request among jewellers and watchmakers.

    <p>
     The white comprises part of his head, and the whole of his mouth,

    </p>
    <p>
     Beyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed,
    </p>
    <p>
     inasmuch as the Porpoise is the smallest of the whales.
    </p>
    <p>
     Above, you have all the Leviathans of note.  But there are a rabble
    </p>
    <p>
     of uncertain, fugitive, half-fabulous whales, which, as an
    </p>
    <p>
     American whaleman, I know by reputation, but not personally.
    </p>
    <p>
     I shall enumerate them by their fore-castle appellations;
    </p>
    <p>
     for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators,
    </p>
    <p>
     who may complete what I have here but begun.  If any of
    </p>
    <p>
     the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked,
    </p>
    <p>
     then he can readily be incorporated into this System,
    </p>
    <p>
     according to his Folio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:--
    </p>
    <p>
     The Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale;
    </p>
    <p>
     the Cape Whale; the Leading Whale; the Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale;
    </p>
    <p>
     the Coppered Whale; the Elephant Whale; the Iceberg Whale;
    </p>
    <p>
     the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; &amp;c. From Icelandic, Dutch,
    </p>
    <p>
     and old English authorities, there might be quoted other lists
    </p>
    <p>
     of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth names.
    </p>
    <p>
     But I omit them as altogether obsolete; and can hardly help
    </p>
    <p>
     suspecting them for mere sounds, full of Leviathanism,
    </p>
    <p>
     but signifying nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally:  It was stated at the outset, that this system would not
    </p>
    <p>
     be here, and at once, perfected.  You cannot but plainly see that I
    </p>
    <p>
     have kept my word.  But I now leave my cetological System standing
    </p>
    <p>
     thus unfinished, even as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left,
    </p>
    <p>
     with the cranes still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower.
    </p>
    <p>
     For small erections may be finished by their first architects;
    </p>
    <p>
     grand ones, true ones, ever leave the copestone to posterity.
    </p>
    <p>
     God keep me from ever completing anything.  This whole
    </p>
    <p>
     book is but a draught--nay, but the draught of a draught.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience!

     CHAPTER 33
    </head>
    <p>
     The Specksynder
    </p>
    <p>
     Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place
    </p>
    <p>
     as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board,
    </p>
    <p>
     arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers,
    </p>
    <p>
     a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.
    </p>
    <p>
     The large importance attached to the harpooneer's vocation is
    </p>
    <p>
     evinced by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery,
    </p>
    <p>
     two centuries and more ago, the command of a whale-ship was not
    </p>
    <p>
     wholly lodged in the person now called the captain, but was divided
    </p>
    <p>
     between him and an officer called the Specksynder.  Literally this
    </p>
    <p>
     word means Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time made it equivalent
    </p>
    <p>
     to Chief Harpooneer.  In those days, the captain's authority was
    </p>
    <p>
     restricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel;
    </p>
    <p>
     while over the whale-hunting department and all its concerns,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Specksynder or Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted title
    </p>
    <p>
     of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained,
    </p>
    <p>
     but his former dignity is sadly abridged.  At present he ranks simply
    </p>
    <p>
     as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain's
    </p>
    <p>
     more inferior subalterns.  Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct
    </p>
    <p>
     of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends,
    </p>
    <p>
     and since in the American Fishery he is not only an important
    </p>
    <p>
     officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night watches
    </p>
    <p>
     on a whaling ground) the command of the ship's deck is also his;
    </p>
    <p>
     therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands,
    </p>
    <p>
     that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast,
    </p>
    <p>
     and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior;
    </p>
    <p>
     though always, by them, familiarly regarded as their social equal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man
    </p>
    <p>
     at sea, is this--the first lives aft, the last forward.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hence, in whale-ships and merchantmen alike, the mates have their
    </p>
    <p>
     quarters with the captain; and so, too, in most of the American
    </p>
    <p>
     whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
     That is to say, they take their meals in the captain's cabin,
    </p>
    <p>
     and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage
    </p>
    <p>
     (by far the longest of all voyages now or ever made by man),
    </p>
    <p>
     the peculiar perils of it, and the community of interest
    </p>
    <p>
     prevailing among a company, all of whom, high or low, depend for
    </p>
    <p>
     their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their common luck,
    </p>
    <p>
     together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and hard work;
    </p>
    <p>
     though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less
    </p>
    <p>
     rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind
    </p>
    <p>
     how much like an old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may,
    </p>
    <p>
     in some primitive instances, live together; for all that,
    </p>
    <p>
     the punctilious externals, at least, of the quarter-deck
    </p>
    <p>
     are seldom materially relaxed, and in no instance done away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see
    </p>
    <p>
     the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur
    </p>
    <p>
     not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost
    </p>
    <p>
     as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple,
    </p>
    <p>
     and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
     And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod
    </p>
    <p>
     was the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption;
    </p>
    <p>
     and though the only homage he ever exacted, was implicit,
    </p>
    <p>
     instantaneous obedience; though he required no man to remove
    </p>
    <p>
     the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter-deck;
    </p>
    <p>
     and though there were times when, owing to peculiar circumstances
    </p>
    <p>
     connected with events hereafter to be detailed, he addressed
    </p>
    <p>
     them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or in terrorem,
    </p>
    <p>
     or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means unobservant
    </p>
    <p>
     of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind
    </p>
    <p>
     those forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself;
    </p>
    <p>
     incidentally making use of them for other and more private
    </p>
    <p>
     ends than they were legitimately intended to subserve.
    </p>
    <p>
     That certain sultanism of his brain, which had otherwise in a
    </p>
    <p>
     good degree remained unmanifested; through those forms that same
    </p>
    <p>
     sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship.
    </p>
    <p>
     For be a man's intellectual superiority what it will, it can
    </p>
    <p>
     never assume the practical, available supremacy over other men,
    </p>
    <p>
     without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments,
    </p>
    <p>
     always, in themselves, more or less paltry and base.
    </p>
    <p>
     This it is, that for ever keeps God's true princes of the Empire
    </p>
    <p>
     from the world's hustings; and leaves the highest honors that this
    </p>
    <p>
     air can give, to those men who become famous more through their
    </p>
    <p>
     infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the Divine Inert,
    </p>
    <p>
     than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level
    </p>
    <p>
     of the mass.  Such large virtue lurks in these small things when
    </p>
    <p>
     extreme political superstitions invest them, that in some royal
    </p>
    <p>
     instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency.
    </p>
    <p>
     But when, as in the case of Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown
    </p>
    <p>
     of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain; then, the plebeian
    </p>
    <p>
     herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor, will the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness
    </p>
    <p>
     in its fullest sweep and direct swing, ever forget a hint,
    </p>
    <p>
     incidentally so important in his art, as the one now alluded to.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket
    </p>
    <p>
     grimness and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors
    </p>
    <p>
     and Kings, I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old
    </p>
    <p>
     whale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings
    </p>
    <p>
     and housings are denied me.  Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee,
    </p>
    <p>
     it must needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived for in the deep,
    </p>
    <p>
     and featured in the unbodied air!

     CHAPTER 34
    </head>
    <p>
     The Cabin-Table
    </p>
    <p>
     It is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale loaf-of-bread
    </p>
    <p>
     face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord and master who,
    </p>
    <p>
     sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been taking an observation
    </p>
    <p>
     of the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth,
    </p>
    <p>
     medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that daily purpose on the upper
    </p>
    <p>
     part of his ivory leg.  From his complete inattention to the tidings,
    </p>
    <p>
     you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial.  But presently,
    </p>
    <p>
     catching hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to the deck,
    </p>
    <p>
     and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying, "Dinner, Mr. Starbuck,"
    </p>
    <p>
     disappears into the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the last echo of his sultan's step has died away, and Starbuck,
    </p>
    <p>
     the first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated,
    </p>
    <p>
     then Starbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along
    </p>
    <p>
     the planks, and, after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some
    </p>
    <p>
     touch of pleasantness, "Dinner, Mr. Stubb," and descends the scuttle.
    </p>
    <p>
     The second Emir lounges about the rigging awhile, and then slightly
    </p>
    <p>
     shaking the main brace, to see whether it will be all right with that
    </p>
    <p>
     important rope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a rapid
    </p>
    <p>
     "Dinner, Mr. Flask," follows after his predecessors.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,
    </p>
    <p>
     seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all
    </p>
    <p>
     sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off
    </p>
    <p>
     his shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe
    </p>
    <p>
     right over the Grand Turk's head; and then, by a dexterous sleight,
    </p>
    <p>
     pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down
    </p>
    <p>
     rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck,
    </p>
    <p>
     reversing all other processions, by bringing up the rear with music.
    </p>
    <p>
     But ere stepping into the cabin doorway below, he pauses,
    </p>
    <p>
     ships a new face altogether, and, then, independent, hilarious little
    </p>
    <p>
     Flask enters King Ahab's presence, in the character of Abjectus,
    </p>
    <p>
     or the Slave.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense
    </p>
    <p>
     artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck
    </p>
    <p>
     some officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly
    </p>
    <p>
     and defyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one,
    </p>
    <p>
     let those very officers the next moment go down to their
    </p>
    <p>
     customary dinner in that same commander's cabin, and straightway
    </p>
    <p>
     their inoffensive, not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him,
    </p>
    <p>
     as he sits at the head of the table; this is marvellous,
    </p>
    <p>
     sometimes most comical.  Wherefore this difference?  A problem?
    </p>
    <p>
     Perhaps not.  To have been Belshazzar, King of Babylon;
    </p>
    <p>
     and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously,
    </p>
    <p>
     therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur.
    </p>
    <p>
     But he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides
    </p>
    <p>
     over his own private dinner-table of invited guests, that man's
    </p>
    <p>
     unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the time;
    </p>
    <p>
     that man's royalty of state transcends Belshazzar's, for Belshazzar
    </p>
    <p>
     was not the greatest.  Who has but once dined his friends, has tasted
    </p>
    <p>
     what it is to be Caesar.  It is a witchery of social czarship
    </p>
    <p>
     which there is no withstanding.  Now, if to this consideration
    </p>
    <p>
     you super-add the official supremacy of a ship-master, then,
    </p>
    <p>
     by inference, you will derive the cause of that peculiarity
    </p>
    <p>
     of sea-life just mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned sea-lion
    </p>
    <p>
     on the white coral beach, surrounded by his war-like but still
    </p>
    <p>
     deferential cubs.  In his own proper turn, each officer waited
    </p>
    <p>
     to be served.  They were as little children before Ahab; and yet,
    </p>
    <p>
     in Ahab, there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance.
    </p>
    <p>
     With one mind, their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man's knife,
    </p>
    <p>
     as he carved the chief dish before him.  I do not suppose that for the
    </p>
    <p>
     world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation,
    </p>
    <p>
     even upon so neutral a topic as the weather.  No!  And when reaching
    </p>
    <p>
     out his knife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked,
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck's plate towards him, the mate
    </p>
    <p>
     received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly;
    </p>
    <p>
     and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate;
    </p>
    <p>
     and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without circumspection.
    </p>
    <p>
     For, like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the German Emperor
    </p>
    <p>
     profoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these cabin
    </p>
    <p>
     meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at
    </p>
    <p>
     table old Ahab forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
     What a relief it was to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden
    </p>
    <p>
     racket in the hold below.  And poor little Flask, he was
    </p>
    <p>
     the youngest son, and little boy of this weary family party.
    </p>
    <p>
     His were the shin-bones of the saline beef; his would have been
    </p>
    <p>
     the drumsticks.  For Flask to have presumed to help himself,
    </p>
    <p>
     this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree.
    </p>
    <p>
     Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more would
    </p>
    <p>
     he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world;
    </p>
    <p>
     nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him.  And had Flask
    </p>
    <p>
     helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Least of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him,
    </p>
    <p>
     on account of its clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether
    </p>
    <p>
     he deemed that, on so long a voyage in such marketless waters,
    </p>
    <p>
     butter was at a premium, and therefore was not for him, a subaltern;
    </p>
    <p>
     however it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!
    </p>
    <p>
     Another thing.  Flask was the last person down at the dinner,
    </p>
    <p>
     and Flask is the first man up.  Consider!  For hereby Flask's
    </p>
    <p>
     dinner was badly jammed in point of time.  Starbuck and Stubb
    </p>
    <p>
     both had the start of him; and yet they also have the privilege
    </p>
    <p>
     of lounging in the rear.  If Stubb even, who is but a peg higher
    </p>
    <p>
     than Flask, happens to have but a small appetite, and soon shows
    </p>
    <p>
     symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask must bestir himself,
    </p>
    <p>
     he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day; for it
    </p>
    <p>
     is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
     Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private,
    </p>
    <p>
     that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer,
    </p>
    <p>
     from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise
    </p>
    <p>
     than hungry, more or less.  For what he ate did not so much relieve
    </p>
    <p>
     his hunger, as keep it immortal in him.  Peace and satisfaction,
    </p>
    <p>
     thought Flask, have for ever departed from my stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
     I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fist a bit of old-fashioned
    </p>
    <p>
     beef in the fore-castle, as I used to when I was before the mast.
    </p>
    <p>
     There's the fruits of promotion now; there's the vanity of glory:
    </p>
    <p>
     there's the insanity of life!  Besides, if it were so that
    </p>
    <p>
     any mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask
    </p>
    <p>
     in Flask's official capacity, all that sailor had to do,
    </p>
    <p>
     in order to obtain ample vengeance, was to go aft at dinnertime,
    </p>
    <p>
     and get a peep at Flask through the cabin sky-light, sitting
    </p>
    <p>
     silly and dumfoundered before awful Ahab.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first
    </p>
    <p>
     table in the Pequod's cabin.  After their departure, taking place
    </p>
    <p>
     in inverted order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared,
    </p>
    <p>
     or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being
    </p>
    <p>
     its residuary legatees.  They made a sort of temporary servants'
    </p>
    <p>
     hall of the high and mighty cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
     In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint
    </p>
    <p>
     and nameless invisible domineerings of the captain's table,
    </p>
    <p>
     was the entire care-free license and ease, the almost frantic
    </p>
    <p>
     democracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers.
    </p>
    <p>
     While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid of the sound
    </p>
    <p>
     of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed
    </p>
    <p>
     their food with such a relish that there was a report to it.
    </p>
    <p>
     They dined like lords; they filled their bellies like Indian
    </p>
    <p>
     ships all day loading with spices.  Such portentous appetites
    </p>
    <p>
     had Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out the vacancies made
    </p>
    <p>
     by the previous repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was fain to bring
    </p>
    <p>
     on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the solid ox.
    </p>
    <p>
     And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with a
    </p>
    <p>
     nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly
    </p>
    <p>
     way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back,
    </p>
    <p>
     harpoon-wise. And once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor,
    </p>
    <p>
     assisted Dough-Boy's memory by snatching him up bodily,
    </p>
    <p>
     and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher,
    </p>
    <p>
     while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the circle
    </p>
    <p>
     preliminary to scalping him.  He was naturally a very nervous,
    </p>
    <p>
     shuddering sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward;
    </p>
    <p>
     the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
     And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages,
    </p>
    <p>
     Dough-Boy's whole life was one continual lip-quiver. Commonly,
    </p>
    <p>
     after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded,
    </p>
    <p>
     he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining,
    </p>
    <p>
     and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door,
    </p>
    <p>
     till all was over.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego,
    </p>
    <p>
     opposing his filed teeth to the Indian's; crosswise to them,
    </p>
    <p>
     Daggoo seated on the floor, for a bench would have brought
    </p>
    <p>
     his hearse-plumed head to the low carlines; at every motion
    </p>
    <p>
     of his colossal limbs, making the low cabin framework to shake,
    </p>
    <p>
     as when an African elephant goes passenger in a ship.
    </p>
    <p>
     But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious,
    </p>
    <p>
     not to say dainty.  It seemed hardly possible that by such
    </p>
    <p>
     comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality
    </p>
    <p>
     diffused through so broad, baronial, and superb a person.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, doubtless, this noble savage fed strong and drank deep
    </p>
    <p>
     of the abounding element of air; and through his dilated
    </p>
    <p>
     nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not by beef or by bread, are giants made or nourished.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Queequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating--
    </p>
    <p>
     an ugly sound enough--so much so, that the trembling Dough-Boy
    </p>
    <p>
     almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his
    </p>
    <p>
     own lean arms.  And when he would hear Tashtego singing out
    </p>
    <p>
     for him to produce himself, that his bones might be picked,
    </p>
    <p>
     the simple-witted Steward all but shattered the crockery hanging
    </p>
    <p>
     round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets,
    </p>
    <p>
     for their lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones,
    </p>
    <p>
     at dinner, they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives;
    </p>
    <p>
     that grating sound did not at all tend to tranquillize poor
    </p>
    <p>
     Dough-Boy. How could he forget that in his Island days, Queequeg,
    </p>
    <p>
     for one, must certainly have been guilty of some murderous,
    </p>
    <p>
     convivial indiscretion.  Alas!  Dough-Boy! hard fares the white waiter
    </p>
    <p>
     who waits upon cannibals.  Not a napkin should he carry on his arm,
    </p>
    <p>
     but a buckler.  In good time, though, to his great delight,
    </p>
    <p>
     the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to his credulous,
    </p>
    <p>
     fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones jingling in them
    </p>
    <p>
     at every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally
    </p>
    <p>
     lived there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits,
    </p>
    <p>
     they were scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just
    </p>
    <p>
     before sleeping-time, when they passed through it to their
    </p>
    <p>
     own peculiar quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
     In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American
    </p>
    <p>
     whale captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion
    </p>
    <p>
     that by rights the ship's cabin belongs to them; and that it is by
    </p>
    <p>
     courtesy alone that anybody else is, at any time, permitted there.
    </p>
    <p>
     So that, in real truth, the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might
    </p>
    <p>
     more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it.
    </p>
    <p>
     For when they did enter it, it was something as a streetdoor
    </p>
    <p>
     enters a house; turning inwards for a moment, only to be turned
    </p>
    <p>
     out the next; and, as a permanent thing, residing in the open air.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin was no companionship;
    </p>
    <p>
     socially, Ahab was inaccessible.  Though nominally included
    </p>
    <p>
     in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it.
    </p>
    <p>
     He lived in the world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived
    </p>
    <p>
     in settled Missouri.  And as when Spring and Summer had departed,
    </p>
    <p>
     that wild Logan of the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree,
    </p>
    <p>
     lived out the winter there, sucking his own paws; so, in his inclement,
    </p>
    <p>
     howling old age, Ahab's soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body,
    </p>
    <p>
     there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom!

     CHAPTER 35
    </head>
    <p>
     The Mast-Head
    </p>
    <p>
     It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation
    </p>
    <p>
     with the other seamen my first mast-head came round.
    </p>
    <p>
     In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned
    </p>
    <p>
     almost simultaneously with the vessel's leaving her port;
    </p>
    <p>
     even though she may have fifteen thousand miles, and more,
    </p>
    <p>
     to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground.  And if,
    </p>
    <p>
     after a three, four, or five years' voyage she is drawing nigh
    </p>
    <p>
     home with anything empty in her--say, an empty vial even--
    </p>
    <p>
     then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last! and not till
    </p>
    <p>
     her skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port, does she
    </p>
    <p>
     altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a very
    </p>
    <p>
     ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate here.
    </p>
    <p>
     I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the
    </p>
    <p>
     old Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them.
    </p>
    <p>
     For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless,
    </p>
    <p>
     by their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in
    </p>
    <p>
     all Asia, or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was put to it)
    </p>
    <p>
     as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by
    </p>
    <p>
     the board, in the dread gale of God's wrath; therefore, we cannot
    </p>
    <p>
     give these Babel builders priority over the Egyptians.  And that
    </p>
    <p>
     the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers, is an
    </p>
    <p>
     assertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists,
    </p>
    <p>
     that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes:
    </p>
    <p>
     a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stairlike formation
    </p>
    <p>
     of all four sides of those edifices; whereby, with prodigious long
    </p>
    <p>
     upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were wont to mount
    </p>
    <p>
     to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the look-outs of a
    </p>
    <p>
     modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
     In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit of old times,
    </p>
    <p>
     who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole
    </p>
    <p>
     latter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his food from
    </p>
    <p>
     the ground with a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance
    </p>
    <p>
     of a dauntless stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from
    </p>
    <p>
     his place by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly
    </p>
    <p>
     facing everything out to the last, literally died at his post.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of modern standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set;
    </p>
    <p>
     mere stone, iron, and bronze men; who, though well capable of facing
    </p>
    <p>
     out a stiff gale, are still entirely incompetent to the business
    </p>
    <p>
     of singing out upon discovering any strange sight.  There is Napoleon;
    </p>
    <p>
     who, upon the top of the column of Vendome stands with arms folded,
    </p>
    <p>
     some one hundred and fifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules
    </p>
    <p>
     the decks below, whether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis
    </p>
    <p>
     the Devil.  Great Washington, too, stands high aloft on his towering
    </p>
    <p>
     main-mast in Baltimore, and like one of Hercules' pillars, his column
    </p>
    <p>
     marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go.
    </p>
    <p>
     Admiral Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his
    </p>
    <p>
     mast-head in Trafalgar Square; and even when most obscured by that
    </p>
    <p>
     London smoke, token is yet given that a hidden hero is there;
    </p>
    <p>
     for where there is smoke, must be fire.  But neither great Washington,
    </p>
    <p>
     nor Napoleon, nor Nelson, will answer a single hail from below,
    </p>
    <p>
     however madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted
    </p>
    <p>
     decks upon which they gaze; however it may be surmised,
    </p>
    <p>
     that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future,
    </p>
    <p>
     and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned.
    </p>
    <p>
     It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head standers
    </p>
    <p>
     of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is not so,
    </p>
    <p>
     is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole historian
    </p>
    <p>
     of Nantucket, stands accountable.  The worthy Obed tells us, that in
    </p>
    <p>
     the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly launched in
    </p>
    <p>
     pursuit of the game, the people of that island erected lofty spars along
    </p>
    <p>
     the seacoast, to which the look-outs ascended by means of nailed cleats,
    </p>
    <p>
     something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house. A few years ago this same
    </p>
    <p>
     plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying
    </p>
    <p>
     the game, gave notice to the ready-manned boats nigh the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
     But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we then to the one proper
    </p>
    <p>
     mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea.  The three mast-heads are kept
    </p>
    <p>
     manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns
    </p>
    <p>
     (as at the helm), and relieving each other every two hours.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant
    </p>
    <p>
     the mast-head: nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful.
    </p>
    <p>
     There you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along
    </p>
    <p>
     the deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath you
    </p>
    <p>
     and between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at
    </p>
    <p>
     old Rhodes.  There you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     with nothing ruffled but the waves.  The tranced ship indolently rolls;
    </p>
    <p>
     the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness
    </p>
    <p>
     invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras with startling
    </p>
    <p>
     accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements;
    </p>
    <p>
     you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt securities; fall of stocks;
    </p>
    <p>
     are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner--
    </p>
    <p>
     for all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks,
    </p>
    <p>
     and your bill of fare is immutable.
    </p>
    <p>
     In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years'
    </p>
    <p>
     voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you
    </p>
    <p>
     spend at the mast-head would amount to several entire months.
    </p>
    <p>
     And it is much to be deplored that the place to which you devote
    </p>
    <p>
     so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life,
    </p>
    <p>
     should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a
    </p>
    <p>
     cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a comfortable localness
    </p>
    <p>
     of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock, a hearse,
    </p>
    <p>
     a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small
    </p>
    <p>
     and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
     Your most usual point of perch is the head of the t'
    </p>
    <p>
     gallant-mast, where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks
    </p>
    <p>
     (almost peculiar to whalemen) called the t' gallant crosstrees.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner feels about
    </p>
    <p>
     as cosy as he would standing on a bull's horns.  To be sure,
    </p>
    <p>
     in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you,
    </p>
    <p>
     in the shape of a watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest
    </p>
    <p>
     watch-coat is no more of a house than the unclad body;
    </p>
    <p>
     for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle,
    </p>
    <p>
     and cannot freely move about in it, nor even move out of it,
    </p>
    <p>
     without running great risk of perishing (like an ignorant pilgrim
    </p>
    <p>
     crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a watch-coat is not so much
    </p>
    <p>
     of a house as it is a mere envelope, or additional skin encasing you.
    </p>
    <p>
     You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body,
    </p>
    <p>
     and no more can you make a convenience closet of your watch-coat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads
    </p>
    <p>
     of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little
    </p>
    <p>
     tents or pulpits, called crow's-nests, in which the look-outs
    </p>
    <p>
     of a Greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather
    </p>
    <p>
     of the frozen seas.  In the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet,
    </p>
    <p>
     entitled "A Voyage among the Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     and incidentally for the re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies
    </p>
    <p>
     of Old Greenland;" in this admirable volume, all standers
    </p>
    <p>
     of mast-heads are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial
    </p>
    <p>
     account of the then recently invented crow's-nest of the Glacier,
    </p>
    <p>
     which was the name of Captain Sleet's good craft.
    </p>
    <p>
     He called it the Sleet's crow's-nest, in honor of himself;
    </p>
    <p>
     he being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all
    </p>
    <p>
     ridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own
    </p>
    <p>
     children after our own names (we fathers being the original
    </p>
    <p>
     inventors and patentees), so likewise should we denominate
    </p>
    <p>
     after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget.  In shape,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Sleet's crow's-nest is something like a large tierce or pipe;
    </p>
    <p>
     it is open above, however, where it is furnished with a movable
    </p>
    <p>
     sidescreen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale.
    </p>
    <p>
     Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into it
    </p>
    <p>
     through a little trap-hatch in the bottom.  On the after side,
    </p>
    <p>
     or side next the stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat,
    </p>
    <p>
     with a locker underneath for umbrellas, comforters, and coats.
    </p>
    <p>
     In front is a leather rack, in which to keep your speaking
    </p>
    <p>
     trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nautical conveniences.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in this
    </p>
    <p>
     crow's-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a rifle with him
    </p>
    <p>
     (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask and shot,
    </p>
    <p>
     for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or vagrant
    </p>
    <p>
     sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot successfully
    </p>
    <p>
     shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water,
    </p>
    <p>
     but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, it was plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe,
    </p>
    <p>
     as he does, all the little detailed conveniences of his crow's-nest;
    </p>
    <p>
     but though he so enlarges upon many of these, and though
    </p>
    <p>
     he treats us to a very scientific account of his experiments
    </p>
    <p>
     in this crow's-nest, with a small compass he kept there
    </p>
    <p>
     for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from
    </p>
    <p>
     what is called the "local attraction" of all binnacle magnets;
    </p>
    <p>
     an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in
    </p>
    <p>
     the ship's planks, and in the Glacier's case, perhaps, to there
    </p>
    <p>
     having been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew;
    </p>
    <p>
     I say, that though the Captain is very discreet and
    </p>
    <p>
     scientific here, yet, for all his learned "binnacle deviations,"
    </p>
    <p>
     "azimuth compass observations," and "approximate errors,"
    </p>
    <p>
     he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was not so much
    </p>
    <p>
     immersed in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail being
    </p>
    <p>
     attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little
    </p>
    <p>
     case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow's nest,
    </p>
    <p>
     within easy reach of his hand.  Though, upon the whole, I greatly
    </p>
    <p>
     admire and even love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain;
    </p>
    <p>
     yet I take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore
    </p>
    <p>
     that case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and comforter
    </p>
    <p>
     it must have been, while with mittened fingers and hooded head
    </p>
    <p>
     he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird's nest
    </p>
    <p>
     within three or four perches of the pole.
    </p>
    <p>
     But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft
    </p>
    <p>
     as Captain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage
    </p>
    <p>
     is greatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity
    </p>
    <p>
     of those seductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float.
    </p>
    <p>
     For one, I used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely,
    </p>
    <p>
     resting in the top to have a chat with Queequeg, or any one
    </p>
    <p>
     else off duty whom I might find there; then ascending a little
    </p>
    <p>
     way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the top-sail yard,
    </p>
    <p>
     take a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so at last
    </p>
    <p>
     mount to my ultimate destination.
    </p>
    <p>
     Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit
    </p>
    <p>
     that I kept but sorry guard.  With the problem of the universe
    </p>
    <p>
     revolving in me, how could I--being left completely to myself
    </p>
    <p>
     at such a thought-engendering altitude--how could I but lightly
    </p>
    <p>
     hold my obligations to observe all whaleships' standing orders,
    </p>
    <p>
     "Keep your weather eye open, and sing out every time."
    </p>
    <p>
     And let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners
    </p>
    <p>
     of Nantucket!  Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad
    </p>
    <p>
     with lean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness;
    </p>
    <p>
     and who offers to ship with the Phaedon instead of Bowditch in his head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Beware of such an one, I say:  your whales must be seen before they can
    </p>
    <p>
     be killed; and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes
    </p>
    <p>
     round the world, and never make you one pint of sperm the richer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor are these monitions at all unneeded.  For nowadays, the whale-fishery
    </p>
    <p>
     furnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded
    </p>
    <p>
     young men, disgusted with the corking care of earth, and seeking
    </p>
    <p>
     sentiment in tar and blubber.  Childe Harold not unfrequently perches
    </p>
    <p>
     himself upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship,
    </p>
    <p>
     and in moody phrase ejaculates:--
    </p>
    <p>
     "Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll!
    </p>
    <p>
     Ten thousand blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain."
    </p>
    <p>
     Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young
    </p>
    <p>
     philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient
    </p>
    <p>
     "interest" in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly
    </p>
    <p>
     lost to all honorable ambition, as that in their secret souls they
    </p>
    <p>
     would rather not see whales than otherwise.  But all in vain;
    </p>
    <p>
     those young Platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect;
    </p>
    <p>
     they are short-sighted; what use, then, to strain the visual nerve?
    </p>
    <p>
     They have left their opera-glasses at home.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, thou monkey," said a harpooneer to one of these lads,
    </p>
    <p>
     "we've been cruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast
    </p>
    <p>
     not raised a whale yet.  Whales are scarce as hen's teeth
    </p>
    <p>
     whenever thou art up here."  Perhaps they were; or perhaps
    </p>
    <p>
     there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon;
    </p>
    <p>
     but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of vacant,
    </p>
    <p>
     unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending
    </p>
    <p>
     cadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he loses his identity;
    </p>
    <p>
     takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of
    </p>
    <p>
     that deep, blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature;
    </p>
    <p>
     and every strange, half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing that eludes him;
    </p>
    <p>
     every dimly-discovered, uprising fin of some undiscernible form,
    </p>
    <p>
     seems to him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that
    </p>
    <p>
     only people the soul by continually flitting through it.
    </p>
    <p>
     In this enchanted mood, thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came;
    </p>
    <p>
     becomes diffused through time and space; like Crammer's
    </p>
    <p>
     sprinkled Pantheistic ashes, forming at last a part of every
    </p>
    <p>
     shore the round globe over.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted
    </p>
    <p>
     by a gently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea;
    </p>
    <p>
     by the sea, from the inscrutable tides of God.  But while
    </p>
    <p>
     this sleep, this dream is on ye, move your foot or hand an inch;
    </p>
    <p>
     slip your hold at all; and your identity comes back in horror.
    </p>
    <p>
     Over Descartian vortices you hover.  And perhaps, at midday,
    </p>
    <p>
     in the fairest weather, with one half-throttled shriek you drop through
    </p>
    <p>
     that transparent air into the summer sea, no more to rise for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
     Heed it well, ye Pantheists!

     CHAPTER 36
    </head>
    <p>
     The Quarter-Deck
    </p>
    <p>
     (Enter Ahab:  Then, all)
    </p>
    <p>
     It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe,
    </p>
    <p>
     that one morning shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont,
    </p>
    <p>
     ascended the cabin-gangway to the deck.  There most sea-captains
    </p>
    <p>
     usually walk at that hour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal,
    </p>
    <p>
     take a few turns in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
     Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his
    </p>
    <p>
     old rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all
    </p>
    <p>
     over dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk.
    </p>
    <p>
     Did you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow;
    </p>
    <p>
     there also, you would see still stranger foot-prints--the foot-prints
    </p>
    <p>
     of his one unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper,
    </p>
    <p>
     even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark.
    </p>
    <p>
     And, so full of his thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn
    </p>
    <p>
     that he made, now at the main-mast and now at the binnacle,
    </p>
    <p>
     you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned,
    </p>
    <p>
     and pace in him as he paced; so completely possessing him, indeed,
    </p>
    <p>
     that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement.
    </p>
    <p>
     "D'ye mark him, Flask?" whispered Stubb; "the chick that's in him
    </p>
    <p>
     pecks the shell.  'Twill soon be out."
    </p>
    <p>
     The hours wore on;--Ahab now shut up within his cabin;
    </p>
    <p>
     anon, pacing the deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose
    </p>
    <p>
     in his aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
     It drew near the close of day.  Suddenly he came to a halt by
    </p>
    <p>
     the bulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there,
    </p>
    <p>
     and with one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck
    </p>
    <p>
     to send everybody aft.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sir!" said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given
    </p>
    <p>
     on ship-board except in some extraordinary case.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Send everybody aft," repeated Ahab.  "Mast-heads, there! come down!"
    </p>
    <p>
     When the entire ship's company were assembled, and with curious
    </p>
    <p>
     and not wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked
    </p>
    <p>
     not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab,
    </p>
    <p>
     after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his
    </p>
    <p>
     eyes among the crew, started from his standpoint; and as though
    </p>
    <p>
     not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
     With bent head and half-slouched hat he continued to pace,
    </p>
    <p>
     unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men; till Stubb
    </p>
    <p>
     cautiously whispered to Flask, that Ahab must have summoned
    </p>
    <p>
     them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat.
    </p>
    <p>
     But this did not last long.  Vehemently pausing, he cried:--
    </p>
    <p>
     "What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sing out for him!" was the impulsive rejoinder from a score
    </p>
    <p>
     of clubbed voices.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good!" cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones;
    </p>
    <p>
     observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected question
    </p>
    <p>
     had so magnetically thrown them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And what do ye next, men?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Lower away, and after him!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "And what tune is it ye pull to, men?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "A dead whale or a stove boat!"
    </p>
    <p>
     More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving,
    </p>
    <p>
     grew the countenance of the old man at every shout;
    </p>
    <p>
     while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other,
    </p>
    <p>
     as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so excited
    </p>
    <p>
     at such seemingly purposeless questions.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his
    </p>
    <p>
     pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly,
    </p>
    <p>
     almost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:--
    </p>
    <p>
     "All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a
    </p>
    <p>
     white whale.  Look ye! d'ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?"--holding up
    </p>
    <p>
     a broad bright coin to the sun--"it is a sixteen dollar piece, men.
    </p>
    <p>
     D'ye see it?  Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul."
    </p>
    <p>
     While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking,
    </p>
    <p>
     was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket,
    </p>
    <p>
     as if to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was
    </p>
    <p>
     meanwhile lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely
    </p>
    <p>
     muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming
    </p>
    <p>
     of the wheels of his vitality in him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast
    </p>
    <p>
     with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the other,
    </p>
    <p>
     and with a high raised voice exclaiming:  "Whosoever of ye raises
    </p>
    <p>
     me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw;
    </p>
    <p>
     whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes
    </p>
    <p>
     punctured in his starboard fluke--look ye, whosoever of ye raises me
    </p>
    <p>
     that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Huzza! huzza!" cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins
    </p>
    <p>
     they hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's a white whale, I say," resumed Ahab, as he threw down the topmaul:
    </p>
    <p>
     "a white whale.  Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for white water;
    </p>
    <p>
     if ye see but a bubble, sing out."
    </p>
    <p>
     All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even
    </p>
    <p>
     more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention
    </p>
    <p>
     of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was
    </p>
    <p>
     separately touched by some specific recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Captain Ahab," said Tashtego, "that white whale must be the same
    </p>
    <p>
     that some call Moby Dick."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Moby Dick?" shouted Ahab.  "Do ye know the white whale then, Tash?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?"
    </p>
    <p>
     said the Gay-Header deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And has he a curious spout, too," said Daggoo, "very bushy,
    </p>
    <p>
     even for a parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "And he have one, two, tree--oh! good many iron in him hide,
    </p>
    <p>
     too, Captain," cried Queequeg disjointedly, "all twiske-tee be-twisk,
    </p>
    <p>
     like him--him-" faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand
    </p>
    <p>
     round and round as though uncorking a bottle--"like him--him-"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Corkscrew!" cried Ahab, "aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie
    </p>
    <p>
     all twisted and wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is
    </p>
    <p>
     a big one, like a whole shock of wheat, and white as a pile
    </p>
    <p>
     of our Nantucket wool after the great annual sheep-shearing;
    </p>
    <p>
     aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like a split jib in a squall.
    </p>
    <p>
     Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have seen--
    </p>
    <p>
     Moby Dick--Moby Dick!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Captain Ahab," said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus
    </p>
    <p>
     far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Captain Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick--but it was not Moby Dick
    </p>
    <p>
     that took off thy leg?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Who told thee that?" cried Ahab; then pausing, "Aye, Starbuck;
    </p>
    <p>
     aye, my hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me;
    </p>
    <p>
     Moby Dick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now.
    </p>
    <p>
     Aye, aye," he shouted with a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of
    </p>
    <p>
     a heart-stricken moose; "Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale
    </p>
    <p>
     that razeed me; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Then tossing both arms, with measureless imprecations he shouted out:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, aye! and I'll chase him round Good Hope, and round the Horn,
    </p>
    <p>
     and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition's flames
    </p>
    <p>
     before I give him up.  And this is what ye have shipped for,
    </p>
    <p>
     men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land, and over all
    </p>
    <p>
     sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out.
    </p>
    <p>
     What say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now?  I think ye
    </p>
    <p>
     do look brave."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, aye!" shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer
    </p>
    <p>
     to the excited old man:  "A sharp eye for the White Whale;
    </p>
    <p>
     a sharp lance for Moby Dick!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "God bless ye," he seemed to half sob and half shout.
    </p>
    <p>
     "God bless ye, men.  Steward! go draw the great measure of grog.
    </p>
    <p>
     But what's this long face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not
    </p>
    <p>
     chase the white whale! art not game for Moby Dick?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too,
    </p>
    <p>
     Captain Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow;
    </p>
    <p>
     but I came here to hunt whales, not my commander's vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
     How many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it,
    </p>
    <p>
     Captain Ahab? it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nantucket market!  Hoot!  But come closer, Starbuck;
    </p>
    <p>
     thou requirest a little lower layer.  If money's to be
    </p>
    <p>
     the measurer, man, and the accountants have computed their
    </p>
    <p>
     great counting-house the globe, by girdling it with guineas,
    </p>
    <p>
     one to every three parts of an inch; then, let me tell thee,
    </p>
    <p>
     that my vengeance will fetch a great premium here!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "He smites his chest," whispered Stubb, "what's that for? methinks it
    </p>
    <p>
     rings most vast, but hollow."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Vengeance on a dumb brute!" cried Starbuck, "that simply smote thee
    </p>
    <p>
     from blindest instinct!  Madness!  To be enraged with a dumb thing,
    </p>
    <p>
     Captain Ahab, seems blasphemous."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hark ye yet again--the little lower layer.  All visible objects, man,
    </p>
    <p>
     are but as pasteboard masks.  But in each event--in the living act,
    </p>
    <p>
     the undoubted deed--there, some unknown but still reasoning
    </p>
    <p>
     thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind
    </p>
    <p>
     the unreasoning mask.  If man will strike, strike through the mask!
    </p>
    <p>
     How can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall?
    </p>
    <p>
     To me, the white whale is that wall, shoved near to me.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sometimes I think there's naught beyond.  But 'tis enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous strength,
    </p>
    <p>
     with an inscrutable malice sinewing it.  That inscrutable
    </p>
    <p>
     thing is chiefly what I hate; and be the white whale agent,
    </p>
    <p>
     or be the white whale principal, I will wreak that hate upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Talk not to me of blasphemy, man; I'd strike the sun if it insulted me.
    </p>
    <p>
     For could the sun do that, then could I do the other; since there is ever
    </p>
    <p>
     a sort of fair play herein, jealousy presiding over all creations.
    </p>
    <p>
     But not my master, man, is even that fair play.  Who's over me?
    </p>
    <p>
     Truth hath no confines.  Take off thine eye! more intolerable
    </p>
    <p>
     than fiends' glarings is a doltish stare!  So, so; thou reddenest
    </p>
    <p>
     and palest; my heat has melted thee to anger-glow. But look ye,
    </p>
    <p>
     Starbuck, what is said in heat, that thing unsays itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are men from whom warm words are small indignity.
    </p>
    <p>
     I meant not to incense thee.  Let it go.  Look! see yonder Turkish
    </p>
    <p>
     cheeks of spotted tawn--living, breathing pictures painted by the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Pagan leopards--the unrecking and unworshipping things, that live;
    </p>
    <p>
     and seek, and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel!
    </p>
    <p>
     The crew, man, the crew!  Are they not one and all with Ahab, in this
    </p>
    <p>
     matter of the whale?  See Stubb! he laughs!  See yonder Chilian!
    </p>
    <p>
     he snorts to think of it.  Stand up amid the general hurricane,
    </p>
    <p>
     thy one tost sapling cannot, Starbuck!  And what is it?
    </p>
    <p>
     Reckon it.  'Tis but to help strike a fin; no wondrous feat
    </p>
    <p>
     for Starbuck.  What is it more?  From this one poor hunt,
    </p>
    <p>
     then, the best lance out of all Nantucket, surely he will not
    </p>
    <p>
     hang back, when every foremast-hand has clutched a whetstone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ah! constrainings seize thee; I see! the billow lifts thee!
    </p>
    <p>
     Speak, but speak!--Aye, aye! thy silence, then, that voices thee.
    </p>
    <p>
     (Aside) Something shot from my dilated nostrils, he has
    </p>
    <p>
     inhaled it in his lungs.  Starbuck now is mine; cannot oppose
    </p>
    <p>
     me now, without rebellion."
    </p>
    <p>
     "God keep me!--keep us all!" murmured Starbuck, lowly.
    </p>
    <p>
     But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate,
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low
    </p>
    <p>
     laugh from the hold; nor yet the presaging vibrations of
    </p>
    <p>
     the winds in the cordage; nor yet the hollow flap of the sails
    </p>
    <p>
     against the masts, as for a moment their hearts sank in.
    </p>
    <p>
     For again Starbuck's downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness
    </p>
    <p>
     of life; the subterranean laugh died away; the winds blew on;
    </p>
    <p>
     the sails filled out; the ship heaved and rolled as before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not when ye come?
    </p>
    <p>
     But rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye shadows!
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet not so much predictions from without, as verifications
    </p>
    <p>
     of the fore-going things within.  For with little external
    </p>
    <p>
     to constrain us, the innermost necessities in our being,
    </p>
    <p>
     these still drive us on.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The measure! the measure!" cried Ahab.
    </p>
    <p>
     Receiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers,
    </p>
    <p>
     he ordered them to produce their weapons.  Then ranging them
    </p>
    <p>
     before him near the capstan, with their harpoons in their hands,
    </p>
    <p>
     while his three mates stood at his side with their lances,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the rest of the ship's company formed a circle round the group;
    </p>
    <p>
     he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew.
    </p>
    <p>
     But those wild eyes met his, as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie
    </p>
    <p>
     wolves meet the eye of their leader, ere he rushes on at their head
    </p>
    <p>
     in the trail of the bison; but, alas! only to fall into the hidden
    </p>
    <p>
     snare of the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Drink and pass!" he cried, handing the heavy charged
    </p>
    <p>
     flagon to the nearest seaman.  "The crew alone now drink.
    </p>
    <p>
     Round with it, round!  Short draughts--long swallows, men;
    </p>
    <p>
     'tis hot as Satan's hoof.  So, so; it goes round excellently.
    </p>
    <p>
     It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the serpent-snapping eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well done; almost drained.  That way it went, this way it comes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hand it me--here's a hollow!  Men, ye seem the years;
    </p>
    <p>
     so brimming life is gulped and gone.  Steward, refill!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Attend now, my braves.  I have mustered ye all round this capstan;
    </p>
    <p>
     and ye mates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand there
    </p>
    <p>
     with your irons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may in some
    </p>
    <p>
     sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me.  O men,
    </p>
    <p>
     you will yet see that--Ha! boy, come back? bad pennies come not sooner.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hand it me.  Why, now, this pewter had run brimming again, wert not thou
    </p>
    <p>
     St. Vitus' imp--away, thou ague!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Advance, ye mates!  Cross your lances full before me.  Well done!
    </p>
    <p>
     Let me touch the axis."  So saying, with extended arm, he grasped
    </p>
    <p>
     the three level, radiating lances at their crossed centre;
    </p>
    <p>
     while so doing, suddenly and nervously twitched them;
    </p>
    <p>
     meanwhile glancing intently from Starbuck to Stubb; from Stubb
    </p>
    <p>
     to Flask.  It seemed as though, by some nameless, interior volition,
    </p>
    <p>
     he would fain have shocked into them the same fiery emotion
    </p>
    <p>
     accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own magnetic life.
    </p>
    <p>
     The three mates quailed before his strong, sustained, and mystic aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him; the honest eye of
    </p>
    <p>
     Starbuck fell downright.
    </p>
    <p>
     "In vain!" cried Ahab; "but, maybe, 'tis well.  For did ye three but once
    </p>
    <p>
     take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, that had perhaps
    </p>
    <p>
     expired from out me.  Perchance, too, it would have dropped ye dead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Perchance ye need it not.  Down lances!  And now, ye mates,
    </p>
    <p>
     I do appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there--
    </p>
    <p>
     yon three most honorable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant harpooneers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Disdain the task?  What, when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars,
    </p>
    <p>
     using his tiara for ewer?  Oh, my sweet cardinals! your own condescension,
    </p>
    <p>
     that shall bend ye to it.  I do not order ye; ye will it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Cut your seizings and draw the poles, ye harpooneers!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Silently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood
    </p>
    <p>
     with the detached iron part of their harpoons, some three
    </p>
    <p>
     feet long, held, barbs up, before him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Stab me not with that keen steel!  Cant them; cant them
    </p>
    <p>
     over! know ye not the goblet end?  Turn up the socket!
    </p>
    <p>
     So, so; now, ye cup-bearers, advance.  The irons! take them;
    </p>
    <p>
     hold them while I fill!"  Forthwith, slowly going from one officer
    </p>
    <p>
     to the other, he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the fiery
    </p>
    <p>
     waters from the pewter.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now, three to three, ye stand.  Commend the murderous chalices!
    </p>
    <p>
     Bestow them, ye who are now made parties to this
    </p>
    <p>
     indissoluble league.  Ha!  Starbuck! but the deed is done!
    </p>
    <p>
     Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon it.  Drink, ye harpooneers!
    </p>
    <p>
     drink and swear, ye men that man the deathful whaleboat's bow--
    </p>
    <p>
     Death to Moby Dick!  God hunt us all, if we do not hunt Moby Dick
    </p>
    <p>
     to his death!"  The long, barbed steel goblets were lifted;
    </p>
    <p>
     and to cries and maledictions against the white whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     Starbuck paled, and turned, and shivered.  Once more, and finally,
    </p>
    <p>
     the replenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew;
    </p>
    <p>
     when, waving his free hand to them, they all dispersed;
    </p>
    <p>
     and Ahab retired within his cabin.

    <p>
     The cabin; by the stern windows; Ahab sitting alone, and gazing out.
    </p>
    <p>
     I leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks,
    </p>
    <p>
     where'er I sail.  The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track;
    </p>
    <p>
     let them; but first I pass.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yonder, by the ever-brimming goblet's rim, the warm waves blush
    </p>
    <p>
     like wine.  The gold brow plumbs the blue.  The diver sun--
    </p>
    <p>
     slow dived from noon--goes down; my soul mounts up! she
    </p>
    <p>
     wearies with her endless hill.  Is, then, the crown too heavy
    </p>
    <p>
     that I wear? this Iron Crown of Lombardy.  Yet is it bright
    </p>
    <p>
     with many a gem; I the wearer, see not its far flashings;
    </p>
    <p>
     but darkly feel that I wear that, that dazzlingly confounds.
    </p>
    <p>
     'Tis iron--that I know--not gold.  'Tis split, too--that I feel;
    </p>
    <p>
     the jagged edge galls me so, my brain seems to beat against
    </p>
    <p>
     the solid metal; aye, steel skull, mine; the sort that needs
    </p>
    <p>
     no helmet in the most brain-battering fight!
    </p>
    <p>
     Dry heat upon my brow?  Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly
    </p>
    <p>
     spurred me, so the sunset soothed.  No more.  This lovely light,
    </p>
    <p>
     it lights not me; all loveliness is anguish to me, since I can
    </p>
    <p>
     ne'er enjoy.  Gifted with the high perception, I lack the low,
    </p>
    <p>
     enjoying power; damned, most subtly and most malignantly!
    </p>
    <p>
     damned in the midst of Paradise!  Good night--good night!
    </p>
    <p>
     (waving his hand, he moves from the window.)
    </p>
    <p>
     'Twas not so hard a task.  I thought to find one stubborn, at the least;
    </p>
    <p>
     but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels,
    </p>
    <p>
     and they revolve.  Or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder,
    </p>
    <p>
     they all stand before me; and I their match.  Oh, hard! that to
    </p>
    <p>
     fire others, the match itself must needs be wasting!  What I've dared,
    </p>
    <p>
     I've willed; and what I've willed, I'll do!  They think me mad--
    </p>
    <p>
     Starbuck does; but I'm demoniac, I am madness maddened!
    </p>
    <p>
     That wild madness that's only calm to comprehend itself!
    </p>
    <p>
     The prophecy was that I should be dismembered; and--Aye!  I lost
    </p>
    <p>
     this leg.  I now prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, then, be the prophet and the fulfiller one.  That's more than ye,
    </p>
    <p>
     ye great gods, ever were.  I laugh and hoot at ye, ye cricket-players,
    </p>
    <p>
     ye pugilists, ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes!  I will not
    </p>
    <p>
     say as schoolboys do to bullies--Take some one of your own size;
    </p>
    <p>
     don't pommel me!  No, ye've knocked me down, and I am up again;
    </p>
    <p>
     but ye have run and hidden.  Come forth from behind your cotton bags!
    </p>
    <p>
     I have no long gun to reach ye.  Come, Ahab's compliments to ye;
    </p>
    <p>
     come and see if ye can swerve me.  Swerve me? ye cannot swerve me,
    </p>
    <p>
     else ye swerve yourselves! man has ye there.  Swerve me?
    </p>
    <p>
     The path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my
    </p>
    <p>
     soul is grooved to run.  Over unsounded gorges, through the rifled
    </p>
    <p>
     hearts of mountains, under torrents' beds, unerringly I rush!
    </p>
    <p>
     Naught's an obstacle, naught's an angle to the iron way!

     Dusk

    <p>
     By the Mainmast; Starbuck leaning against it.
    </p>
    <p>
     My soul is more than matched; she's over-manned; and by a madman!
    </p>
    <p>
     Insufferable sting, that sanity should ground arms on such a field!
    </p>
    <p>
     But he drilled deep down, and blasted all my reason out of me!

    <p>
     I think I see his impious end; but feel that I must help him to it.

    <p>
     Will I, nill I, the ineffable thing has tied me to him; tows me with
    </p>
    <p>
     a cable I have no knife to cut.  Horrible old man!  Who's over him,

    <p>
     he cries;--aye, he would be a democrat to all above; look, how he lords
    </p>
    <p>
     it over all below!  Oh!  I plainly see my miserable office,--
    </p>
    <p>
     to obey, rebelling; and worse yet, to hate with touch of pity!
    </p>
    <p>
     For in his eyes I read some lurid woe would shrivel me up, had I it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet is there hope.  Time and tide flow wide.  The hated whale has
    </p>
    <p>
     the round watery world to swim in, as the small gold-fish has its
    </p>
    <p>
     glassy globe.  His heaven-insulting purpose, God may wedge aside.

     I would up heart, were it not like lead.  But my whole clock's run down;
    </p>
    <p>
     my heart the all-controlling weight, I have no key to lift again.
    </p>
    <p>
     [A burst of revelry from the forecastle.]
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, God! to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch
    </p>
    <p>
     of human mothers in them!  Whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     The white whale is their demigorgon.  Hark! the infernal orgies!
    </p>
    <p>
     that revelry is forward! mark the unfaltering silence aft!
    </p>
    <p>
     Methinks it pictures life.  Foremost through the sparkling sea
    </p>
    <p>
     shoots on the gay, embattled, bantering bow, but only to drag
    </p>
    <p>
     dark Ahab after it, where he broods within his sternward cabin,
    </p>
    <p>
     builded over the dead water of the wake, and further on,
    </p>
    <p>
     hunted by its wolfish gurglings.  The long howl thrills me through!
    </p>
    <p>
     Peace! ye revellers, and set the watch!  Oh, life! 'tis in an
    </p>
    <p>
     hour like this, with soul beat down and held to knowledge,--
    </p>
    <p>
     as wild, untutored things are forced to feed--Oh, life! 'tis
    </p>
    <p>
     now that I do feel the latent horror in thee! but 'tis not me!
    </p>
    <p>
     that horror's out of me, and with the soft feeling of the human
    </p>
    <p>
     in me, yet will I try to fight ye, ye grim, phantom futures!
    </p>
    <p>
     Stand by me, hold me, bind me, O ye blessed influences!

     First Night Watch
    </p>
    <p>
     (Stubb solus, and mending a brace.)
    </p>
    <p>
     Ha! ha! ha! ha! hem! clear my throat!--I've been thinking
    </p>
    <p>
     over it ever since, and that ha, ha's the final consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why so?  Because a laugh's the wisest, easiest answer to all
    </p>
    <p>
     that's queer; and come what will, one comfort's always left--
    </p>
    <p>
     that unfailing comfort is, it's all predestinated.
    </p>
    <p>
     I heard not all his talk with Starbuck; but to my poor eye
    </p>
    <p>
     Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Be sure the old Mogul has fixed him, too.  I twigged it, knew it;
    </p>
    <p>
     had had the gift, might readily have prophesied it--for when I
    </p>
    <p>
     clapped my eye upon his skull I saw it.  Well, Stubb, wise Stubb--
    </p>
    <p>
     that's my title--well, Stubb, what of it, Stubb?  Here's a carcase.
    </p>
    <p>
     I know not all that may be coming, but be it what it will,
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll go to it laughing.  Such a waggish leering as lurks
    </p>
    <p>
     in all your horribles!  I feel funny.  Fa, la! lirra, skirra!
    </p>
    <p>
     What's my juicy little pear at home doing now?  Crying its eyes out?--
    </p>
    <p>
     Giving a party to the last arrived harpooneers, I dare say,
    </p>
    <p>
     gay as a frigate's pennant, and so am I--fa, la! lirra, skirra!  Oh--
    </p>
    <p>
     We'll drink to-night with hearts as light,
    </p>
    <p>
     To love, as gay and fleeting
    </p>
    <p>
     As bubbles that swim, on the beaker's brim,
    </p>
    <p>
     And break on the lips while meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
     A brave stave that--who calls?  Mr. Starbuck?  Aye, aye, sir--
    </p>
    <p>
     (Aside) he's my superior, he has his too, if I'm not mistaken.--
    </p>
    <p>
     Aye, aye, sir, just through with this job--coming.

     1ST NANTUCKET SAILOR
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, boys, don't be sentimental.  it's bad for the digestion!
    </p>
    <p>
     Take a tonic, follow me!  (Sings, and all follow)
    </p>
    <p>
     Our captain stood upon the deck,
    </p>
    <p>
     A spy-glass in his hand,
    </p>
    <p>
     A viewing of those gallant whales
    </p>
    <p>
     That blew at every strand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, your tubs in your boats, my boys,
    </p>
    <p>
     And by your braces stand,
    </p>
    <p>
     And we'll have one of those fine whales,
    </p>
    <p>
     Hand, boys, over hand!
    </p>
    <p>
     So, be cheery, my lads! may your hearts never fail!

    <p>
     While the bold harpooneer is striking the whale!

     Eight bells there, forward!

    <p>
     2ND NANTUCKET SAILOR

    <p>
     Avast the chorus!  Eight bells there! d'ye hear, bell-boy? Strike
    </p>
    <p>
     the bell eight, thou Pip! thou blackling! and let me call the watch.
    </p>
    <p>
     I've the sort of mouth for that--the hogshead mouth.  So, so,
    </p>
    <p>
     (thrusts his head down the scuttle,) Star-bo-l-e-e-n-s, a-h-o-y!

    <p>
     Eight bells there below!  Tumble up!
    </p>
    <p>
     DUTCH SAILOR
    </p>
    <p>
     Grand snoozing to-night, maty; fat night for that.  I mark this in our old
    </p>
    <p>
     Mogul's wine; it's quite as deadening to some as filliping to others.
    </p>
    <p>
     We sing; they sleep--aye, lie down there, like ground-tier butts.
    </p>
    <p>
     At 'em again!  There, take this copper-pump, and hail 'em through it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tell 'em to avast dreaming of their lassies.  Tell 'em it's
    </p>
    <p>
     the resurrection; they must kiss their last, and come to judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
     That's the way--that's it; thy throat ain't spoiled with
    </p>
    <p>
     eating Amsterdam butter.
    </p>
    <p>
     FRENCH SAILOR
    </p>
    <p>
     Hist, boys! let's have a jig or two before we ride to anchor
    </p>
    <p>
     in Blanket Bay.  What say ye?  There comes the other watch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stand by all legs!  Pip! little Pip! hurrah with your tambourine!
    </p>
    <p>
     PIP (Sulky and sleepy)

     Don't know where it is.

     FRENCH SAILOR
    </p>
    <p>
     Beat thy belly, then, and wag thy ears.  Jig it, men, I say;
    </p>
    <p>
     merry's the word; hurrah!  Damn me, won't you dance?
    </p>
    <p>
     Form, now, Indian-file, and gallop into the double-shuffle?
    </p>
    <p>
     Throw yourselves!  Legs! legs!
    </p>
    <p>
     ICELAND SAILOR
    </p>
    <p>
     I don't like your floor, maty; it's too springy to my taste.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm used to ice-floors. I'm sorry to throw cold water on the subject;
    </p>
    <p>
     but excuse me.
    </p>
    <p>
     MALTESE SAILOR
    </p>
    <p>
     Me too; where's your girls?  Who but a fool would take his left hand
    </p>
    <p>
     by his right, and say to himself, how d'ye do?  Partners!  I must
    </p>
    <p>
     have partners!

     SICILIAN SAILOR

    <p>
     Well, well, ye sulkies, there's plenty more of us.
    </p>

     Hoe corn when you may, say I. All legs go to harvest soon.

     AZORE SAILOR (Ascending, and pitching the tambourine up the scuttle.)

    <p>
     up you mount!  Now, boys!
    </p>
    <p>
     (The half of them dance to the tambourine; some go below;

    <p>
     some sleep or lie among the coils of rigging.  Oaths a-plenty.)

    <p>
     AZORE SAILOR (Dancing)

    <p>
     Go it, Pip!  Bang it, bell-boy! Rig it, dig it, stig it, quig it,

    <p>
     I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what they are
    </p>

     dancing over.  I'll dance over your grave, I will--that's the bitterest
    </p>
    <p>
     threat of your night-women, that beat head-winds round corners.
    </p>
    <p>
     O Christ! to think of the green navies and the green-skulled crews!
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, well; belike the whole world's a ball, as you scholars
    </p>
    <p>
     have it; and so 'tis right to make one ballroom of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dance on, lads, you're young; I was once.

     Spell oh!--whew! this is worse than pulling after whales in a calm--
    </p>
    <p>
     give us a whiff, Tash.
    </p>
    <p>
     (They cease dancing, and gather in clusters.  Meantime the sky darkens--
    </p>
    <p>
     the wind rises.)

    <p>
     LASCAR SAILOR
    </p>
    <p>
     By Brahma! boys, it'll be douse sail soon.  The sky-born, high-tide
    </p>
    <p>
     Ganges turned to wind!  Thou showest thy black brow, Seeva!
    </p>
    <p>
     MALTESE SAILOR (Reclining and shaking his cap)
    </p>
    <p>
     It's the waves--the snow's caps turn to jig it now.
    </p>
    <p>
     They'll shake their tassels soon.  Now would all the waves
    </p>
    <p>
     were women, then I'd go drown, and chassee with them evermore!
    </p>
    <p>
     There's naught so sweet on earth--heaven may not match it!--
    </p>
    <p>
     as those swift glances of warm, wild bosoms in the dance,
    </p>
    <p>
     when the over-arboring arms hide such ripe, bursting grapes.
    </p>
    <p>
     SICILIAN SAILOR (Reclining)
    </p>
    <p>
     Tell me not of it!  Hark ye, lad--fleet interlacings of the limbs--
    </p>
    <p>
     lithe swayings--coyings--flutterings! lip! heart! hip! all graze:
    </p>
    <p>
     unceasing touch and go! not taste, observe ye, else come satiety.

     Eh, Pagan?  (Nudging.)

     TAHITAN SAILOR (Reclining on a mat)

    <p>
     Hail, holy nakedness of our dancing girls!--the Heeva-Heeva! Ah!
    </p>
    <p>
     low veiled, high palmed Tahiti!  I still rest me on thy mat,
    </p>
    <p>
     but the soft soil has slid!  I saw thee woven in the wood, my mat!
    </p>
    <p>
     green the first day I brought ye thence; now worn and wilted quite.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ah me!--not thou nor I can bear the change!  How then,
    </p>
    <p>
     if so be transplanted to yon sky?  Hear I the roaring streams from
    </p>
    <p>
     Pirohitee's peak of spears, when they leap down the crags and drown
    </p>
    <p>
     the villages?--The blast, the blast!  Up, spine, and meet it!

     go lunging presently.

     Well done!  The mate there holds ye to it stiffly.  He's no more
    </p>
    <p>
     afraid than the isle fort at Cattegat, put there to fight the Baltic
    </p>

    <p>
     none but the crew's cursed clay.  Steady, helmsman! steady.

    <p>
     This is the sort of weather when brave hearts snap ashore,

     look yonder, boys, there's another in the sky lurid--like, ye see,

     Jollies?  Lord help such jollies!  Crish, crash! there goes

    <p>
     the jib-stay! Blang-whang! God!  Duck lower, Pip, here comes
    </p>
    <p>
     the royal yard!  It's worse than being in the whirled woods,
    </p>
    <p>
     the last day of the year!  Who'd go climbing after chestnuts now?
    </p>
    <p>
     But there they go, all cursing, and here I don't. Fine prospects
    </p>
    <p>
     to 'em; they're on the road to heaven.  Hold on hard!
    </p>
    <p>
     Jimmini, what a squall!  But those chaps there are worse yet--
    </p>
    <p>
     they are your white squalls, they.  White squalls? white whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     shirr! shirr!  Here have I heard all their chat just now,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the white whale--shirr! shirr!--but spoken of once! and only
    </p>
    <p>
     this evening--it makes me jingle all over like my tambourine--
    </p>
    <p>
     that anaconda of an old man swore 'em in to hunt him!
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh! thou big white God aloft there somewhere in yon darkness,
    </p>
    <p>
     have mercy on this small black boy down here; preserve him
    </p>
    <p>
     from all men that have no bowels to feel fear!

     CHAPTER 41
    </head>
    <p>
     Moby Dick
    </p>
    <p>
     I, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the rest;
    </p>
    <p>
     my oath had been welded with theirs; and stronger I shouted, and more
    </p>
    <p>
     did I hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my soul.
    </p>
    <p>
     A wild, mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab's quenchless
    </p>
    <p>
     feud seemed mine.  With greedy ears I learned the history of that
    </p>
    <p>
     murderous monster against whom I and all the others had taken our oaths
    </p>
    <p>
     of violence and revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
     For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied,
    </p>
    <p>
     secluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly
    </p>
    <p>
     frequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen.  But not all of them
    </p>
    <p>
     knew of his existence; only a few of them, comparatively,
    </p>
    <p>
     had knowingly seen him; while the number who as yet had
    </p>
    <p>
     actually and knowingly given battle to him, was small indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
     For, owing to the large number of whale-cruisers; the disorderly
    </p>
    <p>
     way they were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference,
    </p>
    <p>
     many of them adventurously pushing their quest along
    </p>
    <p>
     solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth
    </p>
    <p>
     or more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling sail
    </p>
    <p>
     of any sort; the inordinate length of each separate voyage;
    </p>
    <p>
     the irregularity of the times of sailing from home; all these,
    </p>
    <p>
     with other circumstances, direct and indirect, long obstructed
    </p>
    <p>
     the spread through the whole world-wide whaling-fleet of the special
    </p>
    <p>
     individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick.  It was hardly
    </p>
    <p>
     to be doubted, that several vessels reported to have encountered,
    </p>
    <p>
     at such or such a time, or on such or such a meridian,
    </p>
    <p>
     a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity, which whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     after doing great mischief to his assailants, has completely
    </p>
    <p>
     escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair presumption,
    </p>
    <p>
     I say, that the whale in question must have been no other than
    </p>
    <p>
     Moby Dick.  Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been
    </p>
    <p>
     marked by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity,
    </p>
    <p>
     cunning, and malice in the monster attacked; therefore it was,
    </p>
    <p>
     that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick;
    </p>
    <p>
     such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, were content to ascribe
    </p>
    <p>
     the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it were, to the perils
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the individual cause.
    </p>
    <p>
     In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter between Ahab
    </p>
    <p>
     and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     by chance caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing
    </p>
    <p>
     they had every one of them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly
    </p>
    <p>
     lowered for him, as for any other whale of that species.
    </p>
    <p>
     But at length, such calamities did ensue in these assaults--
    </p>
    <p>
     not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken limbs,
    </p>
    <p>
     or devouring amputations--but fatal to the last degree of fatality;
    </p>
    <p>
     those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and piling
    </p>
    <p>
     their terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to
    </p>
    <p>
     shake the fortitude of many brave hunters, to whom the story
    </p>
    <p>
     of the White Whale had eventually come.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still
    </p>
    <p>
     the more horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters.
    </p>
    <p>
     For not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body
    </p>
    <p>
     of all surprising terrible events,--as the smitten tree gives birth
    </p>
    <p>
     to its fungi; but, in maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma,
    </p>
    <p>
     wild rumors abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them
    </p>
    <p>
     to cling to.  And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter,
    </p>
    <p>
     so the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life,
    </p>
    <p>
     in the wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes
    </p>
    <p>
     circulate there.  For not only are whalemen as a body unexempt
    </p>
    <p>
     from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors;
    </p>
    <p>
     but of all sailors, they are by all odds the most directly brought
    </p>
    <p>
     into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea;
    </p>
    <p>
     face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels, but, hand to jaw,
    </p>
    <p>
     give battle to them.  Alone, in such remotest waters, that though
    </p>
    <p>
     you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a thousand shores, you would
    </p>
    <p>
     not come to any chiselled hearth-stone, or aught hospitable beneath
    </p>
    <p>
     that part of the sun; in such latitudes and longitudes, pursuing too
    </p>
    <p>
     such a calling as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by influences
    </p>
    <p>
     all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth.
    </p>
    <p>
     No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit
    </p>
    <p>
     over the wildest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale
    </p>
    <p>
     did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints,
    </p>
    <p>
     and half-formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies,
    </p>
    <p>
     which eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from
    </p>
    <p>
     anything that visibly appears.  So that in many cases such a panic
    </p>
    <p>
     did he finally strike, that few who by those rumors, at least,
    </p>
    <p>
     had heard of the White Whale, few of those hunters were willing
    </p>
    <p>
     to encounter the perils of his jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
     But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor even at the present day has the original prestige of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Sperm Whale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species
    </p>
    <p>
     of the leviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are those this day among them, who, though intelligent and
    </p>
    <p>
     courageous enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     would perhaps--either from professional inexperience, or incompetency,
    </p>
    <p>
     or timidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate,
    </p>
    <p>
     there are plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations
    </p>
    <p>
     not sailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely
    </p>
    <p>
     encountered the Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan
    </p>
    <p>
     is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North;
    </p>
    <p>
     seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish fireside
    </p>
    <p>
     interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern whaling.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor is the preeminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale
    </p>
    <p>
     anywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows
    </p>
    <p>
     which stem him.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary
    </p>
    <p>
     times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book naturalists--
    </p>
    <p>
     Olassen and Povelson--declaring the Sperm Whale not only to be
    </p>
    <p>
     a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be
    </p>
    <p>
     so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier's, were these or almost
    </p>
    <p>
     similar impressions effaced.  For in his Natural History,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Baron himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish
    </p>
    <p>
     (sharks included) are "struck with the most lively terrors,"
    </p>
    <p>
     and "often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against
    </p>
    <p>
     the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death."
    </p>
    <p>
     And however the general experiences in the fishery may amend
    </p>
    <p>
     such reports as these; yet in their full terribleness, even to the
    </p>
    <p>
     bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the superstitious belief in them is,
    </p>
    <p>
     in some vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds
    </p>
    <p>
     of the hunters.
    </p>
    <p>
     So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him,
    </p>
    <p>
     not a few of the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick,
    </p>
    <p>
     the earlier days of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes
    </p>
    <p>
     hard to induce long practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils
    </p>
    <p>
     of this new and daring warfare; such men protesting that although
    </p>
    <p>
     other leviathans might be hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point
    </p>
    <p>
     lances at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man.
    </p>
    <p>
     That to attempt it, would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
     On this head, there are some remarkable documents that may be consulted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things
    </p>
    <p>
     were ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who,
    </p>
    <p>
     chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the specific
    </p>
    <p>
     details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious accompaniments
    </p>
    <p>
     were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked
    </p>
    <p>
     with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined,
    </p>
    <p>
     was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had
    </p>
    <p>
     actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same
    </p>
    <p>
     instant of time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit
    </p>
    <p>
     altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability.
    </p>
    <p>
     For as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet
    </p>
    <p>
     been divulged, even to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Sperm Whale when beneath the surface remain, in great part,
    </p>
    <p>
     unaccountable to his pursuers; and from time to time have originated
    </p>
    <p>
     the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them,
    </p>
    <p>
     especially concerning the mystic modes whereby, after sounding
    </p>
    <p>
     to a great depth, he transports himself with such vast swiftness
    </p>
    <p>
     to the most widely distant points.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is a thing well known to both American and English
    </p>
    <p>
     whale-ships, and as well a thing placed upon authoritative
    </p>
    <p>
     record years ago by Scoresby, that some whales have been
    </p>
    <p>
     captured far north in the Pacific, in whose bodies have been
    </p>
    <p>
     found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has
    </p>
    <p>
     been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults
    </p>
    <p>
     could not have exceeded very many days.  Hence, by inference,
    </p>
    <p>
     it has been believed by some whalemen, that the Nor' West Passage,
    </p>
    <p>
     so long a problem to man, was never a problem to the whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     So that here, in the real living experience of living men,
    </p>
    <p>
     the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello mountain
    </p>
    <p>
     in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in which
    </p>
    <p>
     the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still
    </p>
    <p>
     more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse
    </p>
    <p>
     (whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land
    </p>
    <p>
     by an underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost
    </p>
    <p>
     fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these;
    </p>
    <p>
     and knowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale
    </p>
    <p>
     had escaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that
    </p>
    <p>
     some whalemen should go still further in their superstitions;
    </p>
    <p>
     declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous, but immortal
    </p>
    <p>
     (for immortality is but ubiquity in time); that though groves
    </p>
    <p>
     of spears should be planted in his flanks, he would still swim
    </p>
    <p>
     away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout
    </p>
    <p>
     thick blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly deception;
    </p>
    <p>
     for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away,
    </p>
    <p>
     his unsullied jet would once more be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
     But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough
    </p>
    <p>
     in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster
    </p>
    <p>
     to strike the imagination with unwonted power.  For, it was not
    </p>
    <p>
     so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from
    </p>
    <p>
     other sperm whales, but, as was elsewhere thrown out--a peculiar
    </p>
    <p>
     snow-white wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump.
    </p>
    <p>
     These were his prominent features; the tokens whereby,
    </p>
    <p>
     even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he revealed his identity,
    </p>
    <p>
     at a long distance, to those who knew him.
    </p>
    <p>
     The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted,
    </p>
    <p>
     and marbled with the same shrouded hue, that, in the end,
    </p>
    <p>
     he had gained his distinctive appellation of the White Whale;
    </p>
    <p>
     a name, indeed, literally justified by his vivid aspect,
    </p>
    <p>
     when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled
    </p>
    <p>
     with golden gleamings.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his
    </p>
    <p>
     deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural terror,
    </p>
    <p>
     as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to
    </p>
    <p>
     specific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults.
    </p>
    <p>
     More than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than
    </p>
    <p>
     perhaps aught else.  For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers,
    </p>
    <p>
     with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times been known
    </p>
    <p>
     to turn around suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave their
    </p>
    <p>
     boats to splinters, or drive them back in consternation to their ship.
    </p>
    <p>
     Already several fatalities had attended his chase.
    </p>
    <p>
     But though similar disasters, however little bruited ashore,
    </p>
    <p>
     were by no means unusual in the fishery; yet, in most instances,
    </p>
    <p>
     such seemed the White Whale's infernal aforethought of ferocity,
    </p>
    <p>
     that every dismembering or death that he caused, was not wholly
    </p>
    <p>
     regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent.
    </p>
    <p>
     Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds
    </p>
    <p>
     of his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips
    </p>
    <p>
     of chewed boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam
    </p>
    <p>
     out of the white curds of the whale's direful wrath into the serene,
    </p>
    <p>
     exasperating sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.
    </p>
    <p>
     His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in
    </p>
    <p>
     the eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow,
    </p>
    <p>
     had dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe,
    </p>
    <p>
     blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life
    </p>
    <p>
     of the whale.  That captain was Ahab.  And then it was, that suddenly
    </p>
    <p>
     sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had
    </p>
    <p>
     reaped away Ahab's leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field.
    </p>
    <p>
     No turbaned Turk, no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him
    </p>
    <p>
     with more seeming malice.  Small reason was there to doubt, then,
    </p>
    <p>
     that ever since that almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild
    </p>
    <p>
     vindictiveness against the whale, all the more fell for that in his
    </p>
    <p>
     frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him, not only all
    </p>
    <p>
     his bodily woes, but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations.
    </p>
    <p>
     The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all
    </p>
    <p>
     those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them,
    </p>
    <p>
     till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung.
    </p>
    <p>
     That intangible malignity which has been from the beginning; to whose
    </p>
    <p>
     dominion even the modern Christians ascribe one-half of the worlds;
    </p>
    <p>
     which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devil;--
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them; but deliriously
    </p>
    <p>
     transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale, he pitted himself,
    </p>
    <p>
     all mutilated, against it.  All that most maddens and torments;
    </p>
    <p>
     all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice in it;
    </p>
    <p>
     all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms
    </p>
    <p>
     of life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly personified,
    </p>
    <p>
     and made practically assailable in Moby Dick.  He piled upon the whale's
    </p>
    <p>
     white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole
    </p>
    <p>
     race from Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a mortar,
    </p>
    <p>
     he burst his hot heart's shell upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant
    </p>
    <p>
     rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, in darting at the monster, knife in hand, he had but
    </p>
    <p>
     given loose to a sudden, passionate, corporal animosity;
    </p>
    <p>
     and when he received the stroke that tore him, he probably
    </p>
    <p>
     but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home, and for
    </p>
    <p>
     long months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched
    </p>
    <p>
     together in one hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary,
    </p>
    <p>
     howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed
    </p>
    <p>
     soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made him mad.
    </p>
    <p>
     That it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the encounter,
    </p>
    <p>
     that the final monomania seized him, seems all but certain
    </p>
    <p>
     from the fact that, at intervals during the passage, he was
    </p>
    <p>
     a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital
    </p>
    <p>
     strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was moreover
    </p>
    <p>
     intensified by his delirium, that his mates were forced to lace
    </p>
    <p>
     him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a strait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the gales.
    </p>
    <p>
     And, when running into more sufferable latitudes, the ship,
    </p>
    <p>
     with mild stun'sails spread, floated across the tranquil tropics,
    </p>
    <p>
     and, to all appearances, the old man's delirium seemed left behind
    </p>
    <p>
     him with the Cape Horn swells, and he came forth from his dark
    </p>
    <p>
     den into the blessed light and air; even then, when he bore
    </p>
    <p>
     that firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his calm
    </p>
    <p>
     orders once again; and his mates thanked God the direful madness
    </p>
    <p>
     was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     When you think it fled, it may have but become transfigured
    </p>
    <p>
     into some still subtler form.  Ahab's full lunacy subsided not,
    </p>
    <p>
     but deepeningly contracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble
    </p>
    <p>
     Northman flows narrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, as in his narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab's
    </p>
    <p>
     broad madness had been left behind; so in that broad madness,
    </p>
    <p>
     not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished.
    </p>
    <p>
     That before living agent, now became the living instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
     If such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy stormed
    </p>
    <p>
     his general sanity, and carried it, and turned all its concentred
    </p>
    <p>
     cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from having lost
    </p>
    <p>
     his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a thousand
    </p>
    <p>
     fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon
    </p>
    <p>
     any one reasonable object.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is much; yet Ahab's larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted.
    </p>
    <p>
     But vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound.
    </p>
    <p>
     Winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de
    </p>
    <p>
     Cluny where we here stand--however grand and wonderful, now quit it;--
    </p>
    <p>
     and take your way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls
    </p>
    <p>
     of Thermes; where far beneath the fantastic towers of man's upper earth,
    </p>
    <p>
     his root of grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state;
    </p>
    <p>
     an antique buried beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes!
    </p>
    <p>
     So with a broken throne, the great gods mock that captive king;
    </p>
    <p>
     so like a Caryatid, he patient sits, upholding on his frozen brow
    </p>
    <p>
     the piled entablatures of ages.  Wind ye down there, ye prouder,
    </p>
    <p>
     sadder souls! question that proud, sad king!  A family likeness! aye,
    </p>
    <p>
     he did beget ye, ye young exiled royalties; and from your grim sire
    </p>
    <p>
     only will the old State-secret come.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely;
    </p>
    <p>
     all my means are sane, my motive and my object mad.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet without power to kill, or change, or shun the fact;
    </p>
    <p>
     he likewise knew that to mankind he did now long dissemble;
    </p>
    <p>
     in some sort, did still.  But that thing of his dissembling was
    </p>
    <p>
     only subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling,
    </p>
    <p>
     that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer
    </p>
    <p>
     thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to
    </p>
    <p>
     the quick, with the terrible casualty which had overtaken him.
    </p>
    <p>
     The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise
    </p>
    <p>
     popularly ascribed to a kindred cause.  And so too, all the added
    </p>
    <p>
     moodiness which always afterwards, to the very day of sailing
    </p>
    <p>
     in the Pequod on the present voyage, sat brooding on his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor is it so very unlikely, that far from distrusting his fitness
    </p>
    <p>
     for another whaling voyage, on account of such dark symptoms,
    </p>
    <p>
     the calculating people of that prudent isle were inclined
    </p>
    <p>
     to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons he was
    </p>
    <p>
     all the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit
    </p>
    <p>
     so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gnawed within and scorched without, with the infixed,
    </p>
    <p>
     unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea; such an one,
    </p>
    <p>
     could he be found, would seem the very man to dart his iron
    </p>
    <p>
     and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or, if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated
    </p>
    <p>
     for that, yet such an one would seem superlatively competent
    </p>
    <p>
     to cheer and howl on his underlings to the attack.
    </p>
    <p>
     But be all this as it may, certain it is, that with the mad
    </p>
    <p>
     secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him, Ahab had
    </p>
    <p>
     purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and
    </p>
    <p>
     all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale.  Had any one
    </p>
    <p>
     of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was
    </p>
    <p>
     lurking in him then, how soon would their aghast and righteous
    </p>
    <p>
     souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man!
    </p>
    <p>
     They were bent on profitable cruises, the profit to be counted
    </p>
    <p>
     down in dollars from the mint.  He was intent on an audacious,
    </p>
    <p>
     immitigable, and supernatural revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with
    </p>
    <p>
     curses a Job's whale round the world, at the head of a crew,
    </p>
    <p>
     too, chiefly made up of mongrel renegades, and castaways,
    </p>
    <p>
     and cannibals--morally enfeebled also, by the incompetence
    </p>
    <p>
     of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in Starbuck,
    </p>
    <p>
     the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness
    </p>
    <p>
     in Stubb, and the pervading mediocrity in Flask.  Such a crew,
    </p>
    <p>
     so officered, seemed specially picked and packed by some
    </p>
    <p>
     infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
     How it was that they so aboundingly responded to the old
    </p>
    <p>
     man's ire--by what evil magic their souls were possessed,
    </p>
    <p>
     that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the White Whale
    </p>
    <p>
     as much their insufferable foe as his; how all this came
    </p>
    <p>
     to be--what the White Whale was to them, or how to their
    </p>
    <p>
     unconscious understandings, also, in some dim, unsuspected way,
    </p>
    <p>
     he might have seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life,--
    </p>
    <p>
     all this to explain, would be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go.
    </p>
    <p>
     The subterranean miner that works in us all, how can one tell
    </p>
    <p>
     whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting, muffled sound
    </p>
    <p>
     of his pick?  Who does not feel the irresistible arm drag?
    </p>
    <p>
     What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand still?  For one,
    </p>
    <p>
     I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place;
    </p>
    <p>
     but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale, could see
    </p>
    <p>
     naught in that brute but the deadliest ill.

    <p>
     The Whiteness of The Whale
    </p>
    <p>
     What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times,
    </p>
    <p>
     he was to me, as yet remains unsaid.
    </p>
    <p>
     Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick,
    </p>
    <p>
     which could not but occasionally awaken in any man's soul some alarm,
    </p>
    <p>
     there was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror
    </p>
    <p>
     concerning him, which at times by its intensity completely overpowered
    </p>
    <p>
     all the rest; and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it,
    </p>
    <p>
     that I almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me.
    </p>
    <p>
     But how can I hope to explain myself here; and yet, in some dim,
    </p>
    <p>
     random way, explain myself I must, else all these chapters
    </p>
    <p>
     might be naught.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly
    </p>
    <p>
     enhances beauty, as if imparting some special virtue of its own,
    </p>
    <p>
     as in marbles, japonicas, and pearls; and though various nations
    </p>
    <p>
     have in some way recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue;
    </p>
    <p>
     even the barbaric, grand old kings of Pegu placing the title
    </p>
    <p>
     "Lord of the White Elephants" above all their other magniloquent
    </p>
    <p>
     ascriptions of dominion; and the modern kings of Siam unfurling
    </p>
    <p>
     the same snow-white quadruped in the royal standard; and the
    </p>
    <p>
     Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow-white charger;
    </p>
    <p>
     and the great Austrian Empire, Caesarian, heir to overlording Rome,
    </p>
    <p>
     having for the imperial color the same imperial hue; and though
    </p>
    <p>
     this pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself,
    </p>
    <p>
     giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe;
    </p>
    <p>
     and though, besides, all this, whiteness has been even made
    </p>
    <p>
     significant of gladness, for among the Romans a white stone marked
    </p>
    <p>
     a joyful day; and though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings,
    </p>
    <p>
     this same hue is made the emblem of many touching, noble things--
    </p>
    <p>
     the innocence of brides, the benignity of age; though among
    </p>
    <p>
     the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum was
    </p>
    <p>
     the deepest pledge of honor; though in many climes, whiteness typifies
    </p>
    <p>
     the majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge, and contributes
    </p>
    <p>
     to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by milk-white steeds;
    </p>
    <p>
     though even in the higher mysteries of the most august religions
    </p>
    <p>
     it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power;
    </p>
    <p>
     by the Persian fire worshippers, the white forked flame being
    </p>
    <p>
     held the holiest on the altar; and in the Greek mythologies,
    </p>
    <p>
     Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a snow-white bull;
    </p>
    <p>
     and though to the noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred
    </p>
    <p>
     White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology,
    </p>
    <p>
     that spotless, faithful creature being held the purest envoy they
    </p>
    <p>
     could send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their
    </p>
    <p>
     own fidelity; and though directly from the Latin word for white,
    </p>
    <p>
     all Christian priests derive the name of one part of their
    </p>
    <p>
     sacred vesture, the alb or tunic, worn beneath the cassock;
    </p>
    <p>
     and though among the holy pomps of the Romish faith, white is
    </p>
    <p>
     specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of our Lord;
    </p>
    <p>
     though in the Vision of St. John, white robes are given to the redeemed,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before
    </p>
    <p>
     the great-white throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there
    </p>
    <p>
     white like wool; yet for all these accumulated associations,
    </p>
    <p>
     with whatever is sweet, and honorable, and sublime, there yet
    </p>
    <p>
     lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue,
    </p>
    <p>
     which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which
    </p>
    <p>
     affrights in blood.
    </p>
    <p>
     This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness,
    </p>
    <p>
     when divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled
    </p>
    <p>
     with any object terrible in itself, to heighten that terror
    </p>
    <p>
     to the furthest bounds.  Witness the white bear of the poles,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the white shark of the tropics; what but their smooth,
    </p>
    <p>
     flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are?
    </p>
    <p>
     That ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness,
    </p>
    <p>
     even more loathsome than terrific, to the dumb gloating of their aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
     So that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can
    </p>
    <p>
     so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or shark.*
    </p>
    <p>
     *With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who
    </p>
    <p>
     would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the whiteness,
    </p>
    <p>
     separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable hideousness of
    </p>
    <p>
     that brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness, it might be said,
    </p>
    <p>
     only rises from the circumstance, that the irresponsible ferociousness
    </p>
    <p>
     of the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence
    </p>
    <p>
     and love; and hence, by bringing together two such opposite emotions
    </p>
    <p>
     in our minds, the Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast.
    </p>
    <p>
     But even assuming all this to be true; yet, were it not for the whiteness,
    </p>
    <p>
     you would not have that intensified terror.
    </p>
    <p>
     As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose
    </p>
    <p>
     in that creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies
    </p>
    <p>
     with the same quality in the Polar quadruped.  This peculiarity is most
    </p>
    <p>
     vividly hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Romish mass for the dead begins with "Requiem eternam"
    </p>
    <p>
     (eternal rest), whence Requiem denominating the mass itself,
    </p>
    <p>
     and any other funeral music.  Now, in allusion to the white,
    </p>
    <p>
     silent stillness of death in this shark, and the mild deadliness
    </p>
    <p>
     of his habits, the French call him Requin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual
    </p>
    <p>
     wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails
    </p>
    <p>
     in all imaginations?  Not Coleridge first threw that spell;
    </p>
    <p>
     but God's great, unflattering laureate, Nature.*
    </p>
    <p>
     *I remember the first albatross I ever saw.  It was during
    </p>
    <p>
     a prolonged gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas.
    </p>
    <p>
     From my forenoon watch below, I ascended to the overclouded deck;
    </p>
    <p>
     and there, dashed upon the main hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing
    </p>
    <p>
     of unspotted whiteness, and with a hooked, Roman bill sublime.
    </p>
    <p>
     At intervals, it arched forth its vast archangel wings, as if to
    </p>
    <p>
     embrace some holy ark.  Wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some king's ghost
    </p>
    <p>
     in supernatural distress.  Through its inexpressible, strange eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
     methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God.  As Abraham
    </p>
    <p>
     before the angels, I bowed myself; the white thing was so white,
    </p>
    <p>
     its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had
    </p>
    <p>
     lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns.
    </p>
    <p>
     Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage.  I cannot tell,
    </p>
    <p>
     can only hint, the things that darted through me then.
    </p>
    <p>
     But at last I awoke; and turning, asked a sailor what bird was this.
    </p>
    <p>
     A goney, he replied.  Goney! never had heard that name before;
    </p>
    <p>
     is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown
    </p>
    <p>
     to men ashore! never!  But some time after, I learned that goney
    </p>
    <p>
     was some seaman's name for albatross.  So that by no possibility
    </p>
    <p>
     could Coleridge's wild Rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical
    </p>
    <p>
     impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon our deck.
    </p>
    <p>
     For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to be
    </p>
    <p>
     an albatross.  Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly burnish
    </p>
    <p>
     a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.
    </p>
    <p>
     I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird
    </p>
    <p>
     chiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in this,
    </p>
    <p>
     that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses;
    </p>
    <p>
     and these I have frequently seen, but never with such emotions as when I
    </p>
    <p>
     beheld the Antarctic fowl.
    </p>
    <p>
     But how had the mystic thing been caught?  Whisper it not,
    </p>
    <p>
     and I will tell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl
    </p>
    <p>
     floated on the sea.  At last the Captain made a postman of it;
    </p>
    <p>
     tying a lettered, leathern tally round its neck, with the ship's
    </p>
    <p>
     time and place; and then letting it escape.  But I doubt not,
    </p>
    <p>
     that leathern tally, meant for man, was taken off in Heaven,
    </p>
    <p>
     when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding, the invoking,
    </p>
    <p>
     and adoring cherubim!
    </p>
    <p>
     Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of
    </p>
    <p>
     the White Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger,
    </p>
    <p>
     large-eyed, small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity
    </p>
    <p>
     of a thousand monarchs in his lofty, overscorning carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was the elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses,
    </p>
    <p>
     whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains
    </p>
    <p>
     and the Alleghanies.  At their flaming head he westward
    </p>
    <p>
     trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads
    </p>
    <p>
     on the hosts of light.  The flashing cascade of his mane,
    </p>
    <p>
     the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings more
    </p>
    <p>
     resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him.
    </p>
    <p>
     A most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen,
    </p>
    <p>
     western world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters
    </p>
    <p>
     revived the glories of those primeval times when Adam walked
    </p>
    <p>
     majestic as a god, bluff-bowed and fearless as this mighty steed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of
    </p>
    <p>
     countless cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the plains,
    </p>
    <p>
     like an Ohio; or whether with his circumambient subjects browsing
    </p>
    <p>
     all around at the horizon, the White Steed gallopingly reviewed
    </p>
    <p>
     them with warm nostrils reddening through his cool milkiness;
    </p>
    <p>
     in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to the bravest
    </p>
    <p>
     Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record
    </p>
    <p>
     of this noble horse, that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly,
    </p>
    <p>
     which so clothed him with divineness; and that this divineness
    </p>
    <p>
     had that in it which, though commanding worship, at the same
    </p>
    <p>
     time enforced a certain nameless terror.
    </p>
    <p>
     But there are other instances where this whiteness loses
    </p>
    <p>
     all that accessory and strange glory which invests it in
    </p>
    <p>
     the White Steed and Albatross.
    </p>
    <p>
     What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks
    </p>
    <p>
     the eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin!
    </p>
    <p>
     It is that whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed
    </p>
    <p>
     by the name he bears.  The Albino is as well made as other men--
    </p>
    <p>
     has no substantive deformity--and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading
    </p>
    <p>
     whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why should this be so?
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least
    </p>
    <p>
     palpable but not the less malicious agencies, fail to enlist
    </p>
    <p>
     among her forces this crowning attribute of the terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
     From its snowy aspect, the gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has
    </p>
    <p>
     been denominated the White Squall.  Nor, in some historic instances,
    </p>
    <p>
     has the art of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary.
    </p>
    <p>
     How wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in Froissart,
    </p>
    <p>
     when, masked in the snowy symbol of their faction, the desperate
    </p>
    <p>
     White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the market-place!
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all
    </p>
    <p>
     mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue.
    </p>
    <p>
     It cannot well be doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect
    </p>
    <p>
     of the dead which most appals the gazer, is the marble pallor
    </p>
    <p>
     lingering there; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge
    </p>
    <p>
     of consternation in the other world, as of mortal trepidation here.
    </p>
    <p>
     And from that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive hue
    </p>
    <p>
     of the shroud in which we wrap them.  Nor even in our superstitions
    </p>
    <p>
     do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms;
    </p>
    <p>
     all ghosts rising in a milk-white fog--Yea, while these terrors
    </p>
    <p>
     seize us, let us add, that even the king of terrors, when personified
    </p>
    <p>
     by the evangelist, rides on his pallid horse.
    </p>
    <p>
     Therefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious
    </p>
    <p>
     thing he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest
    </p>
    <p>
     idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
     But though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal
    </p>
    <p>
     man to account for it?  To analyse it, would seem impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
     Can we, then, by the citation of some of those instances
    </p>
    <p>
     wherein this thing of whiteness--though for the time either
    </p>
    <p>
     wholly or in great part stripped of all direct associations
    </p>
    <p>
     calculated to impart to it aught fearful, but nevertheless,
    </p>
    <p>
     is found to exert over us the same sorcery, however modified;--
    </p>
    <p>
     can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us
    </p>
    <p>
     to the hidden cause we seek?
    </p>
    <p>
     Let us try.  But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety,
    </p>
    <p>
     and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls.
    </p>
    <p>
     And though, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions
    </p>
    <p>
     about to be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few
    </p>
    <p>
     perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore
    </p>
    <p>
     may not be able to recall them now.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but
    </p>
    <p>
     loosely acquainted with the peculiar character of the day,
    </p>
    <p>
     does the bare mention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy
    </p>
    <p>
     such long, dreary, speechless processions of slow-pacing pilgrims,
    </p>
    <p>
     down-cast and hooded with new-fallen snow?  Or to the unread,
    </p>
    <p>
     unsophisticated Protestant of the Middle American States,
    </p>
    <p>
     why does the passing mention of a White Friar or a White Nun,
    </p>
    <p>
     evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul?
    </p>
    <p>
     Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings
    </p>
    <p>
     (which will not wholly account for it) that makes the White Tower
    </p>
    <p>
     of London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an
    </p>
    <p>
     untravelled American, than those other storied structures, its neighbors--
    </p>
    <p>
     the Byward Tower, or even the Bloody?  And those sublimer towers,
    </p>
    <p>
     the White Mountains of New Hampshire, whence, in peculiar moods,
    </p>
    <p>
     comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention
    </p>
    <p>
     of that name, while the thought of Virginia's Blue Ridge is full
    </p>
    <p>
     of a soft, dewy, distant dreaminess?  Or why, irrespective of all
    </p>
    <p>
     latitudes and longitudes, does the name of the White Sea exert
    </p>
    <p>
     such a spectralness over the fancy, while that of the Yellow Sea
    </p>
    <p>
     lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on
    </p>
    <p>
     the waves, followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets?
    </p>
    <p>
     Or, to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance, purely addressed
    </p>
    <p>
     to the fancy, why, in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe,
    </p>
    <p>
     does "the tall pale man" of the Hartz forests, whose changeless
    </p>
    <p>
     pallor unrestingly glides through the green of the groves--
    </p>
    <p>
     why is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Blocksburg?
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling
    </p>
    <p>
     earthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the tearlessness
    </p>
    <p>
     of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her wide field
    </p>
    <p>
     of leaning spires, wrenched cope-stones, and crosses all adroop
    </p>
    <p>
     (like canted yards of anchored fleets); and her suburban avenues
    </p>
    <p>
     of house-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed pack of cards;--
    </p>
    <p>
     it is not these things alone which make tearless Lima, the strangest,
    </p>
    <p>
     saddest city thou can'st see.  For Lima has taken the white veil;
    </p>
    <p>
     and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Old as Pizarro, this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new;
    </p>
    <p>
     admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay; spreads over
    </p>
    <p>
     her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes
    </p>
    <p>
     its own distortions.
    </p>
    <p>
     I know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness
    </p>
    <p>
     is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror
    </p>
    <p>
     of objects otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there
    </p>
    <p>
     aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind
    </p>
    <p>
     almost solely consists in this one phenomenon, especially when exhibited
    </p>
    <p>
     under any form at all approaching to muteness or universality.
    </p>
    <p>
     What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be respectively
    </p>
    <p>
     elucidated by the following examples.
    </p>
    <p>
     First:  The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands,
    </p>
    <p>
     if by night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels
    </p>
    <p>
     just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under
    </p>
    <p>
     precisely similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock
    </p>
    <p>
     to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness--
    </p>
    <p>
     as if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming
    </p>
    <p>
     round him, then he feels a silent, superstitious dread; the shrouded
    </p>
    <p>
     phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost;
    </p>
    <p>
     in vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings; heart and helm
    </p>
    <p>
     they both go down; he never rests till blue water is under him again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet where is the mariner who will tell thee, "Sir, it was not so much
    </p>
    <p>
     the fear of striking hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous whiteness
    </p>
    <p>
     that so stirred me?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Second:  To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of
    </p>
    <p>
     the snowhowdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps,
    </p>
    <p>
     in the mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning
    </p>
    <p>
     at such vast altitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness
    </p>
    <p>
     it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes.  Much the same
    </p>
    <p>
     is it with the backwoodsman of the West, who with comparative
    </p>
    <p>
     indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow,
    </p>
    <p>
     no shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not so the sailor, beholding the scenery of the Antarctic seas;
    </p>
    <p>
     where at times, by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers
    </p>
    <p>
     of frost and air, he, shivering and half shipwrecked, instead of
    </p>
    <p>
     rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery, views what seems
    </p>
    <p>
     a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments
    </p>
    <p>
     and splintered crosses.
    </p>
    <p>
     But thou sayest, methinks this white-lead chapter about
    </p>
    <p>
     whiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul;
    </p>
    <p>
     thou surrenderest to a hypo, Ishmael.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful
    </p>
    <p>
     valley of Vermont, far removed from all beasts of prey--
    </p>
    <p>
     why is it that upon the sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh
    </p>
    <p>
     buffalo robe behind him, so that he cannot even see it, but only
    </p>
    <p>
     smells its wild animal muskiness--why will he start, snort,
    </p>
    <p>
     and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies of affright?
    </p>
    <p>
     There is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild creatures
    </p>
    <p>
     in his green northern home, so that the strange muskiness he smells
    </p>
    <p>
     cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience
    </p>
    <p>
     of former perils; for what knows he, this New England colt,
    </p>
    <p>
     of the black bisons of distant Oregon?
    </p>
    <p>
     No; but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute,
    </p>
    <p>
     the instinct of the knowledge of the demonism in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though thousands of miles from Oregon, still when he smells
    </p>
    <p>
     that savage musk, the rending, goring bison herds are as present
    </p>
    <p>
     as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies, which this instant
    </p>
    <p>
     they may be trampling into dust.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea;
    </p>
    <p>
     the bleak rustlings of the festooned frosts of mountains;
    </p>
    <p>
     the desolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of prairies;
    </p>
    <p>
     all these, to Ishmael, are as the shaking of that buffalo robe
    </p>
    <p>
     to the frightened colt!
    </p>
    <p>
     Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of
    </p>
    <p>
     which the mystic sign gives forth such hints; yet with me,
    </p>
    <p>
     as with the colt, somewhere those things must exist.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though in many of its aspects this visible world seems formed
    </p>
    <p>
     in love, the invisible spheres were formed in fright.
    </p>
    <p>
     But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness,
    </p>
    <p>
     and learned why it appeals with such power to the soul;
    </p>
    <p>
     and more strange and far more portentous--why, as we have seen,
    </p>
    <p>
     it is at once the most meaning symbol of spiritual things, nay,
    </p>
    <p>
     the very veil of the Christian's Deity; and yet should be as it is,
    </p>
    <p>
     the intensifying agent in things the most appalling to mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless
    </p>
    <p>
     voids and immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind
    </p>
    <p>
     with the thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths
    </p>
    <p>
     of the milky way?  Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not
    </p>
    <p>
     so much a color as the visible absence of color; and at the same
    </p>
    <p>
     time the concrete of all colors; is it for these reasons that there
    </p>
    <p>
     is such a dumb blankness, full of meaning, in a wide landscape
    </p>
    <p>
     of snows--a colorless, all-color of atheism from which we shrink?
    </p>
    <p>
     And when we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers,
    </p>
    <p>
     that all other earthly hues--every stately or lovely emblazoning--
    </p>
    <p>
     the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods; yea, and the gilded
    </p>
    <p>
     velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of young girls;
    </p>
    <p>
     all these are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent
    </p>
    <p>
     in substances, but only laid on from without; so that all deified
    </p>
    <p>
     Nature absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing but the charnel-house within; and when we proceed further,
    </p>
    <p>
     and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every
    </p>
    <p>
     one of her hues, the great principle of light, for ever remains
    </p>
    <p>
     white or colorless in itself, and if operating without medium
    </p>
    <p>
     upon matter, would touch all objects, even tulips and roses,
    </p>
    <p>
     with its own blank tinge--pondering all this, the palsied universe
    </p>
    <p>
     lies before us a leper; and like wilful travellers in Lapland,
    </p>
    <p>
     who refuse to wear colored and coloring glasses upon their eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
     so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental
    </p>
    <p>
     white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him.
    </p>
    <p>
     And of all these things the Albino whale was the symbol.

    <p>
     Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt? ..

    <p>
     Hark!
    </p>
    <p>
     "HIST!  Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the middle-watch: a fair moonlight; the seamen were
    </p>
    <p>
     standing in a cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water
    </p>
    <p>
     butts in the waist, to the scuttle-butt near the taffrail.
    </p>
    <p>
     In this manner, they passed the buckets to fill the scuttle-butt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Standing, for the most part, on the hallowed precincts of the
    </p>
    <p>
     quarter-deck, they were careful not to speak or rustle their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     From hand to hand, the buckets went in the deepest silence,
    </p>
    <p>
     only broken by the occasional flap of a sail, and the steady
    </p>
    <p>
     hum of the unceasingly advancing keel.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of the cordon,
    </p>
    <p>
     whose post was near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor,
    </p>
    <p>
     a Cholo, the words above.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Take the bucket, will ye, Archy? what noise d'ye mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "There it is again--under the hatches--don't you hear it--a cough--
    </p>
    <p>
     it sounded like a cough."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Cough be damned!  Pass along that return bucket."
    </p>
    <p>
     "There again--there it is!--it sounds like two or three sleepers
    </p>
    <p>
     turning over, now!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Caramba! have done, shipmate, will ye?  It's the three soaked
    </p>
    <p>
     biscuits ye eat for supper turning over inside of ye--nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
     Look to the bucket!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Say what ye will, shipmate; I've sharp ears."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, you are the chap, ain't ye, that heard the hum of the old
    </p>
    <p>
     Quakeress's knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket;
    </p>
    <p>
     you're the chap."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Grin away; we'll see what turns up.  Hark ye, Cabaco, there is
    </p>
    <p>
     somebody down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck;
    </p>
    <p>
     and I suspect our old Mogul knows something of it too.
    </p>
    <p>
     I heard Stubb tell Flask, one morning watch, that there was
    </p>
    <p>
     something of that sort in the wind."

     "Tish! the bucket!"

    <p>
     The Chart
    </p>
    <p>
     Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall
    </p>
    <p>
     that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification
    </p>
    <p>
     of his purpose with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker
    </p>
    <p>
     in the transom, and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish
    </p>
    <p>
     sea charts, spread them before him on his screwed-down table.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then seating himself before it, you would have seen him intently
    </p>
    <p>
     study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye;
    </p>
    <p>
     and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces
    </p>
    <p>
     that before were blank.  At intervals, he would refer to piles
    </p>
    <p>
     of old log-books beside him, wherein were set down the seasons
    </p>
    <p>
     and places in which, on various former voyages of various ships,
    </p>
    <p>
     sperm whales had been captured or seen.
    </p>
    <p>
     While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains
    </p>
    <p>
     over his head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship,
    </p>
    <p>
     and for ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon
    </p>
    <p>
     his wrinkled brow, till it almost seemed that while he himself
    </p>
    <p>
     was marking out lines and courses on the wrinkled charts,
    </p>
    <p>
     some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and courses upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the deeply marked chart of his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude
    </p>
    <p>
     of his cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Almost every night they were brought out; almost every night
    </p>
    <p>
     some pencil marks were effaced, and others were substituted.
    </p>
    <p>
     For with the charts of all four oceans before him, Ahab was
    </p>
    <p>
     threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a view to the more
    </p>
    <p>
     certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans,
    </p>
    <p>
     it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one
    </p>
    <p>
     solitary creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet.
    </p>
    <p>
     But not so did it seem to Ahab, who knew the sets of all
    </p>
    <p>
     tides and currents; and thereby calculating the driftings of
    </p>
    <p>
     the sperm whale's food; and, also calling to mind the regular,
    </p>
    <p>
     ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes;
    </p>
    <p>
     could arrive at reasonable surmises, almost approaching
    </p>
    <p>
     to certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be upon this
    </p>
    <p>
     or that ground in search of his prey.
    </p>
    <p>
     So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm
    </p>
    <p>
     whale's resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe that,
    </p>
    <p>
     could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world;
    </p>
    <p>
     were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated,
    </p>
    <p>
     then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in
    </p>
    <p>
     invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the flights of swallows.
    </p>
    <p>
     On this hint, attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory
    </p>
    <p>
     charts of the sperm whale.*
    </p>
    <p>
     *Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne
    </p>
    <p>
     out by an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury,
    </p>
    <p>
     of the National Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851.
    </p>
    <p>
     By that circular, it appears that precisely such a chart is in course
    </p>
    <p>
     of completion; and portions of it are presented in the circular.
    </p>
    <p>
     "This chart divides the ocean into districts of five degrees
    </p>
    <p>
     of latitude by five degrees of longitude; perpendicularly through
    </p>
    <p>
     each of which districts are twelve columns for the twelve months;
    </p>
    <p>
     and horizontally through each of which districts are three lines;
    </p>
    <p>
     one to show the number of days that have been spent in each month
    </p>
    <p>
     in every district, and the two others to show the number of days
    </p>
    <p>
     in which whales, sperm or right, have been seen."
    </p>
    <p>
     Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another,
    </p>
    <p>
     the sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct--say, rather,
    </p>
    <p>
     secret intelligence from the Deity--mostly swim in veins, as they
    </p>
    <p>
     are called; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with
    </p>
    <p>
     such undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course,
    </p>
    <p>
     by any chart, with one tithe of such marvellous precision.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though, in these cases, the direction taken by any one whale
    </p>
    <p>
     be straight as a surveyor's parallel, and though the line
    </p>
    <p>
     of advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable,
    </p>
    <p>
     straight wake, yet the arbitrary vein in which at these times
    </p>
    <p>
     he is said to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width
    </p>
    <p>
     (more or less, as the vein is presumed to expand or contract);
    </p>
    <p>
     but never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale-ship's
    </p>
    <p>
     mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sum is, that at particular seasons within that breadth
    </p>
    <p>
     and along that path, migrating whales may with great confidence
    </p>
    <p>
     be looked for.
    </p>
    <p>
     And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known
    </p>
    <p>
     separate feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey;
    </p>
    <p>
     but in crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds
    </p>
    <p>
     he could, by his art, so place and time himself on his way,
    </p>
    <p>
     as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     to entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
     But not so in the reality, perhaps.  Though the gregarious
    </p>
    <p>
     sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds,
    </p>
    <p>
     yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds which haunted
    </p>
    <p>
     such and such a latitude or longitude this year, say, will turn
    </p>
    <p>
     out to be identically the same with those that were found there
    </p>
    <p>
     the preceding season; though there are peculiar and unquestionable
    </p>
    <p>
     instances where the contrary of this has proved true.
    </p>
    <p>
     In general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit,
    </p>
    <p>
     applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured,
    </p>
    <p>
     aged sperm whales.  So that though Moby Dick had in a former
    </p>
    <p>
     year been seen, for example, on what is called the Seychelle
    </p>
    <p>
     ground in the Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast;
    </p>
    <p>
     yet it did not follow that were the Pequod to visit either
    </p>
    <p>
     of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season,
    </p>
    <p>
     she would infallibly encounter him there.  So, too, with some
    </p>
    <p>
     other feeding-grounds, where he had at times revealed himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and
    </p>
    <p>
     ocean-inns, so to speak, not his places of prolonged abode.
    </p>
    <p>
     And where Ahab's chances of accomplishing his object
    </p>
    <p>
     have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only been made
    </p>
    <p>
     to whatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his,
    </p>
    <p>
     ere a particular set time or place were attained, when all
    </p>
    <p>
     possibilities would become probabilities, and, as Ahab
    </p>
    <p>
     fondly thought, every possibility the next thing to a certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
     That particular set time and place were conjoined in the one
    </p>
    <p>
     technical phrase--the Season-on-the-Line. For there and then,
    </p>
    <p>
     for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been periodically
    </p>
    <p>
     descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the sun,
    </p>
    <p>
     in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any
    </p>
    <p>
     one sign of the Zodiac.  There it was, too, that most of
    </p>
    <p>
     the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place;
    </p>
    <p>
     there the waves were storied with his deeds; there also was
    </p>
    <p>
     that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found
    </p>
    <p>
     the awful motive to his vengeance.  But in the cautious
    </p>
    <p>
     comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which Ahab
    </p>
    <p>
     threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt, he would not
    </p>
    <p>
     permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact
    </p>
    <p>
     above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those hopes;
    </p>
    <p>
     nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize
    </p>
    <p>
     his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Season-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could
    </p>
    <p>
     enable her commander to make the great passage southwards,
    </p>
    <p>
     double Cape Horn, and then running down sixty degrees of latitude
    </p>
    <p>
     arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time to cruise there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Therefore, he must wait for the next ensuing season.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet the premature hour of the Pequod's sailing had, perhaps,
    </p>
    <p>
     been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this very complexion
    </p>
    <p>
     of things.  Because, an interval of three hundred and sixty-five
    </p>
    <p>
     days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead of
    </p>
    <p>
     impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt;
    </p>
    <p>
     if by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas
    </p>
    <p>
     far remote from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up
    </p>
    <p>
     his wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay,
    </p>
    <p>
     or China Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race.
    </p>
    <p>
     So that Monsoons, Pampas, Nor-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind
    </p>
    <p>
     but the Levanter and Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious
    </p>
    <p>
     zig-zag world-circle of the Pequod's circumnavigating wake.
    </p>
    <p>
     But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly,
    </p>
    <p>
     seems it not but a mad idea, this; that in the broad
    </p>
    <p>
     boundless ocean, one solitary whale, even if encountered,
    </p>
    <p>
     should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter,
    </p>
    <p>
     even as a white-bearded Mufti in the thronged thoroughfares
    </p>
    <p>
     of Constantinople?  Yes.  For the peculiar snow-white brow of
    </p>
    <p>
     Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but be unmistakable.
    </p>
    <p>
     And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab would mutter to himself,
    </p>
    <p>
     as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he would
    </p>
    <p>
     throw himself back in reveries--tallied him, and shall he escape?
    </p>
    <p>
     His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep's ear!
    </p>
    <p>
     And here, his mad mind would run on in a breathless race;
    </p>
    <p>
     till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him!
    </p>
    <p>
     and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover
    </p>
    <p>
     his strength.  Ah, God! what trances of torments does that man
    </p>
    <p>
     endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire.
    </p>
    <p>
     He sleeps with clenched hands; and wakes with his own bloody
    </p>
    <p>
     nails in his palms.
    </p>
    <p>
     Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably
    </p>
    <p>
     vivid dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts
    </p>
    <p>
     through the day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies,
    </p>
    <p>
     and whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain,
    </p>
    <p>
     till the very throbbing of his life-spot became insufferable anguish;
    </p>
    <p>
     and when, as was sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him
    </p>
    <p>
     heaved his being up from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him,
    </p>
    <p>
     from which forked flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends
    </p>
    <p>
     beckoned him to leap down among them; when this hell in himself
    </p>
    <p>
     yawned beneath him, a wild cry would be heard through the ship;
    </p>
    <p>
     and with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room, as though
    </p>
    <p>
     escaping from a bed that was on fire.  Yet these, perhaps, instead of
    </p>
    <p>
     being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright
    </p>
    <p>
     at his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity.
    </p>
    <p>
     For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast
    </p>
    <p>
     hunter of the white whale; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock,
    </p>
    <p>
     was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again.
    </p>
    <p>
     The latter was the eternal, living principle or soul in him;
    </p>
    <p>
     and in sleep, being for the time dissociated from the characterizing mind,
    </p>
    <p>
     which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or agent,
    </p>
    <p>
     it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the
    </p>
    <p>
     frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no longer an integral.
    </p>
    <p>
     But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the soul, therefore it
    </p>
    <p>
     must have been that, in Ahab's case, yielding up all his thoughts
    </p>
    <p>
     and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that purpose, by its own sheer
    </p>
    <p>
     inveteracy of will, forced itself against gods and devils into a kind
    </p>
    <p>
     of self-assumed, independent being of its own.  Nay, could grimly
    </p>
    <p>
     live and burn, while the common vitality to which it was conjoined,
    </p>
    <p>
     fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Therefore, the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes, when what
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed Ahab rushed from his room, was for the time but a vacated thing,
    </p>
    <p>
     a formless somnambulistic being, a ray of living light, to be sure,
    </p>
    <p>
     but without an object to color, and therefore a blankness in itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     God help thee, old man, thy thoughts have created a creature in thee;
    </p>
    <p>
     and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a Prometheus;
    </p>
    <p>
     a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever; that vulture the very
    </p>
    <p>
     creature he creates.

     CHAPTER 45
    </head>
    <p>
     The Affidavit
    </p>
    <p>
     So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed,
    </p>
    <p>
     as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious
    </p>
    <p>
     particulars in the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in its
    </p>
    <p>
     earlier part, is as important a one as will be found in this volume;
    </p>
    <p>
     but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and more
    </p>
    <p>
     familiarly enlarged upon, in order to be adequately understood,
    </p>
    <p>
     and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance
    </p>
    <p>
     of the entire subject may induce in some minds, as to the natural
    </p>
    <p>
     verity of the main points of this affair.
    </p>
    <p>
     I care not to perform this part of my task methodically;
    </p>
    <p>
     but shall be content to produce the desired impression
    </p>
    <p>
     by separate citations of items, practically or reliably known
    </p>
    <p>
     to me as a whaleman; and from these citations, I take it--
    </p>
    <p>
     the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     First:  I have personally known three instances where a whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     after receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape;
    </p>
    <p>
     and, after an interval (in one instance of three years), has been
    </p>
    <p>
     again struck by the same hand, and slain; when the two irons,
    </p>
    <p>
     both marked by the same private cypher, have been taken from the body.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the instance where three years intervened between the flinging
    </p>
    <p>
     of the two harpoons; and I think it may have been something more
    </p>
    <p>
     than that; the man who darted them happening, in the interval,
    </p>
    <p>
     to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa, went ashore there,
    </p>
    <p>
     joined a discovery party, and penetrated far into the interior,
    </p>
    <p>
     where he travelled for a period of nearly two years, often endangered
    </p>
    <p>
     by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other
    </p>
    <p>
     common perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels;
    </p>
    <p>
     no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its
    </p>
    <p>
     flanks all the coasts of Africa; but to no purpose.  This man and
    </p>
    <p>
     this whale again came together, and the one vanquished the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     I say I, myself, have known three instances similar to this;
    </p>
    <p>
     that is in two of them I saw the whales struck; and, upon the second
    </p>
    <p>
     attack, saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them,
    </p>
    <p>
     afterwards taken from the dead fish.  In the three-year instance,
    </p>
    <p>
     it so fell out that I was in the boat both times, first and last,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the last time distinctly recognized a peculiar sort of huge mole
    </p>
    <p>
     under the whale's eye, which I had observed there three years previous.
    </p>
    <p>
     I say three years, but I am pretty sure it was more than that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here are three instances, then, which I personally know the truth of;
    </p>
    <p>
     but I have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity
    </p>
    <p>
     in the matter there is no good ground to impeach.
    </p>
    <p>
     Secondly:  It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant
    </p>
    <p>
     the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several
    </p>
    <p>
     memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean
    </p>
    <p>
     has been at distant times and places popularly cognisable.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally
    </p>
    <p>
     owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales;
    </p>
    <p>
     for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be,
    </p>
    <p>
     they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him, and boiling
    </p>
    <p>
     him down into a peculiarly valuable oil.  No:  the reason was this:
    </p>
    <p>
     that from the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung
    </p>
    <p>
     a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale as there
    </p>
    <p>
     did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most fishermen were
    </p>
    <p>
     content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins
    </p>
    <p>
     when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like some poor devils ashore that happen to known an irascible
    </p>
    <p>
     great man, they make distant unobtrusive salutations to him
    </p>
    <p>
     in the street, lest if they pursued the acquaintance further,
    </p>
    <p>
     they might receive a summary thump for their presumption.
    </p>
    <p>
     But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great
    </p>
    <p>
     individual celebrity--nay, you may call it an oceanwide renown;
    </p>
    <p>
     not only was he famous in life and now is immortal in
    </p>
    <p>
     forecastle stories after death, but he was admitted into
    </p>
    <p>
     all the rights, privileges, and distinctions of a name;
    </p>
    <p>
     had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Caesar.  Was it not so,
    </p>
    <p>
     O Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg,
    </p>
    <p>
     who so long did'st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name,
    </p>
    <p>
     whose spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay?  Was it
    </p>
    <p>
     not so, O New Zealand Jack! thou terror of all cruisers that crossed
    </p>
    <p>
     their wakes in the vicinity of the Tattoo Land?  Was it not so,
    </p>
    <p>
     O Morquan!  King of Japan, whose lofty jet they say at times
    </p>
    <p>
     assumed the semblance of a snow-white cross against the sky?
    </p>
    <p>
     Was it not so, O Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale, marked like
    </p>
    <p>
     an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back!
    </p>
    <p>
     In plain prose, here are four whales as well known to the students
    </p>
    <p>
     of Cetacean History as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar.
    </p>
    <p>
     But this is not all.  New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at various
    </p>
    <p>
     times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels,
    </p>
    <p>
     were finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out,
    </p>
    <p>
     chased and killed by valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their
    </p>
    <p>
     anchors with that express object as much in view, as in setting
    </p>
    <p>
     out through the Narragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it
    </p>
    <p>
     in his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage Annawon,
    </p>
    <p>
     the headmost warrior of the Indian King Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
     I do not know where I can find a better place than just here,
    </p>
    <p>
     to make mention of one or two other things, which to me seem important,
    </p>
    <p>
     as in printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness
    </p>
    <p>
     of the whole story of the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p>
     For this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires
    </p>
    <p>
     full as much bolstering as error.  So ignorant are most landsmen of some
    </p>
    <p>
     of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world, that without
    </p>
    <p>
     some hints touching the plain facts, historical and otherwise,
    </p>
    <p>
     of the fishery, they might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable,
    </p>
    <p>
     or still worse and more detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory.
    </p>
    <p>
     First:  Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general
    </p>
    <p>
     perils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid
    </p>
    <p>
     conception of those perils, and the frequency with which they recur.
    </p>
    <p>
     One reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual disasters
    </p>
    <p>
     and deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a public record
    </p>
    <p>
     at home, however transient and immediately forgotten that record.
    </p>
    <p>
     Do you suppose that that poor fellow there, who this moment perhaps
    </p>
    <p>
     caught by the whale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being
    </p>
    <p>
     carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan--
    </p>
    <p>
     do you suppose that that poor fellow's name will appear in the newspaper
    </p>
    <p>
     obituary you will read to-morrow at your breakfast?  No:  because the
    </p>
    <p>
     mails are very irregular between here and New Guinea.  In fact,
    </p>
    <p>
     did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct or indirect
    </p>
    <p>
     from New Guinea?  Yet I will tell you that upon one particular voyage
    </p>
    <p>
     which I made to the Pacific, among many others we spoke thirty
    </p>
    <p>
     different ships, every one of which had had a death by a whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     some of them more than one, and three that had each lost a boat's crew.
    </p>
    <p>
     For God's sake, be economical with your lamps and candles! not a gallon
    </p>
    <p>
     you burn, but at least one drop of man's blood was spilled for it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Secondly:  People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea
    </p>
    <p>
     that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power;
    </p>
    <p>
     but I have ever found that when narrating to them some specific
    </p>
    <p>
     example of this two-fold enormousness, they have significantly
    </p>
    <p>
     complimented me upon my facetiousness; when, I declare upon
    </p>
    <p>
     my soul, I had no more idea of being facetious than Moses,
    </p>
    <p>
     when he wrote the history of the plagues of Egypt.
    </p>
    <p>
     But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established
    </p>
    <p>
     upon testimony entirely independent of my own.  That point is this:
    </p>
    <p>
     The Sperm Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing,
    </p>
    <p>
     and judiciously malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in,
    </p>
    <p>
     utterly destroy, and sink a large ship; and what is more,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Sperm Whale has done it.
    </p>
    <p>
     First:  In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard,
    </p>
    <p>
     of Nantucket, was cruising in the Pacific Ocean.  One day
    </p>
    <p>
     she saw spouts, lowered her boats, and gave chase to a shoal
    </p>
    <p>
     of sperm whales.  Ere long, several of the whales were wounded;
    </p>
    <p>
     when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping from the boats,
    </p>
    <p>
     issued from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dashing his forehead against her hull, he so stove her in,
    </p>
    <p>
     that in less than "ten minutes" she settled down and fell over.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not a surviving plank of her has been seen since.
    </p>
    <p>
     After the severest exposure, part of the crew reached the land
    </p>
    <p>
     in their boats.  Being returned home at last, Captain Pollard
    </p>
    <p>
     once more sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship,
    </p>
    <p>
     but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers;
    </p>
    <p>
     for the second time his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith
    </p>
    <p>
     forswearing the sea, he has never attempted it since.
    </p>
    <p>
     At this day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket.  I have
    </p>
    <p>
     seen Owen Chace, who was chief mate of the Essex at the time
    </p>
    <p>
     of the tragedy; I have read his plain and faithful narrative;
    </p>
    <p>
     I have conversed with his son; and all this within a few miles
    </p>
    <p>
     of the scene of the catastrophe.*
    </p>
    <p>
     *The following are extracts from Chace's narrative:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Every fact seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was
    </p>
    <p>
     anything but chance which directed his operations; he made two
    </p>
    <p>
     several attacks upon the ship, at a short interval between them,
    </p>
    <p>
     both of this catastrophe I have never chanced to their direction,
    </p>
    <p>
     were calculated to do us the whale hunters I have now and then
    </p>
    <p>
     heard casual allusions to it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thirdly:  Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J---then commanding
    </p>
    <p>
     an American sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to be dining
    </p>
    <p>
     with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in the
    </p>
    <p>
     harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands.  Conversation turning upon whales,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing
    </p>
    <p>
     strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present.
    </p>
    <p>
     He peremptorily denied for example, that any whale could
    </p>
    <p>
     so smite his stout sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much
    </p>
    <p>
     as a thimbleful.  Very good; but there is more coming.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some weeks later, the Commodore set sail in this impregnable craft
    </p>
    <p>
     for Valparaiso.  But he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     that begged a few moments' confidential business with him.
    </p>
    <p>
     That business consisted in fetching the Commodore's craft such a thwack,
    </p>
    <p>
     that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest
    </p>
    <p>
     port to heave down and repair.  I am not superstitious, but I
    </p>
    <p>
     consider the Commodore's interview with that whale as providential.
    </p>
    <p>
     Was not Saul of Tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright?
    </p>
    <p>
     I tell you, the sperm whale will stand no nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
     I will now refer you to Langsdorff's Voyages for a little circumstance
    </p>
    <p>
     in point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof.  Langsdorff, you
    </p>
    <p>
     must know by the way, was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern's
    </p>
    <p>
     famous Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century.
    </p>
    <p>
     Captain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter:
    </p>
    <p>
     "By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the next day we were out in the open sea, on our way
    </p>
    <p>
     to Ochotsh.  The weather was very clear and fine, but so intolerably
    </p>
    <p>
     cold that we were obliged to keep on our fur clothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     For some days we had very little wind; it was not till
    </p>
    <p>
     the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up.
    </p>
    <p>
     An uncommonly large whale, the body of which was larger
    </p>
    <p>
     than the ship itself, lay almost at the surface of the water,
    </p>
    <p>
     but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment
    </p>
    <p>
     when the ship, which was in full sail, was almost upon him,
    </p>
    <p>
     so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him.
    </p>
    <p>
     We were thus placed in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic
    </p>
    <p>
     creature, setting up its back, raised the ship three feet at least
    </p>
    <p>
     out of the water.  The masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether,
    </p>
    <p>
     while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck,
    </p>
    <p>
     concluding that we had struck upon some rock; instead of this we
    </p>
    <p>
     saw the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Captain D'Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine
    </p>
    <p>
     whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock,
    </p>
    <p>
     but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured."
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, the Captain D'Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship
    </p>
    <p>
     in question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual
    </p>
    <p>
     adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village
    </p>
    <p>
     of Dorchester near Boston.  I have the honor of being a nephew
    </p>
    <p>
     of his.  I have particularly questioned him concerning
    </p>
    <p>
     this passage in Langsdorff.  He substantiates every word.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ship, however, was by no means a large one:  a Russian
    </p>
    <p>
     craft built on the Siberian coast, and purchased by my uncle
    </p>
    <p>
     after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home.
    </p>
    <p>
     In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure,
    </p>
    <p>
     so full, too, of honest wonders--the voyage of Lionel Wafer,
    </p>
    <p>
     one of ancient Dampier's old chums--I found a little matter
    </p>
    <p>
     set down so like that just quoted from Langsdorff, that I
    </p>
    <p>
     cannot forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example,
    </p>
    <p>
     if such be needed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lionel, it seems, was on his way to "John Ferdinando,"
    </p>
    <p>
     as he calls the modern Juan Fernandes.  "In our way thither,"
    </p>
    <p>
     he says, "about four o'clock in the morning, when we were about
    </p>
    <p>
     one hundred and fifty leagues from the Main of America, our ship
    </p>
    <p>
     felt a terrible shock, which put our men in such consternation
    </p>
    <p>
     that they could hardly tell where they were or what to think;
    </p>
    <p>
     but every one began to prepare for death.  And, indeed, the shock
    </p>
    <p>
     was so sudden and violent, that we took it for granted the ship
    </p>
    <p>
     had struck against a rock; but when the amazement was a little over,
    </p>
    <p>
     we cast the lead, and sounded, but found no ground.  ... The
    </p>
    <p>
     suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages,
    </p>
    <p>
     and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was thrown
    </p>
    <p>
     out of his cabin!"  Lionel then goes on to impute the shock
    </p>
    <p>
     to an earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation
    </p>
    <p>
     by stating that a great earthquake, somewhere about that time,
    </p>
    <p>
     did actually do great mischief along the Spanish land.
    </p>
    <p>
     But I should not much wonder if, in the darkness of that early
    </p>
    <p>
     hour of the morning, the shock was after all caused by an unseen
    </p>
    <p>
     whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
     I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known
    </p>
    <p>
     to me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     In more than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase
    </p>
    <p>
     the assailing boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself,
    </p>
    <p>
     and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks.
    </p>
    <p>
     The English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head;
    </p>
    <p>
     and, as for his strength, let me say, that there have been examples
    </p>
    <p>
     where the lines attached to a running sperm whale have, in a calm,
    </p>
    <p>
     been transferred to the ship, and secured there! the whale towing
    </p>
    <p>
     her great hull through the water, as a horse walks off with a cart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm whale, once struck,
    </p>
    <p>
     is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often with blind rage,
    </p>
    <p>
     as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers;
    </p>
    <p>
     nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character,
    </p>
    <p>
     that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth,
    </p>
    <p>
     and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
     But I must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration;
    </p>
    <p>
     a remarkable and most significant one, by which you will not fail
    </p>
    <p>
     to see, that not only is the most marvellous event in this book
    </p>
    <p>
     corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but that these marvels
    </p>
    <p>
     (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages; so that for
    </p>
    <p>
     the millionth time we say amen with Solomon--Verily there is nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     new under the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian
    </p>
    <p>
     magistrate of Constantinople, in the days when Justinian
    </p>
    <p>
     was Emperor and Belisarius general.  As many know, he wrote
    </p>
    <p>
     the history of his own times, a work every way of uncommon value.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the best authorities, he has always been considered a most
    </p>
    <p>
     trustworthy and unexaggerating historian, except in some one
    </p>
    <p>
     or two particulars, not at all affecting the matter presently
    </p>
    <p>
     to be mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term of
    </p>
    <p>
     his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured in the
    </p>
    <p>
     neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed vessels
    </p>
    <p>
     at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years.
    </p>
    <p>
     A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor is there any reason it should be.  Of what precise species this
    </p>
    <p>
     sea-monster was, is not mentioned.  But as he destroyed ships,
    </p>
    <p>
     as well as for other reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am
    </p>
    <p>
     strongly inclined to think a sperm whale.  And I will tell you why.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had been always
    </p>
    <p>
     unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even now I am certain that those seas are not, and perhaps never can be,
    </p>
    <p>
     in the present constitution of things, a place for his habitual
    </p>
    <p>
     gregarious resort.  But further investigations have recently proved to me,
    </p>
    <p>
     that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence
    </p>
    <p>
     of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean.  I am told, on good authority,
    </p>
    <p>
     that on the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found
    </p>
    <p>
     the skeleton of a sperm whale.  Now, as a vessel of war readily passes
    </p>
    <p>
     through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route,
    </p>
    <p>
     pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar
    </p>
    <p>
     substance called brit is to be found, the aliment of the right whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale--
    </p>
    <p>
     squid or cuttle-fish--lurks at the bottom of that sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     because large creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort,
    </p>
    <p>
     have been found at its surface.  If, then, you properly
    </p>
    <p>
     put these statements together, and reason upon them a bit,
    </p>
    <p>
     you will clearly perceive that, according to all human reasoning,
    </p>
    <p>
     Procopius's sea-monster, that for half a century stove the ships
    </p>
    <p>
     of a Roman Emperor, must in all probability have been a sperm whale.

     CHAPTER 46
    </head>
    <p>
     Surmises
    </p>
    <p>
     Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his
    </p>
    <p>
     thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick;
    </p>
    <p>
     though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that
    </p>
    <p>
     one passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature
    </p>
    <p>
     and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman's ways,
    </p>
    <p>
     altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or at least if this were otherwise, there were not wanting other
    </p>
    <p>
     motives much more influential with him.  It would be refining
    </p>
    <p>
     too much, perhaps, even considering his monomania, to hint that his
    </p>
    <p>
     vindictiveness towards the White Whale might have possibly extended
    </p>
    <p>
     itself in some degree to all sperm whales, and that the more monsters
    </p>
    <p>
     he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each
    </p>
    <p>
     subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he hunted.
    </p>
    <p>
     But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable, there were still
    </p>
    <p>
     additional considerations which, though not so strictly according
    </p>
    <p>
     with the wildness of his ruling passion, yet were by no means
    </p>
    <p>
     incapable of swaying him.
    </p>
    <p>
     To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used
    </p>
    <p>
     in the shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order.
    </p>
    <p>
     He knew, for example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some
    </p>
    <p>
     respects was over Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover
    </p>
    <p>
     the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority
    </p>
    <p>
     involves intellectual mastership; for to the purely spiritual,
    </p>
    <p>
     the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Starbuck's body and Starbuck's coerced will were Ahab's, so long as Ahab
    </p>
    <p>
     kept his magnet at Starbuck's brain; still he knew that for all this
    </p>
    <p>
     the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred his captain's quest, and could he,
    </p>
    <p>
     would joyfully disintegrate himself from it, or even frustrate it.
    </p>
    <p>
     It might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale
    </p>
    <p>
     was seen.  During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall
    </p>
    <p>
     into open relapses of rebellion against his captain's leadership,
    </p>
    <p>
     unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences were brought
    </p>
    <p>
     to bear upon him.  Not only that, but the subtle insanity of Ahab
    </p>
    <p>
     respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly manifested than in his
    </p>
    <p>
     superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that, for the present,
    </p>
    <p>
     the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginative
    </p>
    <p>
     impiousness which naturally invested it; that the full terror of the
    </p>
    <p>
     voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure background (for few men's
    </p>
    <p>
     courage is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action);
    </p>
    <p>
     that when they stood their long night watches, his officers and men must
    </p>
    <p>
     have some nearer things to think of than Moby Dick.  For however eagerly
    </p>
    <p>
     and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest;
    </p>
    <p>
     yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable--
    </p>
    <p>
     they live in the varying outer weather, and they inhale its fickleness--
    </p>
    <p>
     and when retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit,
    </p>
    <p>
     however promissory of life and passion in the end, it is above all things
    </p>
    <p>
     requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene
    </p>
    <p>
     and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing.  In times of strong emotion
    </p>
    <p>
     mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent.
    </p>
    <p>
     The permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man,
    </p>
    <p>
     thought Ahab, is sordidness.  Granting that the White Whale fully
    </p>
    <p>
     incites the hearts of this my savage crew, and playing round
    </p>
    <p>
     their savageness even breeds a certain generous knight-errantism
    </p>
    <p>
     in them, still, while for the love of it they give chase to Moby Dick,
    </p>
    <p>
     they must also have food for their more common, daily appetites.
    </p>
    <p>
     For even the high lifted and chivalric Crusaders of old times
    </p>
    <p>
     were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to fight
    </p>
    <p>
     for their holy sepulchre, without committing burglaries,
    </p>
    <p>
     picking pockets, and gaining other pious perquisites by the way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic object--
    </p>
    <p>
     that final and romantic object, too many would have turned
    </p>
    <p>
     from in disgust.  I will not strip these men, thought Ahab,
    </p>
    <p>
     of all hopes of cash--aye, cash.  They may scorn cash now;
    </p>
    <p>
     but let some months go by, and no perspective promise of it to them,
    </p>
    <p>
     and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them,
    </p>
    <p>
     this same cash would soon cashier Ahab.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more
    </p>
    <p>
     related to Ahab personally.  Having impulsively, it is probable,
    </p>
    <p>
     and perhaps somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private
    </p>
    <p>
     purpose of the Pequod's voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that,
    </p>
    <p>
     in so doing, he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable
    </p>
    <p>
     charge of usurpation; and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal,
    </p>
    <p>
     his crew if so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all
    </p>
    <p>
     further obedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command.
    </p>
    <p>
     From even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the possible
    </p>
    <p>
     consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground,
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     That protection could only consist in his own predominating brain
    </p>
    <p>
     and heart and hand, backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention
    </p>
    <p>
     to every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his
    </p>
    <p>
     crew to be subjected to.
    </p>
    <p>
     For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally
    </p>
    <p>
     developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree
    </p>
    <p>
     continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod's voyage;
    </p>
    <p>
     observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force himself
    </p>
    <p>
     to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit
    </p>
    <p>
     of his profession.
    </p>
    <p>
     Be all this as it may, his voice was now often heard
    </p>
    <p>
     hailing the three mastheads and admonishing them to keep
    </p>
    <p>
     a bright look-out, and not omit reporting even a porpoise.
    </p>
    <p>
     This vigilance was not long without reward.

     CHAPTER 47
    </head>
    <p>
     The Mat-Maker
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging
    </p>
    <p>
     about the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-colored waters.
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat,
    </p>
    <p>
     for an additional lashing to our boat.  So still and subdued and yet
    </p>
    <p>
     somehow preluding was all the scene, and such an incantation of revelry
    </p>
    <p>
     lurked in the air, that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his
    </p>
    <p>
     own invisible self.
    </p>
    <p>
     I was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat.
    </p>
    <p>
     As I kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline
    </p>
    <p>
     between the long yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle,
    </p>
    <p>
     and as Queequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy
    </p>
    <p>
     oaken sword between the threads, and idly looking off upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the water, carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn;
    </p>
    <p>
     I say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over
    </p>
    <p>
     the ship and all over the sea, only broken by the intermitting
    </p>
    <p>
     dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as if this were
    </p>
    <p>
     the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle mechanically
    </p>
    <p>
     weaving and weaving away at the Fates.  There lay the fixed
    </p>
    <p>
     threads of the warp subject to but one single, ever returning,
    </p>
    <p>
     unchanging vibration, and that vibration merely enough to admit
    </p>
    <p>
     of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own.
    </p>
    <p>
     This warp seemed necessity; and here, thought I, with my own
    </p>
    <p>
     hand I ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into
    </p>
    <p>
     these unalterable threads.  Meantime, Queequeg's impulsive,
    </p>
    <p>
     indifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof slantingly,
    </p>
    <p>
     or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be;
    </p>
    <p>
     and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a
    </p>
    <p>
     corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric;
    </p>
    <p>
     this savage's sword, thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions
    </p>
    <p>
     both warp and woof; this easy, indifferent sword must be chance--
    </p>
    <p>
     aye, chance, free will, and necessity--no wise incompatible--
    </p>
    <p>
     all interweavingly working together.  The straight warp
    </p>
    <p>
     of necessity, not to be swerved from its ultimate course--
    </p>
    <p>
     its every alternating vibration, indeed, only tending to that;
    </p>
    <p>
     free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads;
    </p>
    <p>
     and chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines
    </p>
    <p>
     of necessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will,
    </p>
    <p>
     though thus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either,
    </p>
    <p>
     and has the last featuring blow at events.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound
    </p>
    <p>
     so strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly,
    </p>
    <p>
     that the ball of free will dropped from my hand, and I stood
    </p>
    <p>
     gazing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing.
    </p>
    <p>
     High aloft in the cross-trees was that mad Gay-Header, Tashtego.
    </p>
    <p>
     His body was reaching eagerly forward, his hand stretched out
    </p>
    <p>
     like a wand, and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries.
    </p>
    <p>
     To be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being
    </p>
    <p>
     heard all over the seas, from hundreds of whalemen's look-outs
    </p>
    <p>
     perched as high in the air; but from few of those lungs could
    </p>
    <p>
     that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence
    </p>
    <p>
     as from Tashtego the Indian's.
    </p>
    <p>
     As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly
    </p>
    <p>
     and eagerly peering towards the horizon, you would have thought
    </p>
    <p>
     him some prophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate,
    </p>
    <p>
     and by those wild cries announcing their coming.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where-away?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "On the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Instantly all was commotion.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating
    </p>
    <p>
     and reliable uniformity.  And thereby whalemen distinguish this
    </p>
    <p>
     fish from other tribes of his genus.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There go flukes!" was now the cry from Tashtego;
    </p>
    <p>
     and the whales disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Quick, steward!" cried Ahab.  "Time! time!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Dough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact
    </p>
    <p>
     minute to Ahab.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently
    </p>
    <p>
     rolling before it.  Tashtego reporting that the whales
    </p>
    <p>
     had gone down heading to leeward, we confidently looked
    </p>
    <p>
     to see them again directly in advance of our bows.
    </p>
    <p>
     For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale when,
    </p>
    <p>
     sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless,
    </p>
    <p>
     while concealed beneath the surface, mills around, and swiftly
    </p>
    <p>
     swims off in the opposite quarter--this deceitfulness of his
    </p>
    <p>
     could not now be in action; for there was no reason to suppose
    </p>
    <p>
     that the fish seen by Tashtego had been in any way alarmed,
    </p>
    <p>
     or indeed knew at all of our vicinity.  One of the men selected
    </p>
    <p>
     for shipkeepers--that is, those not appointed to the boats,
    </p>
    <p>
     by this time relieved the Indian at the main-mast head.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down; the line
    </p>
    <p>
     tubs were fixed in their places; the cranes were thrust out;
    </p>
    <p>
     the mainyard was backed, and the three boats swung over
    </p>
    <p>
     the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung
    </p>
    <p>
     to the rail, while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale.
    </p>
    <p>
     So look the long line of man-of-war's men about to throw
    </p>
    <p>
     themselves on board an enemy's ship.
    </p>
    <p>
     But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took
    </p>
    <p>
     every eye from the whale.  With a start all glared at dark Ahab,
    </p>
    <p>
     who was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed
    </p>
    <p>
     out of air.

    <p>
     The First Lowering
    </p>
    <p>
     The phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other
    </p>
    <p>
     side of the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose
    </p>
    <p>
     the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there.  This boat had
    </p>
    <p>
     always been deemed one of the spare boats, though technically called
    </p>
    <p>
     the captain's, on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
     The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart,
    </p>
    <p>
     with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     A rumpled Chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him,
    </p>
    <p>
     with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff.  But strangely
    </p>
    <p>
     crowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban,
    </p>
    <p>
     the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Less swart in aspect, the companions of this figure were of that vivid,
    </p>
    <p>
     tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Manillas;--a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty,
    </p>
    <p>
     and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies
    </p>
    <p>
     and secret confidential agents on the water of the devil, their lord,
    </p>
    <p>
     whose counting-room they suppose to be elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
     While yet the wondering ship's company were gazing upon these strangers,
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head,
    </p>
    <p>
     "All ready there, Fedallah?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ready," was the half-hissed reply.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Lower away then; d'ye hear?" shouting across the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Lower away there, I say."
    </p>
    <p>
     Such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their
    </p>
    <p>
     amazement the men sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled
    </p>
    <p>
     round in the blocks; with a wallow, the three boats dropped
    </p>
    <p>
     into the sea; while, with a dexterous, off-handed daring,
    </p>
    <p>
     unknown in any other vocation, the sailors, goat-like, leaped
    </p>
    <p>
     down the rolling ship's side into the tossed boats below.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship's lee, when a fourth keel,
    </p>
    <p>
     coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern,
    </p>
    <p>
     and showed the five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect
    </p>
    <p>
     in the stern, loudly hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread
    </p>
    <p>
     themselves widely, so as to cover a large expanse of water.
    </p>
    <p>
     But with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and
    </p>
    <p>
     his crew, the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Captain Ahab?-" said Starbuck.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Spread yourselves," cried Ahab; "give way, all four boats.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thou, Flask, pull out more to leeward!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, aye, sir," cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round his
    </p>
    <p>
     great steering oar.  "Lay back!" addressing his crew.  "There!--there!--
    </p>
    <p>
     there again!  There she blows right ahead, boys!--lay back!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, I don't mind'em, sir," said Archy; "I knew it all before now.
    </p>
    <p>
     Didn't I hear 'em in the hold?  And didn't I tell Cabaco here of it?
    </p>
    <p>
     What say ye, Cabaco?  They are stowaways, Mr. Flask."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children;
    </p>
    <p>
     pull, my little ones," drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb
    </p>
    <p>
     to his crew, some of whom still showed signs of uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why don't you break your backbones, my boys?  What is it you stare at?
    </p>
    <p>
     Those chaps in yonder boat?  Tut!  They are only five more hands
    </p>
    <p>
     come to help us never mind from where the more the merrier.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pull, then, do pull; never mind the brimstone devils are good
    </p>
    <p>
     fellows enough.  So, so; there you are now; that's the stroke
    </p>
    <p>
     for a thousand pounds; that's the stroke to sweep the stakes!
    </p>
    <p>
     Hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil, my heroes!
    </p>
    <p>
     Three cheers, men--all hearts alive!  Easy, easy; don't be in a hurry--
    </p>
    <p>
     don't be in a hurry.  Why don't you snap your oars, you rascals?
    </p>
    <p>
     Bite something, you dogs!  So, so, so, then:--softly, softly!
    </p>
    <p>
     That's it--that's it! long and strong.  Give way there, give way!
    </p>
    <p>
     The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are all asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull.  Pull, will ye? pull,
    </p>
    <p>
     can't ye? pull, won't ye?  Why in the name of gudgeons and
    </p>
    <p>
     ginger-cakes don't ye pull?--pull and break something! pull,
    </p>
    <p>
     and start your eyes out!  Here," whipping out the sharp knife
    </p>
    <p>
     from his girdle; "every mother's son of ye draw his knife,
    </p>
    <p>
     and pull with the blade between his teeth.  That's it--that's it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now ye do something; that looks like it, my steel-bits. Start her--
    </p>
    <p>
     start her, my silverspoons!  Start her, marling-spikes!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Stubb's exordium to his crew is given here at large,
    </p>
    <p>
     because he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general,
    </p>
    <p>
     and especially in inculcating the religion of rowing.
    </p>
    <p>
     But you must not suppose from this specimen of his sermonizings
    </p>
    <p>
     that he ever flew into downright passions with his congregation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not at all; and therein consisted his chief peculiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
     He would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a tone
    </p>
    <p>
     so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     so calculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman
    </p>
    <p>
     could hear such queer invocations without pulling for
    </p>
    <p>
     dear life, and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Besides he all the time looked so easy and indolent himself,
    </p>
    <p>
     so loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so broadly gaped--
    </p>
    <p>
     open-mouthed at times--that the mere sight of such a yawning commander,
    </p>
    <p>
     by sheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon the crew.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then again, Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists,
    </p>
    <p>
     whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous, as to put
    </p>
    <p>
     all inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them.
    </p>
    <p>
     In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely
    </p>
    <p>
     across Stubb's bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were
    </p>
    <p>
     pretty near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir,
    </p>
    <p>
     if ye please!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Halloa!" returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch
    </p>
    <p>
     as he spoke; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew;
    </p>
    <p>
     his face set like a flint from Stubb's.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed.
    </p>
    <p>
     (Strong, strong, boys!)" in a whisper to his crew,
    </p>
    <p>
     then speaking out loud again:  "A sad business, Mr. Stubb!
    </p>
    <p>
     (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never mind, Mr. Stubb,
    </p>
    <p>
     all for the best.  Let all your crew pull strong, come what will.
    </p>
    <p>
     (Spring, my men, spring!) There's hogsheads of sperm ahead,
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Stubb, and that's what ye came for.  (Pull, my boys!)
    </p>
    <p>
     Sperm, sperm's the play!  This at least is duty; duty and profit
    </p>
    <p>
     hand in hand."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, aye, I thought as much," soliloquized Stubb, when the
    </p>
    <p>
     boats diverged, "as soon as I clapt eye on 'em, I thought so.
    </p>
    <p>
     Aye, and that's what he went into the after hold for, so often,
    </p>
    <p>
     as Dough-Boy long suspected.  They were hidden down there.
    </p>
    <p>
     The White Whale's at the bottom of it.  Well, well, so be it!
    </p>
    <p>
     Can't be helped!  All right!  Give way men!  It ain't the White Whale
    </p>
    <p>
     to-day! Give way!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical
    </p>
    <p>
     instant as the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not
    </p>
    <p>
     unreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of
    </p>
    <p>
     the ship's company; but Archy's fancied discovery having some time
    </p>
    <p>
     previous got abroad among them, though indeed not credited then,
    </p>
    <p>
     this had in some small measure prepared them for the event.
    </p>
    <p>
     It took off the extreme edge of their wonder; and so what with all
    </p>
    <p>
     this and Stubb's confident way of accounting for their appearance,
    </p>
    <p>
     they were for the time freed from superstitious surmisings; though the
    </p>
    <p>
     affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures
    </p>
    <p>
     as to dark Ahab's precise agency in the matter from the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
     For me, I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen
    </p>
    <p>
     creeping on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn,
    </p>
    <p>
     as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided
    </p>
    <p>
     the furthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats;
    </p>
    <p>
     a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone;
    </p>
    <p>
     like five trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes
    </p>
    <p>
     of strength, which periodically started the boat along the water
    </p>
    <p>
     like a horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer.
    </p>
    <p>
     As for Fedallah, who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar,
    </p>
    <p>
     he had thrown aside his black jacket, and displayed his naked chest
    </p>
    <p>
     with the whole part of his body above the gunwale, clearly cut
    </p>
    <p>
     against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon;
    </p>
    <p>
     while at the other end of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a fencer's,
    </p>
    <p>
     thrown half backward into the air, as if to counterbalance any
    </p>
    <p>
     tendency to trip; Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar
    </p>
    <p>
     as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him.
    </p>
    <p>
     All at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion
    </p>
    <p>
     and then remained fixed, while the boat's five oars were seen
    </p>
    <p>
     simultaneously peaked.  Boat and crew sat motionless on the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instantly the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way.
    </p>
    <p>
     The whales had irregularly settled bodily down into the blue,
    </p>
    <p>
     thus giving no distantly discernible token of the movement,
    </p>
    <p>
     though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Every man look out along his oars!" cried Starbuck.  "Thou, Queequeg,
    </p>
    <p>
     stand up!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow,
    </p>
    <p>
     the savage stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed
    </p>
    <p>
     off towards the spot where the chase had last been descried.
    </p>
    <p>
     Likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where it was also
    </p>
    <p>
     triangularly platformed level with the gunwale, Starbuck himself
    </p>
    <p>
     was seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking
    </p>
    <p>
     tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently eyeing the vast
    </p>
    <p>
     blue eye of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not very far distant Flask's boat was also lying breathlessly still;
    </p>
    <p>
     its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead,
    </p>
    <p>
     a stout sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet
    </p>
    <p>
     above the level of the stern platform.  It is used for catching turns
    </p>
    <p>
     with the whale line.  Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a
    </p>
    <p>
     man's hand, and standing upon such a base as that, Flask seemed perched
    </p>
    <p>
     at the mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks.
    </p>
    <p>
     But little King-Post was small and short, and at the same time little
    </p>
    <p>
     King-Post was full of a large and tall ambition, so that this logger
    </p>
    <p>
     head stand-point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I can't see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let
    </p>
    <p>
     me onto that."
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way,
    </p>
    <p>
     swiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty
    </p>
    <p>
     shoulders for a pedestal.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good a mast-head as any, sir.  Will you mount?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow;
    </p>
    <p>
     only I wish you fifty feet taller."
    </p>
    <p>
     Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of
    </p>
    <p>
     the boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm
    </p>
    <p>
     to Flask's foot, and then putting Flask's hand on his hearse-plumed
    </p>
    <p>
     head and bidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one
    </p>
    <p>
     dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
     And here was Flask now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing
    </p>
    <p>
     him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by.
    </p>
    <p>
     At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with
    </p>
    <p>
     what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman
    </p>
    <p>
     will maintain an erect posture in his boat, even when pitched
    </p>
    <p>
     about by the most riotously perverse and cross-running seas.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the logger
    </p>
    <p>
     head itself, under such circumstances.  But the sight of little
    </p>
    <p>
     Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious;
    </p>
    <p>
     for sustaining himself with a cool, indifferent, easy, unthought of,
    </p>
    <p>
     barbaric majesty, the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously
    </p>
    <p>
     rolled his fine form.  On his broad back, flaxen-haired Flask
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed a snow-flake. The bearer looked nobler than the rider.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little Flask
    </p>
    <p>
     would now and then stamp with impatience; but not one added
    </p>
    <p>
     heave did he thereby give to the negro's lordly chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping the living
    </p>
    <p>
     magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her tides and her
    </p>
    <p>
     seasons for that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing solicitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
     The whales might have made one of their regular soundings,
    </p>
    <p>
     not a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were the case,
    </p>
    <p>
     Stubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace
    </p>
    <p>
     the languishing interval with his pipe.  He withdrew it from
    </p>
    <p>
     his hatband, where he always wore it aslant like a feather.
    </p>
    <p>
     He loaded it, and rammed home the loading with his thumb-end;
    </p>
    <p>
     but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper
    </p>
    <p>
     of his hand, when Tashtego, his harpooneer, whose eyes had been
    </p>
    <p>
     setting to windward like two fixed stars, suddenly dropped like light
    </p>
    <p>
     from his erect attitude to his seat, crying out in a quick phrensy
    </p>
    <p>
     of hurry, "Down, down all, and give way!--there they are!"
    </p>
    <p>
     To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been
    </p>
    <p>
     visible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish
    </p>
    <p>
     white water, and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it,
    </p>
    <p>
     and suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from
    </p>
    <p>
     white rolling billows.  The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled,
    </p>
    <p>
     as it were, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron.
    </p>
    <p>
     Beneath this atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath
    </p>
    <p>
     a thin layer of water, also, the whales were swimming.  Seen in advance
    </p>
    <p>
     of all the other indications, the puffs of vapor they spouted,
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed their forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders.
    </p>
    <p>
     All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot
    </p>
    <p>
     of troubled water and air.  But it bade far to outstrip them;
    </p>
    <p>
     it flew on and on, as a mass of interblending bubbles borne
    </p>
    <p>
     down a rapid stream from the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Pull, pull, my good boys," said Starbuck, in the lowest possible
    </p>
    <p>
     but intensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp
    </p>
    <p>
     fixed glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow,
    </p>
    <p>
     almost seemed as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses.
    </p>
    <p>
     He did not say much to his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything
    </p>
    <p>
     to him.  Only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly
    </p>
    <p>
     pierced by one of his peculiar whispers, now harsh with command,
    </p>
    <p>
     now soft with entreaty.
    </p>
    <p>
     How different the loud little King-Post. "Sing out and
    </p>
    <p>
     say something, my hearties.  Roar and pull, my thunderbolts!
    </p>
    <p>
     Beach me, beach me on their black backs, boys; only do that for me,
    </p>
    <p>
     and I'll sign over to you my Martha's Vineyard plantation, boys;
    </p>
    <p>
     including wife and children, boys.  Lay me on--lay me on!
    </p>
    <p>
     O Lord, Lord! but I shall go stark, staring mad!  See! see that
    </p>
    <p>
     white water!"  And so shouting, he pulled his hat from his head,
    </p>
    <p>
     and stamped up and down on it; then picking it up, flirted it
    </p>
    <p>
     far off upon the sea; and finally fell to rearing and plunging
    </p>
    <p>
     in the boat's stern like a crazed colt from the prairie.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Look at that chap now," philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with his
    </p>
    <p>
     unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth,
    </p>
    <p>
     at a short distance, followed after--"He's got fits, that Flask has.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fits? yes, give him fits--that's the very word--pitch fits into 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
     Merrily, merrily, hearts-alive. Pudding for supper, you know;--
    </p>
    <p>
     merry's the word.  Pull, babes--pull, sucklings--pull, all.
    </p>
    <p>
     But what the devil are you hurrying about?  Softly, softly,
    </p>
    <p>
     and steadily, my men.  Only pull, and keep pulling; nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Crack all your backbones, and bite your knives in two--that's all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Take it easy--why don't ye take it easy, I say, and burst all your
    </p>
    <p>
     livers and lungs!"
    </p>
    <p>
     But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that
    </p>
    <p>
     tiger-yellow crew of his--these were words best omitted here;
    </p>
    <p>
     for you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land.
    </p>
    <p>
     Only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may give ear
    </p>
    <p>
     to such words, when, with tornado brow, and eyes of red murder,
    </p>
    <p>
     and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after his prey.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meanwhile, all the boats tore on.  The repeated specific
    </p>
    <p>
     allusions of Flask to "that whale," as he called the fictitious
    </p>
    <p>
     monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing
    </p>
    <p>
     his boat's bow with its tail--these allusions of his were at
    </p>
    <p>
     times so vivid and life-like, that they would cause some one
    </p>
    <p>
     or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     But this was against all rule; for the oarsmen must put
    </p>
    <p>
     out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their necks;
    </p>
    <p>
     usages announcing that they must have no organs but ears;
    </p>
    <p>
     and no limbs but arms, in these critical moments.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe!  The vast swells
    </p>
    <p>
     of the omnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made,
    </p>
    <p>
     as they rolled along the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a
    </p>
    <p>
     boundless bowling-green; the brief suspended agony of the boat,
    </p>
    <p>
     as it would tip for an instant on the knife-like edge of the
    </p>
    <p>
     sharper waves, that almost seemed threatening to cut it in two;
    </p>
    <p>
     the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and hollows;
    </p>
    <p>
     the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite hill;
    </p>
    <p>
     the headlong, sled-like slide down its other side;--all these,
    </p>
    <p>
     with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, and the shuddering
    </p>
    <p>
     gasps of the oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of the ivory
    </p>
    <p>
     Pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails,
    </p>
    <p>
     like a wild hen after her screaming brood;--all this was thrilling.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into
    </p>
    <p>
     the fever heat of his first battle; not the dead man's ghost
    </p>
    <p>
     encountering the first unknown phantom in the other world;--
    </p>
    <p>
     neither of these can feel stranger and stronger emotions than
    </p>
    <p>
     that man does, who for the first time finds himself pulling
    </p>
    <p>
     into the charmed, churned circle of the hunted sperm whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more
    </p>
    <p>
     and more visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun
    </p>
    <p>
     cloud-shadows flung upon the sea.  The jets of vapor no longer blended,
    </p>
    <p>
     but tilted everywhere to right and left; the whales seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     separating their wakes.  The boats were pulled more apart;
    </p>
    <p>
     Starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward.
    </p>
    <p>
     Our sail was now set, and, with the still rising wind, we rushed along;
    </p>
    <p>
     the boat going with such madness through the water, that the lee
    </p>
    <p>
     oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn
    </p>
    <p>
     from the row-locks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist;
    </p>
    <p>
     neither ship nor boat to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Give way, men," whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the sheet
    </p>
    <p>
     of his sail; "there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes.
    </p>
    <p>
     There's white water again!--close to!  Spring!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Soon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted
    </p>
    <p>
     that the other boats had got fast; but hardly were they overheard,
    </p>
    <p>
     when with a lightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Stand up!" and Queequeg, harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death
    </p>
    <p>
     peril so close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense
    </p>
    <p>
     countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat, they knew
    </p>
    <p>
     that the imminent instant had come; they heard, too, an enormous
    </p>
    <p>
     wallowing sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meanwhile the boat was still booming through the mist,
    </p>
    <p>
     the waves curling and hissing around us like the erected crests
    </p>
    <p>
     of enraged serpents.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's his hump.  There, there, give it to him!" whispered Starbuck.
    </p>
    <p>
     A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron
    </p>
    <p>
     of Queequeg.  Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible
    </p>
    <p>
     push from astern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge;
    </p>
    <p>
     the sail collapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapor shot up
    </p>
    <p>
     near by; something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us.
    </p>
    <p>
     The whole crew were half suffocated as they were tossed
    </p>
    <p>
     helter-skelter into the white curdling cream of the squall.
    </p>
    <p>
     Squall, whale, and harpoon had all blended together; and the whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     merely grazed by the iron, escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Swimming round it we picked up the floating oars, and lashing
    </p>
    <p>
     them across the gunwale, tumbled back to our places.
    </p>
    <p>
     There we sat up to our knees in the sea, the water covering
    </p>
    <p>
     every rib and plank, so that to our downward gazing eyes
    </p>
    <p>
     the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from
    </p>
    <p>
     the bottom of the ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
     The wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers together;
    </p>
    <p>
     the whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us
    </p>
    <p>
     like a white fire upon the prairie, in which unconsumed,
    </p>
    <p>
     we were burning; immortal in these jaws of death!  In vain we
    </p>
    <p>
     hailed the other boats; as well roar to the live coals down
    </p>
    <p>
     the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meanwhile the driving scud, rack, and mist, grew darker
    </p>
    <p>
     with the shadows of night; no sign of the ship could be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
     The rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
     The oars were useless as propellers, performing now the office
    </p>
    <p>
     of life-preservers. So, cutting the lashing of the waterproof
    </p>
    <p>
     match keg, after many failures Starbuck contrived to ignite
    </p>
    <p>
     the lamp in the lantern; then stretching it on a waif pole,
    </p>
    <p>
     handed it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of this forlorn hope.
    </p>
    <p>
     There, then, he sat, holding up that imbecile candle in the heart
    </p>
    <p>
     of that almighty forlornness.  There, then, he sat, the sign
    </p>
    <p>
     and symbol of a man without faith, hopelessly holding up hope
    </p>
    <p>
     in the midst of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or boat,
    </p>
    <p>
     we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on.  The mist still spread
    </p>
    <p>
     over the sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly Queequeg started to his feet, hollowing his hand to his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     We all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled
    </p>
    <p>
     by the storm.  The sound came nearer and nearer; the thick mists were
    </p>
    <p>
     dimly parted by a huge, vague form.  Affrighted, we all sprang into
    </p>
    <p>
     the sea as the ship at last loomed into view, bearing right down upon
    </p>
    <p>
     us within a distance of not much more than its length.
    </p>
    <p>
     Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one
    </p>
    <p>
     instant it tossed and gaped beneath the ship's bows like a chip
    </p>
    <p>
     at the base of a cataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it,
    </p>
    <p>
     and it was seen no more till it came up weltering astern.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again we swam for it, were dashed against it by the seas,
    </p>
    <p>
     and were at last taken up and safely landed on board.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had cut loose
    </p>
    <p>
     from their fish and returned to the ship in good time.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ship had given us up, but was still cruising,
    </p>
    <p>
     if haply it might light upon some token of our perishing,--
    </p>
    <p>
     an oar or a lance pole.

    <p>
     The Hyena
    </p>
    <p>
     There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed
    </p>
    <p>
     affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast
    </p>
    <p>
     practical joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns,
    </p>
    <p>
     and more than suspects that the joke is at nobody's expense but his own.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, nothing dispirits, and nothing seems worth while disputing.
    </p>
    <p>
     He bolts down all events, all creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions,
    </p>
    <p>
     all hard things visible and invisible, never mind how knobby;
    </p>
    <p>
     as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as for small difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden
    </p>
    <p>
     disaster, peril of life and limb; all these, and death itself,
    </p>
    <p>
     seem to him only sly, good-natured hits, and jolly punches
    </p>
    <p>
     in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker.
    </p>
    <p>
     That odd sort of wayward mood I am speaking of, comes over a man
    </p>
    <p>
     only in some time of extreme tribulation; it comes in the very midst
    </p>
    <p>
     of his earnestness, so that what just before might have seemed to him
    </p>
    <p>
     a thing most momentous, now seems but a part of the general joke.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy
    </p>
    <p>
     sort of genial, desperado philosophy; and with it I now regarded this
    </p>
    <p>
     whole voyage of the Pequod, and the great White Whale its object.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Queequeg," said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the deck,
    </p>
    <p>
     and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water;
    </p>
    <p>
     "Queequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often happen?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Without much emotion, though soaked through just like me, he gave me
    </p>
    <p>
     to understand that such things did often happen.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mr. Stubb," said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his
    </p>
    <p>
     oil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; "Mr. Stubb, I
    </p>
    <p>
     think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met,
    </p>
    <p>
     our chief mate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent.
    </p>
    <p>
     I suppose then, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail
    </p>
    <p>
     set in a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman's discretion?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Certain.  I've lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale
    </p>
    <p>
     off Cape Horn."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mr. Flask," said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing
    </p>
    <p>
     close by; "you are experienced in these things, and I am not.
    </p>
    <p>
     Will you tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery,
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Flask, for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself
    </p>
    <p>
     back-foremost into death's jaws?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can't you twist that smaller?" said Flask.  "Yes, that's the law.
    </p>
    <p>
     I should like to see a boat's crew backing water up to a whale
    </p>
    <p>
     face foremost.  Ha, ha! the whale would give them squint
    </p>
    <p>
     for squint, mind that!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Here then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate
    </p>
    <p>
     statement of the entire case.  Considering, therefore, that squalls
    </p>
    <p>
     and capsizings in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep,
    </p>
    <p>
     were matters of common occurrence in this kind of life; considering that
    </p>
    <p>
     at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I
    </p>
    <p>
     must resign my life into the hands of him who steered the boat--
    </p>
    <p>
     oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousness
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the point of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings;
    </p>
    <p>
     considering that the particular disaster to our own particular boat
    </p>
    <p>
     was chiefly to be imputed to Starbuck's driving on to his whale
    </p>
    <p>
     almost in the teeth of a squall, and considering that Starbuck,
    </p>
    <p>
     notwithstanding, was famous for his great heedfulness in the fishery;
    </p>
    <p>
     considering that I belonged to this uncommonly prudent Starbuck's boat;
    </p>
    <p>
     and finally considering in what a devil's chase I was implicated,
    </p>
    <p>
     touching the White Whale:  taking all things together, I say,
    </p>
    <p>
     I thought I might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Queequeg," said I, "come along, you shall be my lawyer,
    </p>
    <p>
     executor, and legatee."
    </p>
    <p>
     It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering
    </p>
    <p>
     at their last wills and testaments, but there are no people
    </p>
    <p>
     in the world more fond of that diversion.  This was the fourth
    </p>
    <p>
     time in my nautical life that I had done the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     After the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion,
    </p>
    <p>
     I felt all the easier; a stone was rolled away from my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Besides, all the days I should now live would be as good as the days
    </p>
    <p>
     that Lazarus lived after his resurrection; a supplementary
    </p>
    <p>
     clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case may be.
    </p>
    <p>
     I survived myself; my death and burial were locked up in my chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     I looked round me tranquilly and contentedly, like a quiet
    </p>
    <p>
     ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bars of a
    </p>
    <p>
     snug family vault.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock,
    </p>
    <p>
     here goes for a cool, collected dive at death and destruction,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the devil fetch the hindmost.

    <p>
     Ahab's Boat and Crew.  Fedallah
    </p>
    <p>
     "Who would have thought it, Flask!" cried Stubb;
    </p>
    <p>
     "if I had but one leg you would not catch me in a boat,
    </p>
    <p>
     unless maybe to stop the plug-hole with my timber toe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh! he's a wonderful old man!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't think it so strange, after all, on that account,"
    </p>
    <p>
     said Flask.  "If his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be
    </p>
    <p>
     a different thing.  That would disable him; but he has one knee,
    </p>
    <p>
     and good part of the other left, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel."
    </p>
    <p>
     Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether,
    </p>
    <p>
     considering the paramount importance of his life to the
    </p>
    <p>
     success of the voyage, it is right for a whaling captain
    </p>
    <p>
     to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase.
    </p>
    <p>
     So Tamerlane's soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
     whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into
    </p>
    <p>
     the thickest of the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
     But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
     Considering that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight
    </p>
    <p>
     in all times of danger; considering that the pursuit of whales
    </p>
    <p>
     is always under great and extraordinary difficulties;
    </p>
    <p>
     that every individual moment, indeed, then comprises a peril;
    </p>
    <p>
     under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man to enter
    </p>
    <p>
     a whale-boat in the hunt?  As a general thing, the joint-owners
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Pequod must have plainly thought not.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think
    </p>
    <p>
     little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless
    </p>
    <p>
     vicissitudes of the chase, for the sake of being near the scene
    </p>
    <p>
     of action and giving his orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab
    </p>
    <p>
     to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular
    </p>
    <p>
     headsman in the hunt--above all for Captain Ahab to be supplied
    </p>
    <p>
     with five extra men, as that same boat's crew, he well knew
    </p>
    <p>
     that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Pequod.  Therefore he had not solicited a boat's crew
    </p>
    <p>
     from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching
    </p>
    <p>
     all that matter.  Until Cabaco's published discovery,
    </p>
    <p>
     the sailors had little foreseen it, though to be sure when,
    </p>
    <p>
     after being a little while out of port, all hands had concluded
    </p>
    <p>
     the customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service;
    </p>
    <p>
     when some time after this Ahab was now and then found bestirring
    </p>
    <p>
     himself in the matter of making thole-pins with his own hands
    </p>
    <p>
     for what was thought to be one of the spare boats, and even
    </p>
    <p>
     solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which when
    </p>
    <p>
     the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow:
    </p>
    <p>
     when all this was observed in him, and particularly his solicitude
    </p>
    <p>
     in having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat,
    </p>
    <p>
     as if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his
    </p>
    <p>
     ivory limb; and also the anxiety he evinced in exactly shaping
    </p>
    <p>
     the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it is sometimes called,
    </p>
    <p>
     the horizontal piece in the boat's bow for bracing the knee
    </p>
    <p>
     against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was
    </p>
    <p>
     observed how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary
    </p>
    <p>
     knee fixed in the semi-circular depression in the cleat,
    </p>
    <p>
     and with the carpenter's chisel gouged out a little here
    </p>
    <p>
     and straightened it a little there; all these things, I say,
    </p>
    <p>
     had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
     But almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative
    </p>
    <p>
     heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate
    </p>
    <p>
     chase of Moby Dick; for he had already revealed his intention
    </p>
    <p>
     to hunt that mortal monster in person.  But such a supposition
    </p>
    <p>
     did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat's
    </p>
    <p>
     crew being assigned to that boat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon
    </p>
    <p>
     waned away; for in a whaler wonders soon wane.  Besides, now and then
    </p>
    <p>
     such unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from
    </p>
    <p>
     the unknown nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating
    </p>
    <p>
     outlaws of whalers; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer
    </p>
    <p>
     castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks,
    </p>
    <p>
     bits of wreck, oars, whaleboats, canoes, blown-off Japanese junks,
    </p>
    <p>
     and what not; that Beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step
    </p>
    <p>
     down into the cabin to chat with the captain, and it would not create
    </p>
    <p>
     any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle.
    </p>
    <p>
     But be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate
    </p>
    <p>
     phantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it
    </p>
    <p>
     were somehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah
    </p>
    <p>
     remained a muffled mystery to the last.  Whence he came in a mannerly
    </p>
    <p>
     world like this, by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced
    </p>
    <p>
     himself to be linked with Ahab's peculiar fortunes; nay, so far
    </p>
    <p>
     as to have some sort of a half-hinted influence; Heaven knows,
    </p>
    <p>
     but it might have been even authority over him; all this none knew.
    </p>
    <p>
     But one cannot sustain an indifferent air concerning Fedallah.  He was
    </p>
    <p>
     such a creature as civilized, domestic people in the temperate zone
    </p>
    <p>
     only see in their dreams, and that but dimly; but the like of whom
    </p>
    <p>
     now and then glide among the unchanging Asiatic communities,
    </p>
    <p>
     especially the Oriental isles to the east of the continent--
    </p>
    <p>
     those insulated, immemorial, unalterable countries, which even in
    </p>
    <p>
     these modern days still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness
    </p>
    <p>
     of earth's primal generations, when the memory of the first
    </p>
    <p>
     man was a distinct recollection, and all men his descendants,
    </p>
    <p>
     unknowing whence he came, eyed each other as real phantoms, and asked
    </p>
    <p>
     of the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end;
    </p>
    <p>
     when though, according to Genesis, the angels indeed consorted with
    </p>
    <p>
     the daughters of men, the devils also, add the uncanonical Robbins,
    </p>
    <p>
     indulged in mundane amours.

    <p>
     The Spirit-Spout
    </p>
    <p>
     Days, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod
    </p>
    <p>
     had slowly swept across four several cruising-grounds;
    </p>
    <p>
     that off the Azores; off the Cape de Verdes; on the Plate
    </p>
    <p>
     (so called), being off the mouth of the Rio de la Plata;
    </p>
    <p>
     and the Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery locality,
    </p>
    <p>
     southerly from St. Helena.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was while gliding through these latter waters that one
    </p>
    <p>
     serene and moonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like
    </p>
    <p>
     scrolls of silver; and, by their soft, suffusing seethings,
    </p>
    <p>
     made what seemed a silvery silence, not a solitude; on such a
    </p>
    <p>
     silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white
    </p>
    <p>
     bubbles at the bow.  Lit up by the moon, it looked celestial;
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fedallah first descried this jet.  For of these moonlight nights,
    </p>
    <p>
     it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand
    </p>
    <p>
     a look-out there, with the same precision as if it had been day.
    </p>
    <p>
     And yet, though herds of whales were seen by night, not one
    </p>
    <p>
     whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them.
    </p>
    <p>
     You may think with what emotions, then, the seamen beheld
    </p>
    <p>
     this old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours;
    </p>
    <p>
     his turban and the moon, companions in one sky.  But when,
    </p>
    <p>
     after spending his uniform interval there for several successive
    </p>
    <p>
     nights without uttering a single sound; when, after all this silence,
    </p>
    <p>
     his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit jet,
    </p>
    <p>
     every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged
    </p>
    <p>
     spirit had lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There she blows!"  Had the trump of judgment blown,
    </p>
    <p>
     they could not have quivered more; yet still they felt no terror;
    </p>
    <p>
     rather pleasure.  For though it was a most unwonted hour,
    </p>
    <p>
     yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously exciting,
    </p>
    <p>
     that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a lowering.
    </p>
    <p>
     Walking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded
    </p>
    <p>
     the t'gallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread.
    </p>
    <p>
     The best man in the ship must take the helm.  Then, with every
    </p>
    <p>
     mast-head manned, the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
     The strange, upheaving, lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze
    </p>
    <p>
     filling the hollows of so many sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck
    </p>
    <p>
     to feel like air beneath the feet; while still she rushed along,
    </p>
    <p>
     as if two antagonistic influences were struggling in her--one to mount
    </p>
    <p>
     direct to heaven, the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal.
    </p>
    <p>
     And had you watched Ahab's face that night, you would have thought
    </p>
    <p>
     that in him also two different things were warring.  While his one live
    </p>
    <p>
     leg made lively echoes along the deck, every stroke of his dead limb
    </p>
    <p>
     sounded like a coffin-tap. On life and death this old man walked.
    </p>
    <p>
     But though the ship so swiftly sped, and though from every eye,
    </p>
    <p>
     like arrows, the eager glances shot, yet the silvery jet was no
    </p>
    <p>
     more seen that night.  Every sailor swore he saw it once, but not
    </p>
    <p>
     a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
     This midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when,
    </p>
    <p>
     some days after, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced:
    </p>
    <p>
     again it was descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it,
    </p>
    <p>
     once more it disappeared as if it had never been.  And so it served
    </p>
    <p>
     us night after night, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight, or starlight,
    </p>
    <p>
     as the case might be; disappearing again for one whole day,
    </p>
    <p>
     or two days, or three; and somehow seeming at every distinct
    </p>
    <p>
     repetition to be advancing still further and further in our van,
    </p>
    <p>
     this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race,
    </p>
    <p>
     and in accordance with the preternaturalness, as it seemed,
    </p>
    <p>
     which in many things invested the Pequod, were there wanting
    </p>
    <p>
     some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried;
    </p>
    <p>
     at however remote times, or in however far apart latitudes
    </p>
    <p>
     and longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast by one selfsame whale;
    </p>
    <p>
     and that whale, Moby Dick.  For a time, there reigned, too, a sense
    </p>
    <p>
     of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition, as if it were
    </p>
    <p>
     treacherously beckoning us on and on, in order that the monster
    </p>
    <p>
     might turn round upon us, and rend us at last in the remotest
    </p>
    <p>
     and most savage seas.
    </p>
    <p>
     These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a
    </p>
    <p>
     wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather,
    </p>
    <p>
     in which, beneath all its blue blandness, some thought there
    </p>
    <p>
     lurked a devilish charm, as for days and days we voyaged along,
    </p>
    <p>
     through seas so wearily, lonesomely mild, that all space,
    </p>
    <p>
     in repugnance to our vengeful errand, seemed vacating itself
    </p>
    <p>
     of life before our urn-like prow.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds
    </p>
    <p>
     began howling around us, and we rose and fell upon the long,
    </p>
    <p>
     troubled seas that are there; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply
    </p>
    <p>
     bowed to the blast, and gored the dark waves in her madness, till,
    </p>
    <p>
     like showers of silver chips, the foamflakes flew over her bulwarks;
    </p>
    <p>
     then all this desolate vacuity of life went away, but gave place
    </p>
    <p>
     to sights more dismal than before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither
    </p>
    <p>
     before us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens. And
    </p>
    <p>
     every morning, perched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen;
    </p>
    <p>
     and spite of our hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp,
    </p>
    <p>
     as though they deemed our ship some drifting, uninhabited craft;
    </p>
    <p>
     a thing appointed to desolation, and therefore fit roosting-place
    </p>
    <p>
     for their homeless selves.  And heaved and heaved, still unrestingly
    </p>
    <p>
     heaved the black sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience;
    </p>
    <p>
     and the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long
    </p>
    <p>
     sin and suffering it had bred.
    </p>
    <p>
     Cape of Good Hope, do they call ye?  Rather Cape Tormentoto,
    </p>
    <p>
     as called of yore; for long allured by the perfidious silences
    </p>
    <p>
     that before had attended us, we found ourselves launched into this
    </p>
    <p>
     tormented sea, where guilty beings transformed into those fowls
    </p>
    <p>
     and these fish, seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without
    </p>
    <p>
     any haven in store, or beat that black air without any horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
     But calm, snow-white, and unvarying; still directing its fountain
    </p>
    <p>
     of feathers to the sky; still beckoning us on from before,
    </p>
    <p>
     the solitary jet would at times be descried.
    </p>
    <p>
     During all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming
    </p>
    <p>
     for the time the almost continual command of the drenched and
    </p>
    <p>
     dangerous deck, manifested the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom
    </p>
    <p>
     than ever addressed his mates.  In tempestuous times like these,
    </p>
    <p>
     after everything above and aloft has been secured, nothing more
    </p>
    <p>
     can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Captain and crew become practical fatalists.  So, with his
    </p>
    <p>
     ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole, and with one hand
    </p>
    <p>
     firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for hours and hours would stand
    </p>
    <p>
     gazing dead to windward, while an occasional squall of sleet
    </p>
    <p>
     or snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes together.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meantime, the crew driven from the forward part of the ship
    </p>
    <p>
     by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows,
    </p>
    <p>
     stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the better
    </p>
    <p>
     to guard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped
    </p>
    <p>
     himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which
    </p>
    <p>
     he swung as in a loosened belt.  Few or no words were spoken;
    </p>
    <p>
     and the silent ship, as if manned by painted sailors in wax,
    </p>
    <p>
     day after day tore on through all the swift madness and gladness
    </p>
    <p>
     of the demoniac waves.  By night the same muteness of humanity
    </p>
    <p>
     before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed; still in silence the men
    </p>
    <p>
     swung in the bowlines; still wordless Ahab stood up to the blast.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek
    </p>
    <p>
     that repose in his hammock.  Never could Starbuck forget the old
    </p>
    <p>
     man's aspect, when one night going down into the cabin to mark
    </p>
    <p>
     how the barometer stood, he saw him with closed eyes sitting
    </p>
    <p>
     straight in his floor-screwed chair; the rain and half-melted
    </p>
    <p>
     sleet of the storm from which he had some time before emerged,
    </p>
    <p>
     still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts
    </p>
    <p>
     of tides and currents which have previously been spoken of.
    </p>
    <p>
     His lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though the body was erect, the head was thrown back so that
    </p>
    <p>
     the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell-tale
    </p>
    <p>
     that swung from a beam in the ceiling.*
    </p>
    <p>
     *The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without
    </p>
    <p>
     going to the compass at the helm, the Captain, while below,
    </p>
    <p>
     can inform himself of the course of the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
     Terrible old man! thought Starbuck with a shudder, sleeping in this gale,
    </p>
    <p>
     still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose.

     CHAPTER 52
    </head>
    <p>
     The Albatross
    </p>
    <p>
     South-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts,
    </p>
    <p>
     a good cruising ground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Goney (Albatross) by name.  As she slowly drew nigh,
    </p>
    <p>
     from my lofty perch at the fore-mast-head, I had a good view
    </p>
    <p>
     of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheries--
    </p>
    <p>
     a whaler at sea, and long absent from home.
    </p>
    <p>
     As if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached
    </p>
    <p>
     like the skeleton of a stranded walrus.  All down her sides,
    </p>
    <p>
     this spectral appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust,
    </p>
    <p>
     while all her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches
    </p>
    <p>
     of trees furred over with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails were set.
    </p>
    <p>
     A wild sight it was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three
    </p>
    <p>
     mast-heads. They seemed clad in the skins of beasts, so torn and
    </p>
    <p>
     bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of cruising.
    </p>
    <p>
     Standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast, they swayed and swung
    </p>
    <p>
     over a fathomless sea; and though, when the ship slowly glided
    </p>
    <p>
     close under our stern, we six men in the air came so nigh to each
    </p>
    <p>
     other that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of one
    </p>
    <p>
     ship to those of the other; yet, those forlorn-looking fishermen,
    </p>
    <p>
     mildly eyeing us as they passed, said not one word to our own
    </p>
    <p>
     look-outs, while the quarter-deck hail was being heard from below.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ship ahoy!  Have ye seen the White Whale?"
    </p>
    <p>
     But as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks,
    </p>
    <p>
     was in the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow
    </p>
    <p>
     fell from his hand into the sea; and the wind now rising amain,
    </p>
    <p>
     he in vain strove to make himself heard without it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between us.
    </p>
    <p>
     While in various silent ways the seamen of the Pequod were evincing
    </p>
    <p>
     their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention
    </p>
    <p>
     of the White Whale's name to another ship, Ahab for a moment paused;
    </p>
    <p>
     it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat
    </p>
    <p>
     to board the stranger, had not the threatening wind forbade.
    </p>
    <p>
     But taking advantage of his windward position, he again seized
    </p>
    <p>
     his trumpet, and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was
    </p>
    <p>
     a Nantucketer and shortly bound home, he loudly hailed--"Ahoy there!
    </p>
    <p>
     This is the Pequod, bound round the world!  Tell them to address
    </p>
    <p>
     all future letters to the Pacific ocean! and this time three years,
    </p>
    <p>
     if I am not at home, tell them to address them to-"
    </p>
    <p>
     At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly,
    </p>
    <p>
     then, in accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small
    </p>
    <p>
     harmless fish, that for some days before had been placidly swimming
    </p>
    <p>
     by our side, darted away with what seemed shuddering fins,
    </p>
    <p>
     and ranged themselves fore and aft with the stranger's flanks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though in the course of his continual voyagings Ahab must often
    </p>
    <p>
     before have noticed a similar sight, yet, to any monomaniac man,
    </p>
    <p>
     the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Swim away from me, do ye?" murmured Ahab, gazing over into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
     There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of deep
    </p>
    <p>
     helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced.
    </p>
    <p>
     But turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship
    </p>
    <p>
     in the wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion
    </p>
    <p>
     voice,--"Up helm!  Keep her off round the world!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Round the world!  There is much in that sound to inspire
    </p>
    <p>
     proud feelings; but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct?
    </p>
    <p>
     Only through numberless perils to the very point whence we started,
    </p>
    <p>
     where those that we left behind secure, were all the time before us.
    </p>
    <p>
     Were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could
    </p>
    <p>
     for ever reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange
    </p>
    <p>
     than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise
    </p>
    <p>
     in the voyage.  But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of,
    </p>
    <p>
     or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that, some time or other,
    </p>
    <p>
     swims before all human hearts; while chasing such over this round globe,
    </p>
    <p>
     they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed.

     CHAPTER 53
    </head>
    <p>
     The Gam
    </p>
    <p>
     The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler
    </p>
    <p>
     we had spoken was this:  the wind and sea betokened storms.
    </p>
    <p>
     But even had this not been the case, he would not after all,
    </p>
    <p>
     perhaps, have boarded her--judging by his subsequent conduct on
    </p>
    <p>
     similar occasions--if so it had been that, by the process of hailing,
    </p>
    <p>
     he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put.
    </p>
    <p>
     For, as it eventually turned out, he cared not to consort,
    </p>
    <p>
     even for five minutes, with any stranger captain, except he could
    </p>
    <p>
     contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought.
    </p>
    <p>
     But all this might remain inadequately estimated, were not
    </p>
    <p>
     something said here of the peculiar usages of whaling-vessels
    </p>
    <p>
     when meeting each other in foreign seas, and especially on
    </p>
    <p>
     a common cruising-ground.
    </p>
    <p>
     If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State,
    </p>
    <p>
     or the equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually
    </p>
    <p>
     encountering each other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain,
    </p>
    <p>
     for the life of them, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation;
    </p>
    <p>
     and stopping for a moment to interchange the news;
    </p>
    <p>
     and, perhaps, sitting down for a while and resting in concert:
    </p>
    <p>
     then, how much more natural that upon the illimitable Pine Barrens
    </p>
    <p>
     and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two whaling vessels descrying
    </p>
    <p>
     each other at the ends of the earth--off lone Fanning's Island,
    </p>
    <p>
     or the far away King's Mills; how much more natural, I say, that under
    </p>
    <p>
     such circumstances these ships should not only interchange hails,
    </p>
    <p>
     but come into still closer, more friendly and sociable contact.
    </p>
    <p>
     And especially would this seem to be a matter of course, in the case
    </p>
    <p>
     of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose captains, officers,
    </p>
    <p>
     and not a few of the men are personally known to each other;
    </p>
    <p>
     and consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things
    </p>
    <p>
     to talk about.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps,
    </p>
    <p>
     has letters on board; at any rate, she will be sure to let her
    </p>
    <p>
     have some papers of a date a year or two later than the last
    </p>
    <p>
     one on her blurred and thumb-worn files.  And in return for
    </p>
    <p>
     that courtesy, the outward-bound ship would receive the latest
    </p>
    <p>
     whaling intelligence from the cruising-ground to which she
    </p>
    <p>
     may be destined, a thing of the utmost importance to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     And in degree, all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels
    </p>
    <p>
     crossing each other's track on the cruising-ground itself,
    </p>
    <p>
     even though they are equally long absent from home.  For one
    </p>
    <p>
     of them may have received a transfer of letters from some third,
    </p>
    <p>
     and now far remote vessel; and some of those letters may be
    </p>
    <p>
     for the people of the ship she now meets.  Besides, they would
    </p>
    <p>
     exchange the whaling news, and have an agreeable chat.
    </p>
    <p>
     For not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors,
    </p>
    <p>
     but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from
    </p>
    <p>
     a common pursuit and mutually shared privations and perils.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference;
    </p>
    <p>
     that is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case
    </p>
    <p>
     with Americans and English.  Though, to be sure, from the small number
    </p>
    <p>
     of English whalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and when they
    </p>
    <p>
     do occur there.  is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them;
    </p>
    <p>
     for your Englishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he does not
    </p>
    <p>
     fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself.  Besides, the English
    </p>
    <p>
     whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority
    </p>
    <p>
     over the American whalers; regarding the long, lean Nantucketer,
    </p>
    <p>
     with his nondescript provincialisms, as a sort of sea-peasant. But
    </p>
    <p>
     where this superiority in the English whaleman does really consist,
    </p>
    <p>
     it would be hard to say, seeing that the Yankees in one day, collectively,
    </p>
    <p>
     kill more whales than all the English, collectively, in ten years.
    </p>
    <p>
     But this is a harmless little foible in the English whale-hunters, which
    </p>
    <p>
     the Nantucketer does not take much to heart; probably, because he knows
    </p>
    <p>
     that he has a few foibles himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     the whalers have most reason to be sociable--and they are so.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whereas, some merchant ships crossing each other's wake in the
    </p>
    <p>
     mid-Atlantic, will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single
    </p>
    <p>
     word of recognition, mutually cutting each other on the high seas,
    </p>
    <p>
     like a brace of dandies in Broadway; and all the time indulging,
    </p>
    <p>
     perhaps, in finical criticism upon each other's rig.
    </p>
    <p>
     As for Men-of-War, when they chance to meet at sea, they first
    </p>
    <p>
     go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings,
    </p>
    <p>
     such a ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be much
    </p>
    <p>
     right-down hearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     As touching Slave-ships meeting, why, they are in such a
    </p>
    <p>
     prodigious hurry, they run away from each other as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as for Pirates, when they chance to cross each other's
    </p>
    <p>
     cross-bones, the first hail is--"How many skulls?"--
    </p>
    <p>
     the same way that whalers hail--"How many barrels?"
    </p>
    <p>
     And that question once answered, pirates straightway steer apart,
    </p>
    <p>
     for they are infernal villains on both sides, and don't like
    </p>
    <p>
     to see overmuch of each other's villanous likenesses.
    </p>
    <p>
     But look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,
    </p>
    <p>
     free-and-easy whaler!  What does the whaler do when she meets
    </p>
    <p>
     another whaler in any sort of decent weather?  She has a "Gam,"
    </p>
    <p>
     a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they never
    </p>
    <p>
     heard of the name even; and if by chance they should hear of it,
    </p>
    <p>
     they only grin at it, and repeat gamesome stuff about "spouters"
    </p>
    <p>
     and "blubber-boilers," and such like pretty exclamations.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why it is that all Merchant-seamen, and also all Pirates and
    </p>
    <p>
     Man-of-War's men, and Slave-ship sailors, cherish such a scornful
    </p>
    <p>
     feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a question it would be hard
    </p>
    <p>
     to answer.  Because, in the case of pirates, say, I should like to know
    </p>
    <p>
     whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but only at the gallows.
    </p>
    <p>
     And besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion, he has
    </p>
    <p>
     no proper foundation for his superior altitude.  Hence, I conclude,
    </p>
    <p>
     that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman,
    </p>
    <p>
     in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on.
    </p>
    <p>
     But what is a Gam?  You might wear out your index-finger running
    </p>
    <p>
     up and down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word,
    </p>
    <p>
     Dr. Johnson never attained to that erudition; Noah Webster's
    </p>
    <p>
     ark does not hold it.  Nevertheless, this same expressive word
    </p>
    <p>
     has now for many years been in constant use among some fifteen
    </p>
    <p>
     thousand true born Yankees.  Certainly, it needs a definition,
    </p>
    <p>
     and should be incorporated into the Lexicon.  With that view,
    </p>
    <p>
     let me learnedly define it.
    </p>
    <p>
     GAM.  NOUN--A social meeting of two (or more) Whaleships, generally on
    </p>
    <p>
     a cruising-ground; when, after exchanging hails, they exchange
    </p>
    <p>
     visits by boats' crews, the two captains remaining, for the time,
    </p>
    <p>
     on board of one ship, and the two chief mates on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is another little item about Gamming which must not
    </p>
    <p>
     be forgotten here.  All professions have their own little
    </p>
    <p>
     peculiarities of detail; so has the whale fishery.  In a pirate,
    </p>
    <p>
     man-of-war, or slave ship, when the captain is rowed anywhere
    </p>
    <p>
     in his boat, he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable,
    </p>
    <p>
     sometimes cushioned seat there, and often steers himself with a pretty
    </p>
    <p>
     little milliner's tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa of that sort whatever,
    </p>
    <p>
     and no tiller at all.  High times indeed, if whaling captains were wheeled
    </p>
    <p>
     about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never admits of any such effeminacy;
    </p>
    <p>
     and therefore as in gamming a complete boat's crew must leave the ship,
    </p>
    <p>
     and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number,
    </p>
    <p>
     that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and the captain,
    </p>
    <p>
     having no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit all standing
    </p>
    <p>
     like a pine tree.  And often you will notice that being conscious
    </p>
    <p>
     of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from
    </p>
    <p>
     the sides of the two ships, this standing captain is all alive
    </p>
    <p>
     to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor is this any very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense
    </p>
    <p>
     projecting steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of
    </p>
    <p>
     his back, the after-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front.
    </p>
    <p>
     He is thus completely wedged before and behind, and can only
    </p>
    <p>
     expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs;
    </p>
    <p>
     but a sudden, violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him,
    </p>
    <p>
     because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Merely make a spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, again, it would never do in plain sight of the world's riveted eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
     it would never do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen
    </p>
    <p>
     steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything
    </p>
    <p>
     with his hands; indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-command,
    </p>
    <p>
     he generally carries his hands in his trowsers' pockets; but perhaps being
    </p>
    <p>
     generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for ballast.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nevertheless there have occurred instances, well authenticated ones too,
    </p>
    <p>
     where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two,
    </p>
    <p>
     in a sudden squall say--to seize hold of the nearest oarsman's hair,
    </p>
    <p>
     and hold on there like grim death.

     CHAPTER 54

    <p>
     The Town-Ho's Story
    </p>
    <p>
     (As told at the Golden Inn)
    </p>
    <p>
     The Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there,
    </p>
    <p>
     is much like some noted four corners of a great highway, where you
    </p>
    <p>
     meet more travellers than in any other part.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another
    </p>
    <p>
     homeward-bound whaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was manned almost wholly by Polynesians.  In the short gam that
    </p>
    <p>
     ensued she gave us strong news of Moby Dick.  To some the general
    </p>
    <p>
     interest in the White Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Town-Ho's story, which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale
    </p>
    <p>
     a certain wondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so called
    </p>
    <p>
     judgments of God which at times are said to overtake some men.
    </p>
    <p>
     This latter circumstance, with its own particular accompaniments,
    </p>
    <p>
     forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to
    </p>
    <p>
     be narrated, never reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates.
    </p>
    <p>
     For that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Town-Ho himself.  It was the private property of three
    </p>
    <p>
     confederate white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it seems,
    </p>
    <p>
     communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy,
    </p>
    <p>
     but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and revealed
    </p>
    <p>
     so much of it in that way, that when he was wakened he could not
    </p>
    <p>
     well withhold the rest.  Nevertheless, so potent an influence did
    </p>
    <p>
     this thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full
    </p>
    <p>
     knowledge of it, and by such a strange delicacy, to call it so,
    </p>
    <p>
     were they governed in this matter, that they kept the secret among
    </p>
    <p>
     themselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequod's main-mast.
    </p>
    <p>
     Interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story
    </p>
    <p>
     as publicly narrated on the ship, the whole of this strange affair
    </p>
    <p>
     I now proceed to put on lasting record.
    </p>
    <p>
     *The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head,
    </p>
    <p>
     still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin.
    </p>
    <p>
     For my humor's sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated
    </p>
    <p>
     it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one saint's eve,
    </p>
    <p>
     smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden Inn.  Of those
    </p>
    <p>
     fine cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were on the closer
    </p>
    <p>
     terms with me; and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put,
    </p>
    <p>
     and which are duly answered at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about
    </p>
    <p>
     rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket,
    </p>
    <p>
     was cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days' sail eastward from
    </p>
    <p>
     the eaves of this good Golden Inn.  She was somewhere to the northward of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Line.  One morning upon handling the pumps according to daily usage,
    </p>
    <p>
     it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common.
    </p>
    <p>
     They supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her, gentlemen.  But the captain,
    </p>
    <p>
     having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited
    </p>
    <p>
     him in those latitudes; and therefore being very averse to quit them,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous, though, indeed,
    </p>
    <p>
     they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as was
    </p>
    <p>
     possible in rather heavy weather, the ship still continued her cruisings,
    </p>
    <p>
     the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals; but no good
    </p>
    <p>
     luck came; more days went by and not only was the leak yet undiscovered,
    </p>
    <p>
     but it sensibly increased.  So much so, that now taking some alarm,
    </p>
    <p>
     the captain, making all sail, stood away for the nearest harbor among
    </p>
    <p>
     the islands, there to have his hull hove out and repaired.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest
    </p>
    <p>
     chance favoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder
    </p>
    <p>
     by the way, because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically
    </p>
    <p>
     relieved at them, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily
    </p>
    <p>
     keep the ship free; never mind if the leak should double on her.
    </p>
    <p>
     In truth, well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very
    </p>
    <p>
     prosperous breezes, the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect
    </p>
    <p>
     safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality,
    </p>
    <p>
     had it not been for the brutal overbearing of Radney, the mate,
    </p>
    <p>
     a Vineyarder, and the bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt,
    </p>
    <p>
     a Lakeman and desperado from Buffalo.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Lakeman!--Buffalo!  Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is Buffalo?'
    </p>
    <p>
     said Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.
    </p>
    <p>
     "On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but--I crave
    </p>
    <p>
     your courtesy--may be, you shall soon hear further of all that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, gentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships,
    </p>
    <p>
     well nigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your
    </p>
    <p>
     old Callao to far Manilla; this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart
    </p>
    <p>
     of our America, had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian
    </p>
    <p>
     freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
     For in their interflowing aggregate, those grand fresh-water seas
    </p>
    <p>
     of ours,--Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and Superior, and Michigan,--
    </p>
    <p>
     possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many of the ocean's
    </p>
    <p>
     noblest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties of races and
    </p>
    <p>
     of climes.  They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles,
    </p>
    <p>
     even as the Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by two
    </p>
    <p>
     great contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long
    </p>
    <p>
     maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East,
    </p>
    <p>
     dotted all round their banks; here and there are frowned upon
    </p>
    <p>
     by batteries, and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw;
    </p>
    <p>
     they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories; at intervals,
    </p>
    <p>
     they yield their beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted
    </p>
    <p>
     faces flash from out their peltry wigwams; for leagues and leagues
    </p>
    <p>
     are flanked by ancient and unentered forests, where the gaunt
    </p>
    <p>
     pines stand like serried lines of kings in Gothic genealogies;
    </p>
    <p>
     those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of prey, and silken
    </p>
    <p>
     creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors;
    </p>
    <p>
     they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland, as well as
    </p>
    <p>
     Winnebago villages; they float alike the full-rigged merchant ship,
    </p>
    <p>
     the armed cruiser of the State, the steamer, and the beech canoe;
    </p>
    <p>
     they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as direful
    </p>
    <p>
     as any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks are,
    </p>
    <p>
     for out of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned
    </p>
    <p>
     full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus, gentlemen, though an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born,
    </p>
    <p>
     and wild-ocean nurtured; as much of an audacious mariner as any.
    </p>
    <p>
     And for Radney, though in his infancy he may have laid him
    </p>
    <p>
     down on the lone Nantucket beach, to nurse at his maternal sea;
    </p>
    <p>
     though in after life he had long followed our austere
    </p>
    <p>
     Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was he quite
    </p>
    <p>
     as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman,
    </p>
    <p>
     fresh from the latitudes of buckhorn handled Bowie-knives. Yet
    </p>
    <p>
     was this Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits;
    </p>
    <p>
     and this Lakeman, a mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed,
    </p>
    <p>
     might yet by inflexible firmness, only tempered by that common
    </p>
    <p>
     decency of human recognition which is the meanest slave's right;
    </p>
    <p>
     thus treated, this Steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile.
    </p>
    <p>
     At all events, he had proved so thus far; but Radney was doomed
    </p>
    <p>
     and made mad, and Steelkilt--but, gentlemen, you shall hear.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow
    </p>
    <p>
     for her island haven, that the Town-Ho's leak seemed again increasing,
    </p>
    <p>
     but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day.
    </p>
    <p>
     You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic,
    </p>
    <p>
     for example, some skippers think little of pumping their whole way
    </p>
    <p>
     across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should the officer of the deck
    </p>
    <p>
     happen to forget his duty in that respect, the probability would be that
    </p>
    <p>
     he and his shipmates would never again remember it, on account of all
    </p>
    <p>
     hands gently subsiding to the bottom.  Nor in the solitary and savage
    </p>
    <p>
     seas far from you to the westward, gentlemen, is it altogether unusual
    </p>
    <p>
     for ships to keep clanging at their pump-handles in full chorus even
    </p>
    <p>
     for a voyage of considerable length! that is, if it lie along a tolerably
    </p>
    <p>
     accessible coast, or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part
    </p>
    <p>
     of those waters, some really landless latitude, that her captain begins
    </p>
    <p>
     to feel a little anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak
    </p>
    <p>
     was found gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern
    </p>
    <p>
     manifested by several of her company; especially by Radney the mate.
    </p>
    <p>
     He commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew,
    </p>
    <p>
     and every way expanded to the breeze.  Now this Radney, I suppose,
    </p>
    <p>
     was as little of a coward, and as little inclined to any sort
    </p>
    <p>
     of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless,
    </p>
    <p>
     unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently
    </p>
    <p>
     imagine, gentlemen.  Therefore when he betrayed this imagine,
    </p>
    <p>
     solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the seamen declared
    </p>
    <p>
     that it was only on account of his being a part owner in her.
    </p>
    <p>
     So when they were working that evening at the pumps, there was on this
    </p>
    <p>
     head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood
    </p>
    <p>
     with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water;
    </p>
    <p>
     clear as any mountain spring, gentlemen--that bubbling from the pumps
    </p>
    <p>
     ran across the deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at
    </p>
    <p>
     the lee scupper-holes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this
    </p>
    <p>
     conventional world of ours--watery or otherwise; that when a person
    </p>
    <p>
     placed in command over his fellow-men finds one of them to be
    </p>
    <p>
     very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood,
    </p>
    <p>
     straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike
    </p>
    <p>
     and bitterness; and if he had a chance he will pull down and pulverize
    </p>
    <p>
     that subaltern's tower, and make a little heap of dust of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Be this conceit of mine as it may, gentlemen, at all events
    </p>
    <p>
     Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your
    </p>
    <p>
     last viceroy's snorting charger; and a brain, and a heart,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a soul in him, gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne,
    </p>
    <p>
     had he been born son to Charlemagne's father.  But Radney, the mate,
    </p>
    <p>
     was ugly as a mule; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious.
    </p>
    <p>
     He did not love Steelkilt, and Steelkilt knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump
    </p>
    <p>
     with the rest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed,
    </p>
    <p>
     went on with his gay banterings.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Aye, aye, my merry lads, it's a lively leak this; hold a cannikin,
    </p>
    <p>
     one of ye, and let's have a taste.  By the Lord, it's worth bottling!
    </p>
    <p>
     I tell ye what, men, old Rad's investment must go for it!
    </p>
    <p>
     he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fact is, boys, that sword-fish only began the job; he's come
    </p>
    <p>
     back again with a gang of ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish,
    </p>
    <p>
     and what not; and the whole posse of 'em are now hard at work
    </p>
    <p>
     cutting and slashing at the bottom; making improvements, I suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
     If old Rad were here now, I'd tell him to jump overboard and scatter 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
     They're playing the devil with his estate, I can tell him.
    </p>
    <p>
     But he's a simple old soul,--Rad, and a beauty too.  Boys, they say
    </p>
    <p>
     the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses. I wonder
    </p>
    <p>
     if he'd give a poor devil like me the model of his nose.'
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Damn your eyes! what's that pump stopping for?' roared Radney,
    </p>
    <p>
     pretending not to have heard the sailors' talk.  'Thunder away at it!'
    </p>
    <p>
     'Aye, aye, sir,' said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket.
    </p>
    <p>
     'Lively, boys, lively, now!'  And with that the pump clanged
    </p>
    <p>
     like fifty fire-engines; the men tossed their hats off to it,
    </p>
    <p>
     and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard
    </p>
    <p>
     which denotes the fullest tension of life's utmost energies.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman
    </p>
    <p>
     went forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass;
    </p>
    <p>
     his face fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat
    </p>
    <p>
     from his brow.  Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed
    </p>
    <p>
     Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state,
    </p>
    <p>
     I know not; but so it happened.  Intolerably striding along the deck,
    </p>
    <p>
     the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks,
    </p>
    <p>
     and also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon
    </p>
    <p>
     allowing a pig to run at large.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship's deck at sea is a piece of household
    </p>
    <p>
     work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended
    </p>
    <p>
     to every evening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships
    </p>
    <p>
     actually foundering at the time.  Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility
    </p>
    <p>
     of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen;
    </p>
    <p>
     some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
     But in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province
    </p>
    <p>
     of the boys, if boys there be aboard.  Besides, it was the stronger
    </p>
    <p>
     men in the Town-Ho that had been divided into gangs, taking turns
    </p>
    <p>
     at the pumps; and being the most athletic seaman of them all,
    </p>
    <p>
     Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs;
    </p>
    <p>
     consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business
    </p>
    <p>
     not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the case
    </p>
    <p>
     with his comrades.  I mention all these particulars so that you
    </p>
    <p>
     may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But there was more than this:  the order about the shovel was almost
    </p>
    <p>
     as plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney
    </p>
    <p>
     had spat in his face.  Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship
    </p>
    <p>
     will understand this; and all this and doubtless much more,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command.
    </p>
    <p>
     But as he sat still for a moment, and as he steadfastly
    </p>
    <p>
     looked into the mate's malignant eye and perceived the stacks
    </p>
    <p>
     of powder-casks heaped up in him and the slow-match silently
    </p>
    <p>
     burning along towards them; as he instinctively saw all this,
    </p>
    <p>
     that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper
    </p>
    <p>
     passionateness in any already ireful being--a repugnance most felt,
    </p>
    <p>
     when felt at all, by really valiant men even when aggrieved--
    </p>
    <p>
     this nameless phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over Steelkilt.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily
    </p>
    <p>
     exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that
    </p>
    <p>
     sweeping the deck was not his business, and he would not do it.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed
    </p>
    <p>
     to three lads, as the customary sweepers; who, not being
    </p>
    <p>
     billeted at the pumps, had done little or nothing all day.
    </p>
    <p>
     To this, Radney replied, with an oath, in a most domineering
    </p>
    <p>
     and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command;
    </p>
    <p>
     meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an uplifted
    </p>
    <p>
     cooper's club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps,
    </p>
    <p>
     for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating
    </p>
    <p>
     Steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate;
    </p>
    <p>
     but somehow still smothering the conflagration within him,
    </p>
    <p>
     without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat,
    </p>
    <p>
     till at last the incensed Radney shook the hammer within a few
    </p>
    <p>
     inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do his bidding.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass,
    </p>
    <p>
     steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer,
    </p>
    <p>
     deliberately repeated his intention not to obey.  Seeing, however,
    </p>
    <p>
     that his forbearance had not the slightest effect, by an awful
    </p>
    <p>
     and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off
    </p>
    <p>
     the foolish and infatuated man; but it was to no purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
     And in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass;
    </p>
    <p>
     when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him
    </p>
    <p>
     that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Mr. Radney, I will not obey you.  Take that hammer away, or look
    </p>
    <p>
     to yourself.'  But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him,
    </p>
    <p>
     where the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch
    </p>
    <p>
     of his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye
    </p>
    <p>
     with the unflinching poniard of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching his
    </p>
    <p>
     right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his persecutor
    </p>
    <p>
     that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would murder him.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods.
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant the lower
    </p>
    <p>
     jaw of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch spouting
    </p>
    <p>
     blood like a whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays
    </p>
    <p>
     leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing
    </p>
    <p>
     their mastheads.  They were both Canallers.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Canallers!' cried Don Pedro.  'We have seen many whaleships
    </p>
    <p>
     in our harbors, but never heard of your Canallers.  Pardon:  who and
    </p>
    <p>
     what are they?'
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand
    </p>
    <p>
     Erie Canal.  You must have heard of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Nay, Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy,
    </p>
    <p>
     and hereditary land, we know but little of your vigorous North.'
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Aye?  Well then, Don, refill my cup.  Your chicha's very fine;
    </p>
    <p>
     and ere proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are;
    </p>
    <p>
     for such information may throw side-light upon my story.'
    </p>
    <p>
     "For three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire breadth
    </p>
    <p>
     of the state of New York; through numerous populous cities and most
    </p>
    <p>
     thriving villages; through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and affluent,
    </p>
    <p>
     cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility; by billiard-room
    </p>
    <p>
     and bar-room; through the holy-of-holies of great forests; on Roman arches
    </p>
    <p>
     over Indian rivers; through sun and shade; by happy hearts or broken;
    </p>
    <p>
     through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk counties;
    </p>
    <p>
     and especially, by rows of snow-white chapels, whose spires stand
    </p>
    <p>
     almost like milestones, flows one continual stream of Venetianly
    </p>
    <p>
     corrupt and often lawless life.  There's your true Ashantee, gentlemen;
    </p>
    <p>
     there howl your pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you;
    </p>
    <p>
     under the long-flung shadow, and the snug patronizing lee of churches.
    </p>
    <p>
     For by some curious fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan
    </p>
    <p>
     freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice,
    </p>
    <p>
     so sinners, gentlemen, most abound in holiest vicinities.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Is that a friar passing?' said Don Pedro, looking downwards
    </p>
    <p>
     into the crowded plazza, with humorous concern.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella's Inquisition wanes
    </p>
    <p>
     in Lima,' laughed Don Sebastian.  'Proceed, Senor.'
    </p>
    <p>
     "'A moment!  Pardon!' cried another of the company.  'In the name
    </p>
    <p>
     of all us Limeese, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor,
    </p>
    <p>
     that we have by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting
    </p>
    <p>
     present Lima for distant Venice in your corrupt comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh! do not bow and look surprised:  you know the proverb all along
    </p>
    <p>
     this coast--"Corrupt as Lima."  It but bears out your saying, too;
    </p>
    <p>
     churches more plentiful than billiard-tables, and for ever open-and
    </p>
    <p>
     "Corrupt as Lima."  So, too, Venice; I have been there; the holy
    </p>
    <p>
     city of the blessed evangelist, St. Mark!--St. Dominic, purge it!
    </p>
    <p>
     Your cup!  Thanks:  here I refill; now, you pour out again.'
    </p>
    <p>
     "Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller
    </p>
    <p>
     would make a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely
    </p>
    <p>
     wicked is he.  Like Mark Antony, for days and days along his
    </p>
    <p>
     green-turfed, flowery Nile, he indolently floats, openly toying
    </p>
    <p>
     with his red-cheeked Cleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the sunny deck.  But ashore, all this effeminacy is dashed.
    </p>
    <p>
     The brigandish guise which the Canaller so proudly sports;
    </p>
    <p>
     his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his grand features.
    </p>
    <p>
     A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats;
    </p>
    <p>
     his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once a vagabond on his own canal, I have received good turns
    </p>
    <p>
     from one of these Canallers; I thank him heartily; would fain be
    </p>
    <p>
     not ungrateful; but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualities
    </p>
    <p>
     of your man of violence, that at times he has as stiff an arm
    </p>
    <p>
     to back a poor stranger in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy one.
    </p>
    <p>
     In sum, gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is,
    </p>
    <p>
     is emphatically evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so
    </p>
    <p>
     many of its most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of mankind,
    </p>
    <p>
     except Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling captains.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter, that to
    </p>
    <p>
     many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line,
    </p>
    <p>
     the probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transition
    </p>
    <p>
     between quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field, and recklessly
    </p>
    <p>
     ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'I see!  I see!' impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his
    </p>
    <p>
     chicha upon his silvery ruffles.  'No need to travel!
    </p>
    <p>
     The world's one Lima.  I had thought, now, that at your temperate
    </p>
    <p>
     North the generations were cold and holy as the hills.--
    </p>
    <p>
     But the story.'
    </p>
    <p>
     "I had left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the backstay.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hardly had he done so, when he was surrounded by the three junior
    </p>
    <p>
     mates and the four harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
     But sliding down the ropes like baleful comets, the two Canallers
    </p>
    <p>
     rushed into the uproar, and sought to drag their man out of it towards
    </p>
    <p>
     the forecastle.  Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a twisted turmoil ensued; while standing out of harm's way,
    </p>
    <p>
     the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale-pike, calling
    </p>
    <p>
     upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke
    </p>
    <p>
     him along to the quarter-deck. At intervals, he ran close up to
    </p>
    <p>
     the revolving border of the confusion, and prying into the heart of it
    </p>
    <p>
     with his pike, sought to prick out the object of his resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all;
    </p>
    <p>
     they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing
    </p>
    <p>
     about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass,
    </p>
    <p>
     these sea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Come out of that, ye pirates!' roared the captain, now menacing
    </p>
    <p>
     them with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward.
    </p>
    <p>
     'Come out of that, ye cut-throats!'
    </p>
    <p>
     "Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there,
    </p>
    <p>
     defied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain
    </p>
    <p>
     to understand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt's) death would
    </p>
    <p>
     be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true,
    </p>
    <p>
     the captain a little desisted, but still commanded the insurgents
    </p>
    <p>
     instantly to return to their duty.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?' demanded their ringleader.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Turn to! turn to!--I make no promise; to your duty!
    </p>
    <p>
     Do you want to sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this?
    </p>
    <p>
     Turn to!' and he once more raised a pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Sink the ship?' cried Steelkilt.  'Aye, let her sink.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not a man of us turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn
    </p>
    <p>
     against us.  What say ye, men?' turning to his comrades.
    </p>
    <p>
     A fierce cheer was their response.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping
    </p>
    <p>
     his eye on the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:--
    </p>
    <p>
     'It's not our fault; we didn't want it; I told him to take
    </p>
    <p>
     his hammer away; it was boy's business; he might have known
    </p>
    <p>
     me before this; I told him not to prick the buffalo;
    </p>
    <p>
     I believe I have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw;
    </p>
    <p>
     ain't those mincing knives down in the forecastle there,
    </p>
    <p>
     men? look to those handspikes, my hearties.  Captain, by God,
    </p>
    <p>
     look to yourself; say the word; don't be a fool; forget it all;
    </p>
    <p>
     we are ready to turn to; treat us decently, and we're your men;
    </p>
    <p>
     but we won't be flogged.'
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Turn to!  I make no promises, turn to, I say!'
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Look ye, now,' cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him,
    </p>
    <p>
     'there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped
    </p>
    <p>
     for the cruise, d'ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim
    </p>
    <p>
     our discharge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don't want a row;
    </p>
    <p>
     it's not our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work,
    </p>
    <p>
     but we won't be flogged.'
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Turn to!' roared the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:--'I tell
    </p>
    <p>
     you what it is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung
    </p>
    <p>
     for such a shabby rascal, we won't lift a hand against ye unless
    </p>
    <p>
     ye attack us; but till you say the word about not flogging us,
    </p>
    <p>
     we don't do a hand's turn.'
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I'll keep ye there
    </p>
    <p>
     till ye're sick of it.  Down ye go.'
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Shall we?' cried the ringleader to his men.  Most of them
    </p>
    <p>
     were against it; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt,
    </p>
    <p>
     they preceded him down into their dark den, growlingly disappearing,
    </p>
    <p>
     like bears into a cave.
    </p>
    <p>
     "As the Lakeman's bare head was just level with the planks,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Captain and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing
    </p>
    <p>
     over the slide of the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it,
    </p>
    <p>
     and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock
    </p>
    <p>
     belonging to the companionway.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered something down
    </p>
    <p>
     the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them--ten in number--
    </p>
    <p>
     leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had remained neutral.
    </p>
    <p>
     "All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers,
    </p>
    <p>
     forward and aft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and
    </p>
    <p>
     fore hatchway; at which last place it was feared the insurgents
    </p>
    <p>
     might emerge, after breaking through the bulkhead below.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the hours of darkness passed in peace; the men who still
    </p>
    <p>
     remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps, whose clinking
    </p>
    <p>
     and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally
    </p>
    <p>
     resounded through the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
     "At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck,
    </p>
    <p>
     summoned the prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused.
    </p>
    <p>
     Water was then lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls
    </p>
    <p>
     of biscuit were tossed after it; when again turning the key upon
    </p>
    <p>
     them and pocketing it, the Captain returned to the quarter-deck.
    </p>
    <p>
     Twice every day for three days this was repeated; but on the fourth
    </p>
    <p>
     morning a confused wrangling, and then a scuffling was heard,
    </p>
    <p>
     as the customary summons was delivered; and suddenly four men
    </p>
    <p>
     burst up from the forecastle, saying they were ready to turn to.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fetid closeness of the air, and a famishing diet, united perhaps
    </p>
    <p>
     to some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained them to
    </p>
    <p>
     surrender at discretion.  Emboldened by this, the Captain reiterated
    </p>
    <p>
     his demand to the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific
    </p>
    <p>
     hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into
    </p>
    <p>
     the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Only three were left.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Better turn to, now?' said the Captain with a heartless jeer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Shut us up again, will ye!' cried Steelkilt.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh! certainly," said the Captain, and the key clicked.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection
    </p>
    <p>
     of seven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice
    </p>
    <p>
     that had last hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place
    </p>
    <p>
     as black as the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt proposed
    </p>
    <p>
     to the two Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to burst
    </p>
    <p>
     out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison; and armed
    </p>
    <p>
     with their keen mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy implements
    </p>
    <p>
     with a handle at each end) run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail;
    </p>
    <p>
     and if by any devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
     For himself, he would do this, he said, whether they joined him
    </p>
    <p>
     or not.  That was the last night he should spend in that den.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other two;
    </p>
    <p>
     they swore they were ready for that, or for any other mad thing,
    </p>
    <p>
     for anything in short but a surrender.  And what was more, they each
    </p>
    <p>
     insisted upon being the first man on deck, when the time to make
    </p>
    <p>
     the rush should come.  But to this their leader as fiercely objected,
    </p>
    <p>
     reserving that priority for himself; particularly as his two comrades
    </p>
    <p>
     would not yield, the one to the other, in the matter; and both of them
    </p>
    <p>
     could not be first, for the ladder would but admit one man at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
     And here, gentlemen, the foul play of these miscreants must come out.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own
    </p>
    <p>
     separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same
    </p>
    <p>
     piece of treachery, namely:  to be the foremost in breaking out,
    </p>
    <p>
     in order to be the first of the three, though the last of the ten,
    </p>
    <p>
     to surrender; and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon
    </p>
    <p>
     such conduct might merit.  But when Steelkilt made known his
    </p>
    <p>
     determination still to lead them to the last, they in some way,
    </p>
    <p>
     by some subtle chemistry of villany, mixed their before secret
    </p>
    <p>
     treacheries together; and when their leader fell into a doze,
    </p>
    <p>
     verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences;
    </p>
    <p>
     and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with cords;
    </p>
    <p>
     and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood,
    </p>
    <p>
     he and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a few minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot,
    </p>
    <p>
     the still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air
    </p>
    <p>
     by his perfidious allies, who at once claimed the honor
    </p>
    <p>
     of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder.
    </p>
    <p>
     But all these were collared, and dragged along the deck like
    </p>
    <p>
     dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up into the mizzen rigging,
    </p>
    <p>
     like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     'Damn ye,' cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them,
    </p>
    <p>
     'the vultures would not touch ye, ye villains!'
    </p>
    <p>
     "At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had rebelled
    </p>
    <p>
     from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the former
    </p>
    <p>
     that he had a good mind to flog them all round--thought, upon the while,
    </p>
    <p>
     he would do so--he ought to--justice demanded it; but for the present,
    </p>
    <p>
     considering their timely surrender, he would let them go with a reprimand,
    </p>
    <p>
     which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'But as for you, ye carrion rogues,' turning to the three men
    </p>
    <p>
     in the rigging--'for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;'
    </p>
    <p>
     and, seizing a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs
    </p>
    <p>
     of the two traitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung
    </p>
    <p>
     their heads sideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'My wrist is sprained with ye!' he cried, at last; 'but there is still
    </p>
    <p>
     rope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn't give up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Take that gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can
    </p>
    <p>
     say for himself.'
    </p>
    <p>
     "For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion
    </p>
    <p>
     of his cramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head,
    </p>
    <p>
     said in a sort of hiss, 'What I say is this--and mind it well---
    </p>
    <p>
     if you flog me, I murder you!'
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me'--and the Captain drew
    </p>
    <p>
     off with the rope to strike.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Best not,' hissed the Lakeman.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'But I must,'--and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but
    </p>
    <p>
     the Captain; who, to the amazement of all hands, started back,
    </p>
    <p>
     paced the deck rapidly two or three times, and then suddenly
    </p>
    <p>
     throwing down his rope, said, 'I won't do it--let him go--
    </p>
    <p>
     cut him down:  d'ye hear?'
    </p>
    <p>
     But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale man,
    </p>
    <p>
     with a bandaged head, arrested them--Radney the chief mate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ever since the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning,
    </p>
    <p>
     hearing the tumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far
    </p>
    <p>
     had watched the whole scene.  Such was the state of his mouth,
    </p>
    <p>
     that he could hardly speak; but mumbling something about his
    </p>
    <p>
     being willing and able to do what the captain dared not attempt,
    </p>
    <p>
     he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'You are a coward!' hissed the Lakeman.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'So I am, but take that.'  The mate was in the very act
    </p>
    <p>
     of striking, when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm.
    </p>
    <p>
     He paused:  and then pausing no more, made good his word,
    </p>
    <p>
     spite of Steelkilt's threat, whatever that might have been.
    </p>
    <p>
     The three men were then cut down, all hands were turned to,
    </p>
    <p>
     and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps
    </p>
    <p>
     clanged as before.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below,
    </p>
    <p>
     a clamor was heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors
    </p>
    <p>
     running up, besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort
    </p>
    <p>
     with the crew.  Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back,
    </p>
    <p>
     so at their own instance they were put down in the ship's run
    </p>
    <p>
     for salvation.  Still, no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the contrary, it seemed, that mainly at Steelkilt's instigation,
    </p>
    <p>
     they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders
    </p>
    <p>
     to the last, and, when the ship reached port, desert her in a body.
    </p>
    <p>
     But in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage, they all
    </p>
    <p>
     agreed to another thing--namely, not to sing out for whales,
    </p>
    <p>
     in case any should be discovered.  For, spite of her leak,
    </p>
    <p>
     and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still maintained her
    </p>
    <p>
     mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish
    </p>
    <p>
     that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground;
    </p>
    <p>
     and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat,
    </p>
    <p>
     and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw
    </p>
    <p>
     of the whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this
    </p>
    <p>
     sort of passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel
    </p>
    <p>
     (at least till all was over) concerning his own proper and private
    </p>
    <p>
     revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was in Radney the chief mate's watch; and as if the infatuated
    </p>
    <p>
     man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom, after the
    </p>
    <p>
     scene at the rigging, he insisted, against the express counsel
    </p>
    <p>
     of the captain, upon resuming the head of his watch at night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon this, and one or two other circumstances, Steelkilt systematically
    </p>
    <p>
     built the plan of his revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
     "During the night, Radney had an unseaman-like way of sitting
    </p>
    <p>
     on the bulwarks of the quarterdeck, and leaning his arm upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there, a little
    </p>
    <p>
     above the ship's side.  In this attitude, it was well known,
    </p>
    <p>
     he sometimes dozed.  There was a considerable vacancy between
    </p>
    <p>
     the boat and the ship, and down between this was the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his next trick
    </p>
    <p>
     at the helm would come round at two o'clock, in the morning
    </p>
    <p>
     of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed.
    </p>
    <p>
     At his leisure, he employed the interval in braiding something
    </p>
    <p>
     very carefully in his watches below.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'What are you making there?' said a shipmate.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'What do you think? what does it look like?'
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Like a lanyard for your bag; but it's an odd one, seems to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
     'Yes, rather oddish,' said the Lakeman, holding it at arm's length
    </p>
    <p>
     before him; 'but I think it will answer.  Shipmate, I haven't
    </p>
    <p>
     enough twine,--have you any?'
    </p>
    <p>
     "But there was none in the forecastle.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Then I must get some from old Rad;' and he rose to go aft.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'You don't mean to go a begging to him!' said a sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Why not?  Do you think he won't do me a turn, when it's
    </p>
    <p>
     to help himself in the end, shipmate?' and going to the mate,
    </p>
    <p>
     he looked at him quietly, and asked him for some twine to mend
    </p>
    <p>
     his hammock.  It was given him--neither twine nor lanyard were
    </p>
    <p>
     seen again; but the next night an iron ball, closely netted,
    </p>
    <p>
     partly rolled from the pocket of the Lakeman's monkey jacket,
    </p>
    <p>
     as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent helm--
    </p>
    <p>
     nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready
    </p>
    <p>
     dug to the seaman's hand--that fatal hour was then to come;
    </p>
    <p>
     and in the fore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already
    </p>
    <p>
     stark and stretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed in.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from
    </p>
    <p>
     the bloody deed he had planned.  Yet complete revenge he had,
    </p>
    <p>
     and without being the avenger.  For by a mysterious fatality,
    </p>
    <p>
     Heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into
    </p>
    <p>
     its own the damning thing he would have done.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning
    </p>
    <p>
     of the second day, when they were washing down the decks,
    </p>
    <p>
     that a stupid Teneriffe man, drawing water in the main-chains,
    </p>
    <p>
     all at once shouted out, 'There she rolls! there she rolls!'
    </p>
    <p>
     Jesu, what a whale!  It was Moby Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Moby Dick!' cried Don Sebastian; 'St. Dominic!  Sir sailor,
    </p>
    <p>
     but do whales have christenings?  Whom call you Moby Dick?'
    </p>
    <p>
     "'A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster, Don;--
    </p>
    <p>
     but that would be too long a story.'
    </p>
    <p>
     "'How? how?' cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Nay, Dons, Dons--nay, nay!  I cannot rehearse that now.
    </p>
    <p>
     Let me get more into the air, Sirs.'
    </p>
    <p>
     "'The chicha! the chicha!' cried Don Pedro; 'our vigorous friend
    </p>
    <p>
     looks faint;--fill up his empty glass!'
    </p>
    <p>
     "No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.--Now, gentlemen,
    </p>
    <p>
     so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the ship--
    </p>
    <p>
     forgetful of the compact among the crew--in the excitement of the moment,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice
    </p>
    <p>
     for the monster, though for some little time past it had been plainly
    </p>
    <p>
     beheld from the three sullen mast-heads. All was now a phrensy.
    </p>
    <p>
     'The White Whale--the White Whale!' was the cry from captain,
    </p>
    <p>
     mates, and harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours,
    </p>
    <p>
     were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish;
    </p>
    <p>
     while the dogged crew eyed askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty
    </p>
    <p>
     of the vast milky mass, that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun,
    </p>
    <p>
     shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gentlemen, a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these events,
    </p>
    <p>
     as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted.
    </p>
    <p>
     The mutineer was the bowsman of the mate, and when fast to a fish,
    </p>
    <p>
     it was his duty to sit next him, while Radney stood up with his lance
    </p>
    <p>
     in the prow, and haul in or slacken the line, at the word of command.
    </p>
    <p>
     Moreover, when the four boats were lowered, the mate's got the start;
    </p>
    <p>
     and none howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt,
    </p>
    <p>
     as he strained at his oar.  After a stiff pull, their harpooneer
    </p>
    <p>
     got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney sprang to the bow.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat.  And now his
    </p>
    <p>
     bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale's topmost back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding
    </p>
    <p>
     foam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat
    </p>
    <p>
     struck as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the
    </p>
    <p>
     standing mate.  That instant, as he fell on the whale's slippery back,
    </p>
    <p>
     the boat righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney
    </p>
    <p>
     was tossed over into the sea, on the other flank of the whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     He struck out through the spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen
    </p>
    <p>
     through that veil, wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye
    </p>
    <p>
     of Moby Dick.  But the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom;
    </p>
    <p>
     seized the swimmer between his jaws; and rearing high up with him,
    </p>
    <p>
     plunged headlong again, and went down.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Meantime, at the first tap of the boat's bottom, the Lakeman
    </p>
    <p>
     had slackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool;
    </p>
    <p>
     calmly looking on, he thought his own thoughts.  But a sudden, terrific,
    </p>
    <p>
     downward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line.
    </p>
    <p>
     He cut it; and the whale was free.  But, at some distance,
    </p>
    <p>
     Moby Dick rose again, with some tatters of Radney's red
    </p>
    <p>
     woollen shirt, caught in the teeth that had destroyed him.
    </p>
    <p>
     All four boats gave chase again; but the whale eluded them,
    </p>
    <p>
     and finally wholly disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
     "In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port--a savage, solitary place--
    </p>
    <p>
     where no civilized creature resided.  There, headed by the Lakeman,
    </p>
    <p>
     all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among
    </p>
    <p>
     the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double
    </p>
    <p>
     war-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some other harbor.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The ship's company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving
    </p>
    <p>
     down the ship to stop the leak.  But to such unresting vigilance over
    </p>
    <p>
     their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated,
    </p>
    <p>
     both by night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent,
    </p>
    <p>
     that upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such
    </p>
    <p>
     a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them
    </p>
    <p>
     in so heavy a vessel.  After taking counsel with his officers,
    </p>
    <p>
     he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran
    </p>
    <p>
     out his two cannon from the bows; stacked his muskets on the poop;
    </p>
    <p>
     and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at their peril,
    </p>
    <p>
     took one man with him, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat,
    </p>
    <p>
     steered straight before the wind for Tahiti, five hundred miles distant,
    </p>
    <p>
     to procure a reinforcement to his crew.
    </p>
    <p>
     "On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried,
    </p>
    <p>
     which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals.
    </p>
    <p>
     He steered away from it; but the savage craft bore down on him;
    </p>
    <p>
     and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed him to heave to,
    </p>
    <p>
     or he would run him under water.  The captain presented a pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
     With one foot on each prow of the yoked war-canoes, the Lakeman
    </p>
    <p>
     laughed him to scorn; assuring him that if the pistol so much
    </p>
    <p>
     as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and foam.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'What do you want of me?' cried the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?'
    </p>
    <p>
     demanded Steelkilt; 'no lies.'
    </p>
    <p>
     "'I am bound to Tahiti for more men.'
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Very good.  Let me board you a moment--I come in peace.'
    </p>
    <p>
     With that he leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat;
    </p>
    <p>
     and climbing the gunwale, stood face to face with the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head.  Now, repeat after me.
    </p>
    <p>
     As soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat
    </p>
    <p>
     on yonder island, and remain there six days.  If I do not,
    </p>
    <p>
     may lightning strike me!'
    </p>
    <p>
     "'A pretty scholar,' laughed the Lakeman.  'Adios, Senor!'
    </p>
    <p>
     and leaping into the sea, he swam back to his comrades.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the roots
    </p>
    <p>
     of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due time arrived
    </p>
    <p>
     at Tahiti, his own place of destination.  There, luck befriended him;
    </p>
    <p>
     two ships were about to sail for France, and were providentially
    </p>
    <p>
     in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed.
    </p>
    <p>
     They embarked, and so for ever got the start of their former captain,
    </p>
    <p>
     had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more
    </p>
    <p>
     civilized Tahitians, who had been somewhat used to the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Chartering a small native schooner, he returned with them to his vessel;
    </p>
    <p>
     and finding all right there, again resumed his cruisings.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island
    </p>
    <p>
     of Nantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses
    </p>
    <p>
     to give up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale
    </p>
    <p>
     that destroyed him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Are you through?' said Don Sebastian, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'I am, Don.'
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions,
    </p>
    <p>
     this your story is in substance really true?  It is so passing wonderful!
    </p>
    <p>
     Did you get it from an unquestionable source?  Bear with me if I
    </p>
    <p>
     seem to press.'
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Also bear with all of us, sir sailor; for we all join in
    </p>
    <p>
     Don Sebastian's suit,' cried the company, with exceeding interest.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn, gentlemen?'
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Nay,' said Don Sebastian; 'but I know a worthy priest near by,
    </p>
    <p>
     who will quickly procure one for me.  I go for it; but are you
    </p>
    <p>
     well advised? this may grow too serious.'
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?'
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Though there are no Auto-da-Fe's in Lima now,' said one of the company
    </p>
    <p>
     to another; 'I fear our sailor friend runs risks of the archiepiscopacy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight.  I see no need of this.'
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian; but may I
    </p>
    <p>
     also beg that you will be particular in procuring the largest
    </p>
    <p>
     sized Evangelists you can.'
    </p>
    <p>
     'This is the priest, he brings you the Evangelists,' said Don Sebastian,
    </p>
    <p>
     gravely, returning with a tall and solemn figure.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Let me remove my hat.  Now, venerable priest, further into the light,
    </p>
    <p>
     and hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'So help me Heaven, and on my honor the story I have
    </p>
    <p>
     told ye, gentlemen, is in substance and its great items, true.
    </p>
    <p>
     I know it to be true; it happened on this ball; I trod the ship;
    </p>
    <p>
     I knew the crew; I have seen and talked with Steelkilt since
    </p>
    <p>
     the death of Radney."

     CHAPTER 55
    </head>
    <p>
     Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales
    </p>
    <p>
     I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,
    </p>
    <p>
     something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears
    </p>
    <p>
     to the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale
    </p>
    <p>
     is moored alongside the whaleship so that he can be fairly stepped
    </p>
    <p>
     upon there.  It may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert
    </p>
    <p>
     to those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to
    </p>
    <p>
     the present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is time to set the world right in this matter, by proving such
    </p>
    <p>
     pictures of the whale all wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
     It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will
    </p>
    <p>
     be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures.
    </p>
    <p>
     For ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble
    </p>
    <p>
     panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues, and on shields,
    </p>
    <p>
     medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in scales of
    </p>
    <p>
     chain-armor like Saladin's, and a helmeted head like St. George's;
    </p>
    <p>
     ever since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed,
    </p>
    <p>
     not only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific
    </p>
    <p>
     presentations of him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways
    </p>
    <p>
     purporting to be the whale's, is to be found in the famous
    </p>
    <p>
     cavern-pagoda of Elephants, in India.  The Brahmins maintain
    </p>
    <p>
     that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda,
    </p>
    <p>
     all the trades and pursuits, every conceivable avocation of man,
    </p>
    <p>
     were prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being.
    </p>
    <p>
     No wonder then, that in some sort our noble profession
    </p>
    <p>
     of whaling should have been there shadowed forth.  The Hindoo
    </p>
    <p>
     whale referred to, occurs in a separate department of the wall,
    </p>
    <p>
     depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan,
    </p>
    <p>
     learnedly known as the Matse Avatar.  But though this sculpture
    </p>
    <p>
     is half man and half whale, so as only to give the tail
    </p>
    <p>
     of the latter, yet that small section of him is all wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
     It looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda,
    </p>
    <p>
     than the broad palms of the true whale's majestic flukes.
    </p>
    <p>
     But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian
    </p>
    <p>
     painter's portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better
    </p>
    <p>
     than the antediluvian Hindoo.  It is Guido's picture of
    </p>
    <p>
     Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the sea-monster or whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     Where did Guido get the model of such a strange creature as that?
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor does Hogarth, in painting the same scene in his own
    </p>
    <p>
     "Perseus Descending," make out one whit better.  The huge
    </p>
    <p>
     corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the surface,
    </p>
    <p>
     scarcely drawing one inch of water.  It has a sort of howdah on
    </p>
    <p>
     its back, and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows
    </p>
    <p>
     are rolling, might be taken for the Traitors' Gate leading from
    </p>
    <p>
     the Thames by water into the Tower.  Then, there are the Prodromus
    </p>
    <p>
     whales of the old Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah's whale, as depicted
    </p>
    <p>
     in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers.
    </p>
    <p>
     What shall be said of these?  As for the book-binder's whale
    </p>
    <p>
     winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor--
    </p>
    <p>
     as stamped and gilded on the backs and titlepages of many
    </p>
    <p>
     books both old and new--that is a very picturesque but purely
    </p>
    <p>
     fabulous creature, imitated, I take it, from the like figures
    </p>
    <p>
     on antique vases.  Though universally denominated a dolphin,
    </p>
    <p>
     I nevertheless call this book-binder's fish an attempt at a whale;
    </p>
    <p>
     because it was so intended when the device was first introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was introduced by an old Italian publisher somewhere
    </p>
    <p>
     about the 15th century, during the Revival of Learning;
    </p>
    <p>
     and in those days, and even down to a comparatively late period,
    </p>
    <p>
     dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the Leviathan.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books
    </p>
    <p>
     you will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     where all manner of spouts, jets d'eau, hot springs and cold,
    </p>
    <p>
     Saratoga and Baden-Baden, come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the title-page of the original edition of the "Advancement of Learning"
    </p>
    <p>
     you will find some curious whales.
    </p>
    <p>
     But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those
    </p>
    <p>
     pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations,
    </p>
    <p>
     by those who know.  In old Harris's collection of voyages there
    </p>
    <p>
     are some plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages,
    </p>
    <p>
     A.D. 1671, entitled "A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas
    </p>
    <p>
     in the Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master."  In one of those
    </p>
    <p>
     plates the whales, like great rafts of logs, are represented lying
    </p>
    <p>
     among ice-isles, with white bears running over their living backs.
    </p>
    <p>
     In another plate, the prodigious blunder is made of representing
    </p>
    <p>
     the whale with perpendicular flukes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain Colnett,
    </p>
    <p>
     a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled "A Voyage round
    </p>
    <p>
     Cape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending
    </p>
    <p>
     the Spermaceti Whale Fisheries."  In this book is an outline
    </p>
    <p>
     purporting to be a "Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793,
    </p>
    <p>
     and hoisted on deck."  I doubt not the captain had this veracious
    </p>
    <p>
     picture taken for the benefit of his marines.  To mention but one
    </p>
    <p>
     thing about it, let me say that it has an eye which applied,
    </p>
    <p>
     according to the accompanying scale, to a full grown sperm whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     would make the eye of that whale a bow-window some five feet long.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ah, my gallant captain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking
    </p>
    <p>
     out of that eye!
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History
    </p>
    <p>
     for the benefit of the young and tender, free from the same
    </p>
    <p>
     heinousness of mistake.  Look at that popular work
    </p>
    <p>
     "Goldsmith's Animated Nature."  In the abridged London edition
    </p>
    <p>
     of 1807, there are plates of an alleged "whale" and a "narwhale."
    </p>
    <p>
     I do not wish to seem inelegant, but this unsightly whale
    </p>
    <p>
     looks much like an amputated sow; and, as for the narwhale,
    </p>
    <p>
     one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this nineteenth
    </p>
    <p>
     century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon
    </p>
    <p>
     any intelligent public of schoolboys.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacepede,
    </p>
    <p>
     a great naturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book,
    </p>
    <p>
     wherein are several pictures of the different species of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Leviathan.  All these are not only incorrect, but the picture
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Mysticetus or Greenland whale (that is to say the Right
    </p>
    <p>
     whale), even Scoresby, a long experienced man as touching
    </p>
    <p>
     that species, declares not to have its counterpart in nature.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business
    </p>
    <p>
     was reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the
    </p>
    <p>
     famous Baron.  In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales,
    </p>
    <p>
     in which he gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before showing that picture to any Nantucketer, you had best
    </p>
    <p>
     provide for your summary retreat from Nantucket.  In a word,
    </p>
    <p>
     Frederick Cuvier's Sperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale, but a squash.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage (such men
    </p>
    <p>
     seldom have), but whence he derived that picture, who can tell?
    </p>
    <p>
     Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field,
    </p>
    <p>
     Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions; that is, from a
    </p>
    <p>
     Chinese drawing.  And what sort of lively lads with the pencil
    </p>
    <p>
     those Chinese are, many queer cups and saucers inform us.
    </p>
    <p>
     As for the sign-painters' whales seen in the streets hanging
    </p>
    <p>
     over the shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them?
    </p>
    <p>
     They are generally Richard III.  whales, with dromedary humps,
    </p>
    <p>
     and very savage; breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts,
    </p>
    <p>
     that is whaleboats full of mariners:  their deformities
    </p>
    <p>
     floundering in seas of blood and blue paint.
    </p>
    <p>
     But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very
    </p>
    <p>
     surprising after all.  Consider!  Most of the scientific drawings have
    </p>
    <p>
     been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a
    </p>
    <p>
     drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent
    </p>
    <p>
     the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living
    </p>
    <p>
     Leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
     The living whale, in his full majesty and significance, is only
    </p>
    <p>
     to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast
    </p>
    <p>
     bulk of him is out of sight, like a launched line-of-battle ship;
    </p>
    <p>
     and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal
    </p>
    <p>
     man to hoist him bodily into the air, so as to preserve all his mighty
    </p>
    <p>
     swells and undulations.  And, not to speak of the highly presumable
    </p>
    <p>
     difference of contour between a young suckling whale and a full-grown
    </p>
    <p>
     Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of one of those young
    </p>
    <p>
     sucking whales hoisted to a ship's deck, such is then the outlandish,
    </p>
    <p>
     eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that his precise expression
    </p>
    <p>
     the devil himself could not catch.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     accurate hints may be derived touching his true form.  Not at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan,
    </p>
    <p>
     that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though Jeremy Bentham's skeleton, which hangs for candelabra
    </p>
    <p>
     in the library of one of his executors, correctly conveys the idea
    </p>
    <p>
     of a burly-browed utilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy's
    </p>
    <p>
     other leading personal characteristics; yet nothing of this
    </p>
    <p>
     kind could be inferred from any leviathan's articulated bones.
    </p>
    <p>
     In fact, as the great Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale
    </p>
    <p>
     bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal
    </p>
    <p>
     as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it.
    </p>
    <p>
     This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part
    </p>
    <p>
     of this book will be incidentally shown.  It is also very curiously
    </p>
    <p>
     displayed in the side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer
    </p>
    <p>
     to the bones of the human hand, minus only the thumb.  This fin has
    </p>
    <p>
     four regular bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger.
    </p>
    <p>
     But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering,
    </p>
    <p>
     as the human fingers in an artificial covering.  "However recklessly
    </p>
    <p>
     the whale may sometimes serve us," said humorous Stubb one day,
    </p>
    <p>
     "he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens."
    </p>
    <p>
     For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it,
    </p>
    <p>
     you must needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that one
    </p>
    <p>
     creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last.
    </p>
    <p>
     True, one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another,
    </p>
    <p>
     but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness.
    </p>
    <p>
     So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what
    </p>
    <p>
     the whale really looks like.  And the only mode in which you
    </p>
    <p>
     can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour,
    </p>
    <p>
     is by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run
    </p>
    <p>
     no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wherefore, it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious
    </p>
    <p>
     in your curiosity touching this Leviathan.

     CHAPTER 56
    </head>
    <p>
     Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales and the True Pictures
    </p>
    <p>
     of Whaling Scenes
    </p>
    <p>
     In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly
    </p>
    <p>
     tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them
    </p>
    <p>
     which are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern,
    </p>
    <p>
     especially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, &amp;c. But I
    </p>
    <p>
     pass that matter by.
    </p>
    <p>
     I know of only four published outlines of the great
    </p>
    <p>
     Sperm Whale; Colnett's, Huggins's, Frederick Cuvier's, and Beale's. In
    </p>
    <p>
     the previous chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Huggins's is far better than theirs; but, by great odds,
    </p>
    <p>
     Beale's is the best.  All Beale's drawings of this whale
    </p>
    <p>
     are good, excepting the middle figure in the picture of three
    </p>
    <p>
     whales in various attitudes, capping his second chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
     His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales, though no doubt
    </p>
    <p>
     calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men,
    </p>
    <p>
     is admirably correct and life-like in its general effect.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some of the Sperm Whale drawings in J. Ross Browne are pretty
    </p>
    <p>
     correct in contour; but they are wretchedly engraved.
    </p>
    <p>
     That is not his fault though.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby;
    </p>
    <p>
     but they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression.
    </p>
    <p>
     He has but one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency,
    </p>
    <p>
     because it is by such pictures only, when at all well done, that you
    </p>
    <p>
     can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen
    </p>
    <p>
     by his living hunters.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in
    </p>
    <p>
     some details not the most correct, presentations of whales
    </p>
    <p>
     and whaling scenes to be anywhere found, are two large
    </p>
    <p>
     French engravings, well executed, and taken from paintings by
    </p>
    <p>
     one Garnery.  Respectively, they represent attacks on the Sperm
    </p>
    <p>
     and Right Whale.  In the first engraving a noble Sperm Whale
    </p>
    <p>
     is depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath the boat
    </p>
    <p>
     from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the.
    </p>
    <p>
     air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks.
    </p>
    <p>
     The prow of the boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just
    </p>
    <p>
     balancing upon the monster's spine; and standing in that prow,
    </p>
    <p>
     for that one single incomputable flash of time, you behold
    </p>
    <p>
     an oarsman, half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of
    </p>
    <p>
     the whale, and in the act of leaping, as if from a precipice.
    </p>
    <p>
     The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and true.
    </p>
    <p>
     The half-emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea;
    </p>
    <p>
     the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it;
    </p>
    <p>
     the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale
    </p>
    <p>
     in contrasting expressions of affright; while in the black
    </p>
    <p>
     stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
     Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details
    </p>
    <p>
     of this whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me,
    </p>
    <p>
     I could not draw so good a one.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside
    </p>
    <p>
     the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls
    </p>
    <p>
     his black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from
    </p>
    <p>
     the Patagonian cliffs.  His jets are erect, full, and black like soot;
    </p>
    <p>
     so that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think
    </p>
    <p>
     there must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea
    </p>
    <p>
     candies and maccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on
    </p>
    <p>
     his pestilent back.  And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan
    </p>
    <p>
     is rushing through the deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds
    </p>
    <p>
     in his wake, and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells
    </p>
    <p>
     like a skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus, the fore-ground is all raging commotion; but behind,
    </p>
    <p>
     in admirable artistic contrast, is the glassy level of a sea becalmed,
    </p>
    <p>
     the drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship, and the inert
    </p>
    <p>
     mass of a dead whale, a conquered fortress, with the flag of capture
    </p>
    <p>
     lazily hanging from the whale-pole inserted into his spout-hole.
    </p>
    <p>
     Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not.  But my life
    </p>
    <p>
     for it he was either practically conversant with his subject,
    </p>
    <p>
     or else marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman.
    </p>
    <p>
     The French are the lads for painting action.  Go and gaze upon
    </p>
    <p>
     all the paintings in Europe, and where will you find such a
    </p>
    <p>
     gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas, as in that
    </p>
    <p>
     triumphal hall at Versailles; where the beholder fights his way,
    </p>
    <p>
     pell-mell, through the consecutive great battles of France;
    </p>
    <p>
     where every sword seems a flash of the Northern Lights,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the successive armed kings and Emperors dash by, like a
    </p>
    <p>
     charge of crowned centaurs?  Not wholly unworthy of a place
    </p>
    <p>
     in that gallery, are these sea battle-pieces of Garnery.
    </p>
    <p>
     The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness
    </p>
    <p>
     of things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings
    </p>
    <p>
     and engravings they have of their whaling scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
     With not one tenth of England's experience in the fishery,
    </p>
    <p>
     and not the thousandth part of that of the Americans, they have
    </p>
    <p>
     nevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished sketches
    </p>
    <p>
     at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the most part, the English and American whale draughtsmen
    </p>
    <p>
     seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical
    </p>
    <p>
     outline of things, such as the vacant profile of the whale;
    </p>
    <p>
     which, so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned,
    </p>
    <p>
     is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even Scoresby, the justly renowned Right whaleman,
    </p>
    <p>
     after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises,
    </p>
    <p>
     treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks,
    </p>
    <p>
     chopping knives, and grapnels; and with the microscopic diligence
    </p>
    <p>
     of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world
    </p>
    <p>
     ninety-six fac-similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals.
    </p>
    <p>
     I mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager (I honor him
    </p>
    <p>
     for a veteran), but in so important a matter it was certainly
    </p>
    <p>
     an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a sworn
    </p>
    <p>
     affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the Peace.
    </p>
    <p>
     In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two
    </p>
    <p>
     other French engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes
    </p>
    <p>
     himself "H. Durand."  One of them, though not precisely adapted to our
    </p>
    <p>
     present purpose, nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is a quiet noon-scene among the isles of the Pacific; a French
    </p>
    <p>
     whaler anchored, inshore, in a calm, and lazily taking water on board;
    </p>
    <p>
     the loosened sails of the ship, and the long leaves of the palms
    </p>
    <p>
     in the background, both drooping together in the breezeless air.
    </p>
    <p>
     The effect is very fine, when considered with reference to its
    </p>
    <p>
     presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of
    </p>
    <p>
     oriental repose.  The other engraving is quite a different affair:
    </p>
    <p>
     the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in the very heart of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside; the vessel
    </p>
    <p>
     (in the act of cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to a quay;
    </p>
    <p>
     and a boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity,
    </p>
    <p>
     is about giving chase to whales in the distance.  The harpoons
    </p>
    <p>
     and lances lie levelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting
    </p>
    <p>
     the mast in its hole; while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little
    </p>
    <p>
     craft stands half-erect out of the water, like a rearing horse.
    </p>
    <p>
     From the ship, the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is
    </p>
    <p>
     going up like the smoke over a village of smithies; and to windward,
    </p>
    <p>
     a black cloud, rising up with earnest of squalls and rains,
    </p>
    <p>
     seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen.

     On Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen
    </p>
    <p>
     a crippled beggar (or kedger, as the sailors say) holding a painted board
    </p>
    <p>
     before him, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are three whales and three boats; and one of the boats
    </p>
    <p>
     (presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity)
    </p>
    <p>
     is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     Any time these ten years, they tell me, has that man held up
    </p>
    <p>
     that picture, and exhibited that stump to an incredulous world.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the time of his justification has now come.  His three whales
    </p>
    <p>
     are as good whales as were ever published in Wapping, at any rate;
    </p>
    <p>
     and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in
    </p>
    <p>
     the western clearings.  But, though for ever mounted on that stump,
    </p>
    <p>
     never a stump-speech does the poor whaleman make; but, with downcast eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
     stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Throughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford,
    </p>
    <p>
     and Sag Harbor, you will come across lively sketches of whales
    </p>
    <p>
     and whaling-scenes, graven by the fishermen themselves on
    </p>
    <p>
     Sperm Whale-teeth, or ladies' busks wrought out of the Right Whale-bone,
    </p>
    <p>
     and other like skrimshander articles, as the whalemen call
    </p>
    <p>
     the numerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve
    </p>
    <p>
     out of the rough material, in their hours of ocean leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some of them have little boxes of dentistical-looking implements,
    </p>
    <p>
     specially intended for the skrimshandering business.  But, in general,
    </p>
    <p>
     they toil with their jack-knives alone; and, with that almost
    </p>
    <p>
     omnipotent tool of the sailor, they will turn you out anything
    </p>
    <p>
     you please, in the way of a mariner's fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man
    </p>
    <p>
     to that condition in which God placed him, i.e. what is called savagery.
    </p>
    <p>
     Your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois.  I myself
    </p>
    <p>
     am a savage, owning no allegiance but to the King of the Cannibals;
    </p>
    <p>
     and ready at any moment to rebel against him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in
    </p>
    <p>
     his domestic hours, is his wonderful patience of industry.
    </p>
    <p>
     An ancient Hawaiian war-club or spear-paddle, in its full
    </p>
    <p>
     multiplicity and elaboration of carving, is as great a trophy
    </p>
    <p>
     of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon.  For, with but a bit
    </p>
    <p>
     of broken sea-shell or a shark's tooth, that miraculous intricacy
    </p>
    <p>
     of wooden net-work has been achieved; and it has cost steady
    </p>
    <p>
     years of steady application.
    </p>
    <p>
     As with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage.
    </p>
    <p>
     With the same marvellous patience, and with the same single
    </p>
    <p>
     shark's tooth, of his one poor jack-knife, he will carve you a bit
    </p>
    <p>
     of bone sculpture, not quite as workmanlike, but as close packed
    </p>
    <p>
     in its maziness of design, as the Greek savage, Achilles's shield;
    </p>
    <p>
     and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness, as the prints
    </p>
    <p>
     of that fine old Dutch savage, Albert Durer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small dark
    </p>
    <p>
     slabs of the noble South Sea war-wood, are frequently met
    </p>
    <p>
     with in the forecastles of American whalers.  Some of them
    </p>
    <p>
     are done with much accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
     At some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass
    </p>
    <p>
     whales hung by the tail for knockers to the road-side door.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the porter is sleepy, the anvil-headed whale would be best.
    </p>
    <p>
     But these knocking whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the spires of some old-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron
    </p>
    <p>
     whales placed there for weathercocks; but they are so elevated,
    </p>
    <p>
     and besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled
    </p>
    <p>
     with "Hands off!" you cannot examine them closely enough to decide
    </p>
    <p>
     upon their merit.
    </p>
    <p>
     In bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken
    </p>
    <p>
     cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain,
    </p>
    <p>
     you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the Leviathan
    </p>
    <p>
     partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks against them
    </p>
    <p>
     in a surf of green surges.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is
    </p>
    <p>
     continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and there
    </p>
    <p>
     from some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses
    </p>
    <p>
     of the profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges.
    </p>
    <p>
     But you must be a thorough whaleman, to see these sights;
    </p>
    <p>
     and not only that, but if you wish to return to such a sight again,
    </p>
    <p>
     you must be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude
    </p>
    <p>
     and longitude of your first stand-point, else so chance-like
    </p>
    <p>
     are such observations of the hills, that your precise,
    </p>
    <p>
     previous stand-point would require a laborious re-discovery;
    </p>
    <p>
     like the Solomon islands, which still remain incognita, though once
    </p>
    <p>
     high-ruffed Mendanna trod them and old Figuera chronicled them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail
    </p>
    <p>
     to trace out great whales in the starry heavens, and boats
    </p>
    <p>
     in pursuit of them; as when long filled with thoughts of war
    </p>
    <p>
     the Eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus at the North have I chased Leviathan round and round the Pole
    </p>
    <p>
     with the revolutions of the bright points that first defined him to me.
    </p>
    <p>
     And beneath the effulgent Antarctic skies I have boarded
    </p>
    <p>
     the Argo-Navis, and joined the chase against the starry Cetus
    </p>
    <p>
     far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and the Flying Fish.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a frigate's anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons
    </p>
    <p>
     for spurs, would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies,
    </p>
    <p>
     to see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really
    </p>
    <p>
     lie encamped beyond my mortal sight!

     CHAPTER 58
    </head>
    <p>
     Brit
    </p>
    <p>
     Steering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast meadows
    </p>
    <p>
     of brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right Whale
    </p>
    <p>
     largely feeds.  For leagues and leagues it undulated round us,
    </p>
    <p>
     so that we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe
    </p>
    <p>
     and golden wheat.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure from
    </p>
    <p>
     the attack of a Sperm-Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws sluggishly
    </p>
    <p>
     swam through the brit, which, adhering to the fringing fibres of that
    </p>
    <p>
     wondrous Venetian blind in their mouths, was in that manner separated
    </p>
    <p>
     from the water that escaped at the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     As morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance
    </p>
    <p>
     their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads;
    </p>
    <p>
     even so these monsters swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting sound;
    </p>
    <p>
     and leaving behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea.*
    </p>
    <p>
     *That part of the sea known among whalemen as the "Brazil Banks"
    </p>
    <p>
     does not bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do,
    </p>
    <p>
     because of there being shallows and soundings there, but because
    </p>
    <p>
     of this remarkable meadow-like appearance, caused by the vast
    </p>
    <p>
     drifts of brit continually floating in those latitudes,
    </p>
    <p>
     where the Right Whale is often chased.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at
    </p>
    <p>
     all reminded one of mowers.  Seen from the mast-heads, especially
    </p>
    <p>
     when they paused and were stationary for a while, their vast black
    </p>
    <p>
     forms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as in the great hunting countries of India, the stranger
    </p>
    <p>
     at a distance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent
    </p>
    <p>
     elephants without knowing them to be such, taking them for bare,
    </p>
    <p>
     blackened elevations of the soil; even so, often, with him, who for
    </p>
    <p>
     the first time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     And even when recognized at last, their immense magnitude renders
    </p>
    <p>
     it very hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth
    </p>
    <p>
     can possibly be instinct, in all parts, with the same sort of life
    </p>
    <p>
     that lives in a dog or a horse.
    </p>
    <p>
     Indeed.  in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures
    </p>
    <p>
     of the deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
     For though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures
    </p>
    <p>
     of the land are of their kind in the sea; and though taking a broad
    </p>
    <p>
     general view of the thing, this may very well be; yet coming
    </p>
    <p>
     to specialties, where, for example, does the ocean furnish any fish
    </p>
    <p>
     that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog?
    </p>
    <p>
     The accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear
    </p>
    <p>
     comparative analogy to him.
    </p>
    <p>
     But though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the seas
    </p>
    <p>
     have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling;
    </p>
    <p>
     though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita,
    </p>
    <p>
     so that Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover
    </p>
    <p>
     his one superficial western one; though, by vast odds, the most
    </p>
    <p>
     terrific of all mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately
    </p>
    <p>
     befallen tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the waters; though but a moment's consideration will teach that,
    </p>
    <p>
     however baby man may brag of his science and skill, and however much,
    </p>
    <p>
     in a flattering future, that science and skill may augment;
    </p>
    <p>
     yet for ever and for ever, to the crack of doom, the sea will insult
    </p>
    <p>
     and murder him, and pulverize the stateliest, stiffest frigate
    </p>
    <p>
     he can make; nevertheless, by the continual repetition of these
    </p>
    <p>
     very impressions, man has lost that sense of the full awfulness
    </p>
    <p>
     of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese
    </p>
    <p>
     vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow.
    </p>
    <p>
     That same ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships
    </p>
    <p>
     of last year.  Yea, foolish mortals, Noah's flood is not yet subsided;
    </p>
    <p>
     two thirds of the fair world it yet covers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon
    </p>
    <p>
     one is not a miracle upon the other?  Preternatural terrors
    </p>
    <p>
     rested upon the Hebrews, when under the feet of Korah and his
    </p>
    <p>
     company the live ground opened and swallowed them up for ever;
    </p>
    <p>
     yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in precisely the same manner
    </p>
    <p>
     the live sea swallows up ships and crews.
    </p>
    <p>
     But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien
    </p>
    <p>
     to it, but it is also a fiend to its own off-spring;
    </p>
    <p>
     worse than the Persian host who murdered his own guests;
    </p>
    <p>
     sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her
    </p>
    <p>
     own cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against
    </p>
    <p>
     the rocks, and leaves them there side by side with the split
    </p>
    <p>
     wrecks of ships.  No mercy, no power but its own controls it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost
    </p>
    <p>
     its rider, the masterless ocean overruns the globe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded
    </p>
    <p>
     creatures glide under water, unapparent for the most part,
    </p>
    <p>
     and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of
    </p>
    <p>
     its most remorseless tribes, as the dainty embellished shape
    </p>
    <p>
     of many species of sharks.  Consider once more, the universal
    </p>
    <p>
     cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey upon each other,
    </p>
    <p>
     carrying on eternal war since the world began.
    </p>
    <p>
     Consider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most
    </p>
    <p>
     docile earth; consider them both, the sea and the land;
    </p>
    <p>
     and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself?
    </p>
    <p>
     For as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul
    </p>
    <p>
     of man there lies one insular Tahiti, full of peace and joy,
    </p>
    <p>
     but encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life.
    </p>
    <p>
     God keep thee!  Push not off from that isle, thou canst never return!

     CHAPTER 59

    <p>
     Squid
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod still
    </p>
    <p>
     held on her way north-eastward towards the island of Java;
    </p>
    <p>
     a gentle air impelling her keel, so that in the surrounding
    </p>
    <p>
     serenity her three tall tapering masts mildly waved
    </p>
    <p>
     to that languid breeze, as three mild palms on a plain.
    </p>
    <p>
     And still, at wide intervals in the silvery night, the lonely,
    </p>
    <p>
     alluring jet would be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
     But one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost
    </p>
    <p>
     preternatural spread over the sea, however unattended with any
    </p>
    <p>
     stagnant calm; when the long burnished sun-glade on the waters
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed a golden finger laid across them, enjoining some secrecy;
    </p>
    <p>
     when the slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on;
    </p>
    <p>
     in this profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre
    </p>
    <p>
     was seen by Daggoo from the main-mast-head.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher
    </p>
    <p>
     and higher, and disentangling itself from the azure, at last gleamed
    </p>
    <p>
     before our prow like a snow-slide, new slid from the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus glistening for a moment, as slowly it subsided, and sank.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then once more arose, and silently gleamed.  It seemed not a whale;
    </p>
    <p>
     and yet is this Moby Dick? thought Daggoo.  Again the phantom
    </p>
    <p>
     went down, but on re-appearing once more, with a stiletto-like
    </p>
    <p>
     cry that startled every man from his nod, the negro yelled
    </p>
    <p>
     out--"There! there again! there she breaches! right ahead!
    </p>
    <p>
     The White Whale, the White Whale!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time
    </p>
    <p>
     the bees rush to the boughs.  Bare-headed in the sultry sun,
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab stood on the bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind
    </p>
    <p>
     in readiness to wave his orders to the helmsman, cast his eager
    </p>
    <p>
     glance in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched
    </p>
    <p>
     motionless arm of Daggoo.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary
    </p>
    <p>
     jet had gradually worked upon Ahab, so that he was now prepared
    </p>
    <p>
     to connect the ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight
    </p>
    <p>
     of the particular whale he pursued; however this was, or whether
    </p>
    <p>
     his eagerness betrayed him; whichever way it might have been,
    </p>
    <p>
     no sooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass, than with
    </p>
    <p>
     a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering.
    </p>
    <p>
     The four boats were soon on the water; Ahab's in advance,
    </p>
    <p>
     and all swiftly pulling towards their prey.  Soon it went down,
    </p>
    <p>
     and while, with oars suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance,
    </p>
    <p>
     lo! in the same spot where it sank, once more it slowly rose.
    </p>
    <p>
     Almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of Moby Dick,
    </p>
    <p>
     we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret
    </p>
    <p>
     seas have hitherto revealed to mankind.  A vast pulpy mass,
    </p>
    <p>
     furlongs in length and breadth, of a glancing cream-color, lay
    </p>
    <p>
     floating on the water, innumerable long arms radiating from
    </p>
    <p>
     its centre, and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas,
    </p>
    <p>
     as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach.
    </p>
    <p>
     No perceptible face or front did it have; no conceivable token
    </p>
    <p>
     of either sensation or instinct; but undulated there on the billows,
    </p>
    <p>
     an unearthly, formless, chance-like apparition of life.
    </p>
    <p>
     As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again,
    </p>
    <p>
     Starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk,
    </p>
    <p>
     with a wild voice exclaimed--"Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick
    </p>
    <p>
     and fought him, than to have seen thee, thou white ghost!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "What was it, Sir?" said Flask.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever beheld,
    </p>
    <p>
     and returned to their ports to tell of it."
    </p>
    <p>
     But Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the vessel;
    </p>
    <p>
     the rest as silently following.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected
    </p>
    <p>
     with the sight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it
    </p>
    <p>
     being so very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it
    </p>
    <p>
     with portentousness.  So rarely is it beheld, that though one and all
    </p>
    <p>
     of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean,
    </p>
    <p>
     yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning
    </p>
    <p>
     its true nature and form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish
    </p>
    <p>
     to the sperm whale his only food.  For though other species of whales find
    </p>
    <p>
     their food above water, and may be seen by man in the act of feeding,
    </p>
    <p>
     the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below
    </p>
    <p>
     the surface; and only by inference is it that any one can tell
    </p>
    <p>
     of what, precisely, that food consists.  At times, when closely pursued,
    </p>
    <p>
     he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid;
    </p>
    <p>
     some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length.
    </p>
    <p>
     They fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily
    </p>
    <p>
     clings by them to the bed of the ocean; and that the sperm whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     unlike other species, is supplied with teeth in order to attack
    </p>
    <p>
     and tear it.
    </p>
    <p>
     There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of
    </p>
    <p>
     Bishop Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid.  The manner
    </p>
    <p>
     in which the Bishop describes it, as alternately rising and sinking,
    </p>
    <p>
     with some other particulars he narrates, in all this the two correspond.
    </p>
    <p>
     But much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk
    </p>
    <p>
     he assigns it.
    </p>
    <p>
     By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious
    </p>
    <p>
     creature, here spoken of, it is included among the class of cuttle-fish,
    </p>
    <p>
     to which, indeed, in certain external respects it would seem to belong,
    </p>
    <p>
     but only as the Anak of the tribe.

     CHAPTER 60
    </head>
    <p>
     The Line
    </p>
    <p>
     With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described,
    </p>
    <p>
     as well as for the better understanding of all similar scenes
    </p>
    <p>
     elsewhere presented, I have here to speak of the magical,
    </p>
    <p>
     sometimes horrible whale-line.
    </p>
    <p>
     The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp,
    </p>
    <p>
     slightly vapored with tar, not impregnated with it, as in
    </p>
    <p>
     the case of ordinary ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used,
    </p>
    <p>
     makes the hemp more pliable to the rope-maker, and also renders
    </p>
    <p>
     the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common
    </p>
    <p>
     ship use; yet, not only would the ordinary quantity too much
    </p>
    <p>
     stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which it must
    </p>
    <p>
     be subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in
    </p>
    <p>
     general by no means adds to the rope's durability or strength,
    </p>
    <p>
     however much it may give it compactness and gloss.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost
    </p>
    <p>
     entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not
    </p>
    <p>
     so durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic;
    </p>
    <p>
     and I will add (since there is an aesthetics in all things),
    </p>
    <p>
     is much more handsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hemp is a dusky, dark fellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla
    </p>
    <p>
     is as a golden-haired Circassian to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
     The whale-line is only two thirds of an inch in thickness.
    </p>
    <p>
     At first sight, you would not think it so strong as it really is.
    </p>
    <p>
     By experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight
    </p>
    <p>
     of one hundred and twenty pounds; so that the whole rope will
    </p>
    <p>
     bear a strain nearly equal to three tons.  In length, the common
    </p>
    <p>
     sperm whale-line measures something over two hundred fathoms.
    </p>
    <p>
     Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub,
    </p>
    <p>
     not like the worm-pipe of a still though, but so as to form one round,
    </p>
    <p>
     cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded "sheaves," or layers of
    </p>
    <p>
     concentric spiralizations, without any hollow but the "heart,"
    </p>
    <p>
     or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in running out,
    </p>
    <p>
     infallibly take somebody's arm, leg, or entire body off,
    </p>
    <p>
     the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business,
    </p>
    <p>
     carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through
    </p>
    <p>
     a block towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to free it
    </p>
    <p>
     from all possible wrinkles and twists.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one;
    </p>
    <p>
     the same line being continuously coiled in both tubs.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is some advantage in this; because these twin-tubs
    </p>
    <p>
     being so small they fit more readily into the boat,
    </p>
    <p>
     and do not strain it so much; whereas, the American tub,
    </p>
    <p>
     nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth,
    </p>
    <p>
     makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but
    </p>
    <p>
     one-half inch in thickness; for the bottom of the whale-boat
    </p>
    <p>
     is like critical ice, which will bear up a considerable
    </p>
    <p>
     distributed weight, but not very much of a concentrated one.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the american line-tub,
    </p>
    <p>
     the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious
    </p>
    <p>
     great wedding-cake to present to the whales.
    </p>
    <p>
     Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating
    </p>
    <p>
     in an eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against
    </p>
    <p>
     the side of the tub, and hanging over its edge completely
    </p>
    <p>
     disengaged from everything.  This arrangement of the lower end
    </p>
    <p>
     is necessary on two accounts.  First:  In order to facilitate
    </p>
    <p>
     the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat,
    </p>
    <p>
     in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten
    </p>
    <p>
     to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon.
    </p>
    <p>
     In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale,
    </p>
    <p>
     as it were, from the one boat to the other; though the first boat
    </p>
    <p>
     always hovers at hand to assist its consort.  Second:  This arrangement
    </p>
    <p>
     is indispensable for common safety's sake; for were the lower
    </p>
    <p>
     end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were
    </p>
    <p>
     the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single,
    </p>
    <p>
     smoking minute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there,
    </p>
    <p>
     for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him
    </p>
    <p>
     into the profundity of the sea; and in that case no town-crier
    </p>
    <p>
     would ever find her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line
    </p>
    <p>
     is taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there,
    </p>
    <p>
     is again carried forward the entire length of the boat,
    </p>
    <p>
     resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man's oar,
    </p>
    <p>
     so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing; and also passing
    </p>
    <p>
     between the men, as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales,
    </p>
    <p>
     to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of
    </p>
    <p>
     the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill,
    </p>
    <p>
     prevents it from slipping out.  From the chocks it hangs in a slight
    </p>
    <p>
     festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the boat again;
    </p>
    <p>
     and some ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being coiled upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the box in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale still
    </p>
    <p>
     a little further aft, and is then attached to the short-warp--
    </p>
    <p>
     the rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon;
    </p>
    <p>
     but previous to that connexion, the short-warp goes through sundry
    </p>
    <p>
     mystifications too tedious to detail.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,
    </p>
    <p>
     twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction.
    </p>
    <p>
     All the oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions;
    </p>
    <p>
     so that to the timid eye of the landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers,
    </p>
    <p>
     with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor can any son of mortal woman, for the first time, seat himself amid
    </p>
    <p>
     those hempen intricacies, and while straining his utmost at the oar,
    </p>
    <p>
     bethink him that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted,
    </p>
    <p>
     and all these horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings;
    </p>
    <p>
     he cannot be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes
    </p>
    <p>
     the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet habit--strange thing! what cannot habit accomplish?--Gayer sallies,
    </p>
    <p>
     more merry mirth, better jokes, and brighter repartees, you never
    </p>
    <p>
     heard over your mahogany, than you will hear over the half-inch
    </p>
    <p>
     white cedar of the whaleboat, when thus hung in hangman's nooses;
    </p>
    <p>
     and, like the six burghers of Calais before King Edward, the six
    </p>
    <p>
     men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death, with a halter
    </p>
    <p>
     around every neck, as you may say.
    </p>
    <p>
     Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account
    </p>
    <p>
     for those repeated whaling disasters--some few of which are
    </p>
    <p>
     casually chronicled--of this man or that man being taken out of
    </p>
    <p>
     the boat by the line, and lost.  For, when the line is darting out,
    </p>
    <p>
     to be seated then in the boat, is like being seated in the midst
    </p>
    <p>
     of the manifold whizzings of a steam-engine in full play,
    </p>
    <p>
     when every flying beam, and shaft, and wheel, is grazing you.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of
    </p>
    <p>
     these perils, because the boat is rocking like a cradle, and you
    </p>
    <p>
     are pitched one way and the other, without the slightest warning;
    </p>
    <p>
     and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness
    </p>
    <p>
     of volition and action, can you escape being made a Mazeppa of,
    </p>
    <p>
     and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could never
    </p>
    <p>
     pierce you out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again:  as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and
    </p>
    <p>
     prophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself;
    </p>
    <p>
     for, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm;
    </p>
    <p>
     and contains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle
    </p>
    <p>
     holds the fatal powder, and the ball, and the explosion;
    </p>
    <p>
     so the graceful repose of the line, as it silently serpentines
    </p>
    <p>
     about the oarsmen before being brought into actual play--
    </p>
    <p>
     this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other
    </p>
    <p>
     aspect of this dangerous affair.  But why say more?  All men live
    </p>
    <p>
     enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their necks;
    </p>
    <p>
     but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death,
    </p>
    <p>
     that mortals realize the silent, subtle, everpresent perils of life.
    </p>
    <p>
     And if you be a philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat,
    </p>
    <p>
     you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror, than though
    </p>
    <p>
     seated before your evening fire with a poker, and not a harpoon,
    </p>
    <p>
     by your side.

     Stubb Kills a Whale
    </p>
    <p>
     If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents,
    </p>
    <p>
     to Queequeg it was quite a different object.
    </p>
    <p>
     "When you see him 'quid," said the savage, honing his harpoon in the bow
    </p>
    <p>
     of his hoisted boat, "then you quick see him 'parm whale."
    </p>
    <p>
     The next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     special to engage them, the Pequod's crew could hardly
    </p>
    <p>
     resist the spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     For this part of the Indian Ocean through which we then were
    </p>
    <p>
     voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground; that is,
    </p>
    <p>
     it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises, dolphins, flying-fish, and
    </p>
    <p>
     other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters, than those off
    </p>
    <p>
     the Rio de la Plata, or the in-shore ground off Peru.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my
    </p>
    <p>
     shoulders leaning against the slackened royal shrouds,
    </p>
    <p>
     to and fro I idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air.
    </p>
    <p>
     No resolution could withstand it; in that dreamy mood losing
    </p>
    <p>
     all consciousness, at last my soul went out of my body;
    </p>
    <p>
     though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will,
    </p>
    <p>
     long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that
    </p>
    <p>
     the seamen at the main and mizzen mast-heads were already drowsy.
    </p>
    <p>
     So that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars,
    </p>
    <p>
     and for every swing that we made there was a nod from below from
    </p>
    <p>
     the slumbering helmsman.  The waves, too, nodded their indolent crests;
    </p>
    <p>
     and across the wide trance of the sea, east nodded to west,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the sun over all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes;
    </p>
    <p>
     like vices my hands grasped the shrouds; some invisible,
    </p>
    <p>
     gracious agency preserved me; with a shock I came back to life.
    </p>
    <p>
     And lo! close under our lee, not forty fathoms off, a gigantic
    </p>
    <p>
     Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull
    </p>
    <p>
     of a frigate, his broad, glossy back, of an Ethiopian hue,
    </p>
    <p>
     glistening in the sun's rays like a mirror.  But lazily undulating
    </p>
    <p>
     in the trough of the sea, and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his
    </p>
    <p>
     vapory jet, the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe
    </p>
    <p>
     of a warm afternoon.  But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last.
    </p>
    <p>
     As if struck by some enchanter's wand, the sleepy ship
    </p>
    <p>
     and every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness;
    </p>
    <p>
     and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel,
    </p>
    <p>
     simultaneously with the three notes from aloft, shouted forth
    </p>
    <p>
     the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and regularly
    </p>
    <p>
     spouted the sparkling brine into the air.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Clear away the boats!  Luff!" cried Ahab.  And obeying his own order,
    </p>
    <p>
     he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and ere
    </p>
    <p>
     the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the leeward,
    </p>
    <p>
     but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples as he swam,
    </p>
    <p>
     that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed, Ahab gave orders
    </p>
    <p>
     that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak but in whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
     So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the boats,
    </p>
    <p>
     we swiftly but silently paddled along; the calm not admitting of
    </p>
    <p>
     the noiseless sails being set.  Presently, as we thus glided in chase,
    </p>
    <p>
     the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air,
    </p>
    <p>
     and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There go flukes!" was the cry, an announcement immediately
    </p>
    <p>
     followed by Stubb's producing his match and igniting his pipe,
    </p>
    <p>
     for now a respite was granted.  After the full interval of his
    </p>
    <p>
     sounding had elapsed, the whale rose again, and being now in advance
    </p>
    <p>
     of the smoker's boat, and much nearer to it than to any of the others,
    </p>
    <p>
     Stubb counted upon the honor of the capture.  It was obvious,
    </p>
    <p>
     now, that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers.
    </p>
    <p>
     All silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use.
    </p>
    <p>
     Paddles were dropped, and oars came loudly into play.
    </p>
    <p>
     And still puffing at his pipe, Stubb cheered on his crew
    </p>
    <p>
     to the assault.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, a mighty change had come over the fish.  All alive to his jeopardy,
    </p>
    <p>
     he was going "head out"; that part obliquely projecting from the mad
    </p>
    <p>
     yeast which he brewed.*
    </p>
    <p>
     *It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance
    </p>
    <p>
     the entire interior of the sperm whale's enormous head consists.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant
    </p>
    <p>
     part about him.  So that with ease he elevates it in the air,
    </p>
    <p>
     and invariably does so when going at his utmost speed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Besides, such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head,
    </p>
    <p>
     and such the tapering cut-water formation of the lower part,
    </p>
    <p>
     that by obliquely elevating his head, he thereby may be said
    </p>
    <p>
     to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish galliot into
    </p>
    <p>
     a sharppointed New York pilot-boat.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Start her, start her, my men!  Don't hurry yourselves; take plenty
    </p>
    <p>
     of time--but start her; start her like thunder-claps, that's all,"
    </p>
    <p>
     cried Stubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke.  "Start her, now;
    </p>
    <p>
     give 'em the long and strong stroke, Tashtego.  Start her, Tash, my boy--
    </p>
    <p>
     start her, all; but keep cool, keep cool--cucumbers is the word--
    </p>
    <p>
     easy, easy--only start her like grim death and grinning devils,
    </p>
    <p>
     and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves, boys--
    </p>
    <p>
     that's all.  Start her!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Woo-hoo! Wa-hee!" screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some
    </p>
    <p>
     old war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat
    </p>
    <p>
     involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke
    </p>
    <p>
     which the eager Indian gave.
    </p>
    <p>
     But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Kee-hee! Kee-hee!" yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards
    </p>
    <p>
     on his seat, like a pacing tiger in his cage.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ka-la! Koo-loo!" howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a
    </p>
    <p>
     mouthful of Grenadier's steak.  And thus with oars and yells the keels
    </p>
    <p>
     cut the sea.  Meanwhile, Stubb, retaining his place in the van,
    </p>
    <p>
     still encouraged his men to the onset, all the while puffing the smoke
    </p>
    <p>
     from his mouth.  Like desperadoes they tugged and they strained,
    </p>
    <p>
     till the welcome cry was heard--"Stand up, Tashtego!--give it to him!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The harpoon was hurled.  "Stern all!"  The oarsmen backed water; the same
    </p>
    <p>
     moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the magical line.  An instant before, Stubb had swiftly
    </p>
    <p>
     caught two additional turns with it round the loggerhead, whence,
    </p>
    <p>
     by reason of its increased rapid circlings, a hempen blue smoke
    </p>
    <p>
     now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the line passed round and round the loggerhead; so also, just before
    </p>
    <p>
     reaching that point, it blisteringly passed through and through both
    </p>
    <p>
     of Stubb's hands, from which the hand-cloths, or squares of quilted
    </p>
    <p>
     canvas sometimes worn at these times, had accidentally dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was like holding an enemy's sharp two-edged sword by the blade,
    </p>
    <p>
     and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wet the line! wet the line!" cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him seated
    </p>
    <p>
     by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed the sea-water into it.*
    </p>
    <p>
     More turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place.
    </p>
    <p>
     The boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stubb and Tashtego here changed places--stem for stern--a staggering
    </p>
    <p>
     business truly in that rocking commotion.
    </p>
    <p>
     *Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here
    </p>
    <p>
     be stated, that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used
    </p>
    <p>
     to dash the running line with water; in many other ships,
    </p>
    <p>
     a wooden piggin, or bailer, is set apart for that purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
     Your hat, however, is the most convenient.
    </p>
    <p>
     From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part
    </p>
    <p>
     of the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring,
    </p>
    <p>
     you would have thought the craft had two keels--one cleaving the water,
    </p>
    <p>
     the other the air--as the boat churned on through both opposing
    </p>
    <p>
     elements at once.  A continual cascade played at the bows;
    </p>
    <p>
     a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake; and, at the slightest motion
    </p>
    <p>
     from within, even but of a little finger, the vibrating, cracking craft
    </p>
    <p>
     canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea.  Thus they rushed;
    </p>
    <p>
     each man with might and main clinging to his seat, to prevent being
    </p>
    <p>
     tossed to the foam; and the tall form of Tashtego at the steering oar
    </p>
    <p>
     crouching almost double, in order to bring down his centre of gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed passed as they shot on their way,
    </p>
    <p>
     till at length the whale somewhat slackened his flight.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Haul in--haul in!" cried Stubb to the bowsman! and,
    </p>
    <p>
     facing round towards the whale, all hands began pulling
    </p>
    <p>
     the boat up to him, while yet the boat was being towed on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb, firmly planting his knee
    </p>
    <p>
     in the clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart into the flying fish;
    </p>
    <p>
     at the word of command, the boat alternately sterning out
    </p>
    <p>
     of the way of the whale's horrible wallow, and then ranging up
    </p>
    <p>
     for another fling.
    </p>
    <p>
     The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks
    </p>
    <p>
     down a hill.  His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood,
    </p>
    <p>
     which bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake.
    </p>
    <p>
     The slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     sent back its reflection into every face, so that they all glowed
    </p>
    <p>
     to each other like red men.  And all the while, jet after jet
    </p>
    <p>
     of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman;
    </p>
    <p>
     as at every dart, hauling in upon his crooked lance (by the line
    </p>
    <p>
     attached to it), Stubb straightened it again and again, by a few
    </p>
    <p>
     rapid blows against the gunwale, then again and again sent it
    </p>
    <p>
     into the whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Pull up--pull up!" he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning
    </p>
    <p>
     whale relaxed in his wrath.  "Pull up!--close to!" and the boat
    </p>
    <p>
     ranged along the fish's flank.  When reaching far over the bow,
    </p>
    <p>
     Stubb slowly churned his long sharp lance into the fish, and kept
    </p>
    <p>
     it there, carefully churning and churning, as if cautiously seeking
    </p>
    <p>
     to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed,
    </p>
    <p>
     and which he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out.
    </p>
    <p>
     But that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish.
    </p>
    <p>
     And now it is struck; for, starting from his trance into that
    </p>
    <p>
     unspeakable thing called his "flurry," the monster horribly wallowed
    </p>
    <p>
     in his blood, overwrapped himself in impenetrable, mad, boiling spray,
    </p>
    <p>
     so that the imperilled craft, instantly dropping astern, had much ado
    </p>
    <p>
     blindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear
    </p>
    <p>
     air of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
     And now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into view!
    </p>
    <p>
     surging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and contracting
    </p>
    <p>
     his spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized respirations.
    </p>
    <p>
     At last, gush after gush of clotted red gore, as if it had been
    </p>
    <p>
     the purple lees of red wine, shot into the frightened air; and falling
    </p>
    <p>
     back again, ran dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     His heart had burst!
    </p>
    <p>
     "He's dead, Mr. Stubb," said Daggoo.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes; both pipes smoked out!" and withdrawing his own from his mouth,
    </p>
    <p>
     Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment,
    </p>
    <p>
     stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.

     CHAPTER 62
    </head>
    <p>
     The Dart
    </p>
    <p>
     A word concerning an incident in the last chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
     According to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat
    </p>
    <p>
     pushes off from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as
    </p>
    <p>
     temporary steersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling
    </p>
    <p>
     the foremost oar, the one known as the harpooneer-oar. Now it needs
    </p>
    <p>
     a strong, nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish;
    </p>
    <p>
     for often, in what is called a long dart, the heavy implement
    </p>
    <p>
     has to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     But however prolonged and exhausting the chase, the harpooneer is
    </p>
    <p>
     expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost; indeed, he is
    </p>
    <p>
     expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest, not only
    </p>
    <p>
     by incredible rowing, but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations;
    </p>
    <p>
     and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one's compass,
    </p>
    <p>
     while all the other muscles are strained and half started--
    </p>
    <p>
     what that is none know but those who have tried it.
    </p>
    <p>
     For one, I cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly
    </p>
    <p>
     at one and the same time.  In this straining, bawling state,
    </p>
    <p>
     then, with his back to the fish, all at once the exhausted
    </p>
    <p>
     harpooneer hears the exciting cry--"Stand up, and give it to him!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He now has to drop and secure his oar, turn round on his centre
    </p>
    <p>
     half way, seize his harpoon from the crotch, and with what little
    </p>
    <p>
     strength may remain, he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     No wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body, that out
    </p>
    <p>
     of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are successful; no wonder
    </p>
    <p>
     that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated;
    </p>
    <p>
     no wonder that some of them actually burst their blood-vessels
    </p>
    <p>
     in the boat; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four
    </p>
    <p>
     years with four barrels; no wonder that to many ship owners,
    </p>
    <p>
     whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer that makes
    </p>
    <p>
     the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how can
    </p>
    <p>
     you expect to find it there when most wanted!
    </p>
    <p>
     Again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant,
    </p>
    <p>
     that is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and harpooneer
    </p>
    <p>
     likewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy
    </p>
    <p>
     of themselves and every one else.  It is then they change places;
    </p>
    <p>
     and the headsman, the chief officer of the little craft, takes his
    </p>
    <p>
     proper station in the bows of the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this
    </p>
    <p>
     is both foolish and unnecessary.  The headsman should stay
    </p>
    <p>
     in the bows from first to last; he should both dart the harpoon
    </p>
    <p>
     and the lance, and no rowing whatever should be expected
    </p>
    <p>
     of him, except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman.
    </p>
    <p>
     I know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed
    </p>
    <p>
     in the chase; but long experience in various whalemen of more
    </p>
    <p>
     than one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority
    </p>
    <p>
     of failures in the fishery, it has not by any means been so much
    </p>
    <p>
     the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion
    </p>
    <p>
     of the harpooneer that has caused them.
    </p>
    <p>
     To insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers
    </p>
    <p>
     of this world must start to their feet from out of idleness,
    </p>
    <p>
     and not from out of toil.

    <p>
     The Crotch
    </p>
    <p>
     Out of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, in productive subjects, grow the chapters.
    </p>
    <p>
     The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet
    </p>
    <p>
     in length, which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard
    </p>
    <p>
     gunwale near the bow, for the purpose of furnishing a rest
    </p>
    <p>
     for the wooden extremity of the harpoons, whose other naked,
    </p>
    <p>
     barbed end slopingly projects from the prow.  Thereby the weapon
    </p>
    <p>
     is instantly at hand to its hurler, who snatches it up as readily
    </p>
    <p>
     from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch,
    </p>
    <p>
     respectively called the first and second irons.
    </p>
    <p>
     But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected
    </p>
    <p>
     with the line; the object being this:  to dart them both,
    </p>
    <p>
     if possible, one instantly after the other into the same whale;
    </p>
    <p>
     so that if, in the coming drag, one should draw out, the other
    </p>
    <p>
     may still retain a hold.  It is a doubling of the chances.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous, violent,
    </p>
    <p>
     convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron,
    </p>
    <p>
     it becomes impossible for the harpooneer, however lightning-like
    </p>
    <p>
     in his movements, to pitch the second iron into him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the line,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events,
    </p>
    <p>
     be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere;
    </p>
    <p>
     else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tumbled into the water, it accordingly is in such cases;
    </p>
    <p>
     the spare coils of box line (mentioned in a preceding chapter)
    </p>
    <p>
     making this feat, in most instances, prudently practicable.
    </p>
    <p>
     But this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest
    </p>
    <p>
     and most fatal casualties.
    </p>
    <p>
     Furthermore:  you must know that when the second iron is thrown
    </p>
    <p>
     overboard, it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror,
    </p>
    <p>
     skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale, entangling the lines,
    </p>
    <p>
     or cutting them, and making a prodigious sensation in all directions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor, in general, is it possible to secure it again until the whale
    </p>
    <p>
     is fairly captured and a corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
     Consider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging
    </p>
    <p>
     one unusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing
    </p>
    <p>
     to these qualities in him, as well as to the thousand concurring
    </p>
    <p>
     accidents of such an audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second
    </p>
    <p>
     irons may be simultaneously dangling about him.  For, of course,
    </p>
    <p>
     each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line
    </p>
    <p>
     should the first one be ineffectually darted without recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
     All these particulars are faithfully narrated here, as they will not
    </p>
    <p>
     fail to elucidate several most important however intricate passages,
    </p>
    <p>
     in scenes hereafter to be painted.

     CHAPTER 64

    <p>
     Stubb's Supper
    </p>
    <p>
     Stubb's whale had been killed some distance from the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a calm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced
    </p>
    <p>
     the slow business of towing the trophy to the Pequod.  And now,
    </p>
    <p>
     as we eighteen men with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred
    </p>
    <p>
     and eighty thumbs and fingers, slowly toiled hour after hour
    </p>
    <p>
     upon that inert, sluggish corpse in the sea; and it seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     hardly to budge at all, except at long intervals; good evidence
    </p>
    <p>
     was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved.
    </p>
    <p>
     For, upon the great canal of Hang-Ho, or whatever they call it,
    </p>
    <p>
     in China, four or five laborers on the foot-path will draw
    </p>
    <p>
     a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour;
    </p>
    <p>
     but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if laden
    </p>
    <p>
     with piglead in bulk.
    </p>
    <p>
     Darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod's
    </p>
    <p>
     main-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment, he issued
    </p>
    <p>
     the usual orders for securing it for the night, and then
    </p>
    <p>
     handing his lantern to a seaman, went his way into the cabin,
    </p>
    <p>
     and did not come forward again until morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab
    </p>
    <p>
     had evinced his customary activity, to call it so;
    </p>
    <p>
     yet now that the creature was dead, some vague dissatisfaction,
    </p>
    <p>
     or impatience, or despair, seemed working in him; as if the sight
    </p>
    <p>
     of that dead body reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain;
    </p>
    <p>
     and though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship,
    </p>
    <p>
     all that would not one jot advance his grand, monomaniac object.
    </p>
    <p>
     Very soon you would have thought from the sound on the Pequod's decks,
    </p>
    <p>
     that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep;
    </p>
    <p>
     for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck, and thrust
    </p>
    <p>
     rattling out of the port-holes. But by those clanking links,
    </p>
    <p>
     the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tied by the head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows,
    </p>
    <p>
     the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel's,
    </p>
    <p>
     and seen through the darkness of the night, which obscured
    </p>
    <p>
     the spars and rigging aloft, the two--ship and whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks, whereof one reclines
    </p>
    <p>
     while the other remains standing.*
    </p>
    <p>
     *A little item may as well be related here.  The strongest and most
    </p>
    <p>
     reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside,
    </p>
    <p>
     is by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part
    </p>
    <p>
     is relatively heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its
    </p>
    <p>
     flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface;
    </p>
    <p>
     so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to put
    </p>
    <p>
     the chain round it.  But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome:
    </p>
    <p>
     a small, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
     By adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other
    </p>
    <p>
     side of the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain
    </p>
    <p>
     is readily made to follow suit; and being slipped along the body,
    </p>
    <p>
     is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail, at the point
    </p>
    <p>
     of junction with its broad flukes or lobes.
    </p>
    <p>
     If moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could
    </p>
    <p>
     be known on deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest,
    </p>
    <p>
     betrayed an unusual but still good-natured excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
     Such an unwonted bustle was he in that the staid Starbuck,
    </p>
    <p>
     his official superior, quietly resigned to him for the time
    </p>
    <p>
     the sole management of affairs.  One small, helping cause of all
    </p>
    <p>
     this liveliness in Stubb, was soon made strangely manifest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stubb was a high liver; he was somewhat intemperately fond
    </p>
    <p>
     of the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate.
    </p>
    <p>
     "A steak, a steak, ere I sleep!  You, Daggoo! overboard you go,
    </p>
    <p>
     and cut me one from his small!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Here be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not,
    </p>
    <p>
     as a general thing, and according to the great military maxim,
    </p>
    <p>
     make the enemy defray the current expenses of the war (at least
    </p>
    <p>
     before realizing the proceeds of the voyage), yet now and then
    </p>
    <p>
     you find some of these Nantucketers who have a genuine relish
    </p>
    <p>
     for that particular part of the Sperm Whale designated by Stubb;
    </p>
    <p>
     comprising the tapering extremity of the body.
    </p>
    <p>
     About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two
    </p>
    <p>
     lanterns of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti
    </p>
    <p>
     supper at the capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor was Stubb the only banqueter on whale's flesh that night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mingling their mumblings with his own mastications, thousands on thousands
    </p>
    <p>
     of sharks, swarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted
    </p>
    <p>
     on its fatness.  The few sleepers below in their bunks were often
    </p>
    <p>
     startled by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull,
    </p>
    <p>
     within a few inches of the sleepers' hearts.  Peering over the side you
    </p>
    <p>
     could just see them (as before you heard them) wallowing in the sullen,
    </p>
    <p>
     black waters, and turning over on their backs as they scooped out
    </p>
    <p>
     huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head.
    </p>
    <p>
     This particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous.
    </p>
    <p>
     How at such an apparently unassailable surface, they contrive to gouge
    </p>
    <p>
     out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of the universal
    </p>
    <p>
     problem of all things.  The mark they thus leave on the whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking
    </p>
    <p>
     for a screw.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight,
    </p>
    <p>
     sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship's decks,
    </p>
    <p>
     like hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved,
    </p>
    <p>
     ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them; and though,
    </p>
    <p>
     while the valiant butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally
    </p>
    <p>
     carving each other's live meat with carving-knives all gilded
    </p>
    <p>
     and tasselled, the sharks, also, with their jewel-hilted mouths,
    </p>
    <p>
     are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat;
    </p>
    <p>
     and though, were you to turn the whole affair upside down,
    </p>
    <p>
     it would still be pretty much the same thing, that is to say,
    </p>
    <p>
     a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties; and though
    </p>
    <p>
     sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships
    </p>
    <p>
     crossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting alongside, to be
    </p>
    <p>
     handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or a dead slave
    </p>
    <p>
     to be decently buried; and though one or two other like instances
    </p>
    <p>
     might be set down, touching the set terms, places, and occasions,
    </p>
    <p>
     when sharks do most socially congregate, and most hilariously feast;
    </p>
    <p>
     yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will find them
    </p>
    <p>
     in such countless numbers, and in gayer or more jovial spirits,
    </p>
    <p>
     than around a dead sperm whale, moored by night to a whaleship at sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you have never seen that sight, then suspend your decision
    </p>
    <p>
     about the propriety of devil-worship, and the expediency of
    </p>
    <p>
     conciliating the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet
    </p>
    <p>
     that was going on so nigh him, no more than the sharks heeded
    </p>
    <p>
     the smacking of his own epicurean lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Cook, cook!--where's that old Fleece?" he cried at length,
    </p>
    <p>
     widening his legs still further, as if to form a more secure
    </p>
    <p>
     base for his supper; and, at the same time darting his fork
    </p>
    <p>
     into the dish, as if stabbing with his lance; "cook, you cook!--
    </p>
    <p>
     sail this way, cook!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously
    </p>
    <p>
     routed from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour,
    </p>
    <p>
     came shambling along from his galley, for, like many old blacks,
    </p>
    <p>
     there was something the matter with his knee-pans, which he did
    </p>
    <p>
     not keep well scoured like his other pans; this old Fleece,
    </p>
    <p>
     as they called him, came shuffling and limping along, assisting his
    </p>
    <p>
     step with his tongs, which, after a clumsy fashion, were made
    </p>
    <p>
     of straightened iron hoops; this old Ebony floundered along,
    </p>
    <p>
     and in obedience to the word of command, came to a dead stop
    </p>
    <p>
     on the opposite side of Stubb's sideboard; when, with both hands
    </p>
    <p>
     folded before him, and resting on his two-legged cane, he bowed
    </p>
    <p>
     his arched back still further over, at the same time sideways
    </p>
    <p>
     inclining his head, so as to bring his best ear into play.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Cook," said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel
    </p>
    <p>
     to his mouth, "don't you think this steak is rather overdone?
    </p>
    <p>
     You've been beating this steak too much, cook; it's too tender.
    </p>
    <p>
     Don't I always say that to be good, a whale-steak must be tough?
    </p>
    <p>
     There are those sharks now over the side, don't you see they
    </p>
    <p>
     prefer it tough and rare?  What a shindy they are kicking up!
    </p>
    <p>
     Cook, go and talk to 'em; tell 'em they are welcome to help
    </p>
    <p>
     themselves civilly, and in moderation, but they must keep quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Blast me, if I can hear my own voice.  Away, cook, and deliver
    </p>
    <p>
     my message.  Here, take this lantern," snatching one from his sideboard;
    </p>
    <p>
     "now then, go and preach to them!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Sullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across
    </p>
    <p>
     the deck to the bulwarks; and then, with one hand drooping his light
    </p>
    <p>
     low over the sea, so as to get a good view of his congregation,
    </p>
    <p>
     with the other hand he solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning
    </p>
    <p>
     far over the side in a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks,
    </p>
    <p>
     while Stubb, softly crawling behind, overheard all that was said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fellow-critters: I'se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat
    </p>
    <p>
     dam noise dare.  You hear?  Stop dat dam smackin' ob de lips!
    </p>
    <p>
     Massa Stubb say dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings,
    </p>
    <p>
     but by Gor! you must stop dat dam racket!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Cook," here interposed Stubb, accompanying the word with a sudden slap
    </p>
    <p>
     on the shoulder,--Cook! why, damn your eyes, you mustn't swear that way
    </p>
    <p>
     when you're preaching.  That's no way to convert sinners, Cook!  Who dat?
    </p>
    <p>
     Den preach to him yourself," sullenly turning to go.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, Cook; go on, go on."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, den, Belubed fellow-critters:"--
    </p>
    <p>
     "Right!" exclaimed Stubb, approvingly, "coax 'em to it, try that,"
    </p>
    <p>
     and Fleece continued.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you is all sharks, and by natur wery woracious, yet I zay to you,
    </p>
    <p>
     fellow-critters, dat dat woraciousness--'top dat dam slappin' ob de tail!
    </p>
    <p>
     How you tink to hear, 'spose you keep up such a dam slapping
    </p>
    <p>
     and bitin' dare?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Cook," cried Stubb, collaring him, "I won't have that swearing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Talk to 'em gentlemanly."
    </p>
    <p>
     Once more the sermon proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Your woraciousness, fellow-critters. I don't blame ye so much for;
    </p>
    <p>
     dat is natur, and can't be helped; but to gobern dat wicked natur,
    </p>
    <p>
     dat is de pint.  You is sharks, sartin; but if you gobern de
    </p>
    <p>
     shark in you, why den you be angel; for all angel is not'ing
    </p>
    <p>
     more dan de shark well goberned.  Now, look here, bred'ren, just
    </p>
    <p>
     try wonst to be cibil, a helping yourselbs from dat whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     Don't be tearin' de blubber out your neighbour's mout, I say.
    </p>
    <p>
     Is not one shark dood right as toder to dat whale?  And, by Gor, none on
    </p>
    <p>
     you has de right to dat whale; dat whale belong to some one else.
    </p>
    <p>
     I know some o' you has berry brig mout, brigger dan oders;
    </p>
    <p>
     but den de brig mouts sometimes has de small bellies; so dat de
    </p>
    <p>
     brigness of de mout is not to swallar wid, but to bit off de
    </p>
    <p>
     blubber for de small fry ob sharks, dat can't get into de scrouge
    </p>
    <p>
     to help demselves."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well done, old Fleece!" cried Stubb, "that's Christianity; go on."
    </p>
    <p>
     "No use goin' on; de dam willains will keep a scrougin'
    </p>
    <p>
     and slappin' each oder, Massa Stubb; dey don't hear one word;
    </p>
    <p>
     no use a-preaching to such dam g'uttons as you call 'em,
    </p>
    <p>
     till dare bellies is full, and dare bellies is bottomless;
    </p>
    <p>
     and when dey do get 'em full, dey wont hear you den;
    </p>
    <p>
     for den dey sink in de sea, go fast to sleep on de coral,
    </p>
    <p>
     and can't hear noting at all, no more, for eber and eber."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Upon my soul, I am about of the same opinion; so give
    </p>
    <p>
     the benediction, Fleece, and I'll away to my supper."
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon this, Fleece, holding both hands over the fishy mob,
    </p>
    <p>
     raised his shrill voice, and cried--
    </p>
    <p>
     "Cussed fellow-critters! Kick up de damndest row as ever you can;
    </p>
    <p>
     fill your dam bellies 'till dey bust--and den die."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now, cook," said Stubb, resuming his supper at the capstan;
    </p>
    <p>
     Stand just where you stood before, there, over against me,
    </p>
    <p>
     and pay particular attention."
    </p>
    <p>
     "All 'dention," said Fleece, again stooping over upon his tongs
    </p>
    <p>
     in the desired position.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well," said Stubb, helping himself freely meanwhile;
    </p>
    <p>
     "I shall now go back to the subject of this steak.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the first place, how old are you, cook?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "What dat do wid de 'teak, " said the old black, testily.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Silence!  How old are you, cook?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Bout ninety, dey say," he gloomily muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
     And have you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred
    </p>
    <p>
     years, cook, and don't know yet how to cook a whale-steak?"
    </p>
    <p>
     rapidly bolting another mouthful at the last word,
    </p>
    <p>
     so that that morsel seemed a continuation of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where were you born, cook?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Hind de hatchway, in ferry-boat, goin' ober de Roanoke."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Born in a ferry-boat! That's queer, too.  But I want to know
    </p>
    <p>
     what country you were born in, cook!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Didn't I say de Roanoke country?" he cried sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, you didn't, cook; but I'll tell you what I'm coming to, cook.
    </p>
    <p>
     You must go home and be born over again; you don't know how to cook
    </p>
    <p>
     a whale-steak yet."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bress my soul, if I cook noder one," he growled, angrily,
    </p>
    <p>
     turning round to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come back here, cook;--here, hand me those tongs;--now take that bit of
    </p>
    <p>
     steak there, and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be?
    </p>
    <p>
     Take it, I say"--holding the tongs towards him--"take it, and taste it."
    </p>
    <p>
     Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the old
    </p>
    <p>
     negro muttered, "Best cooked 'teak I eber taste; joosy, berry joosy."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Cook," said Stubb, squaring himself once more; "do you belong
    </p>
    <p>
     to the church?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Passed one once in Cape-Down," said the old man sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-Town,
    </p>
    <p>
     where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his
    </p>
    <p>
     hearers as his beloved fellow-creatures, have you, cook!
    </p>
    <p>
     And yet you come here, and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did
    </p>
    <p>
     just now, eh?" said Stubb.  "Where do you expect to go to, cook?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Go to bed berry soon," he mumbled, half-turning as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Avast! heave to!  I mean when you die, cook.  It's an awful question.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now what's your answer?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "When dis old brack man dies," said the negro slowly,
    </p>
    <p>
     changing his whole air and demeanor, "he hisself won't go nowhere;
    </p>
    <p>
     but some bressed angel will come and fetch him."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fetch him?  How?  In a coach and four, as they fetched Elijah?
    </p>
    <p>
     And fetch him where?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Up dere," said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head,
    </p>
    <p>
     and keeping it there very solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook,
    </p>
    <p>
     when you are dead?  But don't you know the higher you climb,
    </p>
    <p>
     the colder it gets?  Main-top, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Didn't say dat t'all," said Fleece, again in the sulks.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You said up there, didn't you? and now look yourself, and see
    </p>
    <p>
     where your tongs are pointing.  But, perhaps you expect to get
    </p>
    <p>
     into heaven by crawling through the lubber's hole, cook; but, no,
    </p>
    <p>
     no, cook, you don't get there, except you go the regular way,
    </p>
    <p>
     round by the rigging.  It's a ticklish business, but must be done,
    </p>
    <p>
     or else it's no go.  But none of us are in heaven yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Drop your tongs, cook, and hear my orders.  Do ye hear?
    </p>
    <p>
     Hold your hat in one hand, and clap t'other a'top of your heart,
    </p>
    <p>
     when I'm giving my orders, cook.  What! that your heart, there?--
    </p>
    <p>
     that's your gizzard!  Aloft! aloft!--that's it--now you have it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hold it there now, and pay attention."
    </p>
    <p>
     "All 'dention," said the old black, with both hands placed as desired,
    </p>
    <p>
     vainly wriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both ears in front
    </p>
    <p>
     at one and the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad,
    </p>
    <p>
     that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible; you see that,
    </p>
    <p>
     don't you?  Well, for the future, when you cook another whale-steak
    </p>
    <p>
     for my private table here, the capstan, I'll tell you what to do
    </p>
    <p>
     so as not to spoil it by overdoing.  Hold the steak in one hand,
    </p>
    <p>
     and show a live coal to it with the other; that done, dish it; d'ye hear?
    </p>
    <p>
     And now to-morrow, cook, when we are cutting in the fish, be sure
    </p>
    <p>
     you stand by to get the tips of his fins; have them put in pickle.
    </p>
    <p>
     As for the ends of the flukes, have them soused, cook.  There, now
    </p>
    <p>
     ye may go."
    </p>
    <p>
     But Fleece had hardly got three paces off, when he was recalled.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Cook, give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch. D'ye
    </p>
    <p>
     hear? away you sail then.--Halloa! stop! make a bow before you go.--
    </p>
    <p>
     Avast heaving again!  Whale-balls for breakfast--don't forget."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wish, by gor! whale eat him, 'stead of him eat whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm bressed if he ain't more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself,"
    </p>
    <p>
     muttered the old man, limping away; with which sage ejaculation
    </p>
    <p>
     he went to his hammock.

    <p>
     The Whale as a Dish
    </p>
    <p>
     That mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds
    </p>
    <p>
     his lamp, and, like Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say;
    </p>
    <p>
     this seems so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little
    </p>
    <p>
     into the history and philosophy of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right Whale
    </p>
    <p>
     was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large
    </p>
    <p>
     prices there.  Also, that in Henry VIIIth's time, a certain cook of
    </p>
    <p>
     the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce
    </p>
    <p>
     to be eaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a species
    </p>
    <p>
     of whale.  Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine eating.
    </p>
    <p>
     The meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls,
    </p>
    <p>
     and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls
    </p>
    <p>
     or veal balls.  The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     They had a great porpoise grant from the crown.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would
    </p>
    <p>
     by all hands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much
    </p>
    <p>
     of him; but when you come to sit down before a meat-pie
    </p>
    <p>
     nearly one hundred feet long, it takes away your appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
     Only the most unprejudiced of men like Stubb, nowadays partake
    </p>
    <p>
     of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are not so fastidious.
    </p>
    <p>
     We all know how they live upon whales, and have rare old vintages
    </p>
    <p>
     of prime old train oil.  Zogranda, one of their most famous doctors,
    </p>
    <p>
     recommends strips of blubber for infants, as being exceedingly
    </p>
    <p>
     juicy and nourishing.  And this reminds me that certain Englishmen,
    </p>
    <p>
     who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel--
    </p>
    <p>
     that these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy
    </p>
    <p>
     scraps of whales which had been left ashore after trying
    </p>
    <p>
     out the blubber.  Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps
    </p>
    <p>
     are called "fritters"; which, indeed, they greatly resemble,
    </p>
    <p>
     being brown and crisp, and smelling something like old
    </p>
    <p>
     Amsterdam housewives' dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh.
    </p>
    <p>
     They have such an eatable look that the most self-denying
    </p>
    <p>
     stranger can hardly keep his hands off.
    </p>
    <p>
     But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish,
    </p>
    <p>
     is his exceeding richness.  He is the great prize ox of the sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     too fat to be delicately good.  Look at his hump, which would
    </p>
    <p>
     be as fine eating as the buffalo's (which is esteemed
    </p>
    <p>
     a rare dish), were it not such a solid pyramid of fat.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that is;
    </p>
    <p>
     like the transparent, half jellied, white meat of a cocoanut
    </p>
    <p>
     in the third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply
    </p>
    <p>
     a substitute for butter.  Nevertheless, many whalemen
    </p>
    <p>
     have a method of absorbing it into some other substance,
    </p>
    <p>
     and then partaking of it.  In the long try watches of the night
    </p>
    <p>
     it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their ship-biscuit
    </p>
    <p>
     into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many a good supper have I thus made.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish.
    </p>
    <p>
     The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two plump,
    </p>
    <p>
     whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two large puddings),
    </p>
    <p>
     they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a most delectable mess,
    </p>
    <p>
     in flavor somewhat resembling calves' head, which is quite a dish
    </p>
    <p>
     among some epicures; and every one knows that some young bucks among
    </p>
    <p>
     the epicures, by continually dining upon calves' brains, by and by get to
    </p>
    <p>
     have a little brains of their own, so as to be able to tell a calf's head
    </p>
    <p>
     from their own heads; which, indeed, requires uncommon discrimination.
    </p>
    <p>
     And that is the reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calf's
    </p>
    <p>
     head before him, is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see.
    </p>
    <p>
     The head looks a sort of reproachfully at him, with an "Et
    </p>
    <p>
     tu Brute!" expression.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively
    </p>
    <p>
     unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him
    </p>
    <p>
     with abhorrence; that appears to result, in some way,
    </p>
    <p>
     from the consideration before mentioned:  i.e. that a man
    </p>
    <p>
     should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea, and eat it
    </p>
    <p>
     too by its own light.  But no doubt the first man that ever
    </p>
    <p>
     murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer; perhaps he was hung;
    </p>
    <p>
     and if he had been put on his trial by oxen, he certainly would
    </p>
    <p>
     have been; and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does.
    </p>
    <p>
     Go to the meat-market of a Saturday night and see the crowds
    </p>
    <p>
     of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds.
    </p>
    <p>
     Does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal's jaw?
    </p>
    <p>
     Cannibals? who is not a cannibal?  I tell you it will be more
    </p>
    <p>
     tolerable for the Fejee that salted down a lean missionary
    </p>
    <p>
     in his cellar against a coming famine; it will be more tolerable
    </p>
    <p>
     for that provident Fejee, I say, in the day of judgment,
    </p>
    <p>
     than for thee, civilized and enlightened gourmand, who nailest
    </p>
    <p>
     geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers
    </p>
    <p>
     in thy pate-de-foie-gras.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is
    </p>
    <p>
     adding insult to injury, is it?  Look at your knife-handle, there,
    </p>
    <p>
     my civilized and enlightened gourmand, dining off that roast beef,
    </p>
    <p>
     what is that handle made of?--what but the bones of the brother
    </p>
    <p>
     of the very ox you are eating?  And what do you pick your teeth with,
    </p>
    <p>
     after devouring that fat goose?  With a feather of the same fowl.
    </p>
    <p>
     And with what quill did the Secretary of the Society for the
    </p>
    <p>
     Suppression of Cruelty to Ganders formally indite his circulars?
    </p>
    <p>
     It is only within the last month or two that that society passed
    </p>
    <p>
     a resolution to patronize nothing but steel pens.

    <p>
     The Shark Massacre
    </p>
    <p>
     When in the Southern Fishery a captured Sperm Whale, after long
    </p>
    <p>
     and weary toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not,
    </p>
    <p>
     as a general thing at least, customary to proceed at once to the business
    </p>
    <p>
     of cutting him in.  For that business is an exceedingly laborious one;
    </p>
    <p>
     is not very soon completed; and requires all hands to set about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Therefore, the common usage is to take in all sail; lash the helm a'lee;
    </p>
    <p>
     and then send every one below to his hammock till daylight,
    </p>
    <p>
     with the reservation that, until that time, anchor-watches shall be kept;
    </p>
    <p>
     that is, two and two for an hour, each couple, the crew in rotation
    </p>
    <p>
     shall mount the deck to see that all goes well.
    </p>
    <p>
     But sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific,
    </p>
    <p>
     this plan will not answer at all; because such incalculable
    </p>
    <p>
     hosts of sharks gather round the moored carcase, that were
    </p>
    <p>
     he left so for six hours, say, on a stretch, little more than
    </p>
    <p>
     the skeleton would be visible by morning.  In most other parts
    </p>
    <p>
     of the ocean, however, where these fish do not so largely abound,
    </p>
    <p>
     their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably diminished,
    </p>
    <p>
     by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades,
    </p>
    <p>
     a procedure notwithstanding, which, in some instances,
    </p>
    <p>
     only seems to tickle them into still greater activity.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it was not thus in the present case with the Pequod's sharks;
    </p>
    <p>
     though, to be sure, any man unaccustomed to such sights,
    </p>
    <p>
     to have looked over her side that night, would have almost
    </p>
    <p>
     thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese, and those sharks
    </p>
    <p>
     the maggots in it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after
    </p>
    <p>
     his supper was concluded; and when, accordingly Queequeg
    </p>
    <p>
     and a forecastle seaman came on deck, no small excitement
    </p>
    <p>
     was created among the sharks; for immediately suspending
    </p>
    <p>
     the cutting stages over the side, and lowering three lanterns,
    </p>
    <p>
     so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     these two mariners, darting their long whaling-spades,* kept
    </p>
    <p>
     up an incessant murdering of the sharks, by striking the keen
    </p>
    <p>
     steel deep into their skulls, seemingly their only vital part.
    </p>
    <p>
     But in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts,
    </p>
    <p>
     the marksmen could not always hit their mark; and this brought
    </p>
    <p>
     about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe.
    </p>
    <p>
     They viciously snapped, not only at each other's disembowelments,
    </p>
    <p>
     but like flexible bows, bent round, and bit their own;
    </p>
    <p>
     till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by
    </p>
    <p>
     the same mouth, to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor was this all.  It was unsafe to meddle with the corpses
    </p>
    <p>
     and ghosts of these creatures.  A sort of generic or Pantheistic
    </p>
    <p>
     vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones,
    </p>
    <p>
     after what might be called the individual life had departed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin,
    </p>
    <p>
     one of these sharks almost took poor Queequeg's hand off,
    </p>
    <p>
     when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
     *The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel;
    </p>
    <p>
     is about the bigness of a man's spread hand; and in general shape,
    </p>
    <p>
     corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named; only its
    </p>
    <p>
     sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably narrower
    </p>
    <p>
     than the lower.  This weapon is always kept as sharp as possible;
    </p>
    <p>
     and when being used is occasionally honed, just like a razor.
    </p>
    <p>
     In its socket, a stiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet long,
    </p>
    <p>
     is inserted for a handle.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Queequeg no care what god made him shark," said the savage,
    </p>
    <p>
     agonizingly lifting his hand up and down; "wedder Fejee god or
    </p>
    <p>
     Nantucket god; but de god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin."

     CHAPTER 67

    <p>
     Cutting In
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed!
    </p>
    <p>
     Ex officio professors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ivory Pequod was turned into what seemed a shamble;
    </p>
    <p>
     every sailor a butcher.  You would have thought we were offering
    </p>
    <p>
     up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other ponderous
    </p>
    <p>
     things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green,
    </p>
    <p>
     and which no single man can possibly lift--this vast bunch of grapes
    </p>
    <p>
     was swayed up to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower
    </p>
    <p>
     mast-head, the strongest point anywhere above a ship's deck.
    </p>
    <p>
     The end of the hawser-like rope winding through these intricacies,
    </p>
    <p>
     was then conducted to the windlass, and the huge lower block
    </p>
    <p>
     of the tackles was swung over the whale; to this block the great
    </p>
    <p>
     blubber hook, weighing some one hundred pounds, was attached.
    </p>
    <p>
     And now suspended in stages over the side, Starbuck and Stubb,
    </p>
    <p>
     the mates, armed with their long spades, began cutting
    </p>
    <p>
     a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just above
    </p>
    <p>
     the nearest of the two side-fins. This done, a broad,
    </p>
    <p>
     semicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is inserted,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus,
    </p>
    <p>
     now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass.
    </p>
    <p>
     When instantly, the entire ship careens over on her side; every bolt
    </p>
    <p>
     in her starts like the nailheads of an old house in frosty weather;
    </p>
    <p>
     she trembles, quivers, and nods her frighted mast-heads to the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
     More and more she leans over to the whale, while every gasping heave
    </p>
    <p>
     of the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows;
    </p>
    <p>
     till at last, a swift, startling snap is heard; with a great
    </p>
    <p>
     swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it
    </p>
    <p>
     the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind
    </p>
    <p>
     does an orange, so is it stripped off from the body precisely
    </p>
    <p>
     as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually
    </p>
    <p>
     keeps the whale rolling over and over in the water, and as
    </p>
    <p>
     the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the line
    </p>
    <p>
     called the "scarf," simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck
    </p>
    <p>
     and Stubb, the mates; and just as fast as it is thus peeled off,
    </p>
    <p>
     and indeed by that very act itself, it is all the time being hoisted
    </p>
    <p>
     higher and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the main-top;
    </p>
    <p>
     the men at the windlass then cease heaving, and for a moment
    </p>
    <p>
     or two the prodigious blood-dripping mass sways to and fro
    </p>
    <p>
     as if let down from the sky, and every one present must take
    </p>
    <p>
     good heed to dodge it when it swings, else it may box his ears
    </p>
    <p>
     and pitch him headlong overboard.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon
    </p>
    <p>
     called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices
    </p>
    <p>
     out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass.
    </p>
    <p>
     Into this hole, the end of the second alternating great tackle is then
    </p>
    <p>
     hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for
    </p>
    <p>
     what follows.  Whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands
    </p>
    <p>
     to stand off, once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a
    </p>
    <p>
     few sidelong, desperate, lunging, slicings, severs it completely in twain;
    </p>
    <p>
     so that while the short lower part is still fast, the long upper strip,
    </p>
    <p>
     called a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for lowering.
    </p>
    <p>
     The heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one tackle is
    </p>
    <p>
     peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other is slowly
    </p>
    <p>
     slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway
    </p>
    <p>
     right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber-room. Into
    </p>
    <p>
     this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long
    </p>
    <p>
     blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents.
    </p>
    <p>
     And thus the work proceeds; the two tackles hoisting and lowering
    </p>
    <p>
     simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving, the heavers singing,
    </p>
    <p>
     the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates scarfing, the ship
    </p>
    <p>
     straining, and all hands swearing occasionally, by way of assuaging
    </p>
    <p>
     the general friction.

     The Blanket
    </p>
    <p>
     I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject,
    </p>
    <p>
     the skin of the whale.  I have had controversies about it with
    </p>
    <p>
     experienced whalemen afloat, and learned naturalists ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
     My original opinion remains unchanged; but it is only an opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
     The question is, what and where is the skin of the whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     Already you know what his blubber is.  That blubber is something
    </p>
    <p>
     of the consistence of firm, close-grained beef, but tougher,
    </p>
    <p>
     more elastic and compact, and ranges from eight or ten to twelve
    </p>
    <p>
     and fifteen inches in thickness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature's
    </p>
    <p>
     skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet in point
    </p>
    <p>
     of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption; because you
    </p>
    <p>
     cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale's body
    </p>
    <p>
     but that same blubber; and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal,
    </p>
    <p>
     if reasonably dense, what can that be but the skin?  True, from the
    </p>
    <p>
     unmarred dead body of the whale, you may scrape off with your hand an
    </p>
    <p>
     infinitely thin, transparent substance, somewhat resembling the thinnest
    </p>
    <p>
     shreds of isinglass, only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin;
    </p>
    <p>
     that is, previous to being dried, when it not only contracts and thickens,
    </p>
    <p>
     but becomes rather hard and brittle.  I have several such dried bits,
    </p>
    <p>
     which I use for marks in my whale-books. It is transparent, as I
    </p>
    <p>
     said before; and being laid upon the printed page, I have sometimes
    </p>
    <p>
     pleased myself with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence.
    </p>
    <p>
     At any rate, it is pleasant to read about whales through their
    </p>
    <p>
     own spectacles, as you may say.  But what I am driving at here is this.
    </p>
    <p>
     That same infinitely thin, isinglass substance, which, I admit,
    </p>
    <p>
     invests the entire body of the whale, is not so much to be regarded
    </p>
    <p>
     as the skin of the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to speak; for it
    </p>
    <p>
     were simply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of the tremendous
    </p>
    <p>
     whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a new-born child.
    </p>
    <p>
     But no more of this.
    </p>
    <p>
     Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin,
    </p>
    <p>
     as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk
    </p>
    <p>
     of one hundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that,
    </p>
    <p>
     in quantity, or rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state,
    </p>
    <p>
     is only three fourths, and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea
    </p>
    <p>
     may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere
    </p>
    <p>
     part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Reckoning ten barrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight
    </p>
    <p>
     of only three quarters of the stuff of the whale's skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     In life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among
    </p>
    <p>
     the many marvels he presents.  Almost invariably it is all over obliquely
    </p>
    <p>
     crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array,
    </p>
    <p>
     something like those in the finest Italian line engravings.
    </p>
    <p>
     But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass
    </p>
    <p>
     substance above mentioned, but seem to be seen through it,
    </p>
    <p>
     as if they were engraved upon the body itself.  Nor is this all.
    </p>
    <p>
     In some instances, to the quick, observant eye, those linear marks,
    </p>
    <p>
     as in a veritable engraving, but afford the ground for far
    </p>
    <p>
     other delineations.  These are hieroglyphical; that is, if you call
    </p>
    <p>
     those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics,
    </p>
    <p>
     then that is the proper word to use in the present connexion.
    </p>
    <p>
     By my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale
    </p>
    <p>
     in particular, I was much struck with a plate representing
    </p>
    <p>
     the old Indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic
    </p>
    <p>
     palisades on the banks of the Upper Mississippi.  Like those
    </p>
    <p>
     mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked whale remains undecipherable.
    </p>
    <p>
     This allusion to the Indian rocks reminds me of another thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm Whale
    </p>
    <p>
     presents, he not seldom displays the back, and more especially his flanks,
    </p>
    <p>
     effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance, by reason
    </p>
    <p>
     of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an irregular, random aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
     I should say that those New England rocks on the seacoast,
    </p>
    <p>
     which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping
    </p>
    <p>
     contact with vast floating icebergs--I should say, that those rocks
    </p>
    <p>
     must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular.
    </p>
    <p>
     It also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably
    </p>
    <p>
     made by hostile contact with other whales; for I have most remarked
    </p>
    <p>
     them in the large, full-grown bulls of the species.
    </p>
    <p>
     A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin
    </p>
    <p>
     or blubber of the whale.  It has already been said, that it
    </p>
    <p>
     is stript from him in long pieces, called blanket-pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like most sea-terms, this one is very happy and significant.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real
    </p>
    <p>
     blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho slipt
    </p>
    <p>
     over his head, and skirting his extremity.  It is by reason of this
    </p>
    <p>
     cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep
    </p>
    <p>
     himself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides.
    </p>
    <p>
     What would become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering,
    </p>
    <p>
     icy seas of the North, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout?
    </p>
    <p>
     True, other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters;
    </p>
    <p>
     but these, be it observed, are your cold-blooded, lungless fish,
    </p>
    <p>
     whose very bellies are refrigerators; creatures, that warm
    </p>
    <p>
     themselves under the lee of an iceberg, as a traveller in winter
    </p>
    <p>
     would bask before an inn fire; whereas, like man, the whale has
    </p>
    <p>
     lungs and warm blood.  Freeze his blood, and he dies.  How wonderful
    </p>
    <p>
     is it then--except after explanation--that this great monster,
    </p>
    <p>
     to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man;
    </p>
    <p>
     how wonderful that he should be found at home, immersed to his lips
    </p>
    <p>
     for life in those Arctic waters! where, when seamen fall overboard,
    </p>
    <p>
     they are sometimes found, months afterwards, perpendicularly frozen
    </p>
    <p>
     into the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is found glued in amber.
    </p>
    <p>
     But more surprising is it to know, as has been proved by experiment,
    </p>
    <p>
     that the blood of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a Borneo
    </p>
    <p>
     negro in summer.
    </p>
    <p>
     It does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong
    </p>
    <p>
     individual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare
    </p>
    <p>
     virtue of interior spaciousness.  Oh, man! admire and model
    </p>
    <p>
     thyself after the whale!  Do thou, too, remain warm among ice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Do thou, too, live in this world without being of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Be cool at the equator; keep thy blood fluid at the Pole.  Like the
    </p>
    <p>
     great dome of St. Peter's, and like the great whale, retain, O man!
    </p>
    <p>
     in all seasons a temperature of thine own.
    </p>
    <p>
     But how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things!
    </p>
    <p>
     Of erections, how few are domed like St. Peter's! of creatures,
    </p>
    <p>
     how few vast as the whale!

     The Funeral

    <p>
     Haul in the chains!  Let the carcase go astern!
    </p>
    <p>
     The vast tackles have now done their duty.  The peeled white
    </p>
    <p>
     body of the beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre;
    </p>
    <p>
     though changed in hue, it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is still colossal.  Slowly it floats more and more away,
    </p>
    <p>
     the water round it torn and splashed by the insatiate sharks,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the air above vexed with rapacious flights of screaming fowls,
    </p>
    <p>
     whose beaks are like so many insulting poniards in the whale.The vast
    </p>
    <p>
     white headless phantom floats further and further from the ship,
    </p>
    <p>
     and every rod that it so floats, what seem square roods of sharks
    </p>
    <p>
     and cubic roods of fowls, augment the murderous din.  For hours
    </p>
    <p>
     and hours from the almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky, upon the fair face
    </p>
    <p>
     of the pleasant sea, wafted by the joyous breezes, that great mass
    </p>
    <p>
     of death floats on and on, till lost in infinite perspectives.
    </p>
    <p>
     There's a most doleful and most mocking funeral!
    </p>
    <p>
     The sea-vultures all in pious mourning, the air-sharks all
    </p>
    <p>
     punctiliously in black or speckled.  In life but few of them would
    </p>
    <p>
     have helped the whale, I ween, if peradventure he had needed it;
    </p>
    <p>
     but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, horrible vulturism of earth! from which not the mightiest
    </p>
    <p>
     whale is free.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor is this the end.  Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful
    </p>
    <p>
     ghost survives and hovers over it to scare.  Espied by some
    </p>
    <p>
     timid man-of-war or blundering discovery-vessel from afar,
    </p>
    <p>
     when the distance obscuring the swarming fowls, nevertheless still
    </p>
    <p>
     shows the white mass floating in the sun, and the white spray
    </p>
    <p>
     heaving high against it; straightway the whale's unharming corpse,
    </p>
    <p>
     with trembling fingers is set down in the log--shoals, rocks,
    </p>
    <p>
     and breakers hereabouts:  beware!  And for years afterwards,
    </p>
    <p>
     perhaps, ships shun the place; leaping over it as silly sheep
    </p>
    <p>
     leap over a vacuum, because their leader originally leaped
    </p>
    <p>
     there when a stick was held.  There's your law of precedents;
    </p>
    <p>
     there's your utility of traditions; there's the story of your
    </p>
    <p>
     obstinate survival of old beliefs never bottomed on the earth,
    </p>
    <p>
     and now not even hovering in the air!  There's orthodoxy!
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus, while in the life the great whale's body may have been a real
    </p>
    <p>
     terror to his foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic
    </p>
    <p>
     to a world.

     Are you a believer in ghosts, my friend?  There are other ghosts

     CHAPTER 70

    <p>
     The Sphynx
    </p>
    <p>
     It should not have been omitted that previous to completely
    </p>
    <p>
     stripping the body of the leviathan, he was beheaded.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, the beheading of the Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat,
    </p>
    <p>
     upon which experienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves:
    </p>
    <p>
     and not without reason.
    </p>
    <p>
     Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck;
    </p>
    <p>
     on the contrary, where his head and body seem to join, there, in that
    </p>
    <p>
     very place, is the thickest part of him.  Remember, also, that the surgeon
    </p>
    <p>
     must operate from above, some eight or ten feet intervening between him
    </p>
    <p>
     and his subject, and that subject almost hidden in a discolored, rolling,
    </p>
    <p>
     and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea.  Bear in mind, too, that under
    </p>
    <p>
     these untoward circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh;
    </p>
    <p>
     and in that subterraneous manner, without so much as getting one single
    </p>
    <p>
     peep into the ever-contracting gash thus made, he must skilfully
    </p>
    <p>
     steer clear of all adjacent, interdicted parts, and exactly divide
    </p>
    <p>
     the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull.
    </p>
    <p>
     Do you not marvel, then, at Stubb's boast, that he demanded but ten
    </p>
    <p>
     minutes to behead a sperm whale?
    </p>
    <p>
     When first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there
    </p>
    <p>
     by a cable till the body is stripped.  That done, if it belong
    </p>
    <p>
     to a small whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately
    </p>
    <p>
     disposed of.  But, with a full grown leviathan this is impossible;
    </p>
    <p>
     for the sperm whale's head embraces nearly one third of his
    </p>
    <p>
     entire bulk, and completely to suspend such a burden as that,
    </p>
    <p>
     even by the immense tackles of a whaler, this were as vain a thing
    </p>
    <p>
     as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn in jewellers' scales.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Pequod's whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head
    </p>
    <p>
     was hoisted against the ship's side--about half way out of the sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element.
    </p>
    <p>
     And there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it,
    </p>
    <p>
     by reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head,
    </p>
    <p>
     and every yard-arm on that side projecting like a crane over
    </p>
    <p>
     the waves; there, that blood-dripping head hung to the Pequod's
    </p>
    <p>
     waist like the giant Holofernes's from the girdle of Judith.
    </p>
    <p>
     When this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen
    </p>
    <p>
     went below to their dinner.  Silence reigned over the before
    </p>
    <p>
     tumultuous but now deserted deck.  An intense copper calm,
    </p>
    <p>
     like a universal yellow lotus, was more and more unfolding
    </p>
    <p>
     its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     A short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone
    </p>
    <p>
     from his cabin.  Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused
    </p>
    <p>
     to gaze over the side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he took
    </p>
    <p>
     Stubb's long spade still remaining there after the whale's decapitation
    </p>
    <p>
     and striking it into the lower part of the half-suspended mass,
    </p>
    <p>
     placed its other end crutchwise under one arm, and so stood leaning
    </p>
    <p>
     over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst
    </p>
    <p>
     of so intense a calm, it seemed the Sphynx's in the desert.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Speak, thou vast and venerable head," muttered Ahab,
    </p>
    <p>
     "which, though ungarnished with a beard, yet here and there
    </p>
    <p>
     lookest hoary with mosses; speak, mighty head, and tell us
    </p>
    <p>
     the secret thing that is in thee.  Of all divers, thou hast dived
    </p>
    <p>
     the deepest.  That head upon which the upper sun now gleams,
    </p>
    <p>
     has moved amid this world's foundations.  Where unrecorded
    </p>
    <p>
     names and navies rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot;
    </p>
    <p>
     where in her murderous hold this frigate earth is ballasted
    </p>
    <p>
     with bones of millions of the drowned; there, in that awful
    </p>
    <p>
     water-land, there was thy most familiar home.  Thou hast been
    </p>
    <p>
     where bell or diver never went; hast slept by many a sailor's side,
    </p>
    <p>
     where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thou saw'st the locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship;
    </p>
    <p>
     heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave;
    </p>
    <p>
     true to each other, when heaven seemed false to them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thou saw'st the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from
    </p>
    <p>
     the midnight deck; for hours he fell into the deeper midnight
    </p>
    <p>
     of the insatiate maw; and his murderers still sailed on unharmed--
    </p>
    <p>
     while swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that would
    </p>
    <p>
     have borne a righteous husband to outstretched, longing arms.
    </p>
    <p>
     O head! thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make
    </p>
    <p>
     an infidel of Abraham, and not one syllable is thine!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sail ho!" cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-head.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye?  Well, now, that's cheering," cried Ahab, suddenly erecting
    </p>
    <p>
     himself, while whole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert
    </p>
    <p>
     a better man.--Where away?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Three points on the starboard bow, sir, and bringing down her
    </p>
    <p>
     breeze to us!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Better and better, man.  Would now St. Paul would come
    </p>
    <p>
     along that way, and to my breezelessness bring his breeze!
    </p>
    <p>
     O Nature, and O soul of man! how far beyond all utterance are your
    </p>
    <p>
     linked analogies; not the smallest atom stirs or lives on matter,

     but has its cunning duplicate in mind."

     Hand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came faster

    </p>
    <p>
     By and by, through the glass the stranger's boats and manned

    <p>
     mast-heads proved her a whale-ship. But as she was so far

    <p>
     to windward, and shooting by, apparently making a passage

    <p>
     to some other ground, the Pequod could not hope to reach her.

     the ships of the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal;
    </p>
    <p>
     all which signals being collected in a book with the names
    </p>
    <p>
     of the respective vessels attached, every captain is provided
    </p>
    <p>
     with it.  Thereby, the whale commanders are enabled to recognise
    </p>
    <p>
     each other upon the ocean, even at considerable distance,
    </p>
    <p>
     and with no small facility.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Pequod's signal was at last responded to by the stranger's
    </p>
    <p>
     setting her own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam
    </p>
    <p>
     of Nantucket.  Squaring her yards, she bore down,
    </p>
    <p>
     ranged abeam under the Pequod's lee, and lowered a boat;
    </p>
    <p>
     it soon drew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was being rigged
    </p>
    <p>
     by Starbuck's order to accommodate the visiting captain,
    </p>
    <p>
     the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat's stern
    </p>
    <p>
     in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p>
     It turned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board,
    </p>
    <p>
     and that Mayhew, her captain, was fearful of infecting
    </p>
    <p>
     the Pequod's company.  For, though himself and the boat's crew
    </p>
    <p>
     remained untainted, and though his ship was half a rifle-shot off,
    </p>
    <p>
     and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between;
    </p>
    <p>
     yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land,
    </p>
    <p>
     he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the Pequod.
    </p>
    <p>
     But this did by no means prevent all communications.
    </p>
    <p>
     Preserving an interval of some few yards between itself and
    </p>
    <p>
     the ship, the Jeroboam's boat by the occasional use of its oars
    </p>
    <p>
     contrived to keep parallel to the Pequod, as she heavily forged
    </p>
    <p>
     through the sea (for by this time it blew very fresh), with her
    </p>
    <p>
     main-topsail aback; though, indeed, at times by the sudden onset
    </p>
    <p>
     of a large rolling wave, the boat would be pushed some way ahead;
    </p>
    <p>
     but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Subject to this, and other the like interruptions now and then,
    </p>
    <p>
     a conversation was sustained between the two parties;
    </p>
    <p>
     but at intervals not without still another interruption of a
    </p>
    <p>
     very different sort.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam's boat, was a man of a singular appearance,
    </p>
    <p>
     even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make up
    </p>
    <p>
     all totalities.  He was a small, short, youngish man, sprinkled all
    </p>
    <p>
     over his face with freckles, and wearing redundant yellow hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     A long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped
    </p>
    <p>
     him; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists.
    </p>
    <p>
     A deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     So soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had exclaimed--
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's he! that's he!--the long-togged scaramouch the Town-Ho's company
    </p>
    <p>
     told us of!"  Stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the Jeroboam,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a certain man among her crew, some time previous when the Pequod spoke
    </p>
    <p>
     the Town-Ho. According to this account and what was subsequently learned,
    </p>
    <p>
     it seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful
    </p>
    <p>
     ascendency over almost everybody in the Jeroboam.  His story was this:
    </p>
    <p>
     He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of
    </p>
    <p>
     Neskyeuna Shakers, where he had been a great prophet; in their cracked,
    </p>
    <p>
     secret meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way
    </p>
    <p>
     of a trapdoor, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial,
    </p>
    <p>
     which he carried in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of
    </p>
    <p>
     containing gunpowder, was supposed to be charged with laudanum.
    </p>
    <p>
     A strange, apostolic whim having seized him, he had left Neskyeuna
    </p>
    <p>
     for Nantucket, where, with that cunning peculiar to craziness,
    </p>
    <p>
     he assumed a steady, common sense exterior, and offered himself
    </p>
    <p>
     as a green-hand candidate for the Jeroboam's whaling voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
     They engaged him; but straightway upon the ship's getting
    </p>
    <p>
     out of sight of land, his insanity broke out in a freshet.
    </p>
    <p>
     He announced himself as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded
    </p>
    <p>
     the captain to jump overboard.  He published his manifesto,
    </p>
    <p>
     whereby he set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles
    </p>
    <p>
     of the sea and vicar-general of all Oceanica.  The unflinching
    </p>
    <p>
     earnestness with which he declared these things;--the dark,
    </p>
    <p>
     daring play of his sleepless, excited imagination, and all
    </p>
    <p>
     the preternatural terrors of real delirium, united to invest
    </p>
    <p>
     this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew,
    </p>
    <p>
     with an atmosphere of sacredness.  Moreover, they were afraid of him.
    </p>
    <p>
     As such a man, however, was not of much practical use in the ship,
    </p>
    <p>
     especially as he refused to work except when he pleased,
    </p>
    <p>
     the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him;
    </p>
    <p>
     but apprised that that individual's intention was to land him
    </p>
    <p>
     in the first convenient port, the archangel forthwith opened
    </p>
    <p>
     all his seals and vials--devoting the ship and all hands to
    </p>
    <p>
     unconditional perdition, in case this intention was carried out.
    </p>
    <p>
     So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew,
    </p>
    <p>
     that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him
    </p>
    <p>
     if Gabriel was sent from the ship, not a man of them would remain.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was therefore forced to relinquish his plan.  Nor would they
    </p>
    <p>
     permit Gabriel to be any way maltreated, say or do what he would;
    </p>
    <p>
     so that it came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom
    </p>
    <p>
     of the ship.  The consequence of all this was, that the archangel
    </p>
    <p>
     cared little or nothing for the captain and mates; and since
    </p>
    <p>
     the epidemic had broken out, he carried a higher hand than ever;
    </p>
    <p>
     declaring that the plague, as he called it, was at his sole command;
    </p>
    <p>
     nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sailors, mostly poor devils, cringed, and some of them
    </p>
    <p>
     fawned before him; in obedience to his instructions,
    </p>
    <p>
     sometimes rendering him personal homage, as to a god.
    </p>
    <p>
     Such things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they are true.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect
    </p>
    <p>
     to the measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his
    </p>
    <p>
     measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it is time to return to the Pequod.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I fear not thy epidemic, man," said Ahab from the bulwarks,
    </p>
    <p>
     to Captain Mayhew, who stood in the boat's stern; "come on board."
    </p>
    <p>
     But now Gabriel started to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Think, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious!
    </p>
    <p>
     Beware of the horrible plague!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Gabriel!  Gabriel!" cried Captain Mayhew; "thou must either-"
    </p>
    <p>
     But that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead,
    </p>
    <p>
     and its seethings drowned all speech.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hast thou seen the White Whale?" demanded Ahab, when the
    </p>
    <p>
     boat drifted back.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Think, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk!
    </p>
    <p>
     Beware of the horrible tail!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I tell thee again, Gabriel, that-" But again the boat tore ahead
    </p>
    <p>
     as if dragged by fiends.  Nothing was said for some moments,
    </p>
    <p>
     while a succession of riotous waves rolled by which by one of those
    </p>
    <p>
     occasional caprices of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meantime, the hoisted sperm whale's head jogged about very violently,
    </p>
    <p>
     and Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness
    </p>
    <p>
     than his archangel nature seemed to warrant.
    </p>
    <p>
     When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark
    </p>
    <p>
     story concerning Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent
    </p>
    <p>
     interruptions from Gabriel, whenever his name was mentioned,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with him.
    </p>
    <p>
     It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon
    </p>
    <p>
     speaking a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised
    </p>
    <p>
     of the existence of Moby Dick, and the havoc he had made.
    </p>
    <p>
     Greedily sucking in this intelligence, Gabriel solemnly warned
    </p>
    <p>
     the captain against attacking the White Whale, in case the monster
    </p>
    <p>
     should be seen; in his gibbering insanity, pronouncing the White Whale
    </p>
    <p>
     to be no less a being than the Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers
    </p>
    <p>
     receiving the Bible.  But when, some year or two afterwards,
    </p>
    <p>
     Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the mast-heads, Macey,
    </p>
    <p>
     the chief mate, burned with ardor to encounter him; and the captain
    </p>
    <p>
     himself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity,
    </p>
    <p>
     despite all the archangel's denunciations and forewarnings,
    </p>
    <p>
     Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat.
    </p>
    <p>
     With them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling,
    </p>
    <p>
     and many perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded
    </p>
    <p>
     in getting one iron fast.  Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the
    </p>
    <p>
     main-royal mast-head, was tossing one arm in frantic gestures,
    </p>
    <p>
     and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious
    </p>
    <p>
     assailants of his divinity.  Now, while Macey, the mate,
    </p>
    <p>
     was standing up in his boat's bow, and with all the reckless energy
    </p>
    <p>
     of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo! a broad
    </p>
    <p>
     white shadow rose from the sea; by its quick, fanning motion,
    </p>
    <p>
     temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of furious life,
    </p>
    <p>
     was smitten bodily into the air, and making a long arc in his descent,
    </p>
    <p>
     fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not a chip of the boat was harmed, nor a hair of any oarsman's head;
    </p>
    <p>
     but the mate for ever sank.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the
    </p>
    <p>
     Sperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated;
    </p>
    <p>
     oftener the boat's bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, on which
    </p>
    <p>
     the headsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body.
    </p>
    <p>
     But strangest of all is the circumstance, that in more instances than one,
    </p>
    <p>
     when the body has been recovered, not a single mark of violence is
    </p>
    <p>
     discernible the man being stark dead.
    </p>
    <p>
     The whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly descried
    </p>
    <p>
     from the ship.  Raising a piercing shriek--"The vial! the vial!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further
    </p>
    <p>
     hunting of the whale.  This terrible event clothed the archangel
    </p>
    <p>
     with added influence; because his credulous disciples believed
    </p>
    <p>
     that he had specifically fore-announced it, instead of only making
    </p>
    <p>
     a general prophecy, which any one might have done, and so have
    </p>
    <p>
     chanced to hit one of many marks in the wide margin allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
     He became a nameless terror to the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to him,
    </p>
    <p>
     that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether
    </p>
    <p>
     he intended to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer.
    </p>
    <p>
     To which Ahab answered--"Aye." Straightway, then, Gabriel once more
    </p>
    <p>
     started to his feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
     with downward pointed finger--"Think, think of the blasphemer--
    </p>
    <p>
     dead, and down there!--beware of the blasphemer's end!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, "Captain, I have just
    </p>
    <p>
     bethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy officers,
    </p>
    <p>
     if I mistake not.  Starbuck, look over the bag."
    </p>
    <p>
     Every whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships,
    </p>
    <p>
     whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed,
    </p>
    <p>
     depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus, most letters never reach their mark; and many are only received
    </p>
    <p>
     after attaining an age of two or three years or more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand.  It was
    </p>
    <p>
     sorely tumbled, damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould,
    </p>
    <p>
     in consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of such a letter, Death himself might well have been the post-boy.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can'st not read it?" cried Ahab.  "Give it me, man.  Aye, aye, aye it's
    </p>
    <p>
     but a dim scrawl;--what's this?"  As he was studying it out, Starbuck took
    </p>
    <p>
     a long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the end,
    </p>
    <p>
     to insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the boat,
    </p>
    <p>
     without its coming any closer to the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, "Mr. Har--
    </p>
    <p>
     yes, Mr. Harry--(a woman's pinny hand,--the man's wife,
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll wager)--Aye--Mr. Harry Macey, Ship Jeroboam; why it's Macey,
    </p>
    <p>
     and he's dead!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife," sighed Mayhew;
    </p>
    <p>
     "but let me have it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nay, keep it thyself," cried Gabriel to Ahab; "thou art soon
    </p>
    <p>
     going that way."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Curses throttle thee!" yelled Ahab.  "Captain Mayhew,
    </p>
    <p>
     stand by now to receive it"; and taking the fatal missive
    </p>
    <p>
     from Starbuck's hands, he caught it in the slit of the pole,
    </p>
    <p>
     and reached it over towards the boat.  But as he did so,
    </p>
    <p>
     the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing; the boat drifted
    </p>
    <p>
     a little towards the ship's stern; so that, as if by magic,
    </p>
    <p>
     the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel's eager hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     He clutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling
    </p>
    <p>
     the letter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
     It fell at Ahab's feet.  Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades
    </p>
    <p>
     to give way with their oars, and in that manner the mutinous
    </p>
    <p>
     boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod.
    </p>
    <p>
     As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the jacket of the whale, many strange things were hinted
    </p>
    <p>
     in reference to this wild affair.
    </p>

     CHAPTER 72
    </head>
    <p>
     The Monkey-Rope
    </p>
    <p>
     In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now hands are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is no staying in any one place; for at one and the same
    </p>
    <p>
     time everything has to be done everywhere.  It is much
    </p>
    <p>
     the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
     We must now retrace our way a little.  It was mentioned that upon
    </p>
    <p>
     first breaking ground in the whale's back, the blubber-hook was
    </p>
    <p>
     inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates.
    </p>
    <p>
     But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get
    </p>
    <p>
     fixed in that hole?  It was inserted there by my particular
    </p>
    <p>
     friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to descend
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the monster's back for the special purpose referred to.
    </p>
    <p>
     But in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer
    </p>
    <p>
     shall remain on the whale till the whole tensing or stripping
    </p>
    <p>
     operation is concluded.  The whale, be it observed, lies almost
    </p>
    <p>
     entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated upon.
    </p>
    <p>
     So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the poor
    </p>
    <p>
     harpooneer flounders about, half on the whale and half in the water,
    </p>
    <p>
     as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the Highland costume--
    </p>
    <p>
     a shirt and socks--in which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to
    </p>
    <p>
     uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to observe him,
    </p>
    <p>
     as will presently be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Being the savage's bowsman, that is, the person who pulled
    </p>
    <p>
     the bow-oar in his boat (the second one from forward),
    </p>
    <p>
     it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking
    </p>
    <p>
     that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead whale's back.
    </p>
    <p>
     You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by a long cord.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just so, from the ship's steep side, did I hold Queequeg down
    </p>
    <p>
     there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery
    </p>
    <p>
     a monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted
    </p>
    <p>
     round his waist.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a humorously perilous business for both of us.  For, before we
    </p>
    <p>
     proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at
    </p>
    <p>
     both ends; fast to Queequeg's broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow
    </p>
    <p>
     leather one.  So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time,
    </p>
    <p>
     were wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both
    </p>
    <p>
     usage and honor demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should drag
    </p>
    <p>
     me down in his wake.  So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature united us.
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could I any way get
    </p>
    <p>
     rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed.
    </p>
    <p>
     So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then,
    </p>
    <p>
     that while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly
    </p>
    <p>
     to perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a
    </p>
    <p>
     joint stock company of two; that my free will had received
    </p>
    <p>
     a mortal wound; and that another's mistake or misfortune
    </p>
    <p>
     might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death.
    </p>
    <p>
     Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of interregnum in Providence;
    </p>
    <p>
     for its even-handed equity never could have so gross an injustice.
    </p>
    <p>
     And yet still further pondering--while I jerked him now and
    </p>
    <p>
     then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten
    </p>
    <p>
     to jam him--still further pondering, I say, I saw that this
    </p>
    <p>
     situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal
    </p>
    <p>
     that breathes; only, in most cases, he, one way or other,
    </p>
    <p>
     has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals.
    </p>
    <p>
     If your banker breaks, you snap; if your apothecary by mistake
    </p>
    <p>
     sends you poison in your pills, you die.  True, you may
    </p>
    <p>
     say that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape
    </p>
    <p>
     these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life.
    </p>
    <p>
     But handle Queequeg's monkey-rope heedfully as I would,
    </p>
    <p>
     sometimes he jerked it so, that I came very near sliding overboard.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor could I possibly forget that, do what I would, I only had
    </p>
    <p>
     the management of one end of it.*
    </p>
    <p>
     *The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in
    </p>
    <p>
     the Pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together.
    </p>
    <p>
     This improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less
    </p>
    <p>
     a man than Stubb, in order to afford to the imperilled harpooneer
    </p>
    <p>
     the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance
    </p>
    <p>
     of his monkey-rope holder.
    </p>
    <p>
     I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between
    </p>
    <p>
     the whale and the ship--where he would occasionally fall,
    </p>
    <p>
     from the incessant rolling and swaying of both.
    </p>
    <p>
     But this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night,
    </p>
    <p>
     the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent
    </p>
    <p>
     blood which began to flow from the carcass--the rabid creatures
    </p>
    <p>
     swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.
    </p>
    <p>
     And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed
    </p>
    <p>
     them aside with his floundering feet.  A thing altogether
    </p>
    <p>
     incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom
    </p>
    <p>
     touch a man.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have
    </p>
    <p>
     such a ravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise
    </p>
    <p>
     to look sharp to them.  Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope,
    </p>
    <p>
     with which I now and then jerked the poor fellow from too
    </p>
    <p>
     close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly
    </p>
    <p>
     ferocious shark--he was provided with still another protection.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego and Daggoo
    </p>
    <p>
     continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whale-spades,
    </p>
    <p>
     wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach.
    </p>
    <p>
     This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested
    </p>
    <p>
     and benevolent of them.  They meant Queequeg's best happiness,
    </p>
    <p>
     I admit; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from
    </p>
    <p>
     the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half
    </p>
    <p>
     hidden by the blood-muddled water, those indiscreet spades
    </p>
    <p>
     of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tall.
    </p>
    <p>
     But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping there
    </p>
    <p>
     with that great iron hook--poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed
    </p>
    <p>
     to his Yojo, and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I
    </p>
    <p>
     drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea--
    </p>
    <p>
     what matters it, after all?  Are you not the precious
    </p>
    <p>
     image of each and all of us men in this whaling world?
    </p>
    <p>
     That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those sharks, your foes;
    </p>
    <p>
     those spades, your friends; and what between sharks and spades
    </p>
    <p>
     you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.
    </p>
    <p>
     But courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg.  For now,
    </p>
    <p>
     as with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last
    </p>
    <p>
     climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily
    </p>
    <p>
     trembling over the side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent,
    </p>
    <p>
     consolatory glance hands him--what?  Some hot Cognac?  No! hands him,
    </p>
    <p>
     ye gods! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ginger?  Do I smell ginger?" suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, this must be ginger," peering into the as yet untasted cup.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then standing as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards
    </p>
    <p>
     the astonished steward slowly saying, "Ginger? ginger? and will you have
    </p>
    <p>
     the goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of ginger?
    </p>
    <p>
     Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to kindle a fire
    </p>
    <p>
     in this shivering cannibal?  Ginger!--what the devil is ginger?--
    </p>
    <p>
     sea-coal? firewood?--lucifer matches?--tinder?--gunpowder?--what the devil
    </p>
    <p>
     is ginger, I say, that you offer this cup to our poor Queequeg here."
    </p>
    <p>
     "There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this business,"
    </p>
    <p>
     he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just come
    </p>
    <p>
     from forward.  "Will you look at that kannakin, sir; smell of it,
    </p>
    <p>
     if you please."  Then watching the mate's countenance, he added,
    </p>
    <p>
     "The steward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel
    </p>
    <p>
     and jalap to Queequeg, there, this instant off the whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     Is the steward an apothecary, sir? and may I ask whether this
    </p>
    <p>
     is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life into
    </p>
    <p>
     a half-drowned man?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I trust not," said Starbuck, "it is poor stuff enough."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, aye, steward," cried Stubb, "we'll teach you to drug it harpooneer;
    </p>
    <p>
     none of your apothecary's medicine here; you want to poison us, do ye?
    </p>
    <p>
     You have got out insurances on our lives and want to give way with
    </p>
    <p>
     their oars, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "It was not me," cried Dough-Boy, "it was Aunt Charity that brought
    </p>
    <p>
     the ginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits,
    </p>
    <p>
     but only this ginger-jub--so she called it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run
    </p>
    <p>
     along with ye to the lockers, and get something better.
    </p>
    <p>
     I hope I do no wrong, Mr. Starbuck.  It is the captain's orders--
    </p>
    <p>
     grog for the harpooneer on a whale."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Enough," replied Starbuck, "only don't hit him again, but-"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale
    </p>
    <p>
     or something of that sort; and this fellow's a weazel.
    </p>
    <p>
     What were you about saying, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Only this:  go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself."
    </p>
    <p>
     When Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a
    </p>
    <p>
     sort of tea-caddy in the other.  The first contained strong spirits,
    </p>
    <p>
     and was handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity's gift,
    </p>
    <p>
     and that was freely given to the waves.

     CHAPTER 73
    </head>
    <p>
     Stubb and Flask Kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk Over Him
    </p>
    <p>
     It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale's
    </p>
    <p>
     prodigious head hanging to the Pequod's side.  But we must let it
    </p>
    <p>
     continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the present other matters press, and the best we can do now for
    </p>
    <p>
     the head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually
    </p>
    <p>
     drifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit,
    </p>
    <p>
     gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time
    </p>
    <p>
     lurking anywhere near.  And though all hands commonly disdained
    </p>
    <p>
     the capture of those inferior creatures; and though the Pequod
    </p>
    <p>
     was not commissioned to cruise for them at all, and though she had
    </p>
    <p>
     passed numbers of them near the Crozetts without lowering a boat;
    </p>
    <p>
     yet now that a Sperm Whale had been brought alongside and beheaded,
    </p>
    <p>
     to the surprise of all, the announcement was made that a Right Whale
    </p>
    <p>
     should be captured that day, if opportunity offered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor was this long wanting.  Tall spouts were seen to leeward;
    </p>
    <p>
     and two boats, Stubb's and Flask's, were detached in pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pulling further and further away, they at last became almost
    </p>
    <p>
     invisible to the men at the masthead.  But suddenly in the distance,
    </p>
    <p>
     they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water, and soon after
    </p>
    <p>
     news came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast.
    </p>
    <p>
     An interval passed and the boats were in plain sight, in the act
    </p>
    <p>
     of being dragged right towards the ship by the towing whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     So close did the monster come to the hull, that at first it seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a maelstrom,
    </p>
    <p>
     within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from view,
    </p>
    <p>
     as if diving under the keel.  "Cut, cut!" was the cry from
    </p>
    <p>
     the ship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on the point
    </p>
    <p>
     of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel's side.
    </p>
    <p>
     But having plenty of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding
    </p>
    <p>
     very rapidly, they paid out abundance of rope, and at the same
    </p>
    <p>
     time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical;
    </p>
    <p>
     for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction,
    </p>
    <p>
     and still plied their oars in another, the contending strain
    </p>
    <p>
     threatened to take them under.  But it was only a few feet advance
    </p>
    <p>
     they sought to gain.  And they stuck to it till they did gain it;
    </p>
    <p>
     when instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning
    </p>
    <p>
     along the keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship,
    </p>
    <p>
     suddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and quivering;
    </p>
    <p>
     and so flinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like
    </p>
    <p>
     bits of broken glass on the water, while the whale beyond
    </p>
    <p>
     also rose to sight, and once more the boats were free to fly.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the fagged whale abated his speed, and blindly altering his course,
    </p>
    <p>
     went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him,
    </p>
    <p>
     so that they performed a complete circuit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close
    </p>
    <p>
     flanking him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance;
    </p>
    <p>
     and thus round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the multitudes
    </p>
    <p>
     of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm Whale's body, rushed to
    </p>
    <p>
     the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking at every new gash,
    </p>
    <p>
     as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting fountains that poured
    </p>
    <p>
     from the smitten rock.
    </p>
    <p>
     At last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit,
    </p>
    <p>
     he turned upon his back a corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
     While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes,
    </p>
    <p>
     and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing,
    </p>
    <p>
     some conversation ensued between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,"
    </p>
    <p>
     said Stubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having
    </p>
    <p>
     to do with so ignoble a leviathan.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wants with it?" said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat's bow,
    </p>
    <p>
     "did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale's
    </p>
    <p>
     head hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a Right Whale's
    </p>
    <p>
     on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that ship can
    </p>
    <p>
     never afterwards capsize?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why not?
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah
    </p>
    <p>
     saying so, and he seems to know all about ships' charms.  But I
    </p>
    <p>
     sometimes think he'll charm the ship to no good at last.
    </p>
    <p>
     I don't half like that chap, Stubb.  Did you ever notice how that
    </p>
    <p>
     tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake's head, Stubb?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sink him!  I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance
    </p>
    <p>
     of a dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by;
    </p>
    <p>
     look down there, Flask"--pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion
    </p>
    <p>
     of both hands--"Aye, will I!  Flask, I take that Fedallah to be
    </p>
    <p>
     the devil in disguise.  Do you believe that cock and bull story about
    </p>
    <p>
     his having been stowed away on board ship?  He's the devil, I say.
    </p>
    <p>
     The reason why you don't see his tail, is because he tucks it up
    </p>
    <p>
     out of sight; he carries it coiled away in his pocket, I guess.
    </p>
    <p>
     Blast him! now that I think of it, he's always wanting oakum to stuff
    </p>
    <p>
     into the toes of his boots."
    </p>
    <p>
     "He sleeps in his boots, don't he?  He hasn't got any hammock;
    </p>
    <p>
     but I've seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging."
    </p>
    <p>
     "No doubt, and it's because of his cursed tail; he coils it down,
    </p>
    <p>
     do ye see, in the eye of the rigging."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What's the old man have so much to do with him for?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Striking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bargain?--about what?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White Whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap
    </p>
    <p>
     away his silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort,
    </p>
    <p>
     and then he'll surrender Moby Dick."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Pooh!  Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a
    </p>
    <p>
     wicked one, I tell ye.  Why, they say as how he went a sauntering
    </p>
    <p>
     into the old flag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish easy
    </p>
    <p>
     and gentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old governor was at home.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, he was at home, and asked the devil what he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     The devil, switching his hoofs, up and says, 'I want John.'  'What for?'
    </p>
    <p>
     says the old governor.  'What business is that of yours,' says the devil,
    </p>
    <p>
     getting mad,--'I want to use him.'  'Take him,' says the governor--
    </p>
    <p>
     and by the Lord, Flask, if the devil didn't give John the Asiatic cholera
    </p>
    <p>
     before he got through with him, I'll eat this whale in one mouthful.
    </p>
    <p>
     But look sharp--ain't you all ready there?  Well, then, pull ahead,
    </p>
    <p>
     and let's get the whale alongside."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I think I remember some such story as you were telling," said Flask,
    </p>
    <p>
     when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden
    </p>
    <p>
     towards the ship, "but I can't remember where."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Three Spaniards?  Adventures of those three bloody-minded soldadoes?
    </p>
    <p>
     Did ye read it there, Flask?  I guess ye did?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No:  never saw such a book; heard of it, though.  But now,
    </p>
    <p>
     tell me, Stubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking
    </p>
    <p>
     of just now, was the same you say is now on board the Pequod?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Am I the same man that helped kill this whale?  Doesn't the devil
    </p>
    <p>
     live for ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead?
    </p>
    <p>
     Did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil?
    </p>
    <p>
     And if the devil has a latch-key to get into the admiral's
    </p>
    <p>
     cabin, don't you suppose he can crawl into a porthole?
    </p>
    <p>
     Tell me that, Mr. Flask?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "How old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you see that mainmast there?" pointing to the ship; "well, that's
    </p>
    <p>
     the figure one; now take all the hoops in the Pequod's hold,
    </p>
    <p>
     and string 'em along in a row with that mast, for oughts,
    </p>
    <p>
     do you see; well, that wouldn't begin to be Fedallah's age.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor all the coopers in creation couldn't show hoops enough
    </p>
    <p>
     to make oughts enough."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now,
    </p>
    <p>
     that you meant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, if he's so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is
    </p>
    <p>
     going to live for ever, what good will it do to pitch him overboard--
    </p>
    <p>
     tell me that?
    </p>
    <p>
     "Give him a good ducking, anyhow."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But he'd crawl back."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Duck him again; and keep ducking him."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though--
    </p>
    <p>
     yes, and drown you--what then?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I should like to see him try it; I'd give him such a pair of black eyes
    </p>
    <p>
     that he wouldn't dare to show his face in the admiral's cabin again
    </p>
    <p>
     for a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he lives,
    </p>
    <p>
     and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much.
    </p>
    <p>
     Damn the devil, Flask; do you suppose I'm afraid of the devil?
    </p>
    <p>
     Who's afraid of him, except the old governor who daresn't catch
    </p>
    <p>
     him and put him in double-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him
    </p>
    <p>
     go about kidnapping people; aye, and signed a bond with him,
    </p>
    <p>
     that all the people the devil kidnapped, he'd roast for him?
    </p>
    <p>
     There's a governor!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do I suppose it?  You'll know it before long, Flask.  But I am
    </p>
    <p>
     going now to keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything
    </p>
    <p>
     very suspicious going on, I'll just take him by the nape of his neck,
    </p>
    <p>
     and say--Look here, Beelzebub, you don't do it; and if he makes
    </p>
    <p>
     any fuss, by the Lord I'll make a grab into his pocket for his tail,
    </p>
    <p>
     take it to the capstan, and give him such a wrenching and heaving,
    </p>
    <p>
     that his tail will come short off at the stump--do you see; and then,
    </p>
    <p>
     I rather guess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion,
    </p>
    <p>
     he'll sneak off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail
    </p>
    <p>
     between his legs."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do with it?  Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;--what else?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along, Stubb?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship."
    </p>
    <p>
     The boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side,
    </p>
    <p>
     where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared
    </p>
    <p>
     for securing him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Didn't I tell you so?" said Flask; "yes, you'll soon see this
    </p>
    <p>
     right whale's head hoisted up opposite that parmacety's."
    </p>
    <p>
     In good time, Flask's saying proved true.  As before, the Pequod steeply
    </p>
    <p>
     leaned over towards the sperm whale's head, now, by the counterpoise
    </p>
    <p>
     of both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely strained,
    </p>
    <p>
     you may well believe.  So, when on one side you hoist in Locke's head,
    </p>
    <p>
     you go over that way; but now, on the other side, hoist in Kant's and you
    </p>
    <p>
     come back again; but in very poor plight.  Thus, some minds for ever keep
    </p>
    <p>
     trimming boat.  Oh, ye foolish! throw all these thunder-heads overboard,
    </p>
    <p>
     and then you will float light and right.
    </p>
    <p>
     In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside
    </p>
    <p>
     the ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place
    </p>
    <p>
     as in the case of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance,
    </p>
    <p>
     the head is cut off whole, but in the former the lips
    </p>
    <p>
     and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck,
    </p>
    <p>
     with all the well known black bone attached to what is called
    </p>
    <p>
     the crown-piece. But nothing like this, in the present case,
    </p>
    <p>
     had been done.  The carcases of both whales had dropped astern;
    </p>
    <p>
     and the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying
    </p>
    <p>
     a pair of overburdening panniers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale's head,
    </p>
    <p>
     and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines
    </p>
    <p>
     in his own hand.  And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee
    </p>
    <p>
     occupied his shadow; while, if the Parsee's shadow was there at
    </p>
    <p>
     all it seemed only to blend with, and lengthen Ahab's. As the crew
    </p>
    <p>
     toiled on, Laplandish speculations were bandied among them,
    </p>
    <p>
     concerning all these passing things.

    <p>
     The Sperm Whale's Head - Contrasted View
    </p>
    <p>
     Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together;
    </p>
    <p>
     let us join them, and lay together our own.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and
    </p>
    <p>
     the Right Whale are by far the most noteworthy.  They are the only
    </p>
    <p>
     whales regularly hunted by man.  To the Nantucketer, they present
    </p>
    <p>
     the two extremes of all the known varieties of the whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the external difference between them is mainly observable
    </p>
    <p>
     in their heads; and as a head of each is this moment hanging from
    </p>
    <p>
     the Pequod's side; and as we may freely go from one to the other,
    </p>
    <p>
     by merely stepping across the deck:--where, I should like to know,
    </p>
    <p>
     will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology than here?
    </p>
    <p>
     In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between
    </p>
    <p>
     these heads.  Both are massive enough in all conscience; but, there is a
    </p>
    <p>
     certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale's which the Right Whale's
    </p>
    <p>
     sadly lacks.  There is more character in the Sperm Whale's head.
    </p>
    <p>
     As you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority
    </p>
    <p>
     to him, in point of pervading dignity.  In the present instance, too,
    </p>
    <p>
     this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt color of his head
    </p>
    <p>
     at the summit, giving token of advanced age and large experience.
    </p>
    <p>
     In short, he is what the fishermen technically call a "grey-headed whale."
    </p>
    <p>
     Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads--
    </p>
    <p>
     namely, the two most important organs, the eye and the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Far back on the side of the head, and low down, near the angle
    </p>
    <p>
     of either whale's jaw, if you narrowly search, you will at last see
    </p>
    <p>
     a lashless eye, which you would fancy to be a young colt's eye;
    </p>
    <p>
     so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale's eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
     it is plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead,
    </p>
    <p>
     no more than he can one exactly astern.  In a word, the position
    </p>
    <p>
     of the whale's eyes corresponds to that of a man's ears;
    </p>
    <p>
     and you may fancy, for yourself, how it would fare with you,
    </p>
    <p>
     did you sideways survey objects through your ears.
    </p>
    <p>
     You would find that you could only command some thirty degrees
    </p>
    <p>
     of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight;
    </p>
    <p>
     and about thirty more behind it.  If your bitterest foe were
    </p>
    <p>
     walking straight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day,
    </p>
    <p>
     you would not be able to see him, any more than if he were
    </p>
    <p>
     stealing upon you from behind.  In a word, you would have
    </p>
    <p>
     two backs, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts
    </p>
    <p>
     (side fronts): for what is it that makes the front of a man--
    </p>
    <p>
     what, indeed, but his eyes?
    </p>
    <p>
     Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of,
    </p>
    <p>
     the eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their
    </p>
    <p>
     visual power, so as to produce one picture and not two
    </p>
    <p>
     to the brain; the peculiar position of the whale's eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
     effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head,
    </p>
    <p>
     which towers between them like a great mountain separating
    </p>
    <p>
     two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate
    </p>
    <p>
     the impressions which each independent organ imparts.
    </p>
    <p>
     The whale, therefore, must see one distinct picture on this side,
    </p>
    <p>
     and another distinct picture on that side; while all
    </p>
    <p>
     between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Man may, in effect, be said to look out on the world
    </p>
    <p>
     from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window.
    </p>
    <p>
     But with the whale, these two sashes are separately inserted,
    </p>
    <p>
     making two distinct windows, but sadly impairing the view.
    </p>
    <p>
     This peculiarity of the whale's eyes is a thing always to be
    </p>
    <p>
     borne in mind in the fishery; and to be remembered by the reader
    </p>
    <p>
     in some subsequent scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
     A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning
    </p>
    <p>
     this visual matter as touching the Leviathan.  But I must be content
    </p>
    <p>
     with a hint.  So long as a man's eyes are open in the light,
    </p>
    <p>
     the act of seeing is involuntary; that is, he cannot then
    </p>
    <p>
     help mechanically seeing whatever objects are before him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nevertheless, any one's experience will teach him, that though
    </p>
    <p>
     he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance,
    </p>
    <p>
     it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and completely,
    </p>
    <p>
     to examine any two things--however large or however small--
    </p>
    <p>
     at one and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie
    </p>
    <p>
     side by side and touch each other.  But if you now come
    </p>
    <p>
     to separate these two objects, and surround each by a circle
    </p>
    <p>
     of profound darkness; then, in order to see one of them,
    </p>
    <p>
     in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other
    </p>
    <p>
     will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
     How is it, then, with the whale?  True, both his eyes, in themselves,
    </p>
    <p>
     must simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more comprehensive,
    </p>
    <p>
     combining, and subtle than man's, that he can at the same moment
    </p>
    <p>
     of time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one
    </p>
    <p>
     side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction?
    </p>
    <p>
     If he can, then is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man
    </p>
    <p>
     were able simultaneously to go through the demonstrations
    </p>
    <p>
     of two distinct problems in Euclid.  Nor, strictly investigated,
    </p>
    <p>
     is there any incongruity in this comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
     It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me,
    </p>
    <p>
     that the extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed
    </p>
    <p>
     by some whales when beset by three or four boats; the timidity
    </p>
    <p>
     and liability to queer frights, so common to such whales;
    </p>
    <p>
     I think that all this indirectly proceeds from the helpless
    </p>
    <p>
     perplexity of volition, in which their divided and diametrically
    </p>
    <p>
     opposite powers of vision must involve them.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you are an entire stranger to their race, you might hunt
    </p>
    <p>
     over these two heads for hours, and never discover that organ.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ear has no external leaf whatever; and into the hole itself
    </p>
    <p>
     you can hardly insert a quill, so wondrously minute is it.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is lodged a little behind the eye.  With respect to their ears,
    </p>
    <p>
     this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale
    </p>
    <p>
     and the right.  While the ears of the former has an external opening,
    </p>
    <p>
     that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a membrane,
    </p>
    <p>
     so as to be quite imperceptible from without.
    </p>
    <p>
     Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should
    </p>
    <p>
     see the world through so small an eye, and hear the thunder
    </p>
    <p>
     through an ear which is smaller than a hare's? But if his
    </p>
    <p>
     eyes were broad as the lens of Herschel's great telescope;
    </p>
    <p>
     and his ears capacious as the porches of cathedrals;
    </p>
    <p>
     would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of hearing?
    </p>
    <p>
     Not at all.--Why then do you try to "enlarge" your mind?
    </p>
    <p>
     Subtilize it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand,
    </p>
    <p>
     cant over the sperm whale's head, so, that it may lie bottom up; then,
    </p>
    <p>
     ascending by a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were
    </p>
    <p>
     it not that the body is now completely separated from it, with a lantern
    </p>
    <p>
     we might descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
     But let us hold on here by this tooth, and look about us where we are.
    </p>
    <p>
     What a really beautiful and chaste-looking mouth! from floor
    </p>
    <p>
     to ceiling, lined, or rather papered with a glistening white membrane,
    </p>
    <p>
     glossy as bridal satins.
    </p>
    <p>
     But come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw,
    </p>
    <p>
     which seems like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box,
    </p>
    <p>
     with the hinge at one end, instead of one side.  If you pry it up,
    </p>
    <p>
     so as to get it overhead, and expose its rows of teeth, it seems
    </p>
    <p>
     a terrific portcullis; and such, alas! it proves to many a poor wight
    </p>
    <p>
     in the fishery, upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force.
    </p>
    <p>
     But far more terrible is it to behold, when fathoms down in
    </p>
    <p>
     the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating there suspended,
    </p>
    <p>
     with his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging straight
    </p>
    <p>
     down at right-angles with his body; for all the world like a
    </p>
    <p>
     ship's jibboom.  This whale is not dead; he is only dispirited;
    </p>
    <p>
     out of sorts, perhaps; hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges
    </p>
    <p>
     of his jaw have relaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort
    </p>
    <p>
     of plight, a reproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt,
    </p>
    <p>
     imprecate lock-jaws upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
     In most cases this lower jaw--being easily unhinged by a practised artist--
    </p>
    <p>
     is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting
    </p>
    <p>
     the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone
    </p>
    <p>
     with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles
    </p>
    <p>
     including canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to riding-whips.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board,
    </p>
    <p>
     as if it were an anchor; and when the proper time comes--
    </p>
    <p>
     some few days after the other work--Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego,
    </p>
    <p>
     being all accomplished dentists, are set to drawing teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a keen cutting-spade, Queequeg lances the gums;
    </p>
    <p>
     then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts, and a tackle being
    </p>
    <p>
     rigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as Michigan oxen
    </p>
    <p>
     drag stumps of old oaks out of wild woodlands.  There are
    </p>
    <p>
     generally forty-two teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down,
    </p>
    <p>
     but undecayed; nor filled after our artificial fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
     The jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs, and piled away like joists
    </p>
    <p>
     for building houses.

    <p>
     The Right Whale's Head - Contrasted View
    </p>
    <p>
     Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the the
    </p>
    <p>
     Right Whale's head.
    </p>
    <p>
     As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale's head may be compared
    </p>
    <p>
     to a Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so
    </p>
    <p>
     broadly rounded); so, at a broad view, the Right Whale's head bears
    </p>
    <p>
     a rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Two hundred years ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape
    </p>
    <p>
     to that of a shoemaker's last.  And in this same last or shoe,
    </p>
    <p>
     that old woman of the nursery tale with the swarming brood,
    </p>
    <p>
     might very comfortably be lodged, she and all her progeny.
    </p>
    <p>
     But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume
    </p>
    <p>
     different aspects, according to your point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you stand on its summit and look at these two f-shaped
    </p>
    <p>
     spout-holes, you would take the whole head for an enormous bass viol,
    </p>
    <p>
     and these spiracles, the apertures in its soundingboard.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, again, if you fix your eye upon this strange, crested,
    </p>
    <p>
     comblike incrustation on the top of the mass--this green,
    </p>
    <p>
     barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the "crown,"
    </p>
    <p>
     and the Southern fishers the "bonnet" of the Right Whale;
    </p>
    <p>
     fixing your eyes solely on this, you would take the head for
    </p>
    <p>
     the trunk of some huge oak, with a bird's nest in its crotch.
    </p>
    <p>
     At any rate, when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on
    </p>
    <p>
     this bonnet, such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you;
    </p>
    <p>
     unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the technical term
    </p>
    <p>
     "crown" also bestowed upon it; in which case you will take
    </p>
    <p>
     great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually
    </p>
    <p>
     a diademed king of the sea, whose green crown has been put
    </p>
    <p>
     together for him in this marvellous manner.  But if this whale
    </p>
    <p>
     be a king, he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem.
    </p>
    <p>
     Look at that hanging lower lip! what a huge sulk and pout is
    </p>
    <p>
     there! a sulk and pout, by carpenter's measurement, about twenty
    </p>
    <p>
     feet long and five feet deep; a sulk and pout that will yield
    </p>
    <p>
     you some 500 gallons of oil and more.
    </p>
    <p>
     A great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fissure is about a foot across.  Probably the mother during
    </p>
    <p>
     an important interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast,
    </p>
    <p>
     when earthquakes caused the beach to gape.  Over this lip,
    </p>
    <p>
     as over a slippery threshold, we now slide into the mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon my word were I at Mackinaw, I should take this to be the inside
    </p>
    <p>
     of an Indian wigwam.  Good Lord! is this the road that Jonah went?
    </p>
    <p>
     The roof is about twelve feet high, and runs to a pretty sharp angle,
    </p>
    <p>
     as if there were a regular ridge-pole there; while these ribbed,
    </p>
    <p>
     arched, hairy sides, present us with those wondrous, half vertical,
    </p>
    <p>
     scimitar-shaped slats of whalebone, say three hundred on a side,
    </p>
    <p>
     which depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone,
    </p>
    <p>
     form those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
     The edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres,
    </p>
    <p>
     through which the Right Whale strains the water, and in whose
    </p>
    <p>
     intricacies he retains the small fish, when openmouthed he goes
    </p>
    <p>
     through the seas of brit in feeding time.  In the central blinds
    </p>
    <p>
     of bone, as they stand in their natural order, there are certain
    </p>
    <p>
     curious marks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some whalemen
    </p>
    <p>
     calculate the creature's age, as the age of an oak by its circular rings.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though the certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable,
    </p>
    <p>
     yet it has the savor of analogical probability.  At any rate,
    </p>
    <p>
     if we yield to it, we must grant a far greater age to the Right Whale
    </p>
    <p>
     than at first glance will seem reasonable.
    </p>
    <p>
     In old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies
    </p>
    <p>
     concerning these blinds.  One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous
    </p>
    <p>
     "whiskers" inside of the whale's mouth;* another, "hogs' bristles";
    </p>
    <p>
     a third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language:
    </p>
    <p>
     "There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his
    </p>
    <p>
     upper chop, which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth."
    </p>
    <p>
     *This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker,
    </p>
    <p>
     or rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white
    </p>
    <p>
     hairs on the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sometimes these tufts impart a rather brigandish expression
    </p>
    <p>
     to his otherwise solemn countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
     As every one knows, these same "hogs' bristles,"
    </p>
    <p>
     "fins," "whiskers," "blinds," or whatever you please, furnish to
    </p>
    <p>
     the ladies their busks and other stiffening contrivances.
    </p>
    <p>
     But in this particular, the demand has long been on the decline.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was in Queen Anne's time that the bone was in its glory,
    </p>
    <p>
     the farthingale being then all the fashion.  And as those ancient
    </p>
    <p>
     dames moved about gaily, though in the jaws of the whale, as you
    </p>
    <p>
     may say; even so, in a shower, with the like thoughtlessness,
    </p>
    <p>
     do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection;
    </p>
    <p>
     the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone.
    </p>
    <p>
     But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and,
    </p>
    <p>
     standing in the Right Whale's mouth, look around you afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seeing all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about,
    </p>
    <p>
     would you not think you were inside of the great Haarlem organ,
    </p>
    <p>
     and gazing upon its thousand pipes?  For a carpet to the organ
    </p>
    <p>
     we have a rug of the softest Turkey--the tongue, which is glued,
    </p>
    <p>
     as it were, to the floor of the mouth.  It is very fat
    </p>
    <p>
     and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck.
    </p>
    <p>
     This particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance I
    </p>
    <p>
     should say it was a six-barreler; that is, it will yield you
    </p>
    <p>
     about that amount of oil.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started with--
    </p>
    <p>
     that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely
    </p>
    <p>
     different heads.  To sum up, then:  in the Right Whale's there
    </p>
    <p>
     is no great well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long,
    </p>
    <p>
     slender mandible of a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale's. Nor
    </p>
    <p>
     in the Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of bone;
    </p>
    <p>
     no huge lower lip; and scarcely anything of a tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again, the Right Whale has two external spout-holes,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Sperm Whale only one.
    </p>
    <p>
     Look your last now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they
    </p>
    <p>
     yet lie together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea;
    </p>
    <p>
     the other will not be very long in following.
    </p>
    <p>
     Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale's there?
    </p>
    <p>
     It is the same he died with, only some of the longer wrinkles
    </p>
    <p>
     in the forehead seem now faded away.  I think his broad brow
    </p>
    <p>
     to be full of a prairie-like placidity, born of a speculative
    </p>
    <p>
     indifference as to death.  But mark the other head's expression.
    </p>
    <p>
     See that amazing lower lip, pressed by accident against the vessel's side,
    </p>
    <p>
     so as firmly to embrace the jaw.  Does not this whole head seem
    </p>
    <p>
     to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death?
    </p>
    <p>
     This Right Whale I take to have been a Stoic; the Sperm Whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     a Platonian, who might have taken up Spinoza in his latter years.

    <p>
     The Battering-Ram
    </p>
    <p>
     Ere quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale's head, I would have you,
    </p>
    <p>
     as a sensible physiologist, simply--particularly remark its front aspect,
    </p>
    <p>
     in all its compacted collectedness.  I would have you investigate it
    </p>
    <p>
     now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated,
    </p>
    <p>
     intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power may be lodged there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here is a vital point; for you must either satisfactorily settle
    </p>
    <p>
     this matter with yourself, or for ever remain an infidel as to one
    </p>
    <p>
     of the most appalling, but not the less true events, perhaps anywhere
    </p>
    <p>
     to be found in all recorded history.
    </p>
    <p>
     You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane
    </p>
    <p>
     to the water; you observe that the lower part of that front
    </p>
    <p>
     slopes considerably backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat
    </p>
    <p>
     for the long socket which receives the boom-like lower jaw;
    </p>
    <p>
     you observe that the mouth is entirely under the head,
    </p>
    <p>
     much in the same way, indeed, as though your own mouth were
    </p>
    <p>
     entirely under your chin.  Moreover you observe that the whale
    </p>
    <p>
     has no external nose; and that what nose he has--his spout hole--
    </p>
    <p>
     is on the top of his head; you observe that his eyes and ears
    </p>
    <p>
     are at the sides of his head; nearly one third of his entire
    </p>
    <p>
     length from the front.  Wherefore, you must now have perceived
    </p>
    <p>
     that the front of the Sperm Whale's head is a dead, blind wall,
    </p>
    <p>
     without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p>
     Furthermore, you are now to consider that only in the extreme,
    </p>
    <p>
     lower, backward sloping part of the front of the head, is there
    </p>
    <p>
     the slightest vestige of bone; and not till you get near twenty feet
    </p>
    <p>
     from the forehead do you come to the full cranial development.
    </p>
    <p>
     So that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, though, as will soon be revealed, its contents partly
    </p>
    <p>
     comprise the most delicate oil; yet, you are now to be apprised
    </p>
    <p>
     of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all
    </p>
    <p>
     that apparent effeminacy.  In some previous place I have described
    </p>
    <p>
     to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale, as the rind
    </p>
    <p>
     wraps an orange.  Just so with the head; but with this difference:
    </p>
    <p>
     about the head this envelope, though not so thick is of a
    </p>
    <p>
     boneless toughness, inestimable by any man who has not handled it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The severest pointed harpoon, the sharpest lance darted
    </p>
    <p>
     by the strongest human arm, impotently rebounds from it.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is as though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved
    </p>
    <p>
     with horses' hoofs.  I do not think that any sensation lurks in it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bethink yourself also of another thing.  When two large,
    </p>
    <p>
     loaded Indian-men chance to crowd and crush towards each other
    </p>
    <p>
     in the docks, what do the sailors do?  They do not suspend
    </p>
    <p>
     between them, at the point of coming contact, any merely
    </p>
    <p>
     hard substance, like iron or wood.  No, they hold there a large,
    </p>
    <p>
     round wad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest and toughest
    </p>
    <p>
     of ox-hide. That bravely and uninjured takes the jam which would
    </p>
    <p>
     have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow-bars. By
    </p>
    <p>
     itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive at.
    </p>
    <p>
     But supplementary to this, it has hypothetically occurred to me,
    </p>
    <p>
     that as ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder
    </p>
    <p>
     in them, capable, at will, of distension or contraction;
    </p>
    <p>
     and as the Sperm Whale, as far as I know, has no such provision
    </p>
    <p>
     in him; considering, too, the otherwise inexplicable manner
    </p>
    <p>
     in which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface,
    </p>
    <p>
     and anon swims with it high elevated out of the water;
    </p>
    <p>
     considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope;
    </p>
    <p>
     considering the unique interior of his head; it has
    </p>
    <p>
     hypothetically occurred to me, I say, that those mystical
    </p>
    <p>
     lung-celled honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto
    </p>
    <p>
     unknown and unsuspected connexion with the outer air, so as
    </p>
    <p>
     to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and contraction.
    </p>
    <p>
     If this be so, fancy the irresistibleness of that might, to which
    </p>
    <p>
     the most impalpable and destructive of all elements contributes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, mark.  Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, uninjurable wall,
    </p>
    <p>
     and this most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a mass
    </p>
    <p>
     of tremendous life, only to be adequately estimated as piled wood is--
    </p>
    <p>
     by the cord; and all obedient to one volition, as the smallest insect.
    </p>
    <p>
     So that when I shall hereafter detail to you all the specialities and
    </p>
    <p>
     concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster;
    </p>
    <p>
     when I shall show you some of his more inconsiderable braining feats;
    </p>
    <p>
     I trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity, and be ready
    </p>
    <p>
     to abide by this; that though the Sperm Whale stove a passage through
    </p>
    <p>
     the Isthmus of Darien, and mixed the Atlantic with the Pacific, you would
    </p>
    <p>
     not elevate one hair of your eye-brow. For unless you own the whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in Truth.  But clear
    </p>
    <p>
     Truth is a thing for salamander giants only to encounter; how small
    </p>
    <p>
     the chances for the provincials then?  What befell the weakling youth
    </p>
    <p>
     lifting the dread goddess's veil at Lais?

     Now comes the Baling of the Case.  But to comprehend it aright,
    </p>
    <p>
     you must know something of the curious internal structure
    </p>
    <p>
     of the thing operated upon.
    </p>
    <p>
     Regarding the Sperm Whale's head as a solid oblong, you may,
    </p>
    <p>
     on an inclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof
    </p>
    <p>
     the lower is the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward
    </p>
    <p>
     end forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin,
    </p>
    <p>
     and then you have two almost equal parts, which before were naturally
    </p>
    <p>
     divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance.
    </p>
    <p>
     *Quoin is not a Euclidean term.  It belongs to the pure
    </p>
    <p>
     nautical mathematics.  I know not that it has been defined before.
    </p>
    <p>
     A quoin is a solid which differs from a wedge in having
    </p>
    <p>
     its sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one side,
    </p>
    <p>
     instead of the mutual tapering of both sides.
    </p>
    <p>
     The lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense
    </p>
    <p>
     honeycomb of oil, formed by the crossing and recrossing,
    </p>
    <p>
     into ten thousand infiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres
    </p>
    <p>
     throughout its whole extent.  The upper part, known as the Case,
    </p>
    <p>
     may be regarded as the great Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front,
    </p>
    <p>
     so the whale's vast plaited forehead forms innumerable strange
    </p>
    <p>
     devices for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun.
    </p>
    <p>
     Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished
    </p>
    <p>
     with the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys,
    </p>
    <p>
     so the tun of the whale contains by far the most precious
    </p>
    <p>
     of all his oily vintages; namely, the highly-prized spermaceti,
    </p>
    <p>
     in its absolutely pure, limpid, and odoriferous state.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part
    </p>
    <p>
     of the creature.  Though in life it remains perfectly fluid,
    </p>
    <p>
     yet, upon exposure to the air, after death, it soon begins
    </p>
    <p>
     to concrete; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots,
    </p>
    <p>
     as when the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water.
    </p>
    <p>
     A large whale's case generally yields about five hundred
    </p>
    <p>
     gallons of sperm, though from unavoidable circumstances,
    </p>
    <p>
     considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and dribbles away,
    </p>
    <p>
     or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business
    </p>
    <p>
     of securing what you can.
    </p>
    <p>
     I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun
    </p>
    <p>
     was coated within, but in superlative richness that coating could
    </p>
    <p>
     not possibly have compared with the silken pearl-colored membrane,
    </p>
    <p>
     like the lining of a fine pelisse, forming the inner surface
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Sperm Whale's case.
    </p>
    <p>
     It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale
    </p>
    <p>
     embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head;
    </p>
    <p>
     and since--as has been elsewhere set forth--the head embraces
    </p>
    <p>
     one third of the whole length of the creature, then setting
    </p>
    <p>
     that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     you have more than twenty-six feet for the depth of the tun,
    </p>
    <p>
     when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship's side.
    </p>
    <p>
     As in decapitating the whale, the operator's instrument is
    </p>
    <p>
     brought close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently
    </p>
    <p>
     forced into the spermaceti magazine; he has, therefore, to be
    </p>
    <p>
     uncommonly heedful, lest a careless, untimely stroke should invade
    </p>
    <p>
     the sanctuary and wastingly let out its invaluable contents.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is this decapitated end of the head, also, which is at
    </p>
    <p>
     last elevated out of the water, and retained in that position
    </p>
    <p>
     by the enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen combinations,
    </p>
    <p>
     on one side, make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous and--
    </p>
    <p>
     in this particular instance--almost fatal operation whereby
    </p>
    <p>
     the Sperm Whale's great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.

    <p>
     Cistern and Buckets
    </p>
    <p>
     Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his
    </p>
    <p>
     erect posture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm,
    </p>
    <p>
     to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun.  He has
    </p>
    <p>
     carried with him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of
    </p>
    <p>
     only two parts, travelling through a single-sheaved block.
    </p>
    <p>
     Securing this block, so that it hangs down from the yard-arm,
    </p>
    <p>
     he swings one end of the rope, till it is caught and firmly held
    </p>
    <p>
     by a hand on the deck.  Then, hand-over-hand, down the other part,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Indian drops through the air, till dexterously he lands
    </p>
    <p>
     on the summit of the head.  There--still high elevated above
    </p>
    <p>
     the rest of the company, to whom he vivaciously cries--
    </p>
    <p>
     he seems some Turkish Muezzin calling the good people to prayers
    </p>
    <p>
     from the top of a tower.  A short-handled sharp spade being
    </p>
    <p>
     sent up to him, he diligently searches for the proper place
    </p>
    <p>
     to begin breaking into the Tun.  In this business he proceeds
    </p>
    <p>
     very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house,
    </p>
    <p>
     sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time this cautious search is over, a stout ironbound bucket,
    </p>
    <p>
     precisely like a well-bucket, has been attached to one end
    </p>
    <p>
     of the whip; while the other end, being stretched across
    </p>
    <p>
     the deck, is there held by two or three alert hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the Indian,
    </p>
    <p>
     to whom another person has reached up a very long pole.
    </p>
    <p>
     Inserting this pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward
    </p>
    <p>
     guides the bucket into the Tun, till it entirely disappears;
    </p>
    <p>
     then giving the word to the seamen at the whip, up comes the
    </p>
    <p>
     bucket again, all bubbling like a dairy-maid's pail of new milk.
    </p>
    <p>
     Carefully lowered from its height, the full-freighted vessel is
    </p>
    <p>
     caught by an appointed hand, and quickly emptied into a large tub.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then remounting aloft, it again goes through the same round
    </p>
    <p>
     until the deep cistern will yield no more.  Towards the end,
    </p>
    <p>
     Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder, and deeper
    </p>
    <p>
     and deeper into the Tun, until some twenty feet of the pole
    </p>
    <p>
     have gone down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way;
    </p>
    <p>
     several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at
    </p>
    <p>
     once a queer accident happened.  Whether it was that Tashtego,
    </p>
    <p>
     that wild Indian, was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment
    </p>
    <p>
     his one-handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head;
    </p>
    <p>
     or whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy;
    </p>
    <p>
     or whether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out so,
    </p>
    <p>
     without stating his particular reasons; how it was exactly,
    </p>
    <p>
     there is no telling now; but, on a sudden, as the eightieth
    </p>
    <p>
     or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up--my God! poor Tashtego--
    </p>
    <p>
     like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well,
    </p>
    <p>
     dropped head-foremost down into this great Tun of Heidelburgh,
    </p>
    <p>
     and with a horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of sight!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Man overboard!" cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation
    </p>
    <p>
     first came to his senses.  "Swing the bucket this way!"
    </p>
    <p>
     and putting one foot into it, so as the better to secure his
    </p>
    <p>
     slippery hand-hold on the whip itself the hoisters ran him high up
    </p>
    <p>
     to the top of the head, almost before Tashtego could have reached
    </p>
    <p>
     its interior bottom.  Meantime, there was a terrible tumult.
    </p>
    <p>
     Looking over the side, they saw the before lifeless head throbbing
    </p>
    <p>
     and heaving just below the surface of the sea, as if that moment
    </p>
    <p>
     seized with some momentous idea; whereas it was only the poor
    </p>
    <p>
     Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous
    </p>
    <p>
     depth to which he had sunk.
    </p>
    <p>
     At this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing
    </p>
    <p>
     the whip--which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles--
    </p>
    <p>
     a sharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror
    </p>
    <p>
     of all, one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out,
    </p>
    <p>
     and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung,
    </p>
    <p>
     till the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg.
    </p>
    <p>
     The one remaining hook, upon which the entire strain now depended,
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed every instant to be on the point of giving way; an event
    </p>
    <p>
     still more likely from the violent motions of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come down, come down!" yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one hand
    </p>
    <p>
     holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop,
    </p>
    <p>
     he would still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the foul line,
    </p>
    <p>
     rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well, meaning that
    </p>
    <p>
     the buried harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted out.
    </p>
    <p>
     "In heaven's name, man," cried Stubb, "are you ramming
    </p>
    <p>
     home a cartridge there?--Avast!  How will that help him;
    </p>
    <p>
     jamming that iron-bound bucket on top of his head?
    </p>
    <p>
     Avast, will ye!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Stand clear of the tackle!" cried a voice like the bursting
    </p>
    <p>
     of a rocket.
    </p>
    <p>
     Almost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous
    </p>
    <p>
     mass dropped into the sea, like Niagara's Table-Rock into
    </p>
    <p>
     the whirlpool; the suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it,
    </p>
    <p>
     to far down her glittering copper; and all caught their breath,
    </p>
    <p>
     as half swinging--now over the sailors' heads, and now
    </p>
    <p>
     over the water--Daggoo, through a thick mist of spray,
    </p>
    <p>
     was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles, while poor,
    </p>
    <p>
     buried-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom
    </p>
    <p>
     of the sea!  But hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away,
    </p>
    <p>
     when a naked figure with a boardingsword in his hand,
    </p>
    <p>
     was for one swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks.
    </p>
    <p>
     The next, a loud splash announced that my brave Queequeg had
    </p>
    <p>
     dived to the rescue.  One packed rush was made to the side,
    </p>
    <p>
     and every eye counted every ripple, as moment followed moment,
    </p>
    <p>
     and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some hands now jumped into a boat alongside, and pushed a little
    </p>
    <p>
     off from the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ha! ha!" cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet,
    </p>
    <p>
     swinging perch overhead; and looking further off from the side,
    </p>
    <p>
     we saw an arm thrust upright from the blue waves; a sight strange
    </p>
    <p>
     to see, as an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Both! both!--it is both!"-cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout;
    </p>
    <p>
     and soon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand,
    </p>
    <p>
     and with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian.  Drawn into
    </p>
    <p>
     the waiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego
    </p>
    <p>
     was long in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished?  Why, diving after
    </p>
    <p>
     the slowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made
    </p>
    <p>
     side lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there;
    </p>
    <p>
     then dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards
    </p>
    <p>
     and upwards, and so hauled out our poor Tash by the head.
    </p>
    <p>
     He averred, that upon first thrusting in for him, a leg was presented;
    </p>
    <p>
     but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be, and might
    </p>
    <p>
     occasion great trouble;--he had thrust back the leg, and by a
    </p>
    <p>
     dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a somerset upon the Indian;
    </p>
    <p>
     so that with the next trial, he came forth in the good old way--
    </p>
    <p>
     head foremost.  As for the great head itself, that was doing
    </p>
    <p>
     as well as could be expected.
    </p>
    <p>
     And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of Queequeg,
    </p>
    <p>
     the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was successfully
    </p>
    <p>
     accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward and apparently
    </p>
    <p>
     hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
     Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing,
    </p>
    <p>
     riding and rowing.
    </p>
    <p>
     I know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header's will be sure
    </p>
    <p>
     to seem incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have
    </p>
    <p>
     either seen or heard of some one's falling into a cistern ashore;
    </p>
    <p>
     an accident which not seldom happens, and with much less reason too
    </p>
    <p>
     than the Indian's, considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Sperm Whale's well.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this?
    </p>
    <p>
     We thought the tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     was the lightest and most corky part about him; and yet thou makest
    </p>
    <p>
     it sink in an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     We have thee there.  Not at all, but I have ye; for at the time poor
    </p>
    <p>
     Tash fell in, the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents,
    </p>
    <p>
     leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the well--a double welded,
    </p>
    <p>
     hammered substance, as I have before said, much heavier than
    </p>
    <p>
     the sea water, and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present
    </p>
    <p>
     instance materially counteracted by the other parts of the head remaining
    </p>
    <p>
     undetached from it, so that it sank very slowly and deliberately indeed,
    </p>
    <p>
     affording Queequeg a fair chance for performing his agile obstetrics
    </p>
    <p>
     on the run, as you may say.  Yes, it was a running delivery,
    </p>
    <p>
     so it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very
    </p>
    <p>
     precious perishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest
    </p>
    <p>
     of fragrant spermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in
    </p>
    <p>
     the secret inner chamber and sanctum sanctorum of the whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     Only one sweeter end can readily be recalled--the delicious
    </p>
    <p>
     death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking honey in the crotch
    </p>
    <p>
     of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of it, that leaning
    </p>
    <p>
     too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died embalmed.
    </p>
    <p>
     How many, think ye, have likewise fallen into Plato's honey head,
    </p>
    <p>
     and sweetly perished there?

    <p>
     Therefore, though I am but ill qualified for a pioneer, in the application
    </p>
    <p>
     of these two semi-sciences to the whale, I will do my endeavor.
    </p>
    <p>
     I try all things; I achieve what I can.
    </p>
    <p>
     Physiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature.
    </p>
    <p>
     He has no proper nose.  And since the nose is the central
    </p>
    <p>
     and most conspicuous of the features; and since it perhaps
    </p>
    <p>
     most modifies and finally controls their combined expression;
    </p>
    <p>
     hence it would seem that its entire absence, as an external appendage,
    </p>
    <p>
     must very largely affect the countenance of the whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     For as in landscape gardening, a spire, cupola, monument,
    </p>
    <p>
     or tower of some sort, is deemed almost indispensable to
    </p>
    <p>
     the completion of the scene; so no face can be physiognomically
    </p>
    <p>
     in keeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dash the nose from Phidias's marble Jove, and what a
    </p>
    <p>
     sorry remainder!  Nevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty
    </p>
    <p>
     a magnitude, all his proportions are so stately, that the same
    </p>
    <p>
     deficiency which in the sculptured Jove were hideous,
    </p>
    <p>
     in him is no blemish at all.  Nay, it is an added grandeur.
    </p>
    <p>
     A nose to the whale would have been impertinent.
    </p>
    <p>
     As on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head
    </p>
    <p>
     in your jollyboat, your noble conceptions of him are never
    </p>
    <p>
     insulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled.
    </p>
    <p>
     A pestilent conceit, which so often will insist upon obtruding
    </p>
    <p>
     even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne.
    </p>
    <p>
     In some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view
    </p>
    <p>
     to be had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
     This aspect is sublime.
    </p>
    <p>
     In thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with
    </p>
    <p>
     the morning.  In the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the bull
    </p>
    <p>
     has a touch of the grand in it.  Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles,
    </p>
    <p>
     the elephant's brow is majestic.  Human or animal, the mystical
    </p>
    <p>
     brow is as that great golden seal affixed by the German Emperors
    </p>
    <p>
     to their decrees.  It signifies--"God: done this day by my hand."
    </p>
    <p>
     But in most creatures, nay in man himself, very often the brow
    </p>
    <p>
     is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line.
    </p>
    <p>
     Few are the foreheads which like Shakespeare's or Melancthon's rise
    </p>
    <p>
     so high, and descend so low, that the eyes themselves seem clear, eternal,
    </p>
    <p>
     tideless mountain lakes; and all above them in the forehead's wrinkles,
    </p>
    <p>
     you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there to drink,
    </p>
    <p>
     as the Highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer.
    </p>
    <p>
     But in the great Sperm Whale, this high and mighty god-like dignity
    </p>
    <p>
     inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified, that gazing on it,
    </p>
    <p>
     in that full front view, you feel the Deity and the dread powers
    </p>
    <p>
     more forcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature.
    </p>
    <p>
     For you see no one point precisely; not one distinct feature is revealed;
    </p>
    <p>
     no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face; he has none, proper; nothing but
    </p>
    <p>
     that one broad firmament of a forehead, pleated with riddles;
    </p>
    <p>
     dumbly lowering with the doom of boats, and ships, and men.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish; though that way
    </p>
    <p>
     viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so.  In profile,
    </p>
    <p>
     you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic depression
    </p>
    <p>
     in the forehead's middle, which, in a man, is Lavater's mark of genius.
    </p>
    <p>
     But how?  Genius in the Sperm Whale?  Has the Sperm Whale
    </p>
    <p>
     ever written a book, spoken a speech?  No, his great genius
    </p>
    <p>
     is declared in his doing nothing particular to prove it.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is moreover declared in his pyramidical silence.  And this reminds
    </p>
    <p>
     me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to the young Orient World,
    </p>
    <p>
     he would have been deified by their child-magian thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
     They deified the crocodile of the Nile, because the crocodile
    </p>
    <p>
     is tongueless; and the Sperm Whale has no tongue, or at least
    </p>
    <p>
     it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable of protrusion.
    </p>
    <p>
     If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall lure
    </p>
    <p>
     back to their birth-right, the merry May-day gods of old;
    </p>
    <p>
     and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky;
    </p>
    <p>
     in the now unhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to Jove's
    </p>
    <p>
     high seat, the great Sperm Whale shall lord it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics.
    </p>
    <p>
     But there is no Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every
    </p>
    <p>
     man's and every being's face.  Physiognomy, like every other
    </p>
    <p>
     human science, is but a passing fable.  If then, Sir William Jones,
    </p>
    <p>
     who read in thirty languages, could not read the simplest
    </p>
    <p>
     peasant's face in its profounder and more subtle meanings,
    </p>
    <p>
     how may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Sperm Whale's brow?  I but put that brow before you.
    </p>
    <p>
     Read if it if you can.

    <p>
     The Nut
    </p>
    <p>
     If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist his
    </p>
    <p>
     brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet
    </p>
    <p>
     in length.  Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull
    </p>
    <p>
     is as the side view of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout
    </p>
    <p>
     on a level base.  But in life--as we have elsewhere seen--this inclined
    </p>
    <p>
     plane is angularly filled up, and almost squared by the enormous
    </p>
    <p>
     superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm.  At the high end the skull
    </p>
    <p>
     forms a crater to bed that part of the mass; while under the long floor
    </p>
    <p>
     of this crater--in another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length
    </p>
    <p>
     and as many in depth reposes the mere handful of this monster's brain.
    </p>
    <p>
     The brain is at least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life;
    </p>
    <p>
     it is hidden away behind its vast outworks, like the innermost citadel
    </p>
    <p>
     within the amplified fortifications of Quebec.  So like a choice casket
    </p>
    <p>
     is it secreted in him, that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily
    </p>
    <p>
     deny that the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable
    </p>
    <p>
     semblance of one formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lying in strange folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions,
    </p>
    <p>
     it seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard
    </p>
    <p>
     that mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan,
    </p>
    <p>
     in the creature's living intact state, is an entire delusion.
    </p>
    <p>
     As for his true brain, you can then see no indications of it,
    </p>
    <p>
     nor feel any.  The whale, like all things that are mighty,
    </p>
    <p>
     wears a false brow to the common world.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear
    </p>
    <p>
     view of its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck
    </p>
    <p>
     by its resemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation,
    </p>
    <p>
     and from the same point of view.  Indeed, place this reversed skull
    </p>
    <p>
     (scaled down to the human magnitude) among a plate of men's skulls,
    </p>
    <p>
     and you would involuntarily confound it with them; and remarking
    </p>
    <p>
     the depressions on one part of its summit, in phrenological phrase
    </p>
    <p>
     you would say--This man had no self-esteem, and no veneration.
    </p>
    <p>
     And by those negations, considered along with the affirmative fact
    </p>
    <p>
     of his prodigious bulk and power, you can best form to yourself
    </p>
    <p>
     the truest, though not the most exhilarating conception of what
    </p>
    <p>
     the most exalted potency is.
    </p>
    <p>
     But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale's proper brain,
    </p>
    <p>
     you deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I
    </p>
    <p>
     have another idea for you.  If you attentively regard almost
    </p>
    <p>
     any quadruped's spine, you will be struck with the resemblance
    </p>
    <p>
     of its vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls,
    </p>
    <p>
     all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is a German conceit, that the vertebrae are absolutely
    </p>
    <p>
     undeveloped skulls.  But the curious external resemblance,
    </p>
    <p>
     I take it the Germans were not the first men to perceive.
    </p>
    <p>
     A foreign friend once pointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe
    </p>
    <p>
     he had slain, and with the vertebrae of which he was inlaying,
    </p>
    <p>
     in a sort of basso-relieve, the beaked prow of his canoe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, I consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important
    </p>
    <p>
     thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum
    </p>
    <p>
     through the spinal canal.  For I believe that much of a
    </p>
    <p>
     man's character will be found betokened in his backbone.
    </p>
    <p>
     I would rather feel your spine than your skull, whoever you are.
    </p>
    <p>
     A thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul.
    </p>
    <p>
     I rejoice in my spine, as in the firm audacious staff of that flag
    </p>
    <p>
     which I fling half out to the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale.  His cranial
    </p>
    <p>
     cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra
    </p>
    <p>
     the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being eight
    </p>
    <p>
     in height, and of a triangular figure with the base downwards.
    </p>
    <p>
     As it passes through the remaining vertebrae the canal tapers in size,
    </p>
    <p>
     but for a considerable distance remains of large capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, of course, this canal is filled with much the same strangely
    </p>
    <p>
     fibrous substance--the spinal cord--as the brain; and directly
    </p>
    <p>
     communicates with the brain.  And what is still more, for many feet
    </p>
    <p>
     after emerging from the brain's cavity, the spinal cord remains
    </p>
    <p>
     of an undecreasing girth, almost equal to that of the brain.
    </p>
    <p>
     Under all these circumstances, would it be unreasonable to survey and map
    </p>
    <p>
     out the whale's spine phrenologically?  For, viewed in this light,
    </p>
    <p>
     the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is more than
    </p>
    <p>
     compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord.
    </p>
    <p>
     But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists,
    </p>
    <p>
     I would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference
    </p>
    <p>
     to the Sperm Whale's hump.  This august hump, if I mistake not,
    </p>
    <p>
     rises over one of the larger vertebrae, and is, therefore, in some sort,
    </p>
    <p>
     the outer convex mould of it.  From its relative situation then,
    </p>
    <p>
     I should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness
    </p>
    <p>
     in the Sperm Whale.  And that the great monster is indomitable,
    </p>
    <p>
     you will yet have reason to know.

    <p>
     The Pequod Meets The Virgin
    </p>
    <p>
     The predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship
    </p>
    <p>
     Jungfrau, Derick De Deer, master, of Bremen.
    </p>
    <p>
     At one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch
    </p>
    <p>
     and Germans are now among the least; but here and there at very wide
    </p>
    <p>
     intervals of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet
    </p>
    <p>
     with their flag in the Pacific.
    </p>
    <p>
     For some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects.
    </p>
    <p>
     While yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and dropping
    </p>
    <p>
     a boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standing
    </p>
    <p>
     in the bows instead of the stern.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What has he in his hand there?" cried Starbuck, pointing to something
    </p>
    <p>
     wavingly held by the German.  "Impossible!--a lamp-feeder!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not that," said Stubb, "no, no, it's a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck;
    </p>
    <p>
     he's coming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don't you see
    </p>
    <p>
     that big tin can there alongside of him?--that's his boiling water.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh! he's all right, is the Yarman."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Go along with you," cried Flask, "it's a lamp-feeder and an oil-can.
    </p>
    <p>
     He's out of oil, and has come a-begging."
    </p>
    <p>
     However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing
    </p>
    <p>
     oil on the whale-ground, and however much it may invertedly
    </p>
    <p>
     contradict the old proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle,
    </p>
    <p>
     yet sometimes such a thing really happens; and in the present
    </p>
    <p>
     case Captain Derick De Deer did indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder
    </p>
    <p>
     as Flask did declare.
    </p>
    <p>
     As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at
    </p>
    <p>
     all heeding what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo,
    </p>
    <p>
     the German soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale;
    </p>
    <p>
     immediately turning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can,
    </p>
    <p>
     with some remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at
    </p>
    <p>
     night in profound darkness--his last drop of Bremen oil being gone,
    </p>
    <p>
     and not a single flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency;
    </p>
    <p>
     concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery
    </p>
    <p>
     is technically called a clean one (that is, an empty one), well
    </p>
    <p>
     deserving the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin.
    </p>
    <p>
     His necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained
    </p>
    <p>
     his ship's side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from
    </p>
    <p>
     the mast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick,
    </p>
    <p>
     that without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard,
    </p>
    <p>
     he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German boats
    </p>
    <p>
     that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the Pequod's keels.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were eight whales, an average pod.  Aware of their danger,
    </p>
    <p>
     they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind,
    </p>
    <p>
     rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness.
    </p>
    <p>
     They left a great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling a great
    </p>
    <p>
     wide parchment upon the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Full in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge,
    </p>
    <p>
     humped old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress,
    </p>
    <p>
     as well as by the unusual yellowish incrustations over-growing him,
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed afflicted with the jaundice, or some other infirmity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance, seemed questionable;
    </p>
    <p>
     for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at
    </p>
    <p>
     all social.  Nevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their
    </p>
    <p>
     back water must have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell
    </p>
    <p>
     at his broad muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two
    </p>
    <p>
     hostile currents meet.  His spout was short, slow, and laborious;
    </p>
    <p>
     coming forth with a choking sort of gush, and spending itself
    </p>
    <p>
     in torn shreds, followed by strange subterranean commotions in him,
    </p>
    <p>
     which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity,
    </p>
    <p>
     causing the waters behind him to upbubble.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Who's got some paregoric?" said Stubb, "he has the stomach-ache,
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm afraid.  Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache!
    </p>
    <p>
     Adverse winds are holding mad Christmas in him, boys.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's the first foul wind I ever knew to blow from astern; but look,
    </p>
    <p>
     did ever whale yaw so before? it must be, he's lost his tiller."
    </p>
    <p>
     As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck
    </p>
    <p>
     load of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on
    </p>
    <p>
     her way; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then
    </p>
    <p>
     partly turning over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause
    </p>
    <p>
     of his devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether he had lost that fin in battle, or had been born without it,
    </p>
    <p>
     it were hard to say.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Only wait a bit, old chap, and I'll give ye a sling for that
    </p>
    <p>
     wounded arm," cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mind he don't sling thee with it," cried Starbuck.  "Give way,
    </p>
    <p>
     or the German will have him."
    </p>
    <p>
     With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed
    </p>
    <p>
     for this one fish, because not only was he the largest,
    </p>
    <p>
     and therefore the most valuable whale, but he was nearest to them,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the other whales were going with such great velocity, moreover,
    </p>
    <p>
     as almost to defy pursuit for the time.  At this juncture,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Pequod's keels had shot by the three German boats last lowered;
    </p>
    <p>
     but from the great start he had had, Derick's boat still led
    </p>
    <p>
     the chase, though every moment neared by his foreign rivals.
    </p>
    <p>
     The only thing they feared, was, that from being already
    </p>
    <p>
     so nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron
    </p>
    <p>
     before they could completely overtake and pass him.
    </p>
    <p>
     As for Derick, he seemed quite confident that this would be the case,
    </p>
    <p>
     and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder
    </p>
    <p>
     at the other boats.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The ungracious and ungrateful dog!" cried Starbuck; "he mocks and dares
    </p>
    <p>
     me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes ago!"--
    </p>
    <p>
     Then in his old intense whisper--"give way, greyhounds!  Dog to it!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I tell ye what it is, men"--cried Stubb to his crew--It's against my
    </p>
    <p>
     religion to get mad; but I'd like to eat that villainous Yarman--Pull--
    </p>
    <p>
     won't ye?  Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye?  Do ye love brandy?
    </p>
    <p>
     A hogshead of brandy, then, to the best man.  Come, why don't some of ye
    </p>
    <p>
     burst a blood-vessel? Who's that been dropping an anchor overboard--
    </p>
    <p>
     we don't budge an inch--we're becalmed.  Halloo, here's grass growing
    </p>
    <p>
     in the boat's bottom--and by the Lord, the mast there's budding.
    </p>
    <p>
     This won't do, boys.  Look at that Yarman!  The short and long of
    </p>
    <p>
     it is, men, will ye spit fire or not?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh! see the suds he makes!" cried Flask, dancing up and down--"What
    </p>
    <p>
     a hump--Oh, do pile on the beef--lays like a log!  Oh! my lads,
    </p>
    <p>
     do spring--slap-jacks and quahogs for supper, you know, my lads--
    </p>
    <p>
     baked clams and muffins--oh, do, do, spring,--he's a hundred barreler--
    </p>
    <p>
     don't lose him now--don't oh, don't!--see that Yarman--Oh, won't ye pull
    </p>
    <p>
     for your duff, my lads--such a sog! such a sogger!  Don't ye love sperm?
    </p>
    <p>
     There goes three thousand dollars, men!--a bank!--a whole bank!
    </p>
    <p>
     The bank of England!--Oh, do, do, do!--What's that Yarman about now?"
    </p>
    <p>
     At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder
    </p>
    <p>
     at the advancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double
    </p>
    <p>
     view of retarding his rivals' way, and at the same time economically
    </p>
    <p>
     accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The unmannerly Dutch dogger!" cried Stubb.  "Pull now, men,
    </p>
    <p>
     like fifty thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils.
    </p>
    <p>
     What d'ye say, Tashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in
    </p>
    <p>
     two-and-twenty pieces for the honor of old Gayhead?  What d'ye say?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I say, pull like god-dam,"--cried the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the Pequod's
    </p>
    <p>
     three boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so disposed,
    </p>
    <p>
     momentarily neared him.  In that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude
    </p>
    <p>
     of the headsman when drawing near to his prey, the three mates stood
    </p>
    <p>
     up proudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating
    </p>
    <p>
     cry of, "There she slides, now!  Hurrah for the white-ash breeze!
    </p>
    <p>
     Down with the Yarman!  Sail over him!"
    </p>
    <p>
     But so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite
    </p>
    <p>
     of all their gallantry, he would have proved the victor
    </p>
    <p>
     in this race, had not a righteous judgment descended upon him
    </p>
    <p>
     in a crab which caught the blade of his midship oarsman.
    </p>
    <p>
     While this clumsy lubber was striving to free his white-ash,
    </p>
    <p>
     and while, in consequence, Derick's boat was nigh to capsizing,
    </p>
    <p>
     and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage;--that was
    </p>
    <p>
     a good time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask.  With a shout,
    </p>
    <p>
     they took a mortal start forwards, and slantingly ranged up
    </p>
    <p>
     on the German's quarter.  An instant more, and all four boats
    </p>
    <p>
     were diagonically in the whale's immediate wake, while stretching
    </p>
    <p>
     from them, on both sides, was the foaming swell that he made.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight.
    </p>
    <p>
     The whale was now going head out, and sending his spout
    </p>
    <p>
     before him in a continual tormented jet; while his one poor
    </p>
    <p>
     fin beat his side in an agony of fright.  Now to this hand,
    </p>
    <p>
     now to that, he yawed in his faltering flight, and still at
    </p>
    <p>
     every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank in the sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin.
    </p>
    <p>
     So have I seen a bird with clipped wing, making affrighted broken
    </p>
    <p>
     circles in the air, vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the bird has a voice, and with plaintive cries will make
    </p>
    <p>
     known her fear; but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     was chained up and enchanted in him; he had no voice,
    </p>
    <p>
     save that choking respiration through his spiracle, and this
    </p>
    <p>
     made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while still,
    </p>
    <p>
     in his amazing bulk, portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail,
    </p>
    <p>
     there was enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod's
    </p>
    <p>
     boats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game,
    </p>
    <p>
     Derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually
    </p>
    <p>
     long dart, ere the last chance would for ever escape.
    </p>
    <p>
     But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all
    </p>
    <p>
     three tigers--Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo--instinctively sprang
    </p>
    <p>
     to their feet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed
    </p>
    <p>
     their barbs; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer,
    </p>
    <p>
     their three Nantucket irons entered the whale.  Blinding vapors
    </p>
    <p>
     of foam and white-fire! The three boats, in the first fury of the
    </p>
    <p>
     whale's headlong rush, bumped the German's aside with such force,
    </p>
    <p>
     that both Derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out,
    </p>
    <p>
     and sailed over by the three flying keels.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't be afraid, my butter-boxes," cried Stubb, casting a passing
    </p>
    <p>
     glance upon them as he shot by; "ye'll be picked up presently--
    </p>
    <p>
     all right--I saw some sharks astern--St. Bernard's dogs, you know--
    </p>
    <p>
     relieve distressed travellers.  Hurrah! this is the way to sail now.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every keel a sunbeam!  Hurrah!--Here we go like three tin
    </p>
    <p>
     kettles at the tail of a mad cougar!  This puts me in mind
    </p>
    <p>
     of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on a plain--
    </p>
    <p>
     makes the wheelspokes fly, boys, when you fasten to him that way;
    </p>
    <p>
     and there's danger of being pitched out too, when you strike a hill.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels when he's going
    </p>
    <p>
     to Davy Jones--all a rush down an endless inclined plane!
    </p>
    <p>
     Hurrah! this whale carries the everlasting mail!"
    </p>
    <p>
     But the monster's run was a brief one.  Giving a sudden gasp,
    </p>
    <p>
     he tumultuously sounded.  With a grating rush, the three lines flew round
    </p>
    <p>
     the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them;
    </p>
    <p>
     while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding
    </p>
    <p>
     would soon exhaust the lines, that using all their dexterous might,
    </p>
    <p>
     they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on;
    </p>
    <p>
     till at last--owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined
    </p>
    <p>
     chocks of the boats, whence the three ropes went straight
    </p>
    <p>
     down into the blue--the gunwales of the bows were almost even
    </p>
    <p>
     with the water, while the three sterns tilted high in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
     And the whale soon ceasing to sound, for some time they
    </p>
    <p>
     remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more line,
    </p>
    <p>
     though the position was a little ticklish.  But though boats have
    </p>
    <p>
     been taken down and lost in this way, yet it is this "holding on,"
    </p>
    <p>
     as it is called; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live
    </p>
    <p>
     flesh from the back; this it is that often torments the Leviathan
    </p>
    <p>
     into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing, it is to be doubted
    </p>
    <p>
     whether this course is always the best; for it is but reasonable
    </p>
    <p>
     to presume, that the longer the stricken whale stays under water,
    </p>
    <p>
     the more he is exhausted.  Because, owing to the enormous surface of him--
    </p>
    <p>
     in a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000 square feet--
    </p>
    <p>
     the pressure of the water is immense.  We all know what an astonishing
    </p>
    <p>
     atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even here,
    </p>
    <p>
     above-ground, in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean!
    </p>
    <p>
     It must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres.  One whaleman
    </p>
    <p>
     has estimated it at the weight of twenty line-of-battle ships,
    </p>
    <p>
     with all their guns, and stores, and men on board.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     gazing down into its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan
    </p>
    <p>
     or cry of any sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble
    </p>
    <p>
     came up from its depths; what landsman would have thought,
    </p>
    <p>
     that beneath all that silence and placidity, the utmost
    </p>
    <p>
     monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in agony!
    </p>
    <p>
     Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great
    </p>
    <p>
     Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suspended? and to what?  To three bits of board.  Is this
    </p>
    <p>
     the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said--"Canst thou
    </p>
    <p>
     fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish-spears?
    </p>
    <p>
     The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold, the spear,
    </p>
    <p>
     the dart, nor the habergeon:  he esteemeth iron as straw;
    </p>
    <p>
     the arrow cannot make him flee; darts are counted as stubble;
    </p>
    <p>
     he laugheth at the shaking of a spear!"  This the creature?
    </p>
    <p>
     this he?  Oh! that unfulfilments should follow the prophets.
    </p>
    <p>
     For with the strength of a thousand thighs in his tail,
    </p>
    <p>
     Leviathan had run his head under the mountains of the sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     to hide him from the Pequod's fishspears!
    </p>
    <p>
     In that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats sent
    </p>
    <p>
     down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad enough
    </p>
    <p>
     to shade half Xerxes' army.  Who can tell how appalling to the wounded
    </p>
    <p>
     whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Stand by, men; he stirs," cried Starbuck, as the three lines suddenly
    </p>
    <p>
     vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to them,
    </p>
    <p>
     as by magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     so that every oarsman felt them in his seat.  The next moment,
    </p>
    <p>
     relieved in a great part from the downward strain at the bows,
    </p>
    <p>
     the boats gave a sudden bounce upwards, as a small icefield will,
    </p>
    <p>
     when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Haul in!  Haul in!" cried Starbuck again; "he's rising."
    </p>
    <p>
     The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand's
    </p>
    <p>
     breadth could have been gained, were now in long quick coils
    </p>
    <p>
     flung back all dripping into the boats, and soon the whale
    </p>
    <p>
     broke water within two ship's length of the hunters.
    </p>
    <p>
     His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion.
    </p>
    <p>
     In most land animals there are certain valves or flood-gates
    </p>
    <p>
     in many of their veins, whereby when wounded, the blood is in
    </p>
    <p>
     some degree at least instantly shut off in certain directions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not so with the whale; one of whose peculiarities it is,
    </p>
    <p>
     to have an entire non-valvular structure of the blood-vessels,
    </p>
    <p>
     so that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon,
    </p>
    <p>
     a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system;
    </p>
    <p>
     and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure
    </p>
    <p>
     of water at a great distance below the surface, his life
    </p>
    <p>
     may be said to pour from him in incessant streams.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him, and so distant
    </p>
    <p>
     and numerous its interior fountains, that he will keep
    </p>
    <p>
     thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period;
    </p>
    <p>
     even as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is
    </p>
    <p>
     in the well-springs of far-off and indiscernible hills.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even now, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously
    </p>
    <p>
     drew over his swaying flukes, and the lances were darted into him,
    </p>
    <p>
     they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound,
    </p>
    <p>
     which kept continually playing, while the natural spout-hole
    </p>
    <p>
     in his head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending its
    </p>
    <p>
     affrighted moisture into the air.  From this last vent no blood
    </p>
    <p>
     yet came, because no vital part of him had thus far been struck.
    </p>
    <p>
     His life, as they significantly call it, was untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of his
    </p>
    <p>
     form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
     His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were beheld.
    </p>
    <p>
     As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the noblest
    </p>
    <p>
     oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale's eyes had
    </p>
    <p>
     once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see.
    </p>
    <p>
     But pity there was none.  For all his old age, and his one arm,
    </p>
    <p>
     and his blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered,
    </p>
    <p>
     in order to light the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men,
    </p>
    <p>
     and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional
    </p>
    <p>
     inoffensiveness by all to all.  Still rolling in his blood, at last
    </p>
    <p>
     he partially disclosed a strangely discolored bunch or protuberance,
    </p>
    <p>
     the size of a bushel, low down on the flank.
    </p>
    <p>
     "A nice spot," cried Flask; "just let me prick him there once."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Avast!" cried Starbuck, "there's no need of that!"
    </p>
    <p>
     But humane Starbuck was too late.  At the instant of the dart
    </p>
    <p>
     an ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it
    </p>
    <p>
     into more than sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting
    </p>
    <p>
     thick blood, with swift fury blindly darted at the craft,
    </p>
    <p>
     bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with
    </p>
    <p>
     showers of gore, capsizing Flask's boat and marring the bows.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was his death stroke.  For, by this time, so spent was he by loss
    </p>
    <p>
     of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made;
    </p>
    <p>
     lay panting on his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin,
    </p>
    <p>
     then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world;
    </p>
    <p>
     turned up the white secrets of his belly; lay like a log,
    </p>
    <p>
     and died.  It was most piteous, that last expiring spout.
    </p>
    <p>
     As when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off
    </p>
    <p>
     from some mighty fountain, and with half-stifled melancholy
    </p>
    <p>
     gurglings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the ground--
    </p>
    <p>
     so the last long dying spout of the whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship,
    </p>
    <p>
     the body showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled.
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately, by Starbuck's orders, lines were secured to it at
    </p>
    <p>
     different points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken
    </p>
    <p>
     whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords.
    </p>
    <p>
     By very heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was
    </p>
    <p>
     transferred to her side, and was strongly secured there by the stiffest
    </p>
    <p>
     fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially upheld,
    </p>
    <p>
     the body would at once sink to the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
     It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade,
    </p>
    <p>
     the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded
    </p>
    <p>
     in his flesh, on the lower part of the bunch before described.
    </p>
    <p>
     But as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead
    </p>
    <p>
     bodies of captured whales, with the flesh perfectly healed
    </p>
    <p>
     around them, and no prominence of any kind to denote their place;
    </p>
    <p>
     therefore, there must needs have been some other unknown reason
    </p>
    <p>
     in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to.
    </p>
    <p>
     But still more curious was the fact of a lance-head of stone being
    </p>
    <p>
     found in him, not far from the buried iron, the flesh perfectly
    </p>
    <p>
     firm about it.  Who had darted that stone lance?  And when?
    </p>
    <p>
     It might have been darted by some Nor' West Indian long before
    </p>
    <p>
     America was discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
     What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet
    </p>
    <p>
     there is no telling.  But a sudden stop was put to further discoveries,
    </p>
    <p>
     by the ship's being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     owing to the body's immensely increasing tendency to sink.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it
    </p>
    <p>
     to the last; hung on to it so resolutely, indeed, that when at length
    </p>
    <p>
     the ship would have been capsized, if still persisting in locking
    </p>
    <p>
     arms with the body; then, when the command was given to break clear
    </p>
    <p>
     from it, such was the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which
    </p>
    <p>
     the fluke-chains and cables were fastened, that it was impossible
    </p>
    <p>
     to cast them off.  Meantime everything in the Pequod was aslant.
    </p>
    <p>
     To cross to the other side of the deck was like walking up
    </p>
    <p>
     the steep gabled roof of a house.  The ship groaned and gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started
    </p>
    <p>
     from their places, by the unnatural dislocation.  In vain handspikes
    </p>
    <p>
     and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable fluke-chains, to pry
    </p>
    <p>
     them adrift from the timberheads; and so low had the whale now settled
    </p>
    <p>
     that the submerged ends could not be at all approached, while every
    </p>
    <p>
     moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the ship seemed on the point of going over.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hold on, hold on, won't ye?" cried Stubb to the body,
    </p>
    <p>
     "don't be in such a devil of a hurry to sink!
    </p>
    <p>
     By thunder, men, we must do something or go for it.
    </p>
    <p>
     No use prying there; avast, I say with your handspikes,
    </p>
    <p>
     and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut
    </p>
    <p>
     the big chains."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Knife?  Aye, aye," cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter's
    </p>
    <p>
     heavy hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron,
    </p>
    <p>
     began slashing at the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes,
    </p>
    <p>
     full of sparks, were given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a terrific snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted,
    </p>
    <p>
     the carcase sank.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed
    </p>
    <p>
     Sperm Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet
    </p>
    <p>
     adequately accounted for it.  Usually the dead Sperm Whale
    </p>
    <p>
     floats with great buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably
    </p>
    <p>
     elevated above the surface.  If the only whales that thus sank
    </p>
    <p>
     were old, meagre, and broken-hearted creatures, their pads
    </p>
    <p>
     of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic;
    </p>
    <p>
     then you might with some reason assert that this sinking is
    </p>
    <p>
     caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking,
    </p>
    <p>
     consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it is not so.  For young whales, in the highest health,
    </p>
    <p>
     and swelling with noble aspirations, prematurely cut off
    </p>
    <p>
     in the warm flush and May of life, with all their panting lard
    </p>
    <p>
     about them! even these brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.
    </p>
    <p>
     Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less
    </p>
    <p>
     liable to this accident than any other species.
    </p>
    <p>
     Where one of that sort go down, twenty Right Whales do.
    </p>
    <p>
     This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small
    </p>
    <p>
     degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale;
    </p>
    <p>
     his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton;
    </p>
    <p>
     from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free.  But there
    </p>
    <p>
     are instances where, after the lapse of many hours or several days,
    </p>
    <p>
     the sunken whale again rises, more buoyant than in life.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the reason of this is obvious.  Gases are generated in him;
    </p>
    <p>
     he swells to a prodigious magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon.
    </p>
    <p>
     A line-of-battle ship could hardly keep him under then.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the Shore Whaling, on soundings, among the Bays of New Zealand,
    </p>
    <p>
     when a Right Whale gives token of sinking, they fasten buoys
    </p>
    <p>
     to him, with plenty of rope; so that when the body has gone down,
    </p>
    <p>
     they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry
    </p>
    <p>
     was heard from the Pequod's mast-heads, announcing that the
    </p>
    <p>
     Jungfrau was again lowering her boats; though the only spout
    </p>
    <p>
     in sight was that of a Fin-Back, belonging to the species of
    </p>
    <p>
     uncapturable whales, because of its incredible power of swimming.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nevertheless, the Fin-Back's spout is so similar to the Sperm Whale's,
    </p>
    <p>
     that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it.
    </p>
    <p>
     And consequently Derick and all his host were now in valiant
    </p>
    <p>
     chase of this unnearable brute.  The Virgin crowding all sail,
    </p>
    <p>
     made after her four young keels, and thus they all disappeared
    </p>
    <p>
     far to leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend.

    <p>
     The Honor and Glory of Whaling
    </p>
    <p>
     There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness
    </p>
    <p>
     is the true method.
    </p>
    <p>
     The more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches
    </p>
    <p>
     up to the very spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed
    </p>
    <p>
     with its great honorableness and antiquity; and especially when I
    </p>
    <p>
     find so many great demi-gods and heroes, prophets of all sorts,
    </p>
    <p>
     who one way or other have shed distinction upon it, I am transported
    </p>
    <p>
     with the reflection that I myself belong, though but subordinately,
    </p>
    <p>
     to so emblazoned a fraternity.
    </p>
    <p>
     The gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman;
    </p>
    <p>
     and to the eternal honor of our calling be it said, that the first
    </p>
    <p>
     whale attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any
    </p>
    <p>
     sordid intent.  Those were the knightly days of our profession,
    </p>
    <p>
     when we only bore arms to succor the distressed, and not to fill
    </p>
    <p>
     men's lamp-feeders. Every one knows the fine story of Perseus
    </p>
    <p>
     and Andromeda; how the lovely Andromeda, the daughter of a king,
    </p>
    <p>
     was tied to a rock on the sea-coast, and as Leviathan was in
    </p>
    <p>
     the very act of carrying her off, Perseus, the prince of whalemen,
    </p>
    <p>
     intrepidly advancing, harpooned the monster, and delivered
    </p>
    <p>
     and married the maid.  It was an admirable artistic exploit,
    </p>
    <p>
     rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day;
    </p>
    <p>
     inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very first dart.
    </p>
    <p>
     And let no man doubt this Arkite story; for in the ancient Joppa,
    </p>
    <p>
     now Jaffa, on the Syrian coast, in one of the Pagan temples,
    </p>
    <p>
     there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     which the city's legends and all the inhabitants asserted
    </p>
    <p>
     to be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the Romans took Joppa, the same skeleton was carried to Italy
    </p>
    <p>
     in triumph.  What seems most singular and suggestively important
    </p>
    <p>
     in this story, is this:  it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail.
    </p>
    <p>
     Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda--indeed, by some
    </p>
    <p>
     supposed to be indirectly derived from it--is that famous story
    </p>
    <p>
     of St. George and the Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have
    </p>
    <p>
     been a whale; for in many old chronicles whales and dragons
    </p>
    <p>
     are strangely jumbled together, and often stand for each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thou art as a lion of the waters, and as a dragon of
    </p>
    <p>
     the sea," said Ezekiel; hereby, plainly meaning a whale;
    </p>
    <p>
     in truth, some versions of the Bible use that word itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Besides, it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit
    </p>
    <p>
     had St. George but encountered a crawling reptile of the land,
    </p>
    <p>
     instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep.
    </p>
    <p>
     Any man may kill a snake, but only a Perseus, a St. George,
    </p>
    <p>
     a Coffin, have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us;
    </p>
    <p>
     for though the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman
    </p>
    <p>
     of old is vaguely represented of a griffin-like shape,
    </p>
    <p>
     and though the battle is depicted on land and the saint
    </p>
    <p>
     on horseback, yet considering the great ignorance of those times,
    </p>
    <p>
     when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists;
    </p>
    <p>
     and considering that as in Perseus' case, St. George's
    </p>
    <p>
     whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach;
    </p>
    <p>
     and considering that the animal ridden by St. George might have
    </p>
    <p>
     been only a large seal, or sea-horse; bearing all this in mind,
    </p>
    <p>
     it will not appear altogether incompatible with the sacred
    </p>
    <p>
     legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene, to hold this
    </p>
    <p>
     so-called dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     In fact, placed before the strict and piercing truth,
    </p>
    <p>
     this whole story will fare like that fish, flesh, and fowl
    </p>
    <p>
     idol of the Philistines, Dagon by name; who being planted
    </p>
    <p>
     before the ark of Israel, his horse's head and both the palms
    </p>
    <p>
     of his hands fell off from him, and only the stump or fishy
    </p>
    <p>
     part of him remained.  Thus, then, one of our own noble stamp,
    </p>
    <p>
     even a whaleman, is the tutelary guardian of England;
    </p>
    <p>
     and by good rights, we harpooneers of Nantucket should be
    </p>
    <p>
     enrolled in the most noble order of St. George.  And therefore,
    </p>
    <p>
     let not the knights of that honorable company (none of whom,
    </p>
    <p>
     I venture to say, have ever had to do with a whale like their
    </p>
    <p>
     great patron), let them never eye a Nantucketer with disdain,
    </p>
    <p>
     since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are much
    </p>
    <p>
     better entitled to St. George's decoration than they.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long
    </p>
    <p>
     remained dubious:  for though according to the Greek mythologies,
    </p>
    <p>
     that antique Crockett and Kit Carson--that brawny doer
    </p>
    <p>
     of rejoicing good deeds, was swallowed down and thrown up
    </p>
    <p>
     by a whale; still, whether that strictly makes a whaleman
    </p>
    <p>
     of him, that might be mooted.  It nowhere appears that he ever
    </p>
    <p>
     actually harpooned his fish, unless, indeed, from the inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman;
    </p>
    <p>
     at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not the whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     I claim him for one of our clan.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story
    </p>
    <p>
     of Hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still
    </p>
    <p>
     more ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and vice versa;
    </p>
    <p>
     certainly they are very similar.  If I claim the demigod then,
    </p>
    <p>
     why not the prophet?
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise
    </p>
    <p>
     the whole roll of our order.  Our grand master is still to be named;
    </p>
    <p>
     for like royal kings of old times, we find the head-waters
    </p>
    <p>
     of our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
     That wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster,
    </p>
    <p>
     which gives us the dread Vishnoo, one of the three persons
    </p>
    <p>
     in the godhead of the Hindoos; gives us this divine Vishnoo
    </p>
    <p>
     himself for our Lord;--Vishnoo, who, by the first of his ten
    </p>
    <p>
     earthly incarnations, has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Brahma, or the God of Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved to
    </p>
    <p>
     recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions,
    </p>
    <p>
     he gave birth to Vishnoo, to preside over the work; but the Vedas,
    </p>
    <p>
     or mystical books, whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable
    </p>
    <p>
     to Vishnoo before beginning the creation, and which therefore
    </p>
    <p>
     must have contained something in the shape of practical hints
    </p>
    <p>
     to young architects, these Vedas were lying at the bottom of
    </p>
    <p>
     the waters; so Vishnoo became incarnate in a whale, and sounding
    </p>
    <p>
     down in him to the uttermost depths, rescued the sacred volumes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman, then? even as a man who rides
    </p>
    <p>
     a horse is called a horseman?
    </p>
    <p>
     Perseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there's
    </p>
    <p>
     a member-roll for you!  What club but the whaleman's can head
    </p>
    <p>
     off like that?

     Jonah Historically Regarded
    </p>
    <p>
     Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale
    </p>
    <p>
     in the preceding chapter.  Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this
    </p>
    <p>
     historical story of Jonah and the whale.  But then there were some
    </p>
    <p>
     sceptical Greeks and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox pagans
    </p>
    <p>
     of their times, equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     and Arion and the dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions
    </p>
    <p>
     did not make those traditions one whit the less facts, for all that.
    </p>
    <p>
     One old Sag-Harbor whaleman's chief reason for questioning the Hebrew
    </p>
    <p>
     story was this:--He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,
    </p>
    <p>
     embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented
    </p>
    <p>
     Jonah's whale with two spouts in his head--a peculiarity only true

    <p>
     with respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale,

     and the varieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen
    </p>
    <p>
     have this saying, "A penny roll would choke him"; his swallow is so
    </p>
    <p>
     very small.  But, to this, Bishop Jebb's anticipative answer is ready.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is not necessary, hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in
    </p>
    <p>
     the whale's belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     And this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop.  For truly,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Right Whale's mouth would accommodate a couple of whist-tables,
    </p>
    <p>
     and comfortably seat all the players.  Possibly, too, Jonah might
    </p>
    <p>
     have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Right Whale is toothless.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name)
    </p>
    <p>
     urged for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet,
    </p>
    <p>
     was something obscurely in reference to his incarcerated body
    </p>
    <p>
     and the whale's gastric juices.  But this objection likewise falls
    </p>
    <p>
     to the ground, because a German exegetist supposes that Jonah
    </p>
    <p>
     must have taken refuge in the floating body of a dead whale--
    </p>
    <p>
     even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned
    </p>
    <p>
     their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Besides, it has been divined by other continental commentators,
    </p>
    <p>
     that when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship,
    </p>
    <p>
     he straightway effected his escape to another vessel near by,
    </p>
    <p>
     some vessel with a whale for a figure-head; and, I would add,
    </p>
    <p>
     possibly called "The Whale," as some craft are nowadays
    </p>
    <p>
     christened the "Shark," the "Gull," the "Eagle."  Nor have
    </p>
    <p>
     there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined
    </p>
    <p>
     that the whale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely meant
    </p>
    <p>
     a life-preserver--an inflated bag of wind--which the endangered
    </p>
    <p>
     prophet swam to, and so was saved from a watery doom.
    </p>
    <p>
     Poor Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all round.
    </p>
    <p>
     But he had still another reason for his want of faith.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was this, if I remember right:  Jonah was swallowed
    </p>
    <p>
     by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea, and after three days'
    </p>
    <p>
     he was vomited up somewhere within three days' journey of Nineveh,
    </p>
    <p>
     a city on the Tigris, very much more than three days'
    </p>
    <p>
     journey across from the nearest point of the Mediterranean coast.
    </p>
    <p>
     How is that?
    </p>
    <p>
     But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within
    </p>
    <p>
     that short distance of Nineveh?  Yes.  He might have carried him
    </p>
    <p>
     round by the way of the Cape of Good Hope.  But not to speak
    </p>
    <p>
     of the passage through the whole length of the Mediterranean,
    </p>
    <p>
     and another passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation
    </p>
    <p>
     of all Africa in three days, not to speak of the Tigris waters,
    </p>
    <p>
     near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow for any whale to swim in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Besides, this idea of Jonah's weathering the Cape of Good Hope
    </p>
    <p>
     at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of that
    </p>
    <p>
     great headland from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer,
    </p>
    <p>
     and so make modern history a liar.
    </p>
    <p>
     But all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his
    </p>
    <p>
     foolish pride of reason--a thing still more reprehensible in him,
    </p>
    <p>
     seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from
    </p>
    <p>
     the sun and the sea.  I say it only shows his foolish, impious pride,
    </p>
    <p>
     and abominable, devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy.
    </p>
    <p>
     For by a Portuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonah's going to
    </p>
    <p>
     Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification
    </p>
    <p>
     of the general miracle.  And so it was.  Besides, to this day,
    </p>
    <p>
     the highly enlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical story
    </p>
    <p>
     of Jonah.  And some three centuries ago, an English traveller in old
    </p>
    <p>
     Harris's Voyages, speaks of a Turkish Mosque built in honor of Jonah,
    </p>
    <p>
     in which Mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil.

    <p>
     Pitchpoling
    </p>
    <p>
     To make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages
    </p>
    <p>
     are anointed; and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform
    </p>
    <p>
     an analogous operation upon their boat; they grease the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor is it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm,
    </p>
    <p>
     it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage; considering that
    </p>
    <p>
     oil and water are hostile; that oil is a sliding thing,
    </p>
    <p>
     and that the object in view is to make the boat slide bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg believed strongly in anointing his boat, and one morning
    </p>
    <p>
     not long after the German ship Jungfrau disappeared, took more than
    </p>
    <p>
     customary pains in that occupation; crawling under its bottom,
    </p>
    <p>
     where it hung over the side, and rubbing in the unctuousness as though
    </p>
    <p>
     diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from the craft's bald keel.
    </p>
    <p>
     He seemed to be working in obedience to some particular presentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor did it remain unwarranted by the event.
    </p>
    <p>
     Towards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed
    </p>
    <p>
     down to them, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy;
    </p>
    <p>
     a disordered flight, as of Cleopatra's barges from Actium.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb's was foremost.
    </p>
    <p>
     By great exertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting
    </p>
    <p>
     one iron; but the stricken whale, without at all sounding,
    </p>
    <p>
     still continued his horizontal flight, with added fleetness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Such unintermitted strainings upon the planted iron must sooner
    </p>
    <p>
     or later inevitably extract it.  It became imperative to lance
    </p>
    <p>
     the flying whale, or be content to lose him.  But to haul the boat
    </p>
    <p>
     up to his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and furious.
    </p>
    <p>
     What then remained?
    </p>
    <p>
     Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and
    </p>
    <p>
     countless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced,
    </p>
    <p>
     none exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance called pitchpoling.
    </p>
    <p>
     Small sword, or broad sword, in all its exercises boasts nothing like it.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale;
    </p>
    <p>
     its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long
    </p>
    <p>
     lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking, jerking boat,
    </p>
    <p>
     under extreme headway.  Steel and wood included, the entire spear
    </p>
    <p>
     is some ten or twelve feet in length; the staff is much slighter
    </p>
    <p>
     than that of the harpoon, and also of a lighter material--pine.  It is
    </p>
    <p>
     furnished with a small rope called a warp, of considerable length,
    </p>
    <p>
     by which it can be hauled back to the hand after darting.
    </p>
    <p>
     But before going further, it is important to mention here, that though
    </p>
    <p>
     the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it
    </p>
    <p>
     is seldom done; and when done, is still less frequently successful,
    </p>
    <p>
     on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon
    </p>
    <p>
     as compared with the lance, which in effect become serious drawbacks.
    </p>
    <p>
     As a general thing, therefore, you must first get fast to a whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     before any pitchpoling comes into play.
    </p>
    <p>
     Look now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous,
    </p>
    <p>
     deliberate coolness and equanimity in the direst emergencies,
    </p>
    <p>
     was specially qualified to excel in pitchpoling.  Look at him;
    </p>
    <p>
     he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat;
    </p>
    <p>
     wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along
    </p>
    <p>
     its length to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb whistlingly
    </p>
    <p>
     gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to secure
    </p>
    <p>
     its free end in his grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then holding the lance full before his waistband's middle,
    </p>
    <p>
     he levels it at the whale; when, covering him with it,
    </p>
    <p>
     he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand, thereby elevating
    </p>
    <p>
     the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm,
    </p>
    <p>
     fifteen feet in the air.  He minds you somewhat of a juggler,
    </p>
    <p>
     balancing a long staff on his chin.  Next moment with a rapid,
    </p>
    <p>
     nameless impulse, in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans
    </p>
    <p>
     the foaming distance, and quivers in the life spot of the whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of sparkling water, he now spouts red blood.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That drove the spigot out of him!" cried Stubb.  "'Tis July's
    </p>
    <p>
     immortal Fourth; all fountains must run wine today!
    </p>
    <p>
     Would now, it were old Orleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable
    </p>
    <p>
     old Monongahela!  Then, Tashtego, lad, I'd have ye hold a canakin
    </p>
    <p>
     to the jet, and we'd drink round it!  Yea, verily, hearts alive,
    </p>
    <p>
     we'd brew choice punch in the spread of his spout-hole there,
    </p>
    <p>
     and from that live punch-bowl quaff the living stuff."
    </p>
    <p>
     Again and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is repeated,
    </p>
    <p>
     the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful leash.
    </p>
    <p>
     The agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line is slackened,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands, and mutely watches
    </p>
    <p>
     the monster die.

     The Fountain
    </p>
    <p>
     That for six thousand years--and no one knows how many millions
    </p>
    <p>
     of ages before--the great whales should have been spouting all over
    </p>
    <p>
     the sea, and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep,
    </p>
    <p>
     as with so many sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some
    </p>
    <p>
     centuries back, thousands of hunters should have been close by
    </p>
    <p>
     the fountain of the whale, watching these sprinklings and spoutings--
    </p>
    <p>
     that all this should be, and yet, that down to this blessed minute
    </p>
    <p>
     (fifteen and a quarter minutes past one o'clock P.M. of this
    </p>
    <p>
     sixteenth day of December, A.D. 1851), it should still remain
    </p>
    <p>
     a problem, whether these spoutings are, after all, really water,
    </p>
    <p>
     or nothing but vapor--this is surely a noteworthy thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting
    </p>
    <p>
     items contingent.  Every one knows that by the peculiar
    </p>
    <p>
     cunning of their gills, the finny tribes in general breathe
    </p>
    <p>
     the air which at all times is combined with the element
    </p>
    <p>
     in which they swim; hence, a herring or a cod might live
    </p>
    <p>
     a century, and never once raise its head above the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
     But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him
    </p>
    <p>
     regular lungs, like a human being's, the whale can only live
    </p>
    <p>
     by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world.
    </p>
    <p>
     But he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth, for,
    </p>
    <p>
     in his ordinary attitude, the Sperm Whale's mouth is buried
    </p>
    <p>
     at least eight feet beneath the surface; and what is still more,
    </p>
    <p>
     his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth.  No, he breathes
    </p>
    <p>
     through his spiracle alone; and this is on the top of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
     If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function
    </p>
    <p>
     indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws
    </p>
    <p>
     from the air a certain element, which being subsequently
    </p>
    <p>
     brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood
    </p>
    <p>
     its vivifying principle, I do not think I shall err;
    </p>
    <p>
     though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words.
    </p>
    <p>
     Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man could
    </p>
    <p>
     be aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils
    </p>
    <p>
     and not fetch another for a considerable time.  That is to say,
    </p>
    <p>
     he would then live without breathing.  Anomalous as it may seem,
    </p>
    <p>
     this is precisely the case with the whale, who systematically lives,
    </p>
    <p>
     by intervals, his full hour and more (when at the bottom)
    </p>
    <p>
     without drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way
    </p>
    <p>
     inhaling a particle of air; for, remember, he has no gills.
    </p>
    <p>
     How is this?  Between his ribs and on each side of his spine
    </p>
    <p>
     he is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth
    </p>
    <p>
     of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when he quits
    </p>
    <p>
     the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated blood.
    </p>
    <p>
     So that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel
    </p>
    <p>
     crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply
    </p>
    <p>
     of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs.
    </p>
    <p>
     The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable;
    </p>
    <p>
     and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true,
    </p>
    <p>
     seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise
    </p>
    <p>
     inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having his
    </p>
    <p>
     spoutings out, as the fishermen phrase it.  This is what I mean.
    </p>
    <p>
     If unmolested, upon rising to the surface, the Sperm Whale will
    </p>
    <p>
     continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all
    </p>
    <p>
     his other unmolested risings.  Say he stays eleven minutes,
    </p>
    <p>
     and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths;
    </p>
    <p>
     then whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy
    </p>
    <p>
     breaths over again, to a minute.  Now, if after he fetches a few
    </p>
    <p>
     breaths you alarm him, so that he sounds, he will be always
    </p>
    <p>
     dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air.
    </p>
    <p>
     And not till those seventy breaths are told, will he finally
    </p>
    <p>
     go down to stay out his full term below.  Remark, however,
    </p>
    <p>
     that in different individuals these rates are different;
    </p>
    <p>
     but in any one they are alike.  Now, why should the whale
    </p>
    <p>
     thus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be
    </p>
    <p>
     to replenish his reservoir of air, ere descending for good?
    </p>
    <p>
     How obvious it is it, too, that this necessity for the whale's
    </p>
    <p>
     rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase.
    </p>
    <p>
     For not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught,
    </p>
    <p>
     when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not so much thy skill, then, O hunter, as the great necessities
    </p>
    <p>
     that strike the victory to thee!
    </p>
    <p>
     In man, breathing is incessantly going on--one breath only serving
    </p>
    <p>
     for two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has
    </p>
    <p>
     to attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday
    </p>
    <p>
     of his time.
    </p>
    <p>
     It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole;
    </p>
    <p>
     if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water,
    </p>
    <p>
     then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell
    </p>
    <p>
     seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at all answers
    </p>
    <p>
     to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so clogged with
    </p>
    <p>
     two elements, it could not be expected to have the power of smelling.
    </p>
    <p>
     But owing to the mystery of the spout--whether it be water or whether it
    </p>
    <p>
     be vapor--no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no proper olfactories.
    </p>
    <p>
     But what does he want of them?  No roses, no violets, no Cologne-water
    </p>
    <p>
     in the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his
    </p>
    <p>
     spouting canal, and as that long canal--like the grand Erie Canal--
    </p>
    <p>
     is furnished with a sort of locks (that open and shut)
    </p>
    <p>
     for the downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water,
    </p>
    <p>
     therefore the whale has no voice; unless you insult him by saying,
    </p>
    <p>
     that when he so strangely rumbles, he talks through his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then again, what has the whale to say?  Seldom have I known
    </p>
    <p>
     any profound being that had anything to say to this world,
    </p>
    <p>
     unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a living.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it
    </p>
    <p>
     is for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,
    </p>
    <p>
     horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a little to one side; this curious canal is very much
    </p>
    <p>
     like a gas-pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the question returns whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe;
    </p>
    <p>
     in other words, whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere
    </p>
    <p>
     vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether that exhaled breath is
    </p>
    <p>
     mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and discharged through
    </p>
    <p>
     the spiracle.  It is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates
    </p>
    <p>
     with the spouting canal; but it cannot be proved that this
    </p>
    <p>
     is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be,
    </p>
    <p>
     when in feeding he accidentally takes in water.  But the Sperm Whale's
    </p>
    <p>
     food is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout
    </p>
    <p>
     even if he would.  Besides, if you regard him very closely,
    </p>
    <p>
     and time him with your watch, you will find that when unmolested,
    </p>
    <p>
     there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets
    </p>
    <p>
     and the ordinary periods of respiration.
    </p>
    <p>
     But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject?
    </p>
    <p>
     Speak out!  You have seen him spout; then declare what
    </p>
    <p>
     the spout is; can you not tell water from air?  My dear sir,
    </p>
    <p>
     in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things.
    </p>
    <p>
     I have ever found your plain things the knottiest of all.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand in it,
    </p>
    <p>
     and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.
    </p>
    <p>
     The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist
    </p>
    <p>
     enveloping it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water
    </p>
    <p>
     falls from it, when, always, when you are close enough to a whale
    </p>
    <p>
     to get a close view of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion,
    </p>
    <p>
     the water cascading all around him.  And if at such times
    </p>
    <p>
     you should think that you really perceived drops of moisture
    </p>
    <p>
     in the spout, how do you know that they are not merely condensed
    </p>
    <p>
     from its vapor; or how do you know that they are not those
    </p>
    <p>
     identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole fissure,
    </p>
    <p>
     which is countersunk into the summit of the whale's head?
    </p>
    <p>
     For even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm,
    </p>
    <p>
     with his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary's in the desert;
    </p>
    <p>
     even then, the whale always carries a small basin of water on
    </p>
    <p>
     his head, as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity
    </p>
    <p>
     in a rock filled up with rain.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching
    </p>
    <p>
     the precise nature of the whale spout.  It will not do for him
    </p>
    <p>
     to be peering into it, and putting his face in it.  You cannot go
    </p>
    <p>
     with your pitcher to this fountain and fill it, and bring it away.
    </p>
    <p>
     For even when coming into slight contact with the outer,
    </p>
    <p>
     vapory shreds of the jet, which will often happen, your skin will
    </p>
    <p>
     feverishly smart, from the acridness of the thing so touching it.
    </p>
    <p>
     And I know one, who coming into still closer contact with the spout,
    </p>
    <p>
     whether with some scientific object in view, or otherwise, I cannot say,
    </p>
    <p>
     the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm.  Wherefore, among whalemen,
    </p>
    <p>
     the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt it,
    </p>
    <p>
     that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you.
    </p>
    <p>
     The wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me,
    </p>
    <p>
     is to let this deadly spout alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish.
    </p>
    <p>
     My hypothesis is this:  that the spout is nothing but mist.
    </p>
    <p>
     And besides other reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled,
    </p>
    <p>
     by considerations touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Sperm Whale; I account him no common, shallow being,
    </p>
    <p>
     inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is never found
    </p>
    <p>
     on soundings, or near shores; all other whales sometimes are.
    </p>
    <p>
     He is both ponderous and profound.  And I am convinced that from
    </p>
    <p>
     the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as Plato, Pyrrho,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes up a certain
    </p>
    <p>
     semi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
     While composing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the curiosity
    </p>
    <p>
     to place a mirror before me; and ere long saw reflected there,
    </p>
    <p>
     a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my head.
    </p>
    <p>
     The invariable moisture of my hair, while plunged in deep thought,
    </p>
    <p>
     after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic, of an August noon;
    </p>
    <p>
     this seems an additional argument for the above supposition.
    </p>
    <p>
     And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster,
    </p>
    <p>
     to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea;
    </p>
    <p>
     his vast, mild head overhung by a canopy of vapor,
    </p>
    <p>
     engendered by his incommunicable contemplations, and that vapor--
    </p>
    <p>
     as you will sometimes see it--glorified by a rainbow,
    </p>
    <p>
     as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
     For d'ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air;
    </p>
    <p>
     they only irradiate vapor.  And so, through all the thick
    </p>
    <p>
     mists of the dim doubts in my mind, divine intuitions now
    </p>
    <p>
     and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray.
    </p>
    <p>
     And for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny;
    </p>
    <p>
     but doubts or denials, few along with them, have intuitions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Doubts of all things earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly;
    </p>
    <p>
     this combination makes neither believer nor infidel, but makes
    </p>
    <p>
     a man who regards them both with equal eye.

    <p>
     The Tail
    </p>
    <p>
     Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less celestial,
    </p>
    <p>
     I celebrate a tail.
    </p>
    <p>
     Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale's tail to begin at
    </p>
    <p>
     that point of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth
    </p>
    <p>
     of a man, it comprises upon its upper surface alone, an area
    </p>
    <p>
     of at least fifty square feet.  The compact round body of its
    </p>
    <p>
     root expands into two broad, firm, flat palms or flukes,
    </p>
    <p>
     gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap, then sideways
    </p>
    <p>
     recede from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy between.
    </p>
    <p>
     In no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely
    </p>
    <p>
     defined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes.
    </p>
    <p>
     At its utmost expansion in the full grown whale, the tail
    </p>
    <p>
     will considerably exceed twenty feet across.
    </p>
    <p>
     The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews;
    </p>
    <p>
     but cut into it, and you find that three distinct strata
    </p>
    <p>
     compose it:--upper, middle, and lower.  The fibres in the upper
    </p>
    <p>
     and lower layers, are long and horizontal; those of the middle one,
    </p>
    <p>
     very short, and running crosswise between the outside layers.
    </p>
    <p>
     This triune structure, as much as anything else, imparts power
    </p>
    <p>
     to the tail.  To the student of old Roman walls, the middle layer
    </p>
    <p>
     will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tiles always
    </p>
    <p>
     alternating with the stone in those wonderful relics of the antique,
    </p>
    <p>
     and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength
    </p>
    <p>
     of the masonry.
    </p>
    <p>
     But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough,
    </p>
    <p>
     the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof
    </p>
    <p>
     of muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side
    </p>
    <p>
     the loins and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them,
    </p>
    <p>
     and largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the confluent
    </p>
    <p>
     measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point.
    </p>
    <p>
     Could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor does this--its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple
    </p>
    <p>
     the graceful flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease
    </p>
    <p>
     undulates through a Titanism of power.  On the contrary,
    </p>
    <p>
     those motions derive their most appalling beauty from it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Real strength never impairs beauty or harmony, but it often bestows it;
    </p>
    <p>
     and in everything imposingly beautiful, strength has much to do with
    </p>
    <p>
     the magic.  Take away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting
    </p>
    <p>
     from the marble in the carved Hercules, and its charm would be gone.
    </p>
    <p>
     As devout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse
    </p>
    <p>
     of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man,
    </p>
    <p>
     that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch.  When Angelo paints even
    </p>
    <p>
     God the Father in human form, mark what robustness is there.
    </p>
    <p>
     And whatever they may reveal of the divine love in the Son,
    </p>
    <p>
     the soft, curled, hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which
    </p>
    <p>
     his idea has been most successfully embodied; these pictures,
    </p>
    <p>
     so destitute as they are of all brawniness, hint nothing of any power,
    </p>
    <p>
     but the mere negative, feminine one of submission and endurance,
    </p>
    <p>
     which on all hands it is conceded, form the peculiar practical
    </p>
    <p>
     virtues of his teachings.
    </p>
    <p>
     Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether
    </p>
    <p>
     wielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood
    </p>
    <p>
     it be in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace.
    </p>
    <p>
     Therein no fairy's arm can transcend it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Five great motions are peculiar to it.  First, when used as a
    </p>
    <p>
     fin for progression; Second, when used as a mace in battle;
    </p>
    <p>
     Third, in sweeping; Fourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.
    </p>
    <p>
     First:  Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan's tail acts
    </p>
    <p>
     in a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
     It never wriggles.  In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority.
    </p>
    <p>
     To the whale his tail is the sole means of propulsion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Scroll-wise coiled forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly
    </p>
    <p>
     sprung backwards, it is this which gives that singular darting,
    </p>
    <p>
     leaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming.
    </p>
    <p>
     His side-fins only serve to steer by.
    </p>
    <p>
     Second:  It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only
    </p>
    <p>
     fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his
    </p>
    <p>
     conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail.
    </p>
    <p>
     In striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the blow is only inflicted by the recoil.  If it be made
    </p>
    <p>
     in the unobstructed air, especially if it descend to its mark,
    </p>
    <p>
     the stroke is then simply irresistible.  No ribs of man or boat
    </p>
    <p>
     can withstand it.  Your only salvation lies in eluding it;
    </p>
    <p>
     but if it comes sideways through the opposing water, then partly
    </p>
    <p>
     owing to the light buoyancy of the whale-boat, and the elasticity
    </p>
    <p>
     of its materials, a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two, a sort
    </p>
    <p>
     of stitch in the side, is generally the most serious result.
    </p>
    <p>
     These submerged side blows are so often received in the fishery,
    </p>
    <p>
     that they are accounted mere child's play.  Some one strips off
    </p>
    <p>
     a frock, and the hole is stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
     Third:  I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in
    </p>
    <p>
     the whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail;
    </p>
    <p>
     for in this respect there is a delicacy in it only equalled by
    </p>
    <p>
     the daintiness of the elephant's trunk.  This delicacy is chiefly
    </p>
    <p>
     evinced in the action of sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness
    </p>
    <p>
     the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes
    </p>
    <p>
     from side to side upon the surface of the sea; and if he feel
    </p>
    <p>
     but a sailor's whisker, woe to that sailor, whiskers and all.
    </p>
    <p>
     What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch!
    </p>
    <p>
     Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink
    </p>
    <p>
     me of Darmonodes' elephant that so frequented the flower-market,
    </p>
    <p>
     and with low salutations presented nosegays to damsels,
    </p>
    <p>
     and then caressed their zones.  On more accounts than one,
    </p>
    <p>
     a pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile
    </p>
    <p>
     virtue in his tail; for I have heard of yet another elephant,
    </p>
    <p>
     that when wounded in the fight, curved round his trunk and
    </p>
    <p>
     extracted the dart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fourth:  Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security
    </p>
    <p>
     of the middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast
    </p>
    <p>
     corpulence of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean
    </p>
    <p>
     as if it were a hearth.  But still you see his power in his play.
    </p>
    <p>
     The broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air! then
    </p>
    <p>
     smiting the surface, the thunderous concussion resounds for miles.
    </p>
    <p>
     You would almost think a great gun had been discharged;
    </p>
    <p>
     and if you noticed the light wreath of vapor from the spiracle
    </p>
    <p>
     at his other extremity, you would think that that was the smoke
    </p>
    <p>
     from the touch-hole.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fifth:  As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes
    </p>
    <p>
     lies considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely
    </p>
    <p>
     out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge
    </p>
    <p>
     into the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his
    </p>
    <p>
     body are tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment,
    </p>
    <p>
     till they downwards shoot out of view.  Excepting the sublime breach--
    </p>
    <p>
     somewhere else to be described--this peaking of the whale's flukes
    </p>
    <p>
     is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature.
    </p>
    <p>
     Out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically
    </p>
    <p>
     snatching at the highest heaven.  So in dreams, have I seen majestic
    </p>
    <p>
     Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame
    </p>
    <p>
     Baltic of Hell.  But in gazing at such scenes, it is all in all what
    </p>
    <p>
     mood you are in; if in the Dantean, the devils will occur to you;
    </p>
    <p>
     if in that of Isaiah, the archangels.  Standing at the mast-head
    </p>
    <p>
     of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw
    </p>
    <p>
     a large herd of whales in the east, all heading towards the sun,
    </p>
    <p>
     and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes.  As it seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     to me at the time, such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods
    </p>
    <p>
     was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of the fire worshippers.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant, I then
    </p>
    <p>
     testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout of all beings.
    </p>
    <p>
     For according to King Juba, the military elephants of antiquity often
    </p>
    <p>
     hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the profoundest silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the elephant,
    </p>
    <p>
     so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other
    </p>
    <p>
     are concerned, should not tend to place those two opposite organs on
    </p>
    <p>
     an equality, much less the creatures to which they respectively belong.
    </p>
    <p>
     For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to Leviathan, so,
    </p>
    <p>
     compared with Leviathan's tail, his trunk is but the stalk of a lily.
    </p>
    <p>
     The most direful blow from the elephant's trunk were as the playful tap
    </p>
    <p>
     of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and crash of the sperm
    </p>
    <p>
     whale's ponderous flukes, which in repeated instances have one after
    </p>
    <p>
     the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews into the air,
    </p>
    <p>
     very much as an Indian juggler tosses his balls.*
    </p>
    <p>
     *Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale
    </p>
    <p>
     and the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular
    </p>
    <p>
     the elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that
    </p>
    <p>
     a dog does to the elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting
    </p>
    <p>
     some points of curious similitude; among these is the spout.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is well known that the elephant will often draw up water or dust
    </p>
    <p>
     in his trunk, and then elevating it, jet it forth in a stream.
    </p>
    <p>
     The more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my inability
    </p>
    <p>
     to express it.  At times there are gestures in it, which, though they
    </p>
    <p>
     would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly inexplicable.
    </p>
    <p>
     In an extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are these
    </p>
    <p>
     mystic gestures, that I have heard hunters who have declared them akin
    </p>
    <p>
     to Free-Mason signs and symbols; that the whale, indeed, by these
    </p>
    <p>
     methods intelligently conversed with the world.  Nor are there wanting
    </p>
    <p>
     other motions of the whale in his general body, full of strangeness,
    </p>
    <p>
     and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant.  Dissect him
    </p>
    <p>
     how I may, then, I but go skin deep.  I know him not, and never will.
    </p>
    <p>
     But if I know not even the tail of this whale, how understand his
    </p>
    <p>
     head? much more, how comprehend his face, when face he has none?
    </p>
    <p>
     Thou shalt see my back parts, my tail, he seems to say, but my face
    </p>
    <p>
     shall not be seen.  But I cannot completely make out his back parts;
    </p>
    <p>
     and hint what he will about his face, I say again he has no face.

    <p>
     The Grand Armada
    </p>
    <p>
     The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward
    </p>
    <p>
     from the territories of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of
    </p>
    <p>
     all Asia.  In a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long
    </p>
    <p>
     islands of Sumatra, Java, Bally, and Timor; which, with many others,
    </p>
    <p>
     form a vast mole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia,
    </p>
    <p>
     and dividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly studded
    </p>
    <p>
     oriental archipelagoes.  This rampart is pierced by several sally-ports
    </p>
    <p>
     for the convenience of ships and whales; conspicuous among which are
    </p>
    <p>
     the straits of Sunda and Malacca.  By the straits of Sunda, chiefly,
    </p>
    <p>
     vessels bound to China from the west, emerge into the China seas.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing
    </p>
    <p>
     midway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold
    </p>
    <p>
     green promontory, known to seamen as Java Head; they not a little
    </p>
    <p>
     correspond to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire:
    </p>
    <p>
     and considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices, and silks,
    </p>
    <p>
     and jewels, and gold, and ivory, with which the thousand islands
    </p>
    <p>
     of that oriental sea are enriched, it seems a significant provision
    </p>
    <p>
     of nature, that such treasures, by the very formation of the land,
    </p>
    <p>
     should at least bear the appearance, however ineffectual,
    </p>
    <p>
     of being guarded from the all-grasping western world.  The shores
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with those domineering
    </p>
    <p>
     fortresses which guard the entrances to the Mediterranean, the Baltic,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the Propontis.  Unlike the Danes, these Orientals do not demand
    </p>
    <p>
     the obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from the endless
    </p>
    <p>
     procession of ships before the wind, which for centuries past,
    </p>
    <p>
     by night and by day, have passed between the islands of Sumatra
    </p>
    <p>
     and Java, freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east.
    </p>
    <p>
     But while they freely waive a ceremonial like this, they do by no
    </p>
    <p>
     means renounce their claim to more solid tribute.
    </p>
    <p>
     Time out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays,
    </p>
    <p>
     lurking among the low shaded coves and islets of Sumatra,
    </p>
    <p>
     have sallied out upon the vessels sailing through the straits,
    </p>
    <p>
     fiercely demanding tribute at the point of their spears.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though by the repeated bloody chastisements they have received
    </p>
    <p>
     at the hands of European cruisers, the audacity of these corsairs
    </p>
    <p>
     has of late been somewhat repressed; yet, even at the present day,
    </p>
    <p>
     we occasionally hear of English and American vessels, which,
    </p>
    <p>
     in those waters, have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits;
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Java sea, and thence,
    </p>
    <p>
     cruising northwards, over waters known to be frequented here and there
    </p>
    <p>
     by the Sperm Whale, sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands, and gain
    </p>
    <p>
     the far coast of Japan, in time for the great whaling season there.
    </p>
    <p>
     By these means, the circumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost all the
    </p>
    <p>
     known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the world, previous to descending
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the Line in the Pacific; where Ahab, though everywhere else
    </p>
    <p>
     foiled in his pursuit, firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby Dick,
    </p>
    <p>
     in the sea he was most known to frequent; and at a season when he might
    </p>
    <p>
     most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it.
    </p>
    <p>
     But how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does
    </p>
    <p>
     his crew drink air?  Surely, he will stop for water.  Nay.  For a
    </p>
    <p>
     long time, now, the circus-running sun has raced within his
    </p>
    <p>
     fiery ring, and needs no sustenance but what's in himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     So Ahab.  Mark this, too, in the whaler.  While other
    </p>
    <p>
     hulls are loaded down with alien stuff, to be transferred
    </p>
    <p>
     to foreign wharves; the world-wandering whale-ship carries
    </p>
    <p>
     no cargo but herself and crew, their weapons and their wants.
    </p>
    <p>
     She has a whole lake's contents bottled in her ample hold.
    </p>
    <p>
     She is ballasted with utilities; not altogether with unusable
    </p>
    <p>
     pig-lead and kentledge.  She carries years' water in her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Clear old prime Nantucket water; which, when three years afloat,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to drink before
    </p>
    <p>
     the brackish fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks,
    </p>
    <p>
     from the Peruvian or Indian streams.  Hence it is, that,
    </p>
    <p>
     while other ships may have gone to China from New York,
    </p>
    <p>
     and back again, touching at a score of ports, the whale-ship,
    </p>
    <p>
     in all that interval, may not have sighted one grain of soil;
    </p>
    <p>
     her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
     So that did you carry them the news that another flood had come;
    </p>
    <p>
     they would only answer--"Well, boys, here's the ark!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western
    </p>
    <p>
     coast of Java, in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda;
    </p>
    <p>
     indeed, as most of the ground, roundabout, was generally
    </p>
    <p>
     recognised by the fishermen as an excellent spot for cruising;
    </p>
    <p>
     therefore, as the Pequod gained more and more upon Java Head,
    </p>
    <p>
     the look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and admonished to keep wide awake.
    </p>
    <p>
     But though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed on
    </p>
    <p>
     the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon
    </p>
    <p>
     was snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet was descried.
    </p>
    <p>
     Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game hereabouts,
    </p>
    <p>
     the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when the customary
    </p>
    <p>
     cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a spectacle
    </p>
    <p>
     of singular magnificence saluted us.
    </p>
    <p>
     But here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity
    </p>
    <p>
     with which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Sperm Whales, instead of almost invariably sailing in small
    </p>
    <p>
     detached companies, as in former times, are now frequently met
    </p>
    <p>
     with in extensive herds, sometimes embracing so great a multitude,
    </p>
    <p>
     that it would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn
    </p>
    <p>
     solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection.
    </p>
    <p>
     To this aggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense caravans,
    </p>
    <p>
     may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds,
    </p>
    <p>
     you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together,
    </p>
    <p>
     without being greeted by a single spout; and then be suddenly
    </p>
    <p>
     saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands.
    </p>
    <p>
     Broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles,
    </p>
    <p>
     and forming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon,
    </p>
    <p>
     a continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling
    </p>
    <p>
     in the noon-day air.  Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Right Whale, which, dividing at top, falls over in two branches,
    </p>
    <p>
     like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting
    </p>
    <p>
     spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist,
    </p>
    <p>
     continually rising and falling away to leeward.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seen from the Pequod's deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill
    </p>
    <p>
     of the sea, this host of vapory spouts, individually curling up into
    </p>
    <p>
     the air, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze,
    </p>
    <p>
     showed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis,
    </p>
    <p>
     descried of a balmy autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height.
    </p>
    <p>
     As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,
    </p>
    <p>
     accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage in
    </p>
    <p>
     their rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain;
    </p>
    <p>
     even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through
    </p>
    <p>
     the straits; gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle,
    </p>
    <p>
     and swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic centre.
    </p>
    <p>
     Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers
    </p>
    <p>
     handling their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads
    </p>
    <p>
     of their yet suspended boats.  If the wind only held,
    </p>
    <p>
     little doubt had they, that chased through these Straits
    </p>
    <p>
     of Sunda, the vast host would only deploy into the Oriental
    </p>
    <p>
     seas to witness the capture of not a few of their number.
    </p>
    <p>
     And who could tell whether, in that congregated caravan,
    </p>
    <p>
     Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming,
    </p>
    <p>
     like the worshipped white-elephant in the coronation procession
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Siamese!  So with stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we
    </p>
    <p>
     sailed along, driving these leviathans before us; when, of a sudden,
    </p>
    <p>
     the voice of Tashtego was heard, loudly directing attention
    </p>
    <p>
     to something in our wake.
    </p>
    <p>
     Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our rear.
    </p>
    <p>
     It seemed formed of detached white vapors, rising and falling something
    </p>
    <p>
     like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so completely come
    </p>
    <p>
     and go; for they constantly hovered, without finally disappearing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Levelling his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly revolved in his
    </p>
    <p>
     pivot-hole, crying, "Aloft there, and rig whips and buckets to wet
    </p>
    <p>
     the sails;--Malays, sir, and after us!"
    </p>
    <p>
     As if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod
    </p>
    <p>
     should fairly have entered the straits, these rascally Asiatics
    </p>
    <p>
     were now in hot pursuit, to make up for their over-cautious delay.
    </p>
    <p>
     But when the swift Pequod, with a fresh leading wind, was herself
    </p>
    <p>
     in hot chase; how very kind of these tawny philanthropists
    </p>
    <p>
     to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuit,--
    </p>
    <p>
     mere riding-whips and rowels to her, that they were.
    </p>
    <p>
     As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck;
    </p>
    <p>
     in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased,
    </p>
    <p>
     and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him;
    </p>
    <p>
     some such fancy as the above seemed his.  And when he glanced
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the ship
    </p>
    <p>
     was then sailing, and bethought him that through that gate lay
    </p>
    <p>
     the route to his vengeance, and beheld, how that through that same
    </p>
    <p>
     gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end;
    </p>
    <p>
     and not only that, but a herd of remorseless wild pirates
    </p>
    <p>
     and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him
    </p>
    <p>
     on with their curses;--when all these conceits had passed
    </p>
    <p>
     through his brain, Ahab's brow was left gaunt and ribbed,
    </p>
    <p>
     like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it,
    </p>
    <p>
     without being able to drag the firm thing from its place.
    </p>
    <p>
     But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and when,
    </p>
    <p>
     after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the Pequod
    </p>
    <p>
     at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra side,
    </p>
    <p>
     emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the harpooneers
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the Malays.  But still driving on in the wake of the whales,
    </p>
    <p>
     at length they seemed abating their speed; gradually the ship neared them;
    </p>
    <p>
     and the wind now dying away, word was passed to spring to the boats.
    </p>
    <p>
     But no sooner did the herd, by some presumed wonderful instinct of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Sperm Whale, become notified of the three keels that were after them,--
    </p>
    <p>
     though as yet a mile in their rear,--than they rallied again, and forming
    </p>
    <p>
     in close ranks and battalions, so that their spouts all looked like
    </p>
    <p>
     flashing lines of stacked bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash,
    </p>
    <p>
     and after several hours' pulling were almost disposed to renounce
    </p>
    <p>
     the chase, when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave
    </p>
    <p>
     animating tokens that they were now at last under the influence
    </p>
    <p>
     of that strange perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the
    </p>
    <p>
     fishermen perceive it in the whale, they say he is gallied*. The
    </p>
    <p>
     compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly
    </p>
    <p>
     and steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout;
    </p>
    <p>
     and like King Porus' elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander,
    </p>
    <p>
     they seemed going mad with consternation.  In all directions
    </p>
    <p>
     expanding in vast irregular circles, and aimlessly swimming hither
    </p>
    <p>
     and thither, by their short thick spoutings, they plainly betrayed
    </p>
    <p>
     their distraction of panic.  This was still more strangely evinced
    </p>
    <p>
     by those of their number, who, completely paralysed as it were,
    </p>
    <p>
     helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled ships on the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Had these Leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep,
    </p>
    <p>
     pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could not
    </p>
    <p>
     possibly have evinced such excessive dismay.  But this occasional
    </p>
    <p>
     timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though banding together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned
    </p>
    <p>
     buffaloes of the West have fled before a solitary horseman.
    </p>
    <p>
     Witness, too, all human beings, how when herded together in the sheepfold
    </p>
    <p>
     of a theatre's pit, they will, at the slightest alarm of fire,
    </p>
    <p>
     rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding, trampling, jamming,
    </p>
    <p>
     and remorselessly dashing each other to death.  Best, therefore,
    </p>
    <p>
     withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us,
    </p>
    <p>
     for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not
    </p>
    <p>
     infinitely outdone by the madness of men.
    </p>
    <p>
     * To gally, or gallow, is to frighten excessively--
    </p>
    <p>
     to confound with fright.  It is an old Saxon word.
    </p>
    <p>
     It occurs once in Shakespeare:--
    </p>
    <p>
     The wrathful skies Gallow the very wanderers of the dark And make
    </p>
    <p>
     them keep their caves.
    </p>
    <p>
     To common language, the word is now completely obsolete.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the polite landsman first hears it from the gaunt Nantucketer, he is
    </p>
    <p>
     apt to set it down as one of the whaleman's self-derived savageries.
    </p>
    <p>
     Much the same is it with many other sinewy Saxonisms of this sort,
    </p>
    <p>
     which emigrated to New-England rocks with the noble brawn of the old
    </p>
    <p>
     English emigrants in the time of the Commonwealth.  Thus, some of
    </p>
    <p>
     the best and furthest-descended English words--the etymological Howards
    </p>
    <p>
     and Percys--are now democratised, nay, plebeianised--so to speak--
    </p>
    <p>
     in the New World.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,
    </p>
    <p>
     yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither
    </p>
    <p>
     advanced nor retreated, but collectively remained in one place.
    </p>
    <p>
     As is customary in those cases, the boats at once separated,
    </p>
    <p>
     each making for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal.
    </p>
    <p>
     In about three minutes' time, Queequeg's harpoon was flung;
    </p>
    <p>
     the stricken fish darted blinding spray in our faces, and then
    </p>
    <p>
     running away with us like light, steered straight for the heart
    </p>
    <p>
     of the herd.  Though such a movement on the part of the whale
    </p>
    <p>
     struck under such circumstances, is in no wise unprecedented;
    </p>
    <p>
     and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated; yet does it
    </p>
    <p>
     present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery.
    </p>
    <p>
     For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the
    </p>
    <p>
     frantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist
    </p>
    <p>
     in a delirious throb.
    </p>
    <p>
     As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power
    </p>
    <p>
     of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him;
    </p>
    <p>
     as we thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced
    </p>
    <p>
     as we flew, by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us;
    </p>
    <p>
     our beset boat was like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest,
    </p>
    <p>
     and striving to steer through their complicated channels and straits,
    </p>
    <p>
     knowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed.
    </p>
    <p>
     But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering
    </p>
    <p>
     off from this monster directly across our route in advance;
    </p>
    <p>
     now edging away from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead,
    </p>
    <p>
     while all the time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand,
    </p>
    <p>
     pricking out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts,
    </p>
    <p>
     for there was no time to make long ones.  Nor were the oarsmen
    </p>
    <p>
     quite idle, though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with.
    </p>
    <p>
     They chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Out of the way, Commodore!" cried one, to a great dromedary that of
    </p>
    <p>
     a sudden rose bodily to the surface, and for an instant threatened
    </p>
    <p>
     to swamp us.  "Hard down with your tail, there!" cried a second
    </p>
    <p>
     to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly cooling
    </p>
    <p>
     himself with his own fan-like extremity.
    </p>
    <p>
     All whale-boats carry certain curious contrivances,
    </p>
    <p>
     originally invented by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Two thick squares of wood of equal size are stoutly
    </p>
    <p>
     clenched together, so that they cross each other's grain at
    </p>
    <p>
     right angles; a line of considerable length is then attached
    </p>
    <p>
     to the middle of this block, and the other end of the line
    </p>
    <p>
     being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used.
    </p>
    <p>
     For then, more whales are close round you than you can
    </p>
    <p>
     possibly chase at one time.  But sperm whales are not every
    </p>
    <p>
     day encountered; while you may, then, you must kill all you can.
    </p>
    <p>
     And if you cannot kill them all at once, you must wing them,
    </p>
    <p>
     so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure.  Hence it is,
    </p>
    <p>
     that at times like these the drug, comes into requisition.
    </p>
    <p>
     Our boat was furnished with three of them.  The first and second were
    </p>
    <p>
     successfully darted, and we saw the whales staggeringly running off,
    </p>
    <p>
     fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball.
    </p>
    <p>
     But upon flinging the third, in the act of tossing overboard
    </p>
    <p>
     the clumsy wooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the boat,
    </p>
    <p>
     and in an instant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the
    </p>
    <p>
     oarsman in the boat's bottom as the seat slid from under him.
    </p>
    <p>
     On both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks, but we
    </p>
    <p>
     stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in, and so stopped
    </p>
    <p>
     the leaks for the time.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons,
    </p>
    <p>
     were it not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale's way
    </p>
    <p>
     greatly diminished; moreover, that as we went still further
    </p>
    <p>
     and further from the circumference of commotion, the direful
    </p>
    <p>
     disorders seemed waning.  So that when at last the jerking
    </p>
    <p>
     harpoon drew out, and the towing whale sideways vanished;
    </p>
    <p>
     then, with the tapering force of his parting momentum, we glided
    </p>
    <p>
     between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal, as if
    </p>
    <p>
     from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales,
    </p>
    <p>
     were heard but not felt.  In this central expanse the sea
    </p>
    <p>
     presented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek,
    </p>
    <p>
     produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale
    </p>
    <p>
     in his more quiet moods.  Yes, we were now in that enchanted
    </p>
    <p>
     calm which they say lurks at the heart of every commotion.
    </p>
    <p>
     And still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of
    </p>
    <p>
     the outer concentric circles, and saw successive pods of whales,
    </p>
    <p>
     eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and round, like multiplied
    </p>
    <p>
     spans of horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder to shoulder,
    </p>
    <p>
     that a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched
    </p>
    <p>
     the middle ones, and so have gone round on their backs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales,
    </p>
    <p>
     more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd,
    </p>
    <p>
     no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us.
    </p>
    <p>
     We must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in;
    </p>
    <p>
     the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Keeping at the centre of the lake, we were occasionally
    </p>
    <p>
     visited by small tame cows and calves; the women and children
    </p>
    <p>
     of this routed host.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between
    </p>
    <p>
     the revolving outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces
    </p>
    <p>
     between the various pods in any one of those circles,
    </p>
    <p>
     the entire area at this juncture, embraced by the whole multitude,
    </p>
    <p>
     must have contained at least two or three square miles.
    </p>
    <p>
     At any rate--though indeed such a test at such a time might
    </p>
    <p>
     be deceptive--spoutings might be discovered from our low boat
    </p>
    <p>
     that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
     I mention this circumstance, because, as if the cows and
    </p>
    <p>
     calves had been purposely locked up in this innermost fold;
    </p>
    <p>
     and as if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them
    </p>
    <p>
     from learning the precise cause of its stopping; or, possibly,
    </p>
    <p>
     being so young, unsophisticated, and every way innocent
    </p>
    <p>
     and inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller whales--
    </p>
    <p>
     now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake--
    </p>
    <p>
     evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still
    </p>
    <p>
     becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like household dogs they came snuffling round us,
    </p>
    <p>
     right up to our gunwales, and touching them; till it almost
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched their backs
    </p>
    <p>
     with his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the time
    </p>
    <p>
     refrained from darting it.
    </p>
    <p>
     But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and
    </p>
    <p>
     still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side.
    </p>
    <p>
     For, suspended in those watery vaults, floated the forms
    </p>
    <p>
     of the nursing mothers of the whales, and those that by their
    </p>
    <p>
     enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers.  The lake, as I
    </p>
    <p>
     have hinted, was to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent;
    </p>
    <p>
     and as human infants while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze
    </p>
    <p>
     away from the breast, as if leading two different lives at the time;
    </p>
    <p>
     and while yet drawing mortal nourishment, be still spiritually
    </p>
    <p>
     feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;--even so did the young
    </p>
    <p>
     of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at us,
    </p>
    <p>
     as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight.
    </p>
    <p>
     Floating on their sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of these little infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     hardly a day old, might have measured some fourteen feet in length,
    </p>
    <p>
     and some six feet in girth.  He was a little frisky; though as yet
    </p>
    <p>
     his body seemed scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it
    </p>
    <p>
     had so lately occupied in the maternal reticule; where, tail to head,
    </p>
    <p>
     and all ready for the final spring, the unborn whale lies bent like a
    </p>
    <p>
     Tartar's bow.  The delicate side-fins, and the palms of his flukes,
    </p>
    <p>
     still freshly retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby's
    </p>
    <p>
     ears newly arrived from foreign parts.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Line! line!" cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale;
    </p>
    <p>
     "him fast! him fast!--Who line him!  Who struck?--Two whale;
    </p>
    <p>
     one big, one little!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "What ails ye, man?" cried Starbuck.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Look-e here," said Queequeg, pointing down.
    </p>
    <p>
     As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled
    </p>
    <p>
     out hundreds of fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding,
    </p>
    <p>
     he floats up again, and shows the slackened curling line
    </p>
    <p>
     buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the air; so now,
    </p>
    <p>
     Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of Madame Leviathan,
    </p>
    <p>
     by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this natural line,
    </p>
    <p>
     with the maternal end loose, becomes entangled with the hempen one,
    </p>
    <p>
     so that the cub is thereby trapped.  Some of the subtlest secrets
    </p>
    <p>
     of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond.
    </p>
    <p>
     We saw young Leviathan amours in the deep.*
    </p>
    <p>
     *The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan,
    </p>
    <p>
     but unlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons;
    </p>
    <p>
     after a gestation which may probably be set down at nine months,
    </p>
    <p>
     producing but one at a time; though in some few known instances
    </p>
    <p>
     giving birth to an Esau and Jacob:--a contingency provided for
    </p>
    <p>
     in suckling by two teats, curiously situated, one on each side
    </p>
    <p>
     of the anus; but the breasts themselves extend upwards from that.
    </p>
    <p>
     When by chance these precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by
    </p>
    <p>
     the hunter's lance, the mother's pouring milk and blood rivallingly
    </p>
    <p>
     discolor the sea for rods.  The milk is very sweet and rich;
    </p>
    <p>
     it has been tasted by man; it might do well with strawberries.
    </p>
    <p>
     When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales salute more hominum.
    </p>
    <p>
     And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations
    </p>
    <p>
     and affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre
    </p>
    <p>
     freely and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments;
    </p>
    <p>
     yea, serenely revelled in dalliance and delight.
    </p>
    <p>
     But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of my being,
    </p>
    <p>
     do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm;
    </p>
    <p>
     and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me,
    </p>
    <p>
     deep down and deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal
    </p>
    <p>
     mildness of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic
    </p>
    <p>
     spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,
    </p>
    <p>
     still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host;
    </p>
    <p>
     or possibly carrying on the war within the first circle,
    </p>
    <p>
     where abundance of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting
    </p>
    <p>
     to and fro across the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly
    </p>
    <p>
     powerful and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were,
    </p>
    <p>
     by sundering or maiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It is done by
    </p>
    <p>
     darting a short-handled cutting-spade, to which is attached a rope
    </p>
    <p>
     for hauling it back again.  A whale wounded (as we afterwards learned)
    </p>
    <p>
     in this part, but not effectually, as it seemed, had broken away
    </p>
    <p>
     from the boat, carrying along with him half of the harpoon line;
    </p>
    <p>
     and in the extraordinary agony of the wound, he was now dashing
    </p>
    <p>
     among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold,
    </p>
    <p>
     at the battle of Saratoga, carrying dismay wherever he went.
    </p>
    <p>
     But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling
    </p>
    <p>
     spectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which
    </p>
    <p>
     he seemed to inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause
    </p>
    <p>
     which at first the intervening distance obscured from us.
    </p>
    <p>
     But at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents
    </p>
    <p>
     of the fishery, this whale had become entangled in the harpoon-line
    </p>
    <p>
     that he towed; he had also run away with the cutting-spade in him;
    </p>
    <p>
     and while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon,
    </p>
    <p>
     had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon-line round
    </p>
    <p>
     his tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose from his flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
     So that tormented to madness, he was now churning through the water,
    </p>
    <p>
     violently flailing with his flexible tail, and tossing the keen
    </p>
    <p>
     spade about him, wounding and murdering his own comrades.
    </p>
    <p>
     This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their
    </p>
    <p>
     stationary fright.  First, the whales forming the margin of our lake
    </p>
    <p>
     began to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted
    </p>
    <p>
     by half spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly
    </p>
    <p>
     to heave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished;
    </p>
    <p>
     in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central circles
    </p>
    <p>
     began to swim in thickening clusters.  Yes, the long calm was departing.
    </p>
    <p>
     A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like to the tumultuous
    </p>
    <p>
     masses of block-ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in Spring,
    </p>
    <p>
     the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre,
    </p>
    <p>
     as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain.  Instantly Starbuck
    </p>
    <p>
     and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck taking the stern.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oars!  Oars!" he intensely whispered, seizing the helm--"gripe
    </p>
    <p>
     your oars, and clutch your souls, now!  My God, men, stand by!
    </p>
    <p>
     Shove him off, you Queequeg--the whale there!--prick him!--hit him!
    </p>
    <p>
     Stand up--stand up, and stay so!  Spring men--pull, men; never mind
    </p>
    <p>
     their backs--scrape them!--scrape away!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks,
    </p>
    <p>
     leaving a narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths.
    </p>
    <p>
     But by desperate endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening;
    </p>
    <p>
     then giving way rapidly, and at the same time earnestly watching
    </p>
    <p>
     for another outlet.  After many similar hair-breadth escapes, we at
    </p>
    <p>
     last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles,
    </p>
    <p>
     but now crossed by random whales, all violently making for one centre.
    </p>
    <p>
     This lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg's
    </p>
    <p>
     hat, who, while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales,
    </p>
    <p>
     had his hat taken clean from his head by the air-eddy made by the sudden
    </p>
    <p>
     tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by.
    </p>
    <p>
     Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was,
    </p>
    <p>
     it soon resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement;
    </p>
    <p>
     for having clumped together at last in one dense body,
    </p>
    <p>
     they then renewed their onward flight with augmented fleetness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Further pursuit was useless; but the boats still lingered in their
    </p>
    <p>
     wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern,
    </p>
    <p>
     and likewise to secure one which Flask had killed and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
     The waif is a pennoned pole, two or three of which are carried
    </p>
    <p>
     by every boat; and which, when additional game is at hand,
    </p>
    <p>
     are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     both to mark its place on the sea, and also as token of
    </p>
    <p>
     prior possession, should the boats of any other ship draw near.
    </p>
    <p>
     The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that
    </p>
    <p>
     sagacious saying in the Fishery,--the more whales the less fish.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of all the drugged whales only one was captured.
    </p>
    <p>
     The rest contrived to escape for the time, but only to be taken,
    </p>
    <p>
     as will hereafter be seen, by some other craft than the Pequod.

     CHAPTER 88
    </head>
    <p>
     Schools and Schoolmasters
    </p>
    <p>
     The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd
    </p>
    <p>
     of Sperm Whales, and there was also then given the probable
    </p>
    <p>
     cause inducing those vast aggregations.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must
    </p>
    <p>
     have been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are
    </p>
    <p>
     occasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each.
    </p>
    <p>
     Such bands are known as schools.  They generally are of two sorts;
    </p>
    <p>
     those composed almost entirely of females, and those mustering none
    </p>
    <p>
     but young vigorous males, or bulls as they are familiarly designated.
    </p>
    <p>
     In cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see
    </p>
    <p>
     a male of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm,
    </p>
    <p>
     evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight
    </p>
    <p>
     of his ladies.  In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman,
    </p>
    <p>
     swimming about over the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by all
    </p>
    <p>
     the solaces and endearments of the harem.  The contrast between this
    </p>
    <p>
     Ottoman and his concubines is striking; because, while he is always
    </p>
    <p>
     of the largest leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth,
    </p>
    <p>
     are not more than one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male.
    </p>
    <p>
     They are comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half
    </p>
    <p>
     a dozen yards round the waist.  Nevertheless, it cannot be denied,
    </p>
    <p>
     that upon the whole they are hereditarily entitled to en bon point.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their
    </p>
    <p>
     indolent ramblings.  Like fashionables, they are for ever
    </p>
    <p>
     on the move in leisurely search of variety.  You meet them
    </p>
    <p>
     on the Line in time for the full flower of the Equatorial
    </p>
    <p>
     feeding season, having just returned, perhaps, from spending
    </p>
    <p>
     the summer in the Northern seas, and so cheating summer of all
    </p>
    <p>
     unpleasant weariness and warmth.  By the time they have lounged
    </p>
    <p>
     up and down the promenade of the Equator awhile, they start
    </p>
    <p>
     for the Oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there,
    </p>
    <p>
     and so evade the other excessive temperature of the year.
    </p>
    <p>
     When serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange
    </p>
    <p>
     suspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his
    </p>
    <p>
     interesting family.  Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan coming
    </p>
    <p>
     that way, presume to draw confidentially close to one of the ladies,
    </p>
    <p>
     with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him, and chases him away!
    </p>
    <p>
     High times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him
    </p>
    <p>
     are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss;
    </p>
    <p>
     though do what the Bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious
    </p>
    <p>
     Lothario out of his bed; for alas! all fish bed in common.
    </p>
    <p>
     As ashore, the ladies often cause the most terrible duels among
    </p>
    <p>
     their rival admirers; just so with the whales, who sometimes come
    </p>
    <p>
     to deadly battle, and all for love.  They fence with their long
    </p>
    <p>
     lower jaws, sometimes locking them together, and so striving for
    </p>
    <p>
     the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not a few are captured having the deep scars of these encounters,--
    </p>
    <p>
     furrowed heads, broken teeth, scolloped fins; and in some instances,
    </p>
    <p>
     wrenched and dislocated mouths.
    </p>
    <p>
     But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away
    </p>
    <p>
     at the first rush of the harem's lord, then is it very diverting
    </p>
    <p>
     to watch that lord.  Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among
    </p>
    <p>
     them again and revels there awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity
    </p>
    <p>
     to young Lothario, like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among
    </p>
    <p>
     his thousand concubines.  Granting other whales to be in sight,
    </p>
    <p>
     the fisherman will seldom give chase to one of these Grand Turks;
    </p>
    <p>
     for these Grand Turks are too lavish of their strength,
    </p>
    <p>
     and hence their unctuousness is small.  As for the sons and
    </p>
    <p>
     the daughters they beget, why, those sons and daughters must
    </p>
    <p>
     take care of themselves; at least, with only the maternal help.
    </p>
    <p>
     For like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named,
    </p>
    <p>
     my Lord Whale has no taste for the nursery, however much
    </p>
    <p>
     for the bower; and so, being a great traveller, he leaves his
    </p>
    <p>
     anonymous babies all over the world; every baby an exotic.
    </p>
    <p>
     In good time, nevertheless, as the ardor of youth declines;
    </p>
    <p>
     as years and dumps increase; as reflection lends her solemn pauses;
    </p>
    <p>
     in short, as a general lassitude overtakes the sated Turk;
    </p>
    <p>
     then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maidens;
    </p>
    <p>
     our Ottoman enters upon the impotent, repentant, admonitory stage
    </p>
    <p>
     of life, forswears, disbands the harem, and grown to an exemplary,
    </p>
    <p>
     sulky old soul, goes about all alone among the meridians and
    </p>
    <p>
     parallels saying his prayers, and warning each young Leviathan
    </p>
    <p>
     from his amorous errors.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so is
    </p>
    <p>
     the lord and master of that school technically known as the schoolmaster.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is therefore not in strict character, however admirably satirical,
    </p>
    <p>
     that after going to school himself, he should then go abroad
    </p>
    <p>
     inculcating not what he learned there, but the folly of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     His title, schoolmaster, would very naturally seem derived from
    </p>
    <p>
     the name bestowed upon the harem itself, but some have surmised
    </p>
    <p>
     that the man who first thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     must have read the memoirs of Vidocq, and informed himself what sort
    </p>
    <p>
     of a country-schoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his younger days,
    </p>
    <p>
     and what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into
    </p>
    <p>
     some of his pupils.
    </p>
    <p>
     The same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster
    </p>
    <p>
     whale betakes himself in his advancing years, is true
    </p>
    <p>
     of all aged Sperm Whales.  Almost universally, a lone whale--
    </p>
    <p>
     as a solitary Leviathan is called--proves an ancient one.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel Boone, he will have no
    </p>
    <p>
     one near him but Nature herself; and her he takes to wife
    </p>
    <p>
     in the wilderness of waters, and the best of wives she is,
    </p>
    <p>
     though she keeps so many moody secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
     The schools composing none but young and vigorous males,
    </p>
    <p>
     previously mentioned, offer a strong contrast to the harem schools.
    </p>
    <p>
     For while those female whales are characteristically timid,
    </p>
    <p>
     the young males, or forty-barrel-bulls, as they call them,
    </p>
    <p>
     are by far the most pugnacious of all Leviathans, and proverbially
    </p>
    <p>
     the most dangerous to encounter; excepting those wondrous
    </p>
    <p>
     grey-headed, grizzled whales, sometimes met, and these will fight
    </p>
    <p>
     you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like a mob of young collegians, they are full of fight, fun,
    </p>
    <p>
     and wickedness, tumbling round the world at such a reckless,
    </p>
    <p>
     rollicking rate, that no prudent underwriter would insure them
    </p>
    <p>
     any more than he would a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard.  They soon
    </p>
    <p>
     relinquish this turbulence though, and when about three-fourths grown,
    </p>
    <p>
     break up, and separately go about in quest of settlements,
    </p>
    <p>
     that is, harems.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another point of difference between the male and female schools
    </p>
    <p>
     is still more characteristic of the sexes.  Say you strike
    </p>
    <p>
     a Forty-barrel-bull--poor devil! all his comrades quit him.
    </p>
    <p>
     But strike a member of the harem school, and her companions swim
    </p>
    <p>
     around her with every token of concern, sometimes lingering
    </p>
    <p>
     so near her and so long, as themselves to fall a prey.

     CHAPTER 89

    <p>
     Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish
    </p>
    <p>
     The allusion to the waifs and waif-poles in the last chapter
    </p>
    <p>
     but one, necessitates some account of the laws and regulations
    </p>
    <p>
     of the whale fishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand
    </p>
    <p>
     symbol and badge.
    </p>
    <p>
     It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company,
    </p>
    <p>
     a whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed
    </p>
    <p>
     and captured by another vessel; and herein are indirectly comprised
    </p>
    <p>
     many minor contingencies, all partaking of this one grand feature.
    </p>
    <p>
     For example,--after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm;
    </p>
    <p>
     and drifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a second whaler, who,
    </p>
    <p>
     in a calm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life or line.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between
    </p>
    <p>
     the fishermen, were there not some written or unwritten, universal,
    </p>
    <p>
     undisputed law applicable to all cases.
    </p>
    <p>
     Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment,
    </p>
    <p>
     was that of Holland.  It was decreed by the States-General in A.D. 1695.
    </p>
    <p>
     But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law,
    </p>
    <p>
     yet the American fishermen have been their own legislators
    </p>
    <p>
     and lawyers in this matter.  They have provided a system which
    </p>
    <p>
     for terse comprehensiveness surpasses Justinian's Pandects and
    </p>
    <p>
     the By-laws of the Chinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling
    </p>
    <p>
     with other People's Business.  Yes; these laws might be engraven
    </p>
    <p>
     on a Queen Anne's farthing, or the barb of a harpoon, and worn
    </p>
    <p>
     round the neck, so small are they.
    </p>
    <p>
     I. A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.
    </p>
    <p>
     II.  A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.
    </p>
    <p>
     But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable
    </p>
    <p>
     brevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries
    </p>
    <p>
     to expound it.
    </p>
    <p>
     First:  What is a Fast-Fish? Alive or dead a fish is technically fast,
    </p>
    <p>
     when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any medium
    </p>
    <p>
     at all controllable by the occupant or occupants,--a mast, an oar,
    </p>
    <p>
     a nine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it is all
    </p>
    <p>
     the same.  Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif,
    </p>
    <p>
     or any other recognized symbol of possession; so long as the party
    </p>
    <p>
     wailing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside,
    </p>
    <p>
     as well as their intention so to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     These are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the whalemen
    </p>
    <p>
     themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks--
    </p>
    <p>
     the Coke-upon-Littleton of the fist.  True, among the more upright
    </p>
    <p>
     and honorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases,
    </p>
    <p>
     where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim
    </p>
    <p>
     possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party.
    </p>
    <p>
     But others are by no means so scrupulous.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover
    </p>
    <p>
     litigated in England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth
    </p>
    <p>
     that after a hard chase of a whale in the Northern seas;
    </p>
    <p>
     and when indeed they (the plaintiffs) had succeeded in harpooning
    </p>
    <p>
     the fish; they were at last, through peril of their lives,
    </p>
    <p>
     obliged to forsake not only their lines, but their boat itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ultimately the defendants (the crew of another ship)
    </p>
    <p>
     came up with the whale, struck, killed, seized, and finally
    </p>
    <p>
     appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs.
    </p>
    <p>
     And when those defendants were remonstrated with, their captain
    </p>
    <p>
     snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs' teeth, and assured
    </p>
    <p>
     them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done,
    </p>
    <p>
     he would now retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which had
    </p>
    <p>
     remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value
    </p>
    <p>
     of their whale, line, harpoons, and boat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough
    </p>
    <p>
     was the judge.  In the course of the defence, the witty
    </p>
    <p>
     Erskine went on to illustrate his position, by alluding to a
    </p>
    <p>
     recent crim.  con.  case, wherein a gentleman, after in vain
    </p>
    <p>
     trying to bridle his wife's viciousness, had at last abandoned
    </p>
    <p>
     her upon the seas of life; but in the course of years, repenting of
    </p>
    <p>
     that step, he instituted an action to recover possession of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Erskine was on the other side; and he then supported it by saying,
    </p>
    <p>
     that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady,
    </p>
    <p>
     and had once had her fast, and only by reason of the great
    </p>
    <p>
     stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned her;
    </p>
    <p>
     yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish;
    </p>
    <p>
     and therefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her,
    </p>
    <p>
     the lady then became that subsequent gentleman's property,
    </p>
    <p>
     along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the whale
    </p>
    <p>
     and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     These pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard,
    </p>
    <p>
     the very learned Judge in set terms decided, to wit,--
    </p>
    <p>
     That as for the boat, he awarded it to the plaintiffs,
    </p>
    <p>
     because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives;
    </p>
    <p>
     but that with regard to the controverted whale, harpoons,
    </p>
    <p>
     and line, they belonged to the defendants; the whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     because it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture;
    </p>
    <p>
     and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off
    </p>
    <p>
     with them, it (the fish) acquired a property in those articles;
    </p>
    <p>
     and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now the defendants afterwards took the fish; ergo, the aforesaid
    </p>
    <p>
     articles were theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
     A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge,
    </p>
    <p>
     might possibly object to it.  But ploughed up to the primary rock
    </p>
    <p>
     of the matter, the two great principles laid down in the twin
    </p>
    <p>
     whaling laws previously quoted, and applied and elucidated
    </p>
    <p>
     by Lord Ellenborough in the above cited case; these two laws
    </p>
    <p>
     touching Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish, I say, will on reflection,
    </p>
    <p>
     be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence;
    </p>
    <p>
     For notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Temple of the Law, like the Temple of the Philistines,
    </p>
    <p>
     has but two props to stand on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Is it not a saying in every one's mouth, Possession is half of the law:
    </p>
    <p>
     that is, regardless of how the thing came into possession?
    </p>
    <p>
     But often possession is the whole of the law.  What are the sinews
    </p>
    <p>
     and souls of Russian serfs and Republican slaves but Fast-Fish,
    </p>
    <p>
     whereof possession is the whole of the law?  What to the rapacious
    </p>
    <p>
     landlord is the widow's last mite but a Fast-Fish? What is yonder
    </p>
    <p>
     undetected villain's marble mansion with a doorplate for a waif;
    </p>
    <p>
     what is that but a Fast-Fish? What is the ruinous discount
    </p>
    <p>
     which Mordecai, the broker, gets from the poor Woebegone,
    </p>
    <p>
     the bankrupt, on a loan to keep Woebegone's family from starvation;
    </p>
    <p>
     what is that ruinous discount but a Fast-Fish? What is the Archbishop
    </p>
    <p>
     of Savesoul's income of 100,000 pounds seized from the scant bread
    </p>
    <p>
     and cheese of hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers
    </p>
    <p>
     (all sure of heaven without any of Savesoul's help) what is that globular
    </p>
    <p>
     100,000 but a Fast-Fish. What are the Duke of Dunder's hereditary towns
    </p>
    <p>
     and hamlets but Fast-Fish? What to that redoubted harpooneer, John Bull,
    </p>
    <p>
     is poor Ireland, but a Fast-Fish? What to that apostolic lancer,
    </p>
    <p>
     Brother Jonathan, is Texas but a Fast-Fish? And concerning all these,
    </p>
    <p>
     is not Possession the whole of the law?
    </p>
    <p>
     But if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable,
    </p>
    <p>
     the kindred doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so.
    </p>
    <p>
     That is internationally and universally applicable.
    </p>
    <p>
     What was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus
    </p>
    <p>
     struck the Spanish standard by way of wailing it for his royal
    </p>
    <p>
     master and mistress?  What was Poland to the Czar?  What Greece
    </p>
    <p>
     to the Turk?  What India to England?  What at last will Mexico
    </p>
    <p>
     be to the United States?  All Loose-Fish.
    </p>
    <p>
     What are the Rights of Man and the Liberties of the World but
    </p>
    <p>
     Loose-Fish? What all men's minds and opinions but Loose-Fish? What
    </p>
    <p>
     is the principle of religious belief in them but a Loose-Fish? What
    </p>
    <p>
     to the ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers
    </p>
    <p>
     but Loose-Fish? What is the great globe itself but a Loose-Fish? And
    </p>
    <p>
     what are you, reader, but a Loose-Fish and a Fast-Fish, too?

     "De balena vero sufficit, si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam."

    <p>
     BRACTON, L. 3, C. 3.
    </p>
    <p>
     Latin from the books of the Laws of England, which taken along with
    </p>
    <p>
     the context, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast
    </p>
    <p>
     of that land, the King, as Honorary Grand Harpooneer, must have
    </p>
    <p>
     the head, and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail.
    </p>
    <p>
     A division which, in the whale, is much like halving an apple; there is
    </p>
    <p>
     no intermediate remainder.  Now as this law, under a modified form,
    </p>
    <p>
     is to this day in force in England; and as it offers in various respects
    </p>
    <p>
     a strange anomaly touching the general law of Fast--and Loose-Fish,
    </p>
    <p>
     it is here treated of in a separate chapter, on the same courteous
    </p>
    <p>
     principle that prompts the English railways to be at the expense of a
    </p>
    <p>
     separate car, specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the first place, in curious proof of the fact that the above-mentioned
    </p>
    <p>
     law is still in force, I proceed to lay before you a circumstance-that
    </p>
    <p>
     happened within the last two years.
    </p>
    <p>
     It seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich,
    </p>
    <p>
     or some one of the Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded
    </p>
    <p>
     in killing and beaching a fine whale which they had originally
    </p>
    <p>
     descried afar off from the shore.  Now the Cinque Ports are
    </p>
    <p>
     partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman
    </p>
    <p>
     or beadle, called a Lord Warden.  Holding the office directly
    </p>
    <p>
     from the crown, I believe, all the royal emoluments incident
    </p>
    <p>
     to the Cinque Port territories become by assignment his.
    </p>
    <p>
     By some writers this office is called a sinecure.  But not so.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in fobbing
    </p>
    <p>
     his perquisites; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same
    </p>
    <p>
     fobbing of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their
    </p>
    <p>
     trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled
    </p>
    <p>
     their fat fish high and dry, promising themselves a good 150 pounds
    </p>
    <p>
     from the precious oil and bone; and in fantasy sipping rare tea
    </p>
    <p>
     with their wives, and good ale with their cronies, upon the strength
    </p>
    <p>
     of their respective shares; up steps a very learned and most Christian
    </p>
    <p>
     and charitable gentleman, with a copy of Blackstone under his arm;
    </p>
    <p>
     and laying it upon the whale's head, he says--"Hands off! this fish,
    </p>
    <p>
     my masters, is a Fast-Fish. I seize it as the Lord Warden's." Upon this
    </p>
    <p>
     the poor mariners in their respectful consternation--so truly English--
    </p>
    <p>
     knowing not what to say, fall to vigorously scratching their heads
    </p>
    <p>
     all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
     But that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soften the hard heart
    </p>
    <p>
     of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone.  At length one
    </p>
    <p>
     of them, after long scratching about for his ideas, made bold to speak,
    </p>
    <p>
     "Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "The Duke."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "It is his."
    </p>
    <p>
     "We have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense,
    </p>
    <p>
     and is all that to go to the Duke's benefit; we getting nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     at all for our pains but our blisters?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "It is his."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode
    </p>
    <p>
     of getting a livelihood?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "It is his."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share
    </p>
    <p>
     of this whale."
    </p>
    <p>
     "It is his."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Won't the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "It is his."
    </p>
    <p>
     In a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of
    </p>
    <p>
     Wellington received the money.  Thinking that viewed in some particular
    </p>
    <p>
     lights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree
    </p>
    <p>
     be deemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman
    </p>
    <p>
     of the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace, begging him
    </p>
    <p>
     to take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
     To which my Lord Duke in substance replied (both letters were published)
    </p>
    <p>
     that he had already done so, and received the money, and would be obliged
    </p>
    <p>
     to the reverend gentleman if for the future he (the reverend gentleman)
    </p>
    <p>
     would decline meddling with other people's business.  Is this the still
    </p>
    <p>
     militant old man, standing at the corners of the three kingdoms,
    </p>
    <p>
     on all hands coercing alms of beggars?
    </p>
    <p>
     It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke
    </p>
    <p>
     to the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign.  We must needs
    </p>
    <p>
     inquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested
    </p>
    <p>
     with that right.  The law itself has already been set forth.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Plowdon gives us the reason for it.  Says Plowdon, the whale so caught
    </p>
    <p>
     belongs to the King and Queen, "because of its superior excellence."
    </p>
    <p>
     And by the soundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent
    </p>
    <p>
     argument in such matters.
    </p>
    <p>
     But why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail?
    </p>
    <p>
     A reason for that, ye lawyers!
    </p>
    <p>
     In his treatise on "Queen-Gold," or Queen-pin-money, an old
    </p>
    <p>
     King's Bench author, one William Prynne, thus discourseth:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ye tail is ye Queen's, that ye Queen's wardrobe may be supplied
    </p>
    <p>
     with ye whalebone."  Now this was written at a time when the black
    </p>
    <p>
     limber bone of the Greenland or Right whale was largely used
    </p>
    <p>
     in ladies' bodices.  But this same bone is not in the tail;
    </p>
    <p>
     it is in the head, which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer
    </p>
    <p>
     like Prynne.  But is the Queen a mermaid, to be presented with a tail?
    </p>
    <p>
     An allegorical meaning may lurk here.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers--
    </p>
    <p>
     the whale and the sturgeon; both royal property under certain limitations,
    </p>
    <p>
     and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown's ordinary revenue.
    </p>
    <p>
     I know not that any other author has hinted of the matter;
    </p>
    <p>
     but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided
    </p>
    <p>
     in the same way as the whale, the King receiving the highly dense
    </p>
    <p>
     and elastic head peculiar to that fish, which, symbolically regarded,
    </p>
    <p>
     may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality.
    </p>
    <p>
     And thus there seems a reason in all things, even in law.

    <p>
     The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud
    </p>
    <p>
     "In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch
    </p>
    <p>
     of this Leviathan, insufferable fetor denying not inquiry."
    </p>
    <p>
     SIR T. BROWNE, V. E.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted,
    </p>
    <p>
     and when we were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapory,
    </p>
    <p>
     mid-day sea, that the many noses on the Pequod's deck proved
    </p>
    <p>
     more vigilant discoverers than the three pairs of eyes aloft.
    </p>
    <p>
     A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will bet something now," said Stubb, "that somewhere hereabouts
    </p>
    <p>
     are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day.
    </p>
    <p>
     I thought they would keel up before long."
    </p>
    <p>
     Presently, the vapors in advance slid aside; and there in the distance
    </p>
    <p>
     lay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must
    </p>
    <p>
     be alongside.  As we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colors
    </p>
    <p>
     from his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that circled,
    </p>
    <p>
     and hovered, and swooped around him, it was plain that the whale alongside
    </p>
    <p>
     must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale, that is, a whale that has
    </p>
    <p>
     died unmolested on the sea, and so floated an unappropriated corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
     It may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale;
    </p>
    <p>
     worse than an Assyrian city in the plague, when the living are incompetent
    </p>
    <p>
     to bury the departed.  So intolerable indeed is it regarded by some,
    </p>
    <p>
     that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet are there those who will still do it; notwithstanding the fact
    </p>
    <p>
     that the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality,
    </p>
    <p>
     and by no means of the nature of attar-of-rose.
    </p>
    <p>
     Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw
    </p>
    <p>
     that the Frenchman had a second whale alongside; and this
    </p>
    <p>
     second whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the first.
    </p>
    <p>
     In truth, it turned out to be one of those problematical whales
    </p>
    <p>
     that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia,
    </p>
    <p>
     or indigestion; leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely
    </p>
    <p>
     bankrupt of anything like oil.  Nevertheless, in the proper
    </p>
    <p>
     place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn
    </p>
    <p>
     up his nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun
    </p>
    <p>
     blasted whales in general.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb
    </p>
    <p>
     vowed he recognized his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines
    </p>
    <p>
     that were knotted round the tail of one of these whales.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There's a pretty fellow, now," he banteringly laughed,
    </p>
    <p>
     standing in the ship's bows, "there's a jackal for ye!
    </p>
    <p>
     I well know that these Crappoes of Frenchmen are but poor devils
    </p>
    <p>
     in the fishery; sometimes lowering their boats for breakers,
    </p>
    <p>
     mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes, and sometimes sailing
    </p>
    <p>
     from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow candles,
    </p>
    <p>
     and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they will get won't
    </p>
    <p>
     be enough to dip the Captain's wick into; aye, we all know these things;
    </p>
    <p>
     but look ye, here's a Crappo that is content with our leavings,
    </p>
    <p>
     the drugged whale there, I mean; aye, and is content too with
    </p>
    <p>
     scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Poor devil!  I say, pass round a hat, some one, and let's
    </p>
    <p>
     make him a present of a little oil for dear charity's sake.
    </p>
    <p>
     For what oil he'll get from that drugged whale there,
    </p>
    <p>
     wouldn't be fit to burn in a jail; no, not in a condemned cell.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as for the other whale, why, I'll agree to get more oil by
    </p>
    <p>
     chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours, than he'll
    </p>
    <p>
     get from that bundle of bones; though, now that I think of it,
    </p>
    <p>
     it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil;
    </p>
    <p>
     yes, ambergris.  I wonder now if our old man has thought of that.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's worth trying.  Yes, I'm for it;" and so saying he started
    </p>
    <p>
     for the quarter-deck.
    </p>
    <p>
     By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that
    </p>
    <p>
     whether or no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell,
    </p>
    <p>
     with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Issuing from the cabin, Stubb now called his boat's crew,
    </p>
    <p>
     and pulled off for the stranger.  Drawing across her bow,
    </p>
    <p>
     he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful French taste,
    </p>
    <p>
     the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in the likeness
    </p>
    <p>
     of a huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for thorns
    </p>
    <p>
     had copper spikes projecting from it here and there; the whole
    </p>
    <p>
     terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red color.
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon her head boards, in large gilt letters, he read "Bouton
    </p>
    <p>
     de Rose,"--Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and this was the romantic
    </p>
    <p>
     name of this aromatic ship.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though Stubb did not understand the Bouton part of the inscription,
    </p>
    <p>
     yet the word rose, and the bulbous figure-head put together,
    </p>
    <p>
     sufficiently explained the whole to him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "A wooden rose-bud, eh?" he cried with his hand to his nose,
    </p>
    <p>
     "that will do very well; but how like all creation it smells!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck,
    </p>
    <p>
     he had to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come
    </p>
    <p>
     close to the blasted whale; and so talk over it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose,
    </p>
    <p>
     he bawled--"Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you
    </p>
    <p>
     Bouton-de-Roses that speak English?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned
    </p>
    <p>
     out to be the chief-mate.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "What whale?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "The White Whale--a Sperm Whale--Moby Dick, have ye seen him?
    </p>
    <p>
     "Never heard of such a whale.  Cachalot Blanche!  White Whale--no."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Very good, then; good bye now, and I'll call again in a minute."
    </p>
    <p>
     Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning
    </p>
    <p>
     over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two hands
    </p>
    <p>
     into a trumpet and shouted--"No, Sir!  No!"  Upon which Ahab retired,
    </p>
    <p>
     and Stubb returned to the Frenchman.
    </p>
    <p>
     He now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the chains,
    </p>
    <p>
     and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort of bag.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What's the matter with your nose, there?" said Stubb.  "Broke it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I wish it was broken, or that I didn't have any nose at all!"
    </p>
    <p>
     answered the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job
    </p>
    <p>
     he was at very much.  "But what are you holding yours for?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, nothing!  It's a wax nose; I have to hold it on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fine day, ain't it?  Air rather gardenny, I should say;
    </p>
    <p>
     throw us a bunch of posies, will ye, Bouton-de-Rose?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "What in the devil's name do you want here?" roared the Guernseyman,
    </p>
    <p>
     flying into a sudden passion.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh! keep cool--cool? yes, that's the word! why don't you
    </p>
    <p>
     pack those whales in ice while you're working at 'em?
    </p>
    <p>
     But joking aside, though; do you know, Rose-bud, that it's
    </p>
    <p>
     all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales?
    </p>
    <p>
     As for that dried up one, there, he hasn't a gill in
    </p>
    <p>
     his whole carcase."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know that well enough; but, d'ye see, the Captain here won't believe
    </p>
    <p>
     it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer before.
    </p>
    <p>
     But come aboard, and mayhap he'll believe you, if he won't me;
    </p>
    <p>
     and so I'll get out of this dirty scrape."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,"
    </p>
    <p>
     rejoined Stubb, and with that he soon mounted to the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
     There a queer scene presented itself.  The sailors,
    </p>
    <p>
     in tasselled caps of red worsted, were getting the heavy tackles
    </p>
    <p>
     in readiness for the whales.  But they worked rather slow
    </p>
    <p>
     and talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good humor.
    </p>
    <p>
     All their noses upwardly projected from their faces like
    </p>
    <p>
     so many jibbooms.  Now and then pairs of them would drop
    </p>
    <p>
     their work, and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some thinking they would catch the plague, dipped oakum
    </p>
    <p>
     in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their nostrils.
    </p>
    <p>
     Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short off
    </p>
    <p>
     at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it
    </p>
    <p>
     constantly filled their olfactories.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding
    </p>
    <p>
     from the Captain's round-house abaft; and looking in that direction
    </p>
    <p>
     saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar
    </p>
    <p>
     from within.  This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain
    </p>
    <p>
     remonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken
    </p>
    <p>
     himself to the Captain's round-house (cabinet he called it)
    </p>
    <p>
     to avoid the pest; but still, could not help yelling out his
    </p>
    <p>
     entreaties and indignations at times.
    </p>
    <p>
     Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to
    </p>
    <p>
     the Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger
    </p>
    <p>
     mate expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus,
    </p>
    <p>
     who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man
    </p>
    <p>
     had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris.
    </p>
    <p>
     He therefore held his peace on that head, but otherwise was quite
    </p>
    <p>
     frank and confidential with him, so that the two quickly concocted
    </p>
    <p>
     a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the Captain,
    </p>
    <p>
     without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
     According to this little plan of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under cover
    </p>
    <p>
     of an interpreter's office, was to tell the Captain what he pleased,
    </p>
    <p>
     but as coming from Stubb; and as for Stubb, he was to utter any nonsense
    </p>
    <p>
     that should come uppermost in him during the interview.
    </p>
    <p>
     By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was a small and dark, but rather delicate looking man
    </p>
    <p>
     for a sea-captain, with large whiskers and moustache, however;
    </p>
    <p>
     and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watch-seals at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
     To this gentleman, Stubb was now politely introduced by
    </p>
    <p>
     the Guernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put on the aspect
    </p>
    <p>
     of interpreting between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What shall I say to him first?" said he.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why," said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals,
    </p>
    <p>
     "you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish
    </p>
    <p>
     to me, though I don't pretend to be a judge."
    </p>
    <p>
     "He says, Monsieur," said the Guernsey-man, in French,
    </p>
    <p>
     turning to his captain, "that only yesterday his ship spoke
    </p>
    <p>
     a vessel, whose captain and chief-mate, with six sailors,
    </p>
    <p>
     had all died of a fever caught from a blasted whale they
    </p>
    <p>
     had brought alongside."
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What now?" said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I
    </p>
    <p>
     have eyed him carefully, I'm quite certain that he's no
    </p>
    <p>
     more fit to command a whale-ship than a St. Jago monkey.
    </p>
    <p>
     In fact, tell him from me he's a baboon."
    </p>
    <p>
     "He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     the dried one, is far more deadly than the blasted one;
    </p>
    <p>
     in fine, Monsieur, he conjures us, as we value our lives,
    </p>
    <p>
     to cut loose from these fish."
    </p>
    <p>
     Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded
    </p>
    <p>
     his crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once
    </p>
    <p>
     cast loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What now?" said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that--that--in fact,
    </p>
    <p>
     tell him I've diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps somebody else."
    </p>
    <p>
     "He says, Monsieur, that he's very happy to have been of any
    </p>
    <p>
     service to us."
    </p>
    <p>
     Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties
    </p>
    <p>
     (meaning himself and mate), and concluded by inviting Stubb down into
    </p>
    <p>
     his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.
    </p>
    <p>
     "He wants you to take a glass of wine with him," said the interpreter.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thank him heartily; but tell him it's against my principles to drink
    </p>
    <p>
     with the man I've diddled.  In fact, tell him I must go."
    </p>
    <p>
     "He says, Monsieur, that his principles won't admit of his drinking;
    </p>
    <p>
     but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then Monsieur
    </p>
    <p>
     had best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from these whales,
    </p>
    <p>
     for it's so calm they won't drift."
    </p>
    <p>
     By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat,
    </p>
    <p>
     hailed the Guernsey-man to this effect,--that having a long
    </p>
    <p>
     tow-line in his boat, he would do what he could to help them,
    </p>
    <p>
     by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ship's side.
    </p>
    <p>
     While the Frenchman's boats, then, were engaged in towing the ship
    </p>
    <p>
     one way, Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way,
    </p>
    <p>
     ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow-line.
    </p>
    <p>
     Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale;
    </p>
    <p>
     hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance,
    </p>
    <p>
     while the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb's whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whereupon Stubb quickly pulled to the floating body, and hailing
    </p>
    <p>
     the Pequod to give notice of his intentions, at once proceeded to reap
    </p>
    <p>
     the fruit of his unrighteous cunning.  Seizing his sharp boat-spade,
    </p>
    <p>
     he commenced an excavation in the body, a little behind the side fin.
    </p>
    <p>
     You would almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea;
    </p>
    <p>
     and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was
    </p>
    <p>
     like turning up old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam.
    </p>
    <p>
     His boat's crew were all in high excitement, eagerly helping their chief,
    </p>
    <p>
     and looking as anxious as gold-hunters.
    </p>
    <p>
     And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking,
    </p>
    <p>
     and screaming, and yelling, and fighting around them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stubb was beginning to look disappointed, especially as the horrible
    </p>
    <p>
     nosegay increased, when suddenly from out the very heart of
    </p>
    <p>
     this plague, there stole a faint stream of perfume, which flowed
    </p>
    <p>
     through the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it,
    </p>
    <p>
     as one river will flow into and then along with another,
    </p>
    <p>
     without at all blending with it for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I have it, I have it," cried Stubb, with delight, striking something
    </p>
    <p>
     in the subterranean regions, "a purse! a purse!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out
    </p>
    <p>
     handfuls of something that looked like ripe Windsor soap,
    </p>
    <p>
     or rich mottled old cheese; very unctuous and savory withal.
    </p>
    <p>
     You might easily dent it with your thumb; it is of a hue
    </p>
    <p>
     between yellow and ash color.  And this, good friends,
    </p>
    <p>
     is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably lost
    </p>
    <p>
     in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured
    </p>
    <p>
     were it not for impatient Ahab's loud command to Stubb to desist,
    </p>
    <p>
     and come on board, else the ship would bid them good-bye.

     CHAPTER 92
    </head>
    <p>
     Ambergris
    </p>
    <p>
     Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as an
    </p>
    <p>
     article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain Coffin
    </p>
    <p>
     was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that subject.
    </p>
    <p>
     For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day,
    </p>
    <p>
     the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself,
    </p>
    <p>
     a problem to the learned.  Though the word ambergris is but the French
    </p>
    <p>
     compound for grey amber, yet the two substances are quite distinct.
    </p>
    <p>
     For amber, though at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in some
    </p>
    <p>
     far inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Besides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance,
    </p>
    <p>
     used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but ambergris
    </p>
    <p>
     is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely used
    </p>
    <p>
     in perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and pomatum.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for the same
    </p>
    <p>
     purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter's in Rome.  Some wine
    </p>
    <p>
     merchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should
    </p>
    <p>
     regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels
    </p>
    <p>
     of a sick whale!  Yet so it is.  By some, ambergris is supposed to be
    </p>
    <p>
     the cause, and by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     How to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering
    </p>
    <p>
     three or four boat loads of Brandreth's pills, and then running out
    </p>
    <p>
     of harm's way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
     I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris,
    </p>
    <p>
     certain hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought
    </p>
    <p>
     might be sailors' trousers buttons; but it afterwards turned
    </p>
    <p>
     out that they were nothing, more than pieces of small squid
    </p>
    <p>
     bones embalmed in that manner.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris
    </p>
    <p>
     should be found in the heart of such decay; is this nothing?
    </p>
    <p>
     Bethink thee of that saying of St. Paul in Corinthians,
    </p>
    <p>
     about corruption and incorruption; how that we are sown in dishonor,
    </p>
    <p>
     but raised in glory.  And likewise call to mind that saying
    </p>
    <p>
     of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk.
    </p>
    <p>
     Also forget not the strange fact that of all things of ill-savor,
    </p>
    <p>
     Cologne-water, in its rudimental manufacturing stages,
    </p>
    <p>
     is the worst.
    </p>
    <p>
     I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal,
    </p>
    <p>
     but cannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made
    </p>
    <p>
     against whalemen, and which, in the estimation of some already
    </p>
    <p>
     biased minds, might be considered as indirectly substantiated
    </p>
    <p>
     by what has been said of the Frenchman's two whales.
    </p>
    <p>
     Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been disproved,
    </p>
    <p>
     that the vocation of whaling is throughout a slatternly,
    </p>
    <p>
     untidy business.  But there is another thing to rebut.
    </p>
    <p>
     They hint that all whales always smell bad.  Now how did this
    </p>
    <p>
     odious stigma originate?
    </p>
    <p>
     I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out
    </p>
    <p>
     their oil at sea as the Southern ships have always done;
    </p>
    <p>
     but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits, thrust it through
    </p>
    <p>
     the bung holes of large casks, and carry it home in that manner;
    </p>
    <p>
     the shortness of the season in those Icy Seas, and the sudden and
    </p>
    <p>
     violent storms to which they are exposed, forbidding any other course.
    </p>
    <p>
     The consequence is, that upon breaking into the hold, and unloading
    </p>
    <p>
     one of these whale cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a savor is
    </p>
    <p>
     given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old
    </p>
    <p>
     city graveyard, for the foundations of a Lying-in Hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
     I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against
    </p>
    <p>
     whalers may be likewise imputed to the existence on the coast
    </p>
    <p>
     of Greenland, in former times, of a Dutch village called
    </p>
    <p>
     Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which latter name is the one used
    </p>
    <p>
     by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great work on Smells,
    </p>
    <p>
     a text-book on that subject.  As its name imports (smeer, fat;
    </p>
    <p>
     berg, to put up), this village was founded in order to afford
    </p>
    <p>
     a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out,
    </p>
    <p>
     without being taken home to Holland for that purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds;
    </p>
    <p>
     and when the works were in full operation certainly gave forth
    </p>
    <p>
     no very pleasant savor.  But all this is quite different
    </p>
    <p>
     from a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four
    </p>
    <p>
     years perhaps, after completely filling her hold with oil,
    </p>
    <p>
     does not, perhaps, consume fifty days in the business of boiling out;
    </p>
    <p>
     and in the state that it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless.
    </p>
    <p>
     The truth is, that living or dead, if but decently treated,
    </p>
    <p>
     whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor;
    </p>
    <p>
     nor can whalemen be recognised, as the people of the middle
    </p>
    <p>
     ages affected to detect a Jew in the company, by the nose.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant,
    </p>
    <p>
     when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health;
    </p>
    <p>
     taking abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true,
    </p>
    <p>
     seldom in the open air.  I say, that the motion of a Sperm Whale's
    </p>
    <p>
     flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented
    </p>
    <p>
     lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor.  What then shall I liken
    </p>
    <p>
     the Sperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude?
    </p>
    <p>
     Must it not be to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks,
    </p>
    <p>
     and redolent with myrrh, which was led out of an Indian town
    </p>
    <p>
     to do honor to Alexander the Great?

     CHAPTER 93

    <p>
     The Castaway
    </p>
    <p>
     It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a most
    </p>
    <p>
     significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod's crew;
    </p>
    <p>
     an event most lamentable; and which ended in providing the sometimes
    </p>
    <p>
     madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying
    </p>
    <p>
     prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some few hands are reserved called shipkeepers, whose province it
    </p>
    <p>
     is to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     As a general thing, these shipkeepers are as hardy fellows
    </p>
    <p>
     as the men comprising the boats' crews.  But if there happen
    </p>
    <p>
     to be an unduly slender, clumsy, or timorous wight in the ship,
    </p>
    <p>
     that wight is certain to be made a ship-keeper. It was so in the Pequod
    </p>
    <p>
     with the little negro Pippin by nick-name, Pip by abbreviation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Poor Pip! ye have heard of him before; ye must remember his tambourine
    </p>
    <p>
     on that dramatic midnight, so gloomy-jolly.
    </p>
    <p>
     In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony
    </p>
    <p>
     and a white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar color,
    </p>
    <p>
     driven in one eccentric span.  But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature
    </p>
    <p>
     dull and torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over tender-hearted,
    </p>
    <p>
     was at bottom very bright, with that pleasant, genial, jolly brightness
    </p>
    <p>
     peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever enjoy all holidays
    </p>
    <p>
     and festivities with finer, freer relish than any other race.
    </p>
    <p>
     For blacks, the year's calendar should show naught but three hundred
    </p>
    <p>
     and sixty-five Fourth of Julys and New Year's Days.  Nor smile so,
    </p>
    <p>
     while I write that this little black was brilliant, for even blackness has
    </p>
    <p>
     its brilliancy; behold yon lustrous ebony, panelled in king's cabinets.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Pip loved life, and all life's peaceable securities; so that
    </p>
    <p>
     the panic-striking business in which he had somehow unaccountably
    </p>
    <p>
     become entrapped, had most sadly blurred his brightness; though, as ere
    </p>
    <p>
     long will be seen, what was thus temporarily subdued in him,
    </p>
    <p>
     in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange wild fires,
    </p>
    <p>
     that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural lustre
    </p>
    <p>
     with which in his native Tolland County in Connecticut, he had once
    </p>
    <p>
     enlivened many a fiddler's frolic on the green; and at melodious
    </p>
    <p>
     even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned the round horizon into
    </p>
    <p>
     one star-belled tambourine.  So, though in the clear air of day,
    </p>
    <p>
     suspended against a blue-veined neck, the pure-watered diamond drop will
    </p>
    <p>
     healthful glow; yet, when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond
    </p>
    <p>
     in its most impressive lustre, he lays it against a gloomy ground,
    </p>
    <p>
     and then lights it up, not by the sun, but by some unnatural gases.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then come out those fiery effulgences, infernally superb; then the
    </p>
    <p>
     evil-blazing diamond, once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies,
    </p>
    <p>
     looks like some crown-jewel stolen from the King of Hell.  But let
    </p>
    <p>
     us to the story.
    </p>
    <p>
     It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb's after-oarsman
    </p>
    <p>
     chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;
    </p>
    <p>
     and, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;
    </p>
    <p>
     but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale;
    </p>
    <p>
     and therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb
    </p>
    <p>
     observing him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his
    </p>
    <p>
     courageousness to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale;
    </p>
    <p>
     and as the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap,
    </p>
    <p>
     which happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip's seat.
    </p>
    <p>
     The involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap,
    </p>
    <p>
     paddle in hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack
    </p>
    <p>
     whale line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with him,
    </p>
    <p>
     so as to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
     That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line
    </p>
    <p>
     swiftly straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up
    </p>
    <p>
     to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line,
    </p>
    <p>
     which had taken several turns around his chest and neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tashtego stood in the bows.  He was full of the fire of the hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
     He hated Pip for a poltroon.  Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath,
    </p>
    <p>
     he suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,
    </p>
    <p>
     exclaimed interrogatively, "Cut?"  Meantime Pip's blue, choked face
    </p>
    <p>
     plainly looked, Do, for God's sake!  All passed in a flash.
    </p>
    <p>
     In less than half a minute, this entire thing happened.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Damn him, cut!" roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost
    </p>
    <p>
     and Pip was saved.
    </p>
    <p>
     So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed
    </p>
    <p>
     by yells and execrations from the crew.  Tranquilly permitting
    </p>
    <p>
     these irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain,
    </p>
    <p>
     business-like, but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially;
    </p>
    <p>
     and that done, unofficially gave him much wholesome advice.
    </p>
    <p>
     The substance was, Never jump from a boat, Pip, except--but all
    </p>
    <p>
     the rest was indefinite, as the soundest advice ever is.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, in general, Stick to the boat, is your true motto in whaling;
    </p>
    <p>
     but cases will sometimes happen when Leap from the boat, is still better.
    </p>
    <p>
     Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted
    </p>
    <p>
     conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a margin
    </p>
    <p>
     to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice,
    </p>
    <p>
     and concluded with a peremptory command "Stick to the boat, Pip,
    </p>
    <p>
     or by the Lord, I won't pick you up if you jump; mind that.
    </p>
    <p>
     We can't afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell
    </p>
    <p>
     for thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama.  Bear that in mind,
    </p>
    <p>
     and don't jump any more."  Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted,
    </p>
    <p>
     that though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal,
    </p>
    <p>
     which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.
    </p>
    <p>
     But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was under very similar circumstances to the first performance;
    </p>
    <p>
     but this time he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale
    </p>
    <p>
     started to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried
    </p>
    <p>
     traveller's trunk.  Alas!  Stubb was but too true to his word.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a beautiful, bounteous, blue day! the spangled sea calm
    </p>
    <p>
     and cool, and flatly stretching away, all round, to the horizon,
    </p>
    <p>
     like gold-beater's skin hammered out to the extremest.  Bobbing up
    </p>
    <p>
     and down in that sea, Pip's ebon head showed like a head of cloves.
    </p>
    <p>
     No boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stubb's inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was winged.
    </p>
    <p>
     In three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between
    </p>
    <p>
     Pip and Stubb.  Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned
    </p>
    <p>
     his crisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway,
    </p>
    <p>
     though the loftiest and the brightest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy
    </p>
    <p>
     to the practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the awful lonesomeness is intolerable.  The intense concentration
    </p>
    <p>
     of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can
    </p>
    <p>
     tell it?  Mark, how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea--
    </p>
    <p>
     mark how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.
    </p>
    <p>
     But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro
    </p>
    <p>
     to his fate?  No; he did not mean to, at least.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because there were two boats in his wake, and he supposed,
    </p>
    <p>
     no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip very quickly,
    </p>
    <p>
     and pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations towards
    </p>
    <p>
     oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity, is not
    </p>
    <p>
     always manifested by the hunters in all similar instances;
    </p>
    <p>
     and such instances not unfrequently occur; almost invariably
    </p>
    <p>
     in the fishery, a coward, so called, is marked with the same
    </p>
    <p>
     ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip,
    </p>
    <p>
     suddenly spying whales close to them on one side, turned,
    </p>
    <p>
     and gave chase; and Stubb's boat was now so far away,
    </p>
    <p>
     and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish, that Pip's
    </p>
    <p>
     ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him;
    </p>
    <p>
     but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot;
    </p>
    <p>
     such, at least, they said he was.  The sea had jeeringly kept
    </p>
    <p>
     his finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not drowned entirely, though.  Rather carried down alive
    </p>
    <p>
     to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of the unwarped
    </p>
    <p>
     primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes;
    </p>
    <p>
     and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps;
    </p>
    <p>
     and among the joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities,
    </p>
    <p>
     Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral insects,
    </p>
    <p>
     that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs.
    </p>
    <p>
     He saw God's foot upon the treadle of the loom, and spoke it;
    </p>
    <p>
     and therefore his shipmates called him mad.  So man's insanity
    </p>
    <p>
     is heaven's sense; and wandering from all mortal reason,
    </p>
    <p>
     man comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason,
    </p>
    <p>
     is absurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised,
    </p>
    <p>
     indifferent as his God.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the rest blame not Stubb too hardly.  The thing is common
    </p>
    <p>
     in that fishery; and in the sequel of the narrative, it will then
    </p>
    <p>
     be seen what like abandonment befell myself.

     CHAPTER 94
    </head>
    <p>
     A Squeeze of the Hand
    </p>
    <p>
     That whale of Stubb's, so dearly purchased, was duly brought
    </p>
    <p>
     to the Pequod's side, where all those cutting and hoisting
    </p>
    <p>
     operations previously detailed, were regularly gone through,
    </p>
    <p>
     even to the baling of the Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.
    </p>
    <p>
     While some were occupied with this latter duty, others were employed
    </p>
    <p>
     in dragging away the larger tubs, so soon as filled with the sperm;
    </p>
    <p>
     and when the proper time arrived, this same sperm was carefully
    </p>
    <p>
     manipulated ere going to the try-works, of which anon.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when,
    </p>
    <p>
     with several others, I sat down before a large Constantine's
    </p>
    <p>
     bath of it, I found it strangely concreted into lumps,
    </p>
    <p>
     here and there rolling about in the liquid part.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid.
    </p>
    <p>
     A sweet and unctuous duty!  No wonder that in old times this
    </p>
    <p>
     sperm was such a favorite cosmetic.  Such a clearer! such
    </p>
    <p>
     a sweetener! such a softener; such a delicious mollifier!
    </p>
    <p>
     After having my hands in it for only a few minutes, my fingers felt
    </p>
    <p>
     like eels, and began, as it were, to serpentine and spiralize.
    </p>
    <p>
     As I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter
    </p>
    <p>
     exertion at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship
    </p>
    <p>
     under indolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as I bathed
    </p>
    <p>
     my hands among those soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues,
    </p>
    <p>
     woven almost within the hour; as they richly broke to my fingers,
    </p>
    <p>
     and discharged all their opulence, like fully ripe grapes
    </p>
    <p>
     their wine; as.  I snuffed up that uncontaminated aroma,--
    </p>
    <p>
     literally and truly, like the smell of spring violets;
    </p>
    <p>
     I declare to you, that for the time I lived as in a musky meadow;
    </p>
    <p>
     I forgot all about our horrible oath; in that inexpressible sperm,
    </p>
    <p>
     I washed my hands and my heart of it; I almost began to credit
    </p>
    <p>
     the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue
    </p>
    <p>
     in allaying the heat of anger; while bathing in that bath,
    </p>
    <p>
     I felt divinely free from all ill-will, or petulance, or malice,
    </p>
    <p>
     of any sort whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p>
     Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed
    </p>
    <p>
     that sperm till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed
    </p>
    <p>
     that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me;
    </p>
    <p>
     and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers'
    </p>
    <p>
     hands in it, mistaking their hands for the gentle globules.
    </p>
    <p>
     Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving feeling did
    </p>
    <p>
     this avocation beget; that at last I was continually squeezing
    </p>
    <p>
     their hands, and looking up into their eyes sentimentally;
    </p>
    <p>
     as much as to say,--Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we longer
    </p>
    <p>
     cherish any social acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor
    </p>
    <p>
     or envy!  Come; let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us
    </p>
    <p>
     all squeeze ourselves into each other; let us squeeze ourselves
    </p>
    <p>
     universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever!
    </p>
    <p>
     For now, since by many prolonged, repeated experiences,
    </p>
    <p>
     I have perceived that in all cases man must eventually lower,
    </p>
    <p>
     or at least shift, his conceit of attainable felicity;
    </p>
    <p>
     not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy;
    </p>
    <p>
     but in the wife, the heart, the bed, the table, the saddle,
    </p>
    <p>
     the fire-side; the country; now that I have perceived all this,
    </p>
    <p>
     I am ready to squeeze case eternally.  In thoughts of the
    </p>
    <p>
     visions of the night, I saw long rows of angels in paradise,
    </p>
    <p>
     each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, while discoursing of sperm it behooves to speak of other things akin
    </p>
    <p>
     to it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the try-works.
    </p>
    <p>
     First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering
    </p>
    <p>
     part of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his flukes.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is tough with congealed tendons--a wad of muscle--but still contains
    </p>
    <p>
     some oil.  After being severed from the whale, the white-horse
    </p>
    <p>
     is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer.
    </p>
    <p>
     They look much like blocks of Berkshire marble.
    </p>
    <p>
     Plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of
    </p>
    <p>
     the whale's flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber,
    </p>
    <p>
     and often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is a most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
     As its name imports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a
    </p>
    <p>
     bestreaked snowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest
    </p>
    <p>
     crimson and purple.  It is plums of rubies, in pictures of citron.
    </p>
    <p>
     Spite of reason, it is hard to keep yourself from eating it.
    </p>
    <p>
     I confess, that once I stole behind the foremast to try it.
    </p>
    <p>
     It tasted something as I should conceive a royal cutlet from
    </p>
    <p>
     the thigh of Louis le Gros might have tasted, supposing him
    </p>
    <p>
     to have been killed the first day after the venison season,
    </p>
    <p>
     and that particular venison season contemporary with an unusually
    </p>
    <p>
     fine vintage of the vineyards of Champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns
    </p>
    <p>
     up in the course of this business, but which I feel it to be
    </p>
    <p>
     very puzzling adequately to describe.  It is called slobgollion;
    </p>
    <p>
     an appellation original with the whalemen, and even so is
    </p>
    <p>
     the nature of the substance.  It is an ineffably oozy,
    </p>
    <p>
     stringy affair, most frequently found in the tubs of sperm,
    </p>
    <p>
     after a prolonged squeezing, and subsequent decanting.
    </p>
    <p>
     I hold it to be the wondrously thin, ruptured membranes
    </p>
    <p>
     of the case, coalescing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen,
    </p>
    <p>
     but sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen.
    </p>
    <p>
     It designates the dark, glutinous substance which is scraped off
    </p>
    <p>
     the back of the Greenland or right whale, and much of which covers
    </p>
    <p>
     the decks of those inferior souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nippers.  Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale's vocabulary.
    </p>
    <p>
     But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so.  A whaleman's nipper
    </p>
    <p>
     is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering
    </p>
    <p>
     part of Leviathan's tail:  it averages an inch in thickness,
    </p>
    <p>
     and for the rest, is about the size of the iron part of a hoe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Edgewise moved along the oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee;
    </p>
    <p>
     and by nameless blandishments, as of magic, allures along with
    </p>
    <p>
     it all impurities.
    </p>
    <p>
     But to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at once
    </p>
    <p>
     to descend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its inmates.
    </p>
    <p>
     This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle
    </p>
    <p>
     for the blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted from the whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the proper time arrives for cutting up its contents, this apartment
    </p>
    <p>
     is a scene of terror to all tyros, especially by night.  On one side,
    </p>
    <p>
     lit by a dull lantern, a space has been left clear for the workmen.
    </p>
    <p>
     They generally go in pairs,--a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man. The
    </p>
    <p>
     whaling-pike is similar to a frigate's boarding-weapon of the same name.
    </p>
    <p>
     The gaff is something like a boat-hook. With his gaff, the gaffman
    </p>
    <p>
     hooks on to a sheet of blubber, and strives to hold it from slipping,
    </p>
    <p>
     as the ship pitches and lurches about.  Meanwhile, the spade-man stands
    </p>
    <p>
     on the sheet itself, perpendicularly chopping it into the portable
    </p>
    <p>
     horse-pieces. This spade is sharp as hone can make it; the spademan's
    </p>
    <p>
     feet are shoeless; the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly
    </p>
    <p>
     slide away from him, like a sledge.  If he cuts off one of his own toes,
    </p>
    <p>
     or one of his assistants', would you be very much astonished?
    </p>
    <p>
     Toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room men.

     The Cassock
    </p>
    <p>
     Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this
    </p>
    <p>
     post-mortemizing of the whale; and had you strolled forward nigh
    </p>
    <p>
     the windlass, pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no
    </p>
    <p>
     small curiosity a very strange, enigmatical object, which you would
    </p>
    <p>
     have seen there, lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not the wondrous cistern in the whale's huge head; not the prodigy
    </p>
    <p>
     of his unhinged lower jaw; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail;
    </p>
    <p>
     none of these would so surprise you, as half a glimpse of
    </p>
    <p>
     that unaccountable cone,--longer than a Kentuckian is tall,
    </p>
    <p>
     nigh a foot in diameter at the base, and jet-black as Yojo,
    </p>
    <p>
     the ebony idol of Queequeg.  And an idol, indeed, it is;
    </p>
    <p>
     or rather, in old times, its likeness was.  Such an idol
    </p>
    <p>
     as that found in the secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea;
    </p>
    <p>
     and for worshipping which, King Asa, her son, did depose her,
    </p>
    <p>
     and destroyed the idol, and burnt it for an abomination
    </p>
    <p>
     at the brook Kedron, as darkly set forth in the 15th chapter
    </p>
    <p>
     of the First Book of Kings.
    </p>
    <p>
     Look at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along,
    </p>
    <p>
     and assisted by two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus,
    </p>
    <p>
     as the mariners call it, and with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it
    </p>
    <p>
     as if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field.
    </p>
    <p>
     Extending it upon the forecastle deck, he now proceeds cylindrically
    </p>
    <p>
     to remove its dark pelt, as an African hunter the pelt of a boa.
    </p>
    <p>
     This done he turns the pelt inside out, like a pantaloon leg;
    </p>
    <p>
     gives it a good stretching, so as almost to double its diameter;
    </p>
    <p>
     and at last hangs it, well spread, in the rigging, to dry.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ere long, it is taken down; when removing some three feet of it,
    </p>
    <p>
     towards the pointed extremity, and then cutting two slits for arm-holes
    </p>
    <p>
     at the other end, he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The mincer now stands before you invested in the full canonicals
    </p>
    <p>
     of his calling.  Immemorial to all his order, this investiture
    </p>
    <p>
     alone will adequately protect him, while employed in the peculiar
    </p>
    <p>
     functions of his office.
    </p>
    <p>
     That office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber
    </p>
    <p>
     for the pots; an operation which is conducted at a curious
    </p>
    <p>
     wooden horse, planted endwise against the bulwarks,
    </p>
    <p>
     and with a capacious tub beneath it, into which the minced
    </p>
    <p>
     pieces drop, fast as the sheets from a rapt orator's desk.
    </p>
    <p>
     Arrayed in decent black; occupying a conspicuous pulpit;
    </p>
    <p>
     intent on bible leaves; what a candidate for an archbishopric,
    </p>
    <p>
     what a lad for a Pope were this mincer!*
    </p>
    <p>
     * Bible leaves!  Bible leaves!  This is the invariable cry
    </p>
    <p>
     from the mates to the mincer.  It enjoins him to be careful,
    </p>
    <p>
     and cut his work into as thin slices as possible, inasmuch as by
    </p>
    <p>
     so doing the business of boiling out the oil is much accelerated,
    </p>
    <p>
     and its quantity considerably increased, besides perhaps improving
    </p>
    <p>
     it in quality.

     CHAPTER 96

    <p>
     The Try-Works
    </p>
    <p>
     Besides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly distinguished
    </p>
    <p>
     by her try-works. She presents the curious anomaly of the most solid
    </p>
    <p>
     masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is as if from the open field a brick-kiln were transported
    </p>
    <p>
     to her planks.
    </p>
    <p>
     The try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast,
    </p>
    <p>
     the most roomy part of the deck.  The timbers beneath are of a
    </p>
    <p>
     peculiar strength, fitted to sustain the weight of an almost
    </p>
    <p>
     solid mass of brick and mortar, some ten feet by eight square,
    </p>
    <p>
     and five in height.  The foundation does not penetrate the deck,
    </p>
    <p>
     but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous
    </p>
    <p>
     knees of iron bracing it on all sides, and screwing it down
    </p>
    <p>
     to the timbers.  On the flanks it is cased with wood, and at top
    </p>
    <p>
     completely covered by a large, sloping, battened hatchway.
    </p>
    <p>
     Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots, two in number,
    </p>
    <p>
     and each of several barrels' capacity.  When not in use,
    </p>
    <p>
     they are kept remarkably clean.  Sometimes they are polished with
    </p>
    <p>
     soapstone and sand, till they shine within like silver punchbowls.
    </p>
    <p>
     During the night-watches some cynical old sailors will
    </p>
    <p>
     crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap.
    </p>
    <p>
     While employed in polishing them--one man in each pot, side by side--
    </p>
    <p>
     many confidential communications are carried on, over the iron lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is a place also for profound mathematical meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was in the left hand try-pot of the Pequod, with the soapstone
    </p>
    <p>
     diligently circling round me, that I was first indirectly struck
    </p>
    <p>
     by the remarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies gliding
    </p>
    <p>
     along the cycloid, my soapstone for example, will descend
    </p>
    <p>
     from any point in precisely the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Removing the fire-board from the front of the try-works,
    </p>
    <p>
     the bare masonry of that side is exposed, penetrated by the two
    </p>
    <p>
     iron mouths of the furnaces, directly underneath the pots.
    </p>
    <p>
     These mouths are fitted with heavy doors of iron.  The intense heat
    </p>
    <p>
     of the fire is prevented from communicating itself to the deck,
    </p>
    <p>
     by means of a shallow reservoir extending under the entire
    </p>
    <p>
     inclosed surface of the works.  By a tunnel inserted at the rear,
    </p>
    <p>
     this reservoir is kept replenished with water as fast as it evaporates.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are no external chimneys; they open direct from the rear wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     And here let us go back for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was about nine o'clock at night that the Pequod's
    </p>
    <p>
     try-works were first started on this present voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
     It belonged to Stubb to oversee the business.
    </p>
    <p>
     "All ready there?  Off hatch, then, and start her.  You cook,
    </p>
    <p>
     fire the works."  This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been
    </p>
    <p>
     thrusting his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here be it said that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the
    </p>
    <p>
     try-works has to be fed for a time with wood.  After that no wood
    </p>
    <p>
     is used, except as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a word, after being tried out, the crisp, shrivelled blubber,
    </p>
    <p>
     now called scraps or fritters, still contains considerable
    </p>
    <p>
     of its unctuous properties.  These fritters feed the flames.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming misanthrope,
    </p>
    <p>
     once ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Would that he consumed his own smoke! for his smoke is horrible
    </p>
    <p>
     to inhale, and inhale it you must, and not only that, but you must
    </p>
    <p>
     live in it for the time.  It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor
    </p>
    <p>
     about it, such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres.
    </p>
    <p>
     It smells like the left wing of the day of judgment; it is an argument
    </p>
    <p>
     for the pit.
    </p>
    <p>
     By midnight the works were in full operation.
    </p>
    <p>
     We were clear from the carcass; sail had been made;
    </p>
    <p>
     the wind was freshening; the wild ocean darkness was intense.
    </p>
    <p>
     But that darkness was licked up by the fierce flames, which at
    </p>
    <p>
     intervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and illuminated
    </p>
    <p>
     every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed Greek fire.
    </p>
    <p>
     The burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned
    </p>
    <p>
     to some vengeful deed.  So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs
    </p>
    <p>
     of the bold Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors,
    </p>
    <p>
     with broad sheets of flame for sails, bore down upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the Turkish frigates, and folded them in conflagrations.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide
    </p>
    <p>
     hearth in front of them.  Standing on this were the Tartarean
    </p>
    <p>
     shapes of the pagan harpooneers, always the whale-ship's stokers.
    </p>
    <p>
     With huge pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into
    </p>
    <p>
     the scalding pots, or stirred up the fires beneath, till the snaky
    </p>
    <p>
     flames darted, curling, out of the doors to catch them by the feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     The smoke rolled away in sullen heaps.  To every pitch of the ship
    </p>
    <p>
     there was a pitch of the boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness
    </p>
    <p>
     to leap into their faces.  Opposite the mouth of the works,
    </p>
    <p>
     on the further side of the wide wooden hearth, was the windlass.
    </p>
    <p>
     This served for a sea-sofa. Here lounged the watch, when not
    </p>
    <p>
     otherwise employed, looking into the red heat of the fire,
    </p>
    <p>
     till their eyes felt scorched in their heads.  Their tawny features,
    </p>
    <p>
     now all begrimed with smoke and sweat, their matted beards,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth, all these were
    </p>
    <p>
     strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works.
    </p>
    <p>
     As they narrated to each other their unholy adventures, their tales
    </p>
    <p>
     of terror told in words of mirth; as their uncivilized laughter
    </p>
    <p>
     forked upwards out of them, like the flames from the furnace;
    </p>
    <p>
     as to and fro, in their front, the harpooneers wildly gesticulated
    </p>
    <p>
     with their huge pronged forks and dippers; as the wind howled on,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the sea leaped, and the ship groaned and dived, and yet steadfastly
    </p>
    <p>
     shot her red hell further and further into the blackness of the sea
    </p>
    <p>
     and the night, and scornfully champed the white bone in her mouth,
    </p>
    <p>
     and viciously spat round her on all sides; then the rushing Pequod,
    </p>
    <p>
     freighted with savages, and laden with fire, and burning a corpse,
    </p>
    <p>
     and plunging into that blackness of darkness, seemed the material
    </p>
    <p>
     counterpart of her monomaniac commander's soul.
    </p>
    <p>
     So seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long
    </p>
    <p>
     hours silently guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wrapped, for that interval, in darkness myself, I but the better
    </p>
    <p>
     saw the redness, the madness, the ghastliness of others.
    </p>
    <p>
     The continual sight of the fiend shapes before me, capering half
    </p>
    <p>
     in smoke and half in fire, these at last begat kindred visions
    </p>
    <p>
     in my soul, so soon as I began to yield to that unaccountable
    </p>
    <p>
     drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm.
    </p>
    <p>
     But that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since inexplicable)
    </p>
    <p>
     thing occurred to me.  Starting from a brief standing sleep,
    </p>
    <p>
     I was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
     The jaw-bone tiller smote my side, which leaned against it; in my
    </p>
    <p>
     ears was the low hum of sails, just beginning to shake in the wind;
    </p>
    <p>
     I thought my eyes were open; I was half conscious of putting
    </p>
    <p>
     my fingers to the lids and mechanically stretching them still
    </p>
    <p>
     further apart.  But, spite of all this, I could see no compass
    </p>
    <p>
     before me to steer by; though it seemed but a minute since I had been
    </p>
    <p>
     watching the card, by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and then made
    </p>
    <p>
     ghastly by flashes of redness.  Uppermost was the impression,
    </p>
    <p>
     that whatever swift, rushing thing I stood on was not so much
    </p>
    <p>
     bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern.
    </p>
    <p>
     A stark, bewildered feeling, as of death, came over me.
    </p>
    <p>
     Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller, but with the crazy conceit
    </p>
    <p>
     that the tiller was, somehow, in some enchanted way, inverted.
    </p>
    <p>
     My God! what is the matter with me? thought I. Lo! in my
    </p>
    <p>
     brief sleep I had turned myself about, and was fronting
    </p>
    <p>
     the ship's stern, with my back to her prow and the compass.
    </p>
    <p>
     In an instant I faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel
    </p>
    <p>
     from flying up into the wind, and very probably capsizing her.
    </p>
    <p>
     How glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural
    </p>
    <p>
     hallucination of the night, and the fatal contingency of being
    </p>
    <p>
     brought by the lee!
    </p>
    <p>
     Look not too long in the face of the fire, O man!  Never dream
    </p>
    <p>
     with thy hand on the helm!  Turn not thy back to the compass;
    </p>
    <p>
     accept the first hint of the hitching tiller; believe not the
    </p>
    <p>
     artificial fire, when its redness makes all things look ghastly.
    </p>
    <p>
     To-morrow, in the natural sun, the skies will be bright;
    </p>
    <p>
     those who glared like devils in the forking flames, the morn
    </p>
    <p>
     will show in far other, at least gentler, relief; the glorious,
    </p>
    <p>
     golden, glad sun, the only true lamp--all others but liars!
    </p>
    <p>
     Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginia's Dismal Swamp,
    </p>
    <p>
     nor Rome's accursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the
    </p>
    <p>
     millions of miles of deserts and of griefs beneath the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sun hides not the ocean, which is the dark side of this earth,
    </p>
    <p>
     and which is two thirds of this earth.  So, therefore, that mortal
    </p>
    <p>
     man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him, that mortal man
    </p>
    <p>
     cannot be true--not true, or undeveloped.  With books the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     The truest of all men was the Man of Sorrows, and the truest
    </p>
    <p>
     of all books is Solomon's, and Ecclesiastes is the fine
    </p>
    <p>
     hammered steel of woe.  "All is vanity."  ALL.  This wilful
    </p>
    <p>
     world hath not got hold of unchristian Solomon's wisdom yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     But he who dodges hospitals and jails, and walks fast
    </p>
    <p>
     crossing graveyards, and would rather talk of operas than hell;
    </p>
    <p>
     calls Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils all of sick men;
    </p>
    <p>
     and throughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabelais
    </p>
    <p>
     as passing wise, and therefore jolly;--not that man is fitted
    </p>
    <p>
     to sit down on tomb-stones, and break the green damp mould
    </p>
    <p>
     with unfathomably wondrous Solomon.
    </p>
    <p>
     But even Solomon, he says, "the man that wandereth out of
    </p>
    <p>
     the way of understanding shall remain" (i.e. even while living)
    </p>
    <p>
     "in the congregation of the dead."  Give not thyself up, then, to fire,
    </p>
    <p>
     lest it invert thee, deaden thee; as for the time it did me.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is a wisdom that is woe; but there is a woe that is madness.
    </p>
    <p>
     And there is a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike
    </p>
    <p>
     dive down into the blackest gorges, and soar out of them again
    </p>
    <p>
     and become invisible in the sunny spaces.  And even if he for
    </p>
    <p>
     ever flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the mountains;
    </p>
    <p>
     so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still
    </p>
    <p>
     higher than other birds upon the plain, even though they soar.

     The Lamp
    </p>
    <p>
     Had you descended from the Pequod's try-works to the Pequod's forecastle,
    </p>
    <p>
     where the off duty watch were sleeping, for one single moment you
    </p>
    <p>
     would have almost thought you were standing in some illuminated
    </p>
    <p>
     shrine of canonized kings and counsellors.  There they lay in
    </p>
    <p>
     their triangular oaken vaults, each mariner a chiselled muteness;
    </p>
    <p>
     a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     In merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk
    </p>
    <p>
     of queens.  To dress in the dark, and eat in the dark,
    </p>
    <p>
     and stumble in darkness to his pallet, this is his usual lot.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the whaleman, as he seeks the food of light, so he lives in light.
    </p>
    <p>
     He makes his berth an Aladdin's lamp, and lays him down in it;
    </p>
    <p>
     so that in the pitchiest night the ship's black hull still
    </p>
    <p>
     houses an illumination.
    </p>
    <p>
     See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful
    </p>
    <p>
     of lamps--often but old bottles and vials, though--to the
    </p>
    <p>
     copper cooler at the tryworks, and replenishes them there,
    </p>
    <p>
     as mugs of ale at a vat.  He burns, too, the purest of oil,
    </p>
    <p>
     in its unmanufactured, and, therefore, unvitiated state;
    </p>
    <p>
     a fluid unknown to solar, lunar, or astral contrivances ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is sweet as early grass butter in April.  He goes and hunts
    </p>
    <p>
     for his oil, so as to be sure of its freshness and genuineness,
    </p>
    <p>
     even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own
    </p>
    <p>
     supper of game.

    <p>
     Stowing Down and Clearing Up
    </p>
    <p>
     Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off
    </p>
    <p>
     descried from the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors,
    </p>
    <p>
     and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then towed alongside
    </p>
    <p>
     and beheaded; and how (on the principle which entitled the headsman
    </p>
    <p>
     of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed) his great padded
    </p>
    <p>
     surtout becomes the property of his executioner; how, in due time,
    </p>
    <p>
     he is condemned to the pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
    </p>
    <p>
     his spermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through the fire;--but now
    </p>
    <p>
     it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description
    </p>
    <p>
     by rehearsing--singing, if I may--the romantic proceeding of decanting
    </p>
    <p>
     off his oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold,
    </p>
    <p>
     where once again leviathan returns to his native profundities,
    </p>
    <p>
     sliding along beneath the surface :is before; but, alas! never more
    </p>
    <p>
     to rise and blow.
    </p>
    <p>
     While still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into
    </p>
    <p>
     the six-barrel casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching
    </p>
    <p>
     and rolling this way and that in the midnight sea, the enormous
    </p>
    <p>
     casks are slewed round and headed over, end for end, and sometimes
    </p>
    <p>
     perilously scoot across the slippery deck, like so many land slides,
    </p>
    <p>
     till at last man-handled and stayed in their course; and all round
    </p>
    <p>
     the hoops, rap, rap, go as many hammers as can play upon them,
    </p>
    <p>
     for now, ex officio, every sailor is a cooper.
    </p>
    <p>
     At length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool,
    </p>
    <p>
     then the great hatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are
    </p>
    <p>
     thrown open, and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     This done, the hatches are replaced, and hermetically closed,
    </p>
    <p>
     like a closet walled up.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most
    </p>
    <p>
     remarkable incidents in all the business of whaling.
    </p>
    <p>
     One day the planks stream with freshets of blood and oil;
    </p>
    <p>
     on the sacred quarter-deck enormous masses of the whale's head are
    </p>
    <p>
     profanely piled; great rusty casks lie about, as in a brewery yard;
    </p>
    <p>
     the smoke from the try-works has besooted all the bulwarks;
    </p>
    <p>
     the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness; the entire
    </p>
    <p>
     ship seems great leviathan himself; while on all hands
    </p>
    <p>
     the din is deafening.
    </p>
    <p>
     But a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears
    </p>
    <p>
     in this self-same ship! and were it not for the tell-tale boats
    </p>
    <p>
     and try-works, you would all but swear you trod some silent
    </p>
    <p>
     merchant vessel, with a most scrupulously neat commander.
    </p>
    <p>
     The unmanufactured sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is the reason why the decks never look so white as just
    </p>
    <p>
     after what they call an affair of oil.  Besides, from the ashes
    </p>
    <p>
     of the burned scraps of the whale, a potent lye is readily made;
    </p>
    <p>
     and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains
    </p>
    <p>
     clinging to the side, that lye quickly exterminates it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hands go diligently along the bulwarks, and with buckets
    </p>
    <p>
     of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness.
    </p>
    <p>
     The soot is brushed from the lower rigging.  All the numerous
    </p>
    <p>
     implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully
    </p>
    <p>
     cleansed and put away.  The great hatch is scrubbed and placed
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the try-works, completely hiding the pots; every cask
    </p>
    <p>
     is out of sight; all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks;
    </p>
    <p>
     and when by the combined and, simultaneous industry of almost
    </p>
    <p>
     the entire ship's company, the whole of this conscientious
    </p>
    <p>
     duty is at last concluded, then the crew themselves proceed
    </p>
    <p>
     to their own ablutions; shift themselves from top to toe;
    </p>
    <p>
     and finally issue to the immaculate deck, fresh and all aglow
    </p>
    <p>
     as bridegrooms new-leaped from out the daintiest Holland.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes,
    </p>
    <p>
     and humorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics;
    </p>
    <p>
     propose to mat the deck; think of having hangings to the top;
    </p>
    <p>
     object not to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle.
    </p>
    <p>
     To hint to such musked mariners of oil, and bone, and blubber,
    </p>
    <p>
     were little short of audacity.  They know not the thing you distantly
    </p>
    <p>
     allude to.  Away, and bring us napkins!
    </p>
    <p>
     But mark:  aloft there, at the three mast heads, stand three
    </p>
    <p>
     men intent on spying out more whales, which, if caught,
    </p>
    <p>
     infallibly will again soil the old oaken furniture, and drop
    </p>
    <p>
     at least one small grease-spot somewhere.  Yes; and many is
    </p>
    <p>
     the time, when, after the severest uninterrupted labors, which know
    </p>
    <p>
     no night; continuing straight through for ninety-six hours;
    </p>
    <p>
     when from the boat, where they have swelled their wrists
    </p>
    <p>
     with all day rowing on the Line,--they only step to the deck
    </p>
    <p>
     to carry vast chains, and heave the heavy windlass, and cut
    </p>
    <p>
     and slash, yea, and in their very sweatings to be smoked
    </p>
    <p>
     and burned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial sun
    </p>
    <p>
     and the equatorial try-works; when, on the heel of all this,
    </p>
    <p>
     they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship, and make
    </p>
    <p>
     a spotless dairy room of it; many is the time the poor fellows,
    </p>
    <p>
     just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks, are startled
    </p>
    <p>
     by the cry of "There she blows!" and away they fly to fight
    </p>
    <p>
     another whale, and go through the whole weary thing again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh! my friends, but this is man-killing! Yet this is life.
    </p>
    <p>
     For hardly have we mortals by long toilings extracted from this
    </p>
    <p>
     world's vast bulk its small but valuable sperm; and then,
    </p>
    <p>
     with weary patience, cleansed ourselves from its defilements,
    </p>
    <p>
     and learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul;
    </p>
    <p>
     hardly is this done, when--There she blows!--the ghost
    </p>
    <p>
     is spouted up, and away we sail to fight some other world,
    </p>
    <p>
     and go through young life's old routine again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh! the metempsychosis!  Oh!  Pythagoras, that in bright Greece,
    </p>
    <p>
     two thousand years ago, did die, so good, so wise, so mild; I sailed
    </p>
    <p>
     with thee along the Peruvian coast last voyage--and, foolish as I am,
    </p>
    <p>
     taught thee, a green simple boy, how to splice a rope.

    <p>
     The Doubloon
    </p>
    <p>
     Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck,
    </p>
    <p>
     taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast;
    </p>
    <p>
     but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it
    </p>
    <p>
     has not been added how that sometimes in these walks, when most
    </p>
    <p>
     plunged in his mood, he was wont to pause in turn at each spot,
    </p>
    <p>
     and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him.
    </p>
    <p>
     When he halted before the binnacle, with his glance fastened on
    </p>
    <p>
     the pointed needle in the compass, that glance shot like a javelin
    </p>
    <p>
     with the pointed intensity of his purpose; and when resuming his walk
    </p>
    <p>
     he again paused before the mainmast, then, as the same riveted glance
    </p>
    <p>
     fastened upon the riveted gold coin there, he still wore the same
    </p>
    <p>
     aspect of nailed firmness, only dashed with a certain wild longing,
    </p>
    <p>
     if not hopefulness.
    </p>
    <p>
     But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly
    </p>
    <p>
     attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it,
    </p>
    <p>
     as though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself
    </p>
    <p>
     in some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them.
    </p>
    <p>
     And some certain significance lurks in all things, else all things
    </p>
    <p>
     are little worth, and the round world itself but an empty cipher,
    </p>
    <p>
     except to sell by the cartload, as they do hills about Boston,
    </p>
    <p>
     to fill up some morass in the Milky Way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere
    </p>
    <p>
     out of the heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west,
    </p>
    <p>
     over golden sands, the head-waters of many a Pactolus flows.
    </p>
    <p>
     And though now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts
    </p>
    <p>
     and the verdigris of copper spikes, yet, untouchable and immaculate
    </p>
    <p>
     to any foulness, it still preserved its Quito glow.  Nor, though placed
    </p>
    <p>
     amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands,
    </p>
    <p>
     and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness
    </p>
    <p>
     which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless every
    </p>
    <p>
     sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset last left it last.
    </p>
    <p>
     For it was set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end;
    </p>
    <p>
     and however wanton in their sailor ways, one and all,
    </p>
    <p>
     the mariners revered it as the white whale's talisman.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night,
    </p>
    <p>
     wondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he would ever
    </p>
    <p>
     live to spend it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun
    </p>
    <p>
     and tropic token-pieces. Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes; sun's disks
    </p>
    <p>
     and stars, ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners waving,
    </p>
    <p>
     are in luxuriant profusion stamped; so that the precious gold seems
    </p>
    <p>
     almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories,
    </p>
    <p>
     by passing through those fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.
    </p>
    <p>
     It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy
    </p>
    <p>
     example of these things.  On its round border it bore the letters,
    </p>
    <p>
     REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR:  QUITO.  So this bright coin came from a country
    </p>
    <p>
     planted in the middle of the world, and beneath the great equator,
    </p>
    <p>
     and named after it; and it had been cast midway up the Andes,
    </p>
    <p>
     in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn.  Zoned by those letters
    </p>
    <p>
     you saw the likeness of three Andes' summits; from one a flame;
    </p>
    <p>
     a tower on another; on the third a crowing cock; while arching
    </p>
    <p>
     over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac, the signs all
    </p>
    <p>
     marked with their usual cabalistics, and the keystone sun entering
    </p>
    <p>
     the equinoctial point at Libra.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others,
    </p>
    <p>
     was now pausing.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There's something ever egotistical in mountain-tops
    </p>
    <p>
     and towers, and all other grand and lofty things; look here,--
    </p>
    <p>
     three peaks as proud as Lucifer.  The firm tower, that is Ahab;
    </p>
    <p>
     the volcano, that is Ahab; the courageous, the undaunted,
    </p>
    <p>
     and victorious fowl, that, too, is Ahab; all are Ahab;
    </p>
    <p>
     and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe,
    </p>
    <p>
     which, like a magician's glass, to each and every man in turn
    </p>
    <p>
     but mirrors back his own mysterious self.  Great pains,
    </p>
    <p>
     small gains for those who ask the world to solve them; it cannot
    </p>
    <p>
     solve itself.  Methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face;
    </p>
    <p>
     but see! aye, he enters the sign of storms, the equinox!
    </p>
    <p>
     and but six months before he wheeled out of a former equinox
    </p>
    <p>
     at Aries!  From storm to storm!  So be it, then.  Born in throes,
    </p>
    <p>
     't is fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs!
    </p>
    <p>
     So be it, then!  Here's stout stuff for woe to work on.
    </p>
    <p>
     So be it, then."
    </p>
    <p>
     "No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil's
    </p>
    <p>
     claws must have left their mouldings there since yesterday,"
    </p>
    <p>
     murmured Starbuck to himself, leaning against the bulwarks.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The old man seems to read Belshazzar's awful writing.
    </p>
    <p>
     I have never marked the coin inspectingly.  He goes below; let me read.
    </p>
    <p>
     A dark valley between three mighty, heaven-abiding peaks,
    </p>
    <p>
     that almost seem the Trinity, in some faint earthly symbol.
    </p>
    <p>
     So in this vale of Death, God girds us round; and over all our gloom,
    </p>
    <p>
     the sun of Righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope.
    </p>
    <p>
     If we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows her mouldy soil;
    </p>
    <p>
     but if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance half way, to cheer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if, at midnight, we would
    </p>
    <p>
     fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze for him in vain!
    </p>
    <p>
     This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still sadly to me.
    </p>
    <p>
     I will quit it, lest Truth shake me falsely."
    </p>
    <p>
     "There now's the old Mogul," soliloquized Stubb by the try-works,
    </p>
    <p>
     "he's been twigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the same,
    </p>
    <p>
     and both with faces which I should say might be somewhere
    </p>
    <p>
     within nine fathoms long.  And all from looking at a piece
    </p>
    <p>
     of gold, which did I have it now on Negro Hill or in
    </p>
    <p>
     Corlaer's Hook, I'd not look at it very long ere spending it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Humph! in my poor, insignificant opinion, I regard this as queer.
    </p>
    <p>
     I have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings; your doubloons
    </p>
    <p>
     of old Spain, your doubloons of Peru, your doubloons of Chili,
    </p>
    <p>
     your doubloons of Bolivia, your doubloons of Popayan;
    </p>
    <p>
     with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles, and joes,
    </p>
    <p>
     and half joes, and quarter joes.  What then should there be
    </p>
    <p>
     in this doubloon of the Equator that is so killing wonderful?
    </p>
    <p>
     By Golconda! let me read it once.  Halloa! here's signs and
    </p>
    <p>
     wonders truly!  That, now, is what old Bowditch in his Epitome
    </p>
    <p>
     calls the zodiac, and what my almanack below calls ditto.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll get the almanack; and as I have heard devils can be raised
    </p>
    <p>
     with Daboll's arithmetic, I'll try my hand at raising a meaning
    </p>
    <p>
     out of these queer curvicues here with the Massachusetts calendar.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here's the book.  Let's see now.  Signs and wonders;
    </p>
    <p>
     and the sun, he's always among 'em.  Hem, hem, hem; here they are--
    </p>
    <p>
     here they go--all alive:  Aries, or the Ram; Taurus, or the Bull
    </p>
    <p>
     and Jimimi! here's Gemini himself, or the Twins.  Well; the sun
    </p>
    <p>
     he wheels among 'em.  Aye, here on the coin he's just crossing
    </p>
    <p>
     the threshold between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring.
    </p>
    <p>
     Book! you lie there; the fact is, you books must know your places.
    </p>
    <p>
     You'll do to give us the bare words and facts, but we come
    </p>
    <p>
     in to supply the thoughts.  That's my small experience,
    </p>
    <p>
     so far as the Massachusetts calendar, and Bowditch's navigator,
    </p>
    <p>
     and Daboll's arithmetic go.  Signs and wonders, eh?  Pity if there
    </p>
    <p>
     is nothing wonderful in signs, and significant in wonders!
    </p>
    <p>
     There's a clue somewhere; wait a bit; hist--hark!  By Jove, I have it!
    </p>
    <p>
     Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man in one
    </p>
    <p>
     round chapter; and now I'll read it off, straight out of the book.
    </p>
    <p>
     Come, Almanack!  To begin:  there's Aries, or the Ram--
    </p>
    <p>
     lecherous dog, he begets us; then, Taurus, or the Bull--
    </p>
    <p>
     he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini, or the Twins--
    </p>
    <p>
     that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue,
    </p>
    <p>
     when lo! comes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and here,
    </p>
    <p>
     going from Virtue, Leo, a roaring Lion, lies in the path--
    </p>
    <p>
     he gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw;
    </p>
    <p>
     we escape, and hail Virgo, the Virgin! that's our first love;
    </p>
    <p>
     we marry and think to be happy for aye, when pop comes Libra,
    </p>
    <p>
     or the Scales--happiness weighed and found wanting; and while we
    </p>
    <p>
     are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio,
    </p>
    <p>
     or the Scorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the wound,
    </p>
    <p>
     when whang comes the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer,
    </p>
    <p>
     is amusing himself.  As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside!
    </p>
    <p>
     here's the battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt,
    </p>
    <p>
     he comes rushing, and headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius,
    </p>
    <p>
     or the Waterbearer, pours out his whole deluge and drowns us;
    </p>
    <p>
     and to wind up with Pisces, or the Fishes, we sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     There's a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the sun goes through
    </p>
    <p>
     it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jollily he, aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and so,
    </p>
    <p>
     alow here, does jolly Stubb.  Oh, jolly's the word for aye!
    </p>
    <p>
     Adieu, Doubloon!  But stop; here comes little King-Post;
    </p>
    <p>
     dodge round the try-works, now, and let's hear what he'll have
    </p>
    <p>
     to say.  There; he's before it; he'll out with something presently.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, so; he's beginning."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever raises
    </p>
    <p>
     a certain whale, this round thing belongs to him.  So, what's all
    </p>
    <p>
     this staring been about?  It is worth sixteen dollars, that's true;
    </p>
    <p>
     and at two cents the cigar, that's nine hundred and sixty cigars.
    </p>
    <p>
     I won't smoke dirty pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and here's nine
    </p>
    <p>
     hundred and sixty of them; so here goes Flask aloft to spy 'em out."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Shall I call that Wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has
    </p>
    <p>
     a foolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a sort
    </p>
    <p>
     of wiseish look to it.  But, avast; here comes our old Manxman--the old
    </p>
    <p>
     hearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he took to the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     He luffs up before the doubloon; halloa, and goes round on the other
    </p>
    <p>
     side of the mast; why, there's a horse-shoe nailed on that side;
    </p>
    <p>
     and now he's back again; what does that mean?  Hark! he's muttering--
    </p>
    <p>
     voice like an old worn-out coffee-mill. Prick ears, and listen!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "If the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day,
    </p>
    <p>
     when the sun stands in some one of these signs.  I've studied signs,
    </p>
    <p>
     and know their marks; they were taught me two score years ago,
    </p>
    <p>
     by the old witch in Copenhagen.  Now, in what sign will the sun then be?
    </p>
    <p>
     The horse-shoe sign; for there it is, right opposite the gold.
    </p>
    <p>
     And what's the horse-shoe sign?  The lion is the horse-shoe sign--
    </p>
    <p>
     the roaring and devouring lion.  Ship, old ship! my old head shakes
    </p>
    <p>
     to think of thee."
    </p>
    <p>
     "There's another rendering now; but still one text.  All sorts of men
    </p>
    <p>
     in one kind of world, you see.  Dodge again! here comes Queequeg--
    </p>
    <p>
     all tattooing--looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself.  What says
    </p>
    <p>
     the Cannibal?  As I live he's comparing notes; looking at his thigh bone;
    </p>
    <p>
     thinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels,
    </p>
    <p>
     I suppose, as the old women talk Surgeon's Astronomy in the back country.
    </p>
    <p>
     And by Jove, he's found something there in the vicinity of his thigh--
    </p>
    <p>
     I guess it's Sagittarius, or the Archer.  No:  he don't know what to make
    </p>
    <p>
     of the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off some king's trowsers.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, aside again! here comes that ghost-devil, Fedallah; tail coiled
    </p>
    <p>
     out of sight as usual, oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
     What does he say, with that look of his?  Ah, only makes a sign
    </p>
    <p>
     to the sign and bows himself; there is a sun on the coin--
    </p>
    <p>
     fire worshipper, depend upon it.  Ho! more and more.  This way comes Pip--
    </p>
    <p>
     poor boy! would he had died, or I; he's half horrible to me.
    </p>
    <p>
     He too has been watching all of these interpreters myself included--
    </p>
    <p>
     and look now, he comes to read, with that unearthly idiot face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stand away again and hear him.  Hark!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Upon my soul, he's been studying Murray's Grammar!  Improving his mind,
    </p>
    <p>
     poor fellow!  But what's that he says now--hist!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, he's getting it by heart--hist! again."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, that's funny."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And I, you, and he; and we, ye, and they, are all bats;
    </p>
    <p>
     and I'm a crow, especially when I stand a'top of this pine
    </p>
    <p>
     tree here.  Caw! caw! caw! caw! caw! caw!  Ain't I a crow?
    </p>
    <p>
     And where's the scare-crow? There he stands; two bones stuck
    </p>
    <p>
     into a pair of old trowsers, and two more poked into the sleeves
    </p>
    <p>
     of an old jacket."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wonder if he means me?--complimentary--poor lad!--I could go
    </p>
    <p>
     hang myself.  Any way, for the present, I'll quit Pip's vicinity.
    </p>
    <p>
     I can stand the rest, for they have plain wits; but he's too
    </p>
    <p>
     crazy-witty for my sanity.  So, so, I leave him muttering."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Here's the ship's navel, this doubloon here, and they are all one fire
    </p>
    <p>
     to unscrew it.  But, unscrew your navel, and what's the consequence?
    </p>
    <p>
     Then again, if it stays here, that is ugly, too, for when aught's
    </p>
    <p>
     nailed to the mast it's a sign that things grow desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ha! ha! old Ahab! the White Whale; he'll nail ye!  This is a pine tree.
    </p>
    <p>
     My father, in old Tolland county, cut down a pine tree once, and found
    </p>
    <p>
     a silver ring grown over in it; some old darkey's wedding ring.
    </p>
    <p>
     How did it get there?  And so they'll say in the resurrection,
    </p>
    <p>
     when they come to fish up this old mast, and find a doubloon lodged in it,
    </p>
    <p>
     with bedded oysters for the shaggy bark.  Oh, the gold! the precious,
    </p>
    <p>
     precious gold!--the green miser'll hoard ye soon!  Hish! hish!
    </p>
    <p>
     God goes 'mong the worlds blackberrying.  Cook! ho, cook! and cook us!

     CHAPTER 100
    </head>
    <p>
     Leg and Arm
    </p>
    <p>
     The Pequod of Nantucket, Meets the Samuel Enderby, of London
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ship, ahoy!  Hast seen the White Whale?"
    </p>
    <p>
     So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colors,
    </p>
    <p>
     bearing down under the stern.  Trumpet to mouth, the old man was standing
    </p>
    <p>
     in his hoisted quarter-deck, his ivory leg plainly revealed to the
    </p>
    <p>
     stranger captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own boat's bow.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was a darkly-tanned, burly, goodnatured, fine-looking man, of sixty
    </p>
    <p>
     or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that hung round him
    </p>
    <p>
     in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty arm of this jacket
    </p>
    <p>
     streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a huzzar's surcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hast seen the White Whale!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "See you this?" and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it,
    </p>
    <p>
     he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden
    </p>
    <p>
     head like a mallet.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Man my boat!" cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars
    </p>
    <p>
     near him--"Stand by to lower!"
    </p>
    <p>
     In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft,
    </p>
    <p>
     he and his crew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside
    </p>
    <p>
     of the stranger.  But here a curious difficulty presented itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the excitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since
    </p>
    <p>
     the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any
    </p>
    <p>
     vessel at sea but his own, and then it was always by an ingenious
    </p>
    <p>
     and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel at
    </p>
    <p>
     a moment's warning.  Now, it is no very easy matter for anybody--
    </p>
    <p>
     except those who are almost hourly used to it, like whalemen--
    </p>
    <p>
     to clamber up a ship's side from a boat on the open sea;
    </p>
    <p>
     for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks,
    </p>
    <p>
     and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, deprived of one leg, and the strange ship of course being
    </p>
    <p>
     altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab now
    </p>
    <p>
     found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again;
    </p>
    <p>
     hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly
    </p>
    <p>
     hope to attain.
    </p>
    <p>
     It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward
    </p>
    <p>
     circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang
    </p>
    <p>
     from his luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or
    </p>
    <p>
     exasperated Ahab.  And in the present instance, all this was heightened
    </p>
    <p>
     by the sight of the two officers of the strange ship, leaning over
    </p>
    <p>
     the side, by the perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there,
    </p>
    <p>
     and swinging towards him a pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes;
    </p>
    <p>
     for at first they did not seem to bethink them that a one-legged
    </p>
    <p>
     man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea bannisters.
    </p>
    <p>
     But this awkwardness only lasted a minute, because the strange captain,
    </p>
    <p>
     observing at a glance how affairs stood, cried out, "I see, I see!--
    </p>
    <p>
     avast heaving there!  Jump, boys, and swing over the cutting-tackle."
    </p>
    <p>
     As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or
    </p>
    <p>
     two previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive
    </p>
    <p>
     curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all,
    </p>
    <p>
     slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like
    </p>
    <p>
     sitting in the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree),
    </p>
    <p>
     and then giving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time
    </p>
    <p>
     also helped to hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon
    </p>
    <p>
     one of the running parts of the tackle.  Soon he was carefully swung
    </p>
    <p>
     inside the high bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head.
    </p>
    <p>
     With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other
    </p>
    <p>
     captain advanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg, and crossing
    </p>
    <p>
     the ivory arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way,
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, aye, hearty! let us shake bones together!--an arm and a leg!--
    </p>
    <p>
     an arm that never can shrink, d'ye see; and a leg that never can run.
    </p>
    <p>
     Where did'st thou see the White Whale?--how long ago?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "The White Whale," said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm
    </p>
    <p>
     towards the East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it
    </p>
    <p>
     had been a telescope; There I saw him, on the Line, last season."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And he took that arm off, did he?" asked Ahab, now sliding
    </p>
    <p>
     down from the capstan, and resting on the Englishman's shoulder,
    </p>
    <p>
     as he did so.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Spin me the yarn," said Ahab; "how was it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,"
    </p>
    <p>
     began the Englishman.  "I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my
    </p>
    <p>
     boat fastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too,
    </p>
    <p>
     that went milling and milling round so that my boat's crew could
    </p>
    <p>
     only trim dish, by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale.
    </p>
    <p>
     Presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     with a milky-white head and hump, all crows' feet and wrinkles."
    </p>
    <p>
     "It was he, it was he!" cried Ahab, suddenly letting out
    </p>
    <p>
     his suspended breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.  Aye, aye--
    </p>
    <p>
     they were mine--my irons," cried Ahab, exultingly--"but on!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Give me a chance, then," said the Englishman, good-humoredly. "Well,
    </p>
    <p>
     this old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs all afoam
    </p>
    <p>
     into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, I see!--wanted to part it; free the fast-fish--an old trick--
    </p>
    <p>
     I know him."
    </p>
    <p>
     "How it was exactly," continued the one-armed commander,
    </p>
    <p>
     "I do not know; but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth,
    </p>
    <p>
     caught there somehow; but we didn't know it then; so that when we
    </p>
    <p>
     afterwards pulled on the line, bounce we came plump on to his hump!
    </p>
    <p>
     instead of the other whale's; that went off to windward, all fluking.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seeing how matters stood, and what a noble great whale it was--
    </p>
    <p>
     the noblest and biggest I ever saw, sir, in my life--I resolved
    </p>
    <p>
     to capture him, spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in.
    </p>
    <p>
     And thinking the hap-hazard line would get loose, or the tooth
    </p>
    <p>
     it was tangled to might draw (for I have a devil of a boat's
    </p>
    <p>
     crew for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I say,
    </p>
    <p>
     I jumped into my first mate's boat--Mr. Mounttop's here
    </p>
    <p>
     (by the way, Captain--Mounttop; Mounttop--the captain);--
    </p>
    <p>
     as I was saying, I jumped into Mounttop's boat, which, d'ye see,
    </p>
    <p>
     was gunwale and gunwale with mine, then; and snatching the
    </p>
    <p>
     first harpoon, let this old great-grandfather have it.  But, Lord,
    </p>
    <p>
     look you, sir--hearts and souls alive, man--the next instant,
    </p>
    <p>
     in a jiff, I was blind as a bat--both eyes out--all befogged
    </p>
    <p>
     and bedeadened with black foam--the whale's tail looming straight
    </p>
    <p>
     up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble steeple.
    </p>
    <p>
     No use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday,
    </p>
    <p>
     with a blinding sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say,
    </p>
    <p>
     after the second iron, to toss it overboard--down comes the tail
    </p>
    <p>
     like a Lima tower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each half
    </p>
    <p>
     in splinters; and, flukes first, the white hump backed through
    </p>
    <p>
     the wreck, as though it was all chips.  We all struck out.
    </p>
    <p>
     To escape his terrible flailings, I seized hold of my harpoon-pole
    </p>
    <p>
     sticking in him, and for a moment clung to that like a sucking fish.
    </p>
    <p>
     But a combing sea dashed me off, and at the same instant,
    </p>
    <p>
     the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down like a flash;
    </p>
    <p>
     and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me
    </p>
    <p>
     caught me here" (clapping his hand just below his shoulder);
    </p>
    <p>
     "yes, caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to
    </p>
    <p>
     Hell's flames, I was thinking; when, when, all of a sudden,
    </p>
    <p>
     thank the good God, the barb ript its way along the flesh--
    </p>
    <p>
     clear along the whole length of my arm--came out nigh my wrist,
    </p>
    <p>
     and up I floated;--and that gentleman there will tell you the rest
    </p>
    <p>
     (by the way, captain--Dr. Bunger, ship's surgeon:  Bunger, my lad,--
    </p>
    <p>
     the captain). Now, Bunger boy, spin your part of the yarn."
    </p>
    <p>
     The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out,
    </p>
    <p>
     had been all the time standing near them, with nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     specific visible, to denote his gentlemanly rank on board.
    </p>
    <p>
     His face was an exceedingly round but sober one; he was dressed
    </p>
    <p>
     in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and patched trowsers;
    </p>
    <p>
     and had thus far been dividing his attention between a marlingspike
    </p>
    <p>
     he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in the other,
    </p>
    <p>
     occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of
    </p>
    <p>
     the two crippled captains.  But, at his superior's introduction
    </p>
    <p>
     of him to Ahab, he politely bowed, and straightway went on
    </p>
    <p>
     to do his captain's bidding.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It was a shocking bad wound," began the whale-surgeon;
    </p>
    <p>
     "and, taking my advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy-"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship," interrupted the
    </p>
    <p>
     one-armed captain, addressing Ahab; "go on, boy."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Stood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing
    </p>
    <p>
     hot weather there on the Line.  But it was no use--I did all I could;
    </p>
    <p>
     sat up with him nights; was very severe with him in the matter of diet-"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, very severe!" chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly
    </p>
    <p>
     altering his voice, "Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night,
    </p>
    <p>
     till he couldn't see to put on the bandages; and sending me
    </p>
    <p>
     to bed, half seas over, about three o'clock in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, ye stars! he sat up with me indeed, and was very severe
    </p>
    <p>
     in my diet.  Oh! a great watcher, and very dietetically severe,
    </p>
    <p>
     is Dr. Bunger.  (Bunger, you dog, laugh out! why don't ye?
    </p>
    <p>
     You know you're a precious jolly rascal.) But, heave ahead, boy,
    </p>
    <p>
     I'd rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man."
    </p>
    <p>
     "My captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sir"--
    </p>
    <p>
     said the imperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing
    </p>
    <p>
     to Ahab--"is apt to be facetious at times; he spins us many
    </p>
    <p>
     clever things of that sort.  But I may as well say--en passant,
    </p>
    <p>
     as the French remark--that I myself--that is to say, Jack Bunger,
    </p>
    <p>
     late of the reverend clergy--am a strict total abstinence man;
    </p>
    <p>
     I never drink-"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Water!" cried the captain; "he never drinks it; it's a sort
    </p>
    <p>
     of fits to him; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia;
    </p>
    <p>
     but go on--go on with the arm story."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, I may as well," said the surgeon, coolly.  "I was about
    </p>
    <p>
     observing, sir, before Captain Boomer's facetious interruption,
    </p>
    <p>
     that spite of my best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting
    </p>
    <p>
     worse and worse; the truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound
    </p>
    <p>
     as surgeon ever saw; more than two feet and several inches long.
    </p>
    <p>
     I measured it with the lead line.  In short, it grew black;
    </p>
    <p>
     I knew what was threatened, and off it came.  But I had no hand
    </p>
    <p>
     in shipping that ivory arm there; that thing is against all rule"--
    </p>
    <p>
     pointing at it with the marlingspike--"that is the captain's work,
    </p>
    <p>
     not mine; he ordered the carpenter to make it; he had that club-hammer
    </p>
    <p>
     there put to the end, to knock some one's brains out with, I suppose,
    </p>
    <p>
     as he tried mine once.  He flies into diabolical passions sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Do ye see this dent, sir"--removing his hat, and brushing aside his hair,
    </p>
    <p>
     and exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull, but which bore not
    </p>
    <p>
     the slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever having been a wound--
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, the captain there will tell you how that came there; he knows."
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, I don't," said the captain, "but his mother did;
    </p>
    <p>
     he was born with it.  Oh, you solemn rogue, you--you Bunger!
    </p>
    <p>
     was there ever such another Bunger in the watery world?
    </p>
    <p>
     Bunger, when you die, you ought to die in pickle, you dog;
    </p>
    <p>
     you should be preserved to future ages, you rascal."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What became of the White Whale?" now cried Ahab, who thus far had been
    </p>
    <p>
     impatiently listening to this byeplay between the two Englishmen.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh!" cried the one-armed captain, Oh, yes!  Well; after he sounded,
    </p>
    <p>
     we didn't see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted,
    </p>
    <p>
     I didn't then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick,
    </p>
    <p>
     till some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard
    </p>
    <p>
     about Moby Dick--as some call him--and then I knew it was he."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Did'st thou cross his wake again?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Twice."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But could not fasten?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Didn't want to try to; ain't one limb enough?  What should I
    </p>
    <p>
     do without this other arm?  And I'm thinking Moby Dick doesn't
    </p>
    <p>
     bite so much as he swallows."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, then," interrupted Bunger, "give him your left arm for
    </p>
    <p>
     bait to get the right.  Do you know, gentlemen"--very gravely
    </p>
    <p>
     and mathematically bowing to each Captain in succession--"Do
    </p>
    <p>
     you know, gentlemen, that the digestive organs of the whale
    </p>
    <p>
     are so inscrutably constructed by Divine Providence, that it is
    </p>
    <p>
     quite impossible for him to completely digest even a man's arm?
    </p>
    <p>
     And he knows it too.  So that what you take for the White Whale's
    </p>
    <p>
     malice is only his awkwardness.  For he never means to
    </p>
    <p>
     swallow a single limb; he only thinks to terrify by feints.
    </p>
    <p>
     But sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient
    </p>
    <p>
     of mine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow jack-knives,
    </p>
    <p>
     once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest,
    </p>
    <p>
     and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more; when I gave
    </p>
    <p>
     him an emetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks, d'ye see?
    </p>
    <p>
     No possible way for him to digest that jack-knife, and fully
    </p>
    <p>
     incorporate it into his general bodily system.  Yes, Captain Boomer,
    </p>
    <p>
     if you are quick enough about it, and have a mind to pawn
    </p>
    <p>
     one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial
    </p>
    <p>
     to the other, why, in that case the arm is yours; only let
    </p>
    <p>
     the whale have another chance at you shortly, that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, thank you, Bunger," said the English Captain, "he's welcome
    </p>
    <p>
     to the arm he has, since I can't help it, and didn't know
    </p>
    <p>
     him then; but not to another one.  No more White Whales for me;
    </p>
    <p>
     I've lowered for him once, and that has satisfied me.
    </p>
    <p>
     There would be great glory in killing him, I know that;
    </p>
    <p>
     and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him, but, hark ye,
    </p>
    <p>
     he's best let alone; don't you think so, Captain?"--glancing at
    </p>
    <p>
     the ivory leg.
    </p>
    <p>
     "He is.  But he will still be hunted, for all that.  What is best
    </p>
    <p>
     let alone, that accursed thing is not always what least allures.
    </p>
    <p>
     He's all a magnet!  How long since thou saw'st him last?
    </p>
    <p>
     Which way heading?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend's," cried Bunger,
    </p>
    <p>
     stoopingly walking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing;
    </p>
    <p>
     "this man's blood--bring the thermometer!--it's at the boiling point!--
    </p>
    <p>
     his pulse makes these planks beat!--sir!"--taking a lancet from
    </p>
    <p>
     his pocket, and drawing near to Ahab's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Avast!" roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks--"Man the boat!
    </p>
    <p>
     Which way heading?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good God!" cried the English Captain, to whom the question was put.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What's the matter?  He was heading east, I think.--Is your
    </p>
    <p>
     Captain crazy?" whispering Fedallah.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks
    </p>
    <p>
     to take the boat's steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle
    </p>
    <p>
     towards him commanded the ship's sailors to stand by to lower.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a moment he was standing in the boat's stern, and the Manilla men
    </p>
    <p>
     were springing to their oars.  In vain the English Captain hailed him.
    </p>
    <p>
     With back to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint to his own,
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod.

    <p>
     The Decanter
    </p>
    <p>
     Ere the English ship fades from sight be it set down here, that she
    </p>
    <p>
     hailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby,
    </p>
    <p>
     merchant of that city, the original of the famous whaling house
    </p>
    <p>
     of enderby and sons; a house which in my poor whaleman's opinion,
    </p>
    <p>
     comes not far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons,
    </p>
    <p>
     in point of real historical interest.  How long, prior to the year
    </p>
    <p>
     of our Lord 1775, this great whaling house was in existence,
    </p>
    <p>
     my numerous fish-documents do not make plain; but in that year
    </p>
    <p>
     (1775) it fitted out the first English ships that ever regularly
    </p>
    <p>
     hunted the Sperm Whale; though for some score of years previous
    </p>
    <p>
     (ever since 1726) our valiant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket
    </p>
    <p>
     and the Vineyard had in large fleets pursued the Leviathan,
    </p>
    <p>
     but only in the North and South Atlantic:  not elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
     Be it distinctly recorded here, that the Nantucketers were the first
    </p>
    <p>
     among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm Whale;
    </p>
    <p>
     and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole
    </p>
    <p>
     globe who so harpooned him.
    </p>
    <p>
     In 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose,
    </p>
    <p>
     and at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded
    </p>
    <p>
     Cape Horn, and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat
    </p>
    <p>
     of any sort in the great South Sea.  The voyage was a skilful
    </p>
    <p>
     and lucky one; and returning to her berth with her hold full
    </p>
    <p>
     of the precious sperm, the Amelia's example was soon followed
    </p>
    <p>
     by other ships, English and American, and thus the vast Sperm Whale
    </p>
    <p>
     grounds of the Pacific were thrown open.  But not content with this
    </p>
    <p>
     good deed, the indefatigable house again bestirred itself:
    </p>
    <p>
     Samuel and all his Sons--how many, their mother only knows--and under
    </p>
    <p>
     their immediate auspices, and partly, I think, at their expense,
    </p>
    <p>
     the British government was induced to send the sloop-of-war Rattler
    </p>
    <p>
     on a whaling voyage of discovery into the South Sea.  Commanded by
    </p>
    <p>
     a naval Post-Captain, the Rattler made a rattling voyage of it,
    </p>
    <p>
     and did some service; how much does not appear.  But this is not all.
    </p>
    <p>
     In 1819, the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own,
    </p>
    <p>
     to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan.  That ship--
    </p>
    <p>
     well called the "Syren"--made a noble experimental cruise;
    </p>
    <p>
     and it was thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became
    </p>
    <p>
     generally known.  The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded
    </p>
    <p>
     by a Captain Coffin, a Nantucketer.
    </p>
    <p>
     All honor to the Enderbies, therefore, whose house, I think,
    </p>
    <p>
     exists to the present day; though doubtless the original Samuel
    </p>
    <p>
     must long ago have slipped his cable for the great South Sea
    </p>
    <p>
     of the other world.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ship named after him was worthy of the honor, being a very fast sailer
    </p>
    <p>
     and a noble craft every way.  I boarded her once at midnight somewhere
    </p>
    <p>
     off the Patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the forecastle.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a fine gam we had, and they were all trumps--every soul on board.
    </p>
    <p>
     A short life to them, and a jolly death.  And that fine gam I had--
    </p>
    <p>
     long, very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his ivory heel--
    </p>
    <p>
     it minds me of the noble, solid, Saxon hospitality of that ship;
    </p>
    <p>
     and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember me, if I ever
    </p>
    <p>
     lose sight of it.  Flip?  Did I say we had flip?  Yes, and we flipped
    </p>
    <p>
     it at the rate of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall came
    </p>
    <p>
     (for it's squally off there by Patagonia), and all hands--
    </p>
    <p>
     visitors and all--were called to reef topsails, we were so top-heavy
    </p>
    <p>
     that we had to swing each other aloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly
    </p>
    <p>
     furled the skirts of our jackets into the sails, so that we hung there,
    </p>
    <p>
     reefed fast in the howling gale, a warning example to all drunken tars.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, the masts did not go overboard; and by and by we scrambled down,
    </p>
    <p>
     so sober, that we had to pass the flip again, though the savage salt
    </p>
    <p>
     spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted
    </p>
    <p>
     and pickled it for my taste.
    </p>
    <p>
     The beef was fine--tough, but with body in it.
    </p>
    <p>
     They said it was bullbeef; others, that it was dromedary beef;
    </p>
    <p>
     but I do not know, for certain, how that was.  They had
    </p>
    <p>
     dumplings too; small, but substantial, symmetrically globular,
    </p>
    <p>
     and indestructible dumplings.  I fancied that you could feel them,
    </p>
    <p>
     and roll them about in you after they were swallowed.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you stooped over too far forward, you risked their
    </p>
    <p>
     pitching out of you like billiard-balls. The bread--
    </p>
    <p>
     but that couldn't be helped; besides, it was an anti-scorbutic,
    </p>
    <p>
     in short, the bread contained the only fresh fare they had.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the forecastle was not very light, and it was very easy
    </p>
    <p>
     to step over into a dark corner when you ate it.  But all in all,
    </p>
    <p>
     taking her from truck to helm, considering the dimensions
    </p>
    <p>
     of the cook's boilers, including his own live parchment boilers;
    </p>
    <p>
     fore and aft, I say, the Samuel Enderby was a jolly ship;
    </p>
    <p>
     of good fare and plenty; fine flip and strong; crack fellows all,
    </p>
    <p>
     and capital from boot heels to hat-band.
    </p>
    <p>
     But why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other
    </p>
    <p>
     English whalers I know of--not all though--were such famous,
    </p>
    <p>
     hospitable ships; that passed round the beef, and the bread,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the can, and the joke; and were not soon weary of eating,
    </p>
    <p>
     and drinking, and laughing?  I will tell you.  The abounding good
    </p>
    <p>
     cheer of these English whalers is matter for historical research.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor have I been at all sparing of historical whale research,
    </p>
    <p>
     when it has seemed needed.
    </p>
    <p>
     The English were preceded in the whale fishery by
    </p>
    <p>
     the Hollanders, Zealanders, and Danes; from whom they derived
    </p>
    <p>
     many terms still extant in the fishery; and what is yet more,
    </p>
    <p>
     their fat old fashions, touching plenty to eat and drink.
    </p>
    <p>
     For, as a general thing, the English merchant-ship scrimps her crew;
    </p>
    <p>
     but not so the English whaler.  Hence, in the English, this thing
    </p>
    <p>
     of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural, but incidental
    </p>
    <p>
     and particular; and, therefore, must have some special origin,
    </p>
    <p>
     which is here pointed out, and will be still further elucidated.
    </p>
    <p>
     During my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon
    </p>
    <p>
     an ancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it,
    </p>
    <p>
     I knew must be about whalers.  The title was, "Dan Coopman,"
    </p>
    <p>
     wherefore I concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs
    </p>
    <p>
     of some Amsterdam cooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must
    </p>
    <p>
     carry its cooper.  I was reinforced in this opinion by seeing
    </p>
    <p>
     that it was the production of one "Fitz Swackhammer."  But my
    </p>
    <p>
     friend Dr. Snodhead, a very learned man, professor of Low Dutch
    </p>
    <p>
     and High German in the college of Santa Claus and St. Potts,
    </p>
    <p>
     to whom I handed the work for translation, giving him a box of sperm
    </p>
    <p>
     candles for his trouble--this same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as he spied
    </p>
    <p>
     the book, assured me that "Dan Coopman" did not mean "The Cooper,"
    </p>
    <p>
     but "The Merchant."  In short, this ancient and learned Low Dutch
    </p>
    <p>
     book treated of the commerce of Holland; and, among other subjects,
    </p>
    <p>
     contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery.
    </p>
    <p>
     And in this chapter it was, headed, "Smeer," or "Fat," that I
    </p>
    <p>
     found a long detailed list of the outfits for the larders
    </p>
    <p>
     and cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen; from which list,
    </p>
    <p>
     as translated by Dr. Snodhead, I transcribe the following:
    </p>
    <p>
     0084400,000 lbs. of beef.
    </p>
    <p>
     60,000 lbs. Friesland pork.
    </p>
    <p>
     150,000 lbs. of stock fish.
    </p>
    <p>
     550,000 lbs. of biscuit.
    </p>
    <p>
     72,000 lbs. of soft bread.
    </p>
    <p>
     2,800 firkins of butter.
    </p>
    <p>
     20,000 lbs. of Texel and Leyden cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
     144,000 lbs. cheese (probably an inferior article).
    </p>
    <p>
     550 ankers of Geneva.
    </p>
    <p>
     10,800 barrels of beer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading;
    </p>
    <p>
     not so in the present case, however, where the reader is flooded
    </p>
    <p>
     with whole pipes, barrels, quarts, and gills of good gin
    </p>
    <p>
     and good cheer.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all
    </p>
    <p>
     this beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts
    </p>
    <p>
     were incidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcendental
    </p>
    <p>
     and Platonic application; and, furthermore, I compiled supplementary
    </p>
    <p>
     tables of my own, touching the probable quantity of stock-fish, &amp;c.,
    </p>
    <p>
     consumed by every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland
    </p>
    <p>
     and Spitzbergen whale fishery.  In the first place, the amount
    </p>
    <p>
     of butter, and Texel and Leyden cheese consumed, seems amazing.
    </p>
    <p>
     I impute it, though, to their naturally unctuous natures,
    </p>
    <p>
     being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation,
    </p>
    <p>
     and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid Polar Seas,
    </p>
    <p>
     on the very coasts of that Esquimaux country where the convivial
    </p>
    <p>
     natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil.
    </p>
    <p>
     The quantity of the beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, as those polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short
    </p>
    <p>
     summer of that climate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch
    </p>
    <p>
     whalemen, including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     did not much exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men
    </p>
    <p>
     to each of their fleet of 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen
    </p>
    <p>
     in all; therefore, I say, we have precisely two barrels of beer
    </p>
    <p>
     per man, for a twelve weeks' allowance, exclusive of his fair
    </p>
    <p>
     proportion of that 550 ankers of gin.  Now, whether these gin and
    </p>
    <p>
     beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one might fancy them to have been,
    </p>
    <p>
     were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat's head, and take
    </p>
    <p>
     good aim at flying whales; this would seem somewhat improbable.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet they did aim at them, and hit them too.  But this was very far North,
    </p>
    <p>
     be it remembered, where beer agrees well with the constitution;
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the Equator, in our southern fishery, beer would be apt to make
    </p>
    <p>
     the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his boat;
    </p>
    <p>
     and grievous loss might ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford.
    </p>
    <p>
     But no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch
    </p>
    <p>
     whalers of two or three centuries ago were high livers; and that
    </p>
    <p>
     the English whalers have not neglected so excellent an example.
    </p>
    <p>
     For, say they, when cruising in an empty ship, if you can get nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     better out of the world, get a good dinner out of it, at least.
    </p>
    <p>
     And this empties the decanter.

     CHAPTER 102
    </head>
    <p>
     A Bower in the Arsacides
    </p>
    <p>
     Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have
    </p>
    <p>
     chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately
    </p>
    <p>
     and in detail upon some few interior structural features.
    </p>
    <p>
     But to a large and thorough sweeping comprehension of him,
    </p>
    <p>
     it behoves me now to unbutton him still further, and untagging
    </p>
    <p>
     the points of his hose, unbuckling his garters, and casting loose
    </p>
    <p>
     the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones,
    </p>
    <p>
     set him before you in his ultimatum; that is to say,
    </p>
    <p>
     in his unconditional skeleton.
    </p>
    <p>
     But how now, Ishmael?  How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in
    </p>
    <p>
     the fishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts
    </p>
    <p>
     of the whale?  Did erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan,
    </p>
    <p>
     deliver lectures on the anatomy of the Cetacea; and by help
    </p>
    <p>
     of the windlass, hold up a specimen rib for exhibition?
    </p>
    <p>
     Explain thyself, Ishmael.  Can you land a full-grown whale on your
    </p>
    <p>
     deck for examination, as a cook dishes a roast-pig? Surely not.
    </p>
    <p>
     A veritable witness have you hitherto been, Ishmael;
    </p>
    <p>
     but have a care how you seize the privilege of Jonah alone;
    </p>
    <p>
     the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams;
    </p>
    <p>
     the rafters, ridge-pole, sleepers, and under-pinnings, making
    </p>
    <p>
     up the frame-work of leviathan; and belike of the tallow-vats,
    </p>
    <p>
     dairy-rooms, butteries, and cheeseries in his bowels.
    </p>
    <p>
     I confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very far
    </p>
    <p>
     beneath the skin of the adult whale; nevertheless, I have been
    </p>
    <p>
     blessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a ship I belonged to, a small cub Sperm Whale was once
    </p>
    <p>
     bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag, to make sheaths
    </p>
    <p>
     for the barbs of the harpoons, and for the heads of the lances.
    </p>
    <p>
     Think you I let that chance go, without using my boat-hatchet
    </p>
    <p>
     and jack-knife, and breaking the seal and reading all the contents
    </p>
    <p>
     of that young cub?
    </p>
    <p>
     And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan
    </p>
    <p>
     in their gigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge
    </p>
    <p>
     I am indebted to my late royal friend Tranquo, king of Tranque,
    </p>
    <p>
     one of the Arsacides.  For being at Tranque, years ago,
    </p>
    <p>
     when attached to the trading-ship Dey of Algiers, I was invited
    </p>
    <p>
     to spend part of the Arsacidean holidays with the lord of Tranque,
    </p>
    <p>
     at his retired palm villa at Pupella; a sea-side glen not very far
    </p>
    <p>
     distant from what our sailors called Bamboo-Town, his capital.
    </p>
    <p>
     Among many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo,
    </p>
    <p>
     being gifted with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu,
    </p>
    <p>
     had brought together in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious
    </p>
    <p>
     of his people could invent; chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices,
    </p>
    <p>
     chiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic canoes;
    </p>
    <p>
     and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders,
    </p>
    <p>
     the wonder-freighted, tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his shores.
    </p>
    <p>
     Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an
    </p>
    <p>
     unusually long raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with his
    </p>
    <p>
     head against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted droopings
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed his verdant jet.  When the vast body had at last been stripped
    </p>
    <p>
     of its fathomdeep enfoldings, and the bones become dust dry in the sun,
    </p>
    <p>
     then the skeleton was carefully transported up the Pupella glen,
    </p>
    <p>
     where a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebrae were carved
    </p>
    <p>
     with Arsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull,
    </p>
    <p>
     the priests kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic
    </p>
    <p>
     head again sent forth its vapory spout; while, suspended from
    </p>
    <p>
     a bough, the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees,
    </p>
    <p>
     like the hair-hung sword that so affrighted Damocles.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a wondrous sight.  The wood was green as mosses of the Icy Glen;
    </p>
    <p>
     the trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap;
    </p>
    <p>
     the industrious earth beneath was as a weaver's loom,
    </p>
    <p>
     with a gorgeous carpet on it, whereof the ground-vine tendrils
    </p>
    <p>
     formed the warp and woof, and the living flowers the figures.
    </p>
    <p>
     All the trees, with all their laden branches; all the shrubs,
    </p>
    <p>
     and ferns, and grasses; the message-carrying air; all these
    </p>
    <p>
     unceasingly were active.  Through the lacings of the leaves,
    </p>
    <p>
     the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!--pause!--one word!--
    </p>
    <p>
     whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore
    </p>
    <p>
     all these ceaseless toilings?  Speak, weaver!--stay thy hand!--
    </p>
    <p>
     but one single word with thee!  Nay--the shuttle flies--
    </p>
    <p>
     the figures float from forth the loom; the fresher-rushing
    </p>
    <p>
     carpet for ever slides away.  The weaver-god, he weaves;
    </p>
    <p>
     and by that weaving is he deafened, that he hears no mortal voice;
    </p>
    <p>
     and by that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened;
    </p>
    <p>
     and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that
    </p>
    <p>
     speak through it.  For even so it is in all material factories.
    </p>
    <p>
     The spoken words that are inaudible among the flying spindles;
    </p>
    <p>
     those same words are plainly heard without the walls, bursting from
    </p>
    <p>
     the opened casements.  Thereby have villainies been detected.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ah, mortal! then, be heedful; for so, in all this din of the great
    </p>
    <p>
     world's loom, thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood,
    </p>
    <p>
     the great, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging--a gigantic idler!
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed
    </p>
    <p>
     around him, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all woven
    </p>
    <p>
     over with the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher verdure;
    </p>
    <p>
     but himself a skeleton.  Life folded Death; Death trellised Life;
    </p>
    <p>
     the grim god wived with youthful Life, and begat him curly-headed glories.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     and saw the skull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending
    </p>
    <p>
     from where the real jet had issued, I marvelled that the king
    </p>
    <p>
     should regard a chapel as an object of vertu.  He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
     But more I marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jet
    </p>
    <p>
     of his was genuine.  To and fro I paced before this skeleton--
    </p>
    <p>
     brushed the vines aside--broke through the ribs--and with a ball
    </p>
    <p>
     of Arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long amid its many winding,
    </p>
    <p>
     shaded colonnades and arbors.  But soon my line was out;
    </p>
    <p>
     and following it back, I emerged from the opening where I entered.
    </p>
    <p>
     I saw no living thing within; naught was there but bones.
    </p>
    <p>
     Cutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within
    </p>
    <p>
     the skeleton.  From their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests
    </p>
    <p>
     perceived me taking the altitude of the final rib, "How now!"
    </p>
    <p>
     they shouted; "Dar'st thou measure this our god!  That's for us."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, priests--well, how long do ye make him, then?"  But hereupon
    </p>
    <p>
     a fierce contest rose among them, concerning feet and inches;
    </p>
    <p>
     they cracked each other's sconces with their yard-sticks--
    </p>
    <p>
     the great skull echoed--and seizing that lucky chance,
    </p>
    <p>
     I quickly concluded my own admeasurements.
    </p>
    <p>
     These admeasurements I now propose to set before you.
    </p>
    <p>
     But first, be it recorded, that, in this matter, I am not free
    </p>
    <p>
     to utter any fancied measurements I please.  Because there are
    </p>
    <p>
     skeleton authorities you can refer to, to test my accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is a Leviathanic Museum, they tell me, in Hull, England,
    </p>
    <p>
     one of the whaling ports of that country, where they have some
    </p>
    <p>
     fine specimens of fin-backs and other whales.  Likewise, I have
    </p>
    <p>
     heard that in the museum of Manchester, in New Hampshire,
    </p>
    <p>
     they have what the proprietors call "the only perfect specimen
    </p>
    <p>
     of a Greenland or River Whale in the United States."  Moreover, at a
    </p>
    <p>
     place in Yorkshire, England, Burton Constable by name, a certain
    </p>
    <p>
     Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession the skeleton of a
    </p>
    <p>
     Sperm Whale, but of moderate size, by no means of the full-grown
    </p>
    <p>
     magnitude of my friend King Tranquo's.
    </p>
    <p>
     In both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged,
    </p>
    <p>
     were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
     King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it; and Sir Clifford,
    </p>
    <p>
     because he was lord of the seignories of those parts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sir Clifford's whale has been articulated throughout; so that,
    </p>
    <p>
     like a great chest of drawers, you can open and shut him,
    </p>
    <p>
     in all his bony cavities--spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan--
    </p>
    <p>
     and swing all day upon his lower jaw.  Locks are to be put
    </p>
    <p>
     upon some of his trap-doors and shutters; and a footman will
    </p>
    <p>
     show round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering
    </p>
    <p>
     gallery in the spinal column; threepence to hear the echo
    </p>
    <p>
     in the hollow of his cerebellum; and sixpence for the unrivalled
    </p>
    <p>
     view from his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
     The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are
    </p>
    <p>
     copied verbatim from my right arm, where I had them tattooed;
    </p>
    <p>
     as in my wild wanderings at that period, there was no
    </p>
    <p>
     other secure way of preserving such valuable statistics.
    </p>
    <p>
     But as I was crowded for space, and wished the other parts of my
    </p>
    <p>
     body to remain a blank page for a poem I was then composing--
    </p>
    <p>
     at least, what untattooed parts might remain--I did not trouble
    </p>
    <p>
     myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed, should inches at all
    </p>
    <p>
     enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale.

     CHAPTER 103
    </head>
    <p>
     Measurement of The Whale's Skeleton
    </p>
    <p>
     In the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular,
    </p>
    <p>
     plain statement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan,
    </p>
    <p>
     whose skeleton we are briefly to exhibit.  Such a statement
    </p>
    <p>
     may prove useful here.
    </p>
    <p>
     According to a careful calculation I have made, and which I
    </p>
    <p>
     partly base upon Captain Scoresby's estimate, of seventy tons
    </p>
    <p>
     for the largest sized Greenland whale of sixty feet in length;
    </p>
    <p>
     according to my careful calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the
    </p>
    <p>
     largest magnitude, between eighty-five and ninety feet in length,
    </p>
    <p>
     and something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference,
    </p>
    <p>
     such a whale will weigh at least ninety tons; so that,
    </p>
    <p>
     reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would considerably outweigh
    </p>
    <p>
     the combined population of a whole village of one thousand
    </p>
    <p>
     one hundred inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
     Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to
    </p>
    <p>
     this leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman's imagination?
    </p>
    <p>
     Having already in various ways put before you his skull,
    </p>
    <p>
     spout-hole, jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts,
    </p>
    <p>
     I shall now simply point out what is most interesting in the
    </p>
    <p>
     general bulk of his unobstructed bones.  But as the colossal
    </p>
    <p>
     skull embraces so very large a proportion of the entire extent
    </p>
    <p>
     of the skeleton; as it is by far the most complicated part;
    </p>
    <p>
     and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter,
    </p>
    <p>
     you must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under your arm,
    </p>
    <p>
     as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a complete notion
    </p>
    <p>
     of the general structure we are about to view.
    </p>
    <p>
     In length, the Sperm Whale's skeleton at Tranque measured
    </p>
    <p>
     seventy-two feet:  so that when fully invested and extended in life,
    </p>
    <p>
     he must have been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton
    </p>
    <p>
     loses about one fifth in length compared with the living body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of this seventy-two feet, his skull and jaw comprised some
    </p>
    <p>
     twenty feet, leaving some fifty feet of plain backbone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Attached to this back-bone, for something less than a third
    </p>
    <p>
     of its length, was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once
    </p>
    <p>
     enclosed his vitals.
    </p>
    <p>
     To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,
    </p>
    <p>
     extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled
    </p>
    <p>
     the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some
    </p>
    <p>
     twenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise,
    </p>
    <p>
     for the time, but a long, disconnected timber.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ribs were ten on a side.  The first, to begin from the neck,
    </p>
    <p>
     was nearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each
    </p>
    <p>
     successively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth,
    </p>
    <p>
     or one of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and
    </p>
    <p>
     some inches.  From that part, the remaining ribs diminished,
    </p>
    <p>
     till the tenth and last only spanned five feet and some inches.
    </p>
    <p>
     In general thickness, they all bore a seemly correspondence
    </p>
    <p>
     to their length.  The middle ribs were the most arched.
    </p>
    <p>
     In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay
    </p>
    <p>
     footpath bridges over small streams.
    </p>
    <p>
     In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with
    </p>
    <p>
     the circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton
    </p>
    <p>
     of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form.
    </p>
    <p>
     The largest of the Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones,
    </p>
    <p>
     occupied that part of the fish which, in life, is greatest
    </p>
    <p>
     in depth.  Now, the greatest depth of the invested body of this
    </p>
    <p>
     particular whale must have been at least sixteen feet; whereas,
    </p>
    <p>
     the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion
    </p>
    <p>
     of the living magnitude of that part.  Besides, for some way,
    </p>
    <p>
     where I now saw but a naked spine, all that had been once wrapped
    </p>
    <p>
     round with tons of added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still more, for the ample fins, I here saw but a few disordered joints;
    </p>
    <p>
     and in place of the weighty and majestic, but boneless flukes,
    </p>
    <p>
     an utter blank!
    </p>
    <p>
     How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man
    </p>
    <p>
     to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring
    </p>
    <p>
     over his dead attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood.
    </p>
    <p>
     No. Only in the heart of quickest perils; only when within
    </p>
    <p>
     the eddyings of his angry flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     can the fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the spine.  For that, the best way we can consider it is,
    </p>
    <p>
     with a crane, to pile its bones high up on end.  No speedy enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
     But now it's done, it looks much like Pompey's Pillar.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are forty and odd vertebrae in all, which in the skeleton
    </p>
    <p>
     are not locked together.  They mostly lie like the great knobbed
    </p>
    <p>
     blocks on a Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry.
    </p>
    <p>
     The largest, a middle one, is in width something less than three feet,
    </p>
    <p>
     and in depth more than four.  The smallest, where the spine tapers
    </p>
    <p>
     away into the tail, is only two inches in width, and looks something
    </p>
    <p>
     like a white billiard-ball. I was told that there were still
    </p>
    <p>
     smaller ones, but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins,
    </p>
    <p>
     the priest's children, who had stolen them to play marbles with.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus we see how that the spine of even the hugest of living things
    </p>
    <p>
     tapers off at last into simple child's play.

    <p>
     The Fossil Whale
    </p>
    <p>
     From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme
    </p>
    <p>
     whereon to enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate.  Would you,
    </p>
    <p>
     you could not compress him.  By good rights he should only be
    </p>
    <p>
     treated of in imperial folio.  Not to tell over again his furlongs
    </p>
    <p>
     from spiracle to tail, and the yards he measures about the waist;
    </p>
    <p>
     only think of the gigantic involutions of his intestines,
    </p>
    <p>
     where they lie in him like great cables and hawsers coiled away
    </p>
    <p>
     in the subterranean orlop-deck of a line-of-battle-ship.
    </p>
    <p>
     Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behoves
    </p>
    <p>
     me to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise;
    </p>
    <p>
     not overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood,
    </p>
    <p>
     and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his bowels.
    </p>
    <p>
     Having already described him in most of his present habitatory
    </p>
    <p>
     and anatomical peculiarities, it now remains to magnify him in
    </p>
    <p>
     an archaeological, fossiliferous, and antediluvian point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
     Applied to any other creature than the Leviathan--to an ant or a flea--
    </p>
    <p>
     such portly terms might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent.
    </p>
    <p>
     But when Leviathan is the text, the case is altered.  Fain am I to stagger
    </p>
    <p>
     to this enterprise under the weightiest words of the dictionary.
    </p>
    <p>
     And here be it said, that whenever it has been convenient to consult
    </p>
    <p>
     one in the course of these dissertations, I have invariably used a huge
    </p>
    <p>
     quarto edition of Johnson, expressly purchased for that purpose;
    </p>
    <p>
     because that famous lexicographer's uncommon personal bulk more fitted
    </p>
    <p>
     him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author like me.
    </p>
    <p>
     One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject,
    </p>
    <p>
     though it may seem but an ordinary one.  How, then, with me,
    </p>
    <p>
     writing of this Leviathan?  Unconsciously my chirography
    </p>
    <p>
     expands into placard capitals.  Give me a condor's quill!
    </p>
    <p>
     Give me Vesuvius' crater for an inkstand!  Friends, hold my arms!
    </p>
    <p>
     For in the mere act of penning my thoughts of this Leviathan,
    </p>
    <p>
     they weary me, and make me faint with their outreaching
    </p>
    <p>
     comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the whole circle
    </p>
    <p>
     of the sciences, and all the generations of whales, and men,
    </p>
    <p>
     and mastodons, past, present, and to come, with all the revolving
    </p>
    <p>
     panoramas of empire on earth, and throughout the whole universe,
    </p>
    <p>
     not excluding its suburbs.  Such, and so magnifying, is the
    </p>
    <p>
     virtue of a large and liberal theme!  We expand to its bulk.
    </p>
    <p>
     To produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme.
    </p>
    <p>
     No great and enduring volume can ever be written on the flea,
    </p>
    <p>
     though many there be who have tried it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my
    </p>
    <p>
     credentials as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous
    </p>
    <p>
     time I have been a stone-mason, and also a great digger of ditches,
    </p>
    <p>
     canals and wells, wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Likewise, by way of preliminary, I desire to remind the reader,
    </p>
    <p>
     that while in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils
    </p>
    <p>
     of monsters now almost completely extinct; the subsequent relics
    </p>
    <p>
     discovered in what are called the Tertiary formations seem the connecting,
    </p>
    <p>
     or at any rate intercepted links, between the antichronical creatures,
    </p>
    <p>
     and those whose remote posterity are said to have entered the Ark;
    </p>
    <p>
     all the Fossil Whales hitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary period,
    </p>
    <p>
     which is the last preceding the superficial formations.  And though
    </p>
    <p>
     none of them precisely answer to any known species of the present time,
    </p>
    <p>
     they are yet sufficiently akin to them in general respects, to justify
    </p>
    <p>
     their taking ranks as Cetacean fossils.
    </p>
    <p>
     Detached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their bones
    </p>
    <p>
     and skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals,
    </p>
    <p>
     been found at the base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in France,
    </p>
    <p>
     in England, in Scotland, and in the States of Louisiana, Mississippi,
    </p>
    <p>
     and Alabama.  Among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull,
    </p>
    <p>
     which in the year 1779 was disinterred in the Rue Dauphine in Paris,
    </p>
    <p>
     a short street opening almost directly upon the palace of the Tuileries;
    </p>
    <p>
     and bones disinterred in excavating the great docks of Antwerp,
    </p>
    <p>
     in Napoleon's time.  Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged
    </p>
    <p>
     to some utterly unknown Leviathanic species.
    </p>
    <p>
     But by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost
    </p>
    <p>
     complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the year 1842,
    </p>
    <p>
     on the plantation of Judge Creagh, in Alabama.  The awe-stricken credulous
    </p>
    <p>
     slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen angels.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile, and bestowed upon it
    </p>
    <p>
     the name of Basilosaurus.  But some specimen bones of it being taken
    </p>
    <p>
     across the sea to Owen, the English Anatomist, it turned out that this
    </p>
    <p>
     alleged reptile was a whale, though of a departed species.  A significant
    </p>
    <p>
     illustration of the fact, again and again repeated in this book,
    </p>
    <p>
     that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape
    </p>
    <p>
     of his fully invested body.  So Owen rechristened the monster Zeuglodon;
    </p>
    <p>
     and in his paper read before the London Geological Society, pronounced it,
    </p>
    <p>
     in substance, one of the most extraordinary creatures which the mutations
    </p>
    <p>
     of the globe have blotted out of existence.
    </p>
    <p>
     When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons,
    </p>
    <p>
     skulls, tusks, jaws, ribs, and vertebrae, all characterized
    </p>
    <p>
     by partial resemblances to the existing breeds of sea-monsters;
    </p>
    <p>
     but at the same time bearing on the other hand similar affinities to
    </p>
    <p>
     the annihilated antichronical Leviathans, their incalculable seniors;
    </p>
    <p>
     I am, by a flood, borne back to that wondrous period, ere time
    </p>
    <p>
     itself can be said to have begun; for time began with man.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here Saturn's grey chaos rolls over me, and I obtain dim,
    </p>
    <p>
     shuddering glimpses into those Polar eternities; when wedged
    </p>
    <p>
     bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics;
    </p>
    <p>
     and in all the 25,000 miles of this world's circumference,
    </p>
    <p>
     not an inhabitable hand's breadth of land was visible.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then the whole world was the whale's; and, king of creation,
    </p>
    <p>
     he left his wake along the present lines of the Andes and
    </p>
    <p>
     the Himmalehs.  Who can show a pedigree like Leviathan?  Ahab's harpoon
    </p>
    <p>
     had shed older blood than the Pharaoh's. Methuselah seems a schoolboy.
    </p>
    <p>
     I look round to shake hands with Shem.  I am horror-struck
    </p>
    <p>
     at this antemosaic, unsourced existence of the unspeakable
    </p>
    <p>
     terrors of the whale, which, having been before all time,
    </p>
    <p>
     must needs exist after all humane ages are over.
    </p>
    <p>
     But not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the
    </p>
    <p>
     stereotype plates of nature, and in limestone and marl bequeathed his
    </p>
    <p>
     ancient bust; but upon Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to claim
    </p>
    <p>
     for them an almost fossiliferous character, we find the unmistakable print
    </p>
    <p>
     of his fin.  In an apartment of the great temple of Denderah, some fifty
    </p>
    <p>
     years ago, there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured
    </p>
    <p>
     and painted planisphere, abounding in centaurs, griffins, and dolphins,
    </p>
    <p>
     similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the moderns.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gliding among them, old Leviathan swam as of yore; was there swimming
    </p>
    <p>
     in that planisphere, centuries before Solomon was cradled.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity
    </p>
    <p>
     of the whale, in his own osseous postdiluvian reality, as set down
    </p>
    <p>
     by the venerable John Leo, the old Barbary traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters
    </p>
    <p>
     and Beams of which are made of Whale-Bones; for Whales of a
    </p>
    <p>
     monstrous size are oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Common People imagine, that by a secret Power bestowed by God
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the Temple, no Whale can pass it without immediate death.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the truth of the Matter is, that on either side
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Temple, there are Rocks that shoot two Miles into
    </p>
    <p>
     the Sea, and wound the Whales when they light upon 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
     They keep a Whale's Rib of an incredible length for a Miracle,
    </p>
    <p>
     which lying upon the Ground with its convex part uppermost,
    </p>
    <p>
     makes an Arch, the Head of which cannot be reached
    </p>
    <p>
     by a Man upon a Camel's Back.  This Rib (says John Leo)
    </p>
    <p>
     is said to have layn there a hundred Years before I saw it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their Historians affirm, that a Prophet who prophesy'd of Mahomet,
    </p>
    <p>
     came from this Temple, and some do not stand to assert,
    </p>
    <p>
     that the Prophet Jonas was cast forth by the Whale at the Base
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Temple."
    </p>
    <p>
     In this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you, reader, and if you
    </p>
    <p>
     be a Nantucketer, and a whaleman, you will silently worship there.

     CHAPTER 105
    </head>
    <p>
     Does the Whale's Magnitude Diminish? - Will He Perish?
    </p>
    <p>
     Inasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down
    </p>
    <p>
     upon us from the head-waters of the Eternities, it may be
    </p>
    <p>
     fitly inquired, whether, in the long course of his generations,
    </p>
    <p>
     he has not degenerated from the original bulk of his sires.
    </p>
    <p>
     But upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales
    </p>
    <p>
     of the present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil
    </p>
    <p>
     remains are found in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct
    </p>
    <p>
     geological period prior to man), but of the whales found in
    </p>
    <p>
     that Tertiary system, those belonging to its latter formations
    </p>
    <p>
     exceed in size those of its earlier ones.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest
    </p>
    <p>
     is the Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that
    </p>
    <p>
     was less than seventy feet in length in the skeleton.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whereas, we have already seen, that the tape-measure gives
    </p>
    <p>
     seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     And I have heard, on whalemen's authority, that Sperm Whales have
    </p>
    <p>
     been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture.
    </p>
    <p>
     But may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an
    </p>
    <p>
     advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods;
    </p>
    <p>
     may it not be, that since Adam's time they have degenerated?
    </p>
    <p>
     Assuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts
    </p>
    <p>
     of such gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally.
    </p>
    <p>
     For Pliny tells us of Whales that embraced acres of living bulk,
    </p>
    <p>
     and Aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in length--
    </p>
    <p>
     Rope Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales!  And even in the days
    </p>
    <p>
     of Banks and Solander, Cooke's naturalists, we find a Danish member
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales
    </p>
    <p>
     (reydan-siskur, or Wrinkled Bellies) at one hundred and twenty yards;
    </p>
    <p>
     that is, three hundred and sixty feet.  And Lacepede,
    </p>
    <p>
     the French naturalist, in his elaborate history of whales,
    </p>
    <p>
     in the very beginning of his work (page 3), sets down the Right Whale
    </p>
    <p>
     at one hundred metres, three hundred and twenty-eight feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     And this work was published so late as A.D. 1825.
    </p>
    <p>
     But will any whaleman believe these stories?  No. The whale
    </p>
    <p>
     of to-day is as big as his ancestors in Pliny's time.
    </p>
    <p>
     And if ever I go where Pliny is, I, a whaleman (more than he was),
    </p>
    <p>
     will make bold to tell him so.  Because I cannot understand
    </p>
    <p>
     how it is, that while the Egyptian mummies that were buried
    </p>
    <p>
     thousands of years before even Pliny was born, do not measure
    </p>
    <p>
     so much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks;
    </p>
    <p>
     and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest
    </p>
    <p>
     Egyptian and Nineveh tablets, by the relative proportions in
    </p>
    <p>
     which they are drawn, just as plainly prove that the high-bred,
    </p>
    <p>
     stall-fed, prize cattle of Smithfield, not only equal,
    </p>
    <p>
     but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of Pharaoh's fat kine;
    </p>
    <p>
     in the face of all this, I will not admit that of all animals
    </p>
    <p>
     the whale alone should have degenerated.
    </p>
    <p>
     But still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more
    </p>
    <p>
     recondite Nantucketers.  Whether owing to the almost omniscient
    </p>
    <p>
     look-outs at the mast-heads of the whaleships, now penetrating
    </p>
    <p>
     even through Behring's straits, and into the remotest secret drawers
    </p>
    <p>
     and lockers of the world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted
    </p>
    <p>
     along all continental coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan
    </p>
    <p>
     can long endure so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc;
    </p>
    <p>
     whether he must not at last be exterminated from the waters,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the last whale, like the last man, smoke his last pipe,
    </p>
    <p>
     and then himself evaporate in the final puff.
    </p>
    <p>
     Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo,
    </p>
    <p>
     which, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands the prairies
    </p>
    <p>
     of Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron manes and scowled with
    </p>
    <p>
     their thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous river-capitals,
    </p>
    <p>
     where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch;
    </p>
    <p>
     in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished,
    </p>
    <p>
     to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction.
    </p>
    <p>
     But you must look at this matter in every light.  Though so short
    </p>
    <p>
     a period ago--not a good lifetime--the census of the buffalo in Illinois
    </p>
    <p>
     exceeded the census of men now in London, and though at the present
    </p>
    <p>
     day not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region;
    </p>
    <p>
     and though the cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear
    </p>
    <p>
     of man; yet the far different nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily
    </p>
    <p>
     forbids so inglorious an end to the Leviathan.  Forty men in one
    </p>
    <p>
     ship hunting the Sperm Whales for forty-eight months think they
    </p>
    <p>
     have done extremely well, and thank God, if at last they carry home
    </p>
    <p>
     the oil of forty fish.  Whereas, in the days of the old Canadian
    </p>
    <p>
     and Indian hunters and trappers of the West, when the far west
    </p>
    <p>
     (in whose sunset suns still rise) was a wilderness and a virgin,
    </p>
    <p>
     the same number of moccasined men, for the same number of months,
    </p>
    <p>
     mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships, would have slain
    </p>
    <p>
     not forty, but forty thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that,
    </p>
    <p>
     if need were, could be statistically stated.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favor
    </p>
    <p>
     of the gradual extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example,
    </p>
    <p>
     that in former years (the latter part of the last century, say)
    </p>
    <p>
     these Leviathans, in small pods, were encountered much
    </p>
    <p>
     oftener than at present, and, in consequence, the voyages
    </p>
    <p>
     were not so prolonged, and were also much more remunerative.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those whales, influenced by
    </p>
    <p>
     some views to safety, now swim the seas in immense caravans,
    </p>
    <p>
     so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries, yokes,
    </p>
    <p>
     and pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into
    </p>
    <p>
     vast but widely separated, unfrequent armies.  That is all.
    </p>
    <p>
     And equally fallacious seems the conceit, that because the so-called
    </p>
    <p>
     whale-bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years
    </p>
    <p>
     abounding with them, hence that species also is declining.
    </p>
    <p>
     For they are only being driven from promontory to cape; and if
    </p>
    <p>
     one coast is no longer enlivened with their jets, then, be sure,
    </p>
    <p>
     some other and remoter strand has been very recently startled
    </p>
    <p>
     by the unfamiliar spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Furthermore:  concerning these last mentioned Leviathans,
    </p>
    <p>
     they have two firm fortresses, which, in all human probability,
    </p>
    <p>
     will for ever remain impregnable.  And as upon the invasion of
    </p>
    <p>
     their valleys, the frosty Swiss have retreated to their mountains;
    </p>
    <p>
     so, hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas,
    </p>
    <p>
     the whale-bone whales can at last resort to their Polar citadels,
    </p>
    <p>
     and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls there,
    </p>
    <p>
     come up among icy fields and floes! and in a charmed circle
    </p>
    <p>
     of everlasting December, bid defiance to all pursuit from man.
    </p>
    <p>
     But as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned
    </p>
    <p>
     for one cachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have
    </p>
    <p>
     concluded that this positive havoc has already very seriously
    </p>
    <p>
     diminished their battalions.  But though for some time past
    </p>
    <p>
     a number of these whales, not less than 13,000, have been
    </p>
    <p>
     annually slain on the nor'west coast by the Americans alone;
    </p>
    <p>
     yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance
    </p>
    <p>
     of little or no account as an opposing argument in this matter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness
    </p>
    <p>
     of the more enormous creatures of the globe, yet what shall we
    </p>
    <p>
     say to Harto, the historian of Goa, when he tells us that at one
    </p>
    <p>
     hunting the King of Siam took 4,000 elephants; that in those regions
    </p>
    <p>
     elephants are numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes.
    </p>
    <p>
     And there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephants,
    </p>
    <p>
     which have now been hunted for thousands of years, by Semiramis,
    </p>
    <p>
     by Porus, by Hannibal, and by all the successive monarchs of the East--
    </p>
    <p>
     if they still survive there in great numbers, much more may
    </p>
    <p>
     the great whale outlast all hunting, since he has a pasture
    </p>
    <p>
     to expatiate in, which is precisely twice as large as all Asia,
    </p>
    <p>
     both Americas, Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the Isles
    </p>
    <p>
     of the sea combined.
    </p>
    <p>
     Moreover:  we are to consider, that from the presumed great longevity
    </p>
    <p>
     of whales, their probably attaining the age of a century and more,
    </p>
    <p>
     therefore at any one period of time, several distinct adult
    </p>
    <p>
     generations must be contemporary.  And what this is, we may soon
    </p>
    <p>
     gain some idea of, by imagining all the grave-yards, cemeteries,
    </p>
    <p>
     and family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all
    </p>
    <p>
     the men, women, and children who were alive seventy-five years ago;
    </p>
    <p>
     and adding this countless host to the present human population
    </p>
    <p>
     of the globe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal
    </p>
    <p>
     in his species, however perishable in his individuality.
    </p>
    <p>
     He swam the seas before the continents broke water; he once
    </p>
    <p>
     swam over the site of the Tuileries, and Windsor Castle,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the Kremlin.  In Noah's flood he despised Noah's Ark;
    </p>
    <p>
     and if ever the world is to be again flooded, like the Netherlands,
    </p>
    <p>
     to kill off its rats, then the eternal whale will still survive,
    </p>
    <p>
     and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood,
    </p>
    <p>
     spout his frothed defiance to the skies.

    <p>
     Ahab's Leg
    </p>
    <p>
     The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted
    </p>
    <p>
     the Samuel Enderby of London, had not been unattended with some small
    </p>
    <p>
     violence to his own person.  He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart
    </p>
    <p>
     of his boat that his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock.
    </p>
    <p>
     And when after gaining his own deck, and his own pivot-hole there,
    </p>
    <p>
     he so vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman
    </p>
    <p>
     (it was, as ever, something about his not steering inflexibly enough);
    </p>
    <p>
     then, the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist
    </p>
    <p>
     and wrench, that though it still remained entire, and to all
    </p>
    <p>
     appearances lusty, yet Ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy.
    </p>
    <p>
     And, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all
    </p>
    <p>
     his pervading, mad recklessness, Ahab, did at times give careful
    </p>
    <p>
     heed to the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood.
    </p>
    <p>
     For it had not been very long prior to the Pequod's sailing
    </p>
    <p>
     from Nantucket, that he had been found one night lying prone upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the ground, and insensible; by some unknown, and seemingly inexplicable,
    </p>
    <p>
     unimaginable casualty, his ivory limb having been so violently displaced,
    </p>
    <p>
     that it had stake-wise smitten, and all but pierced his groin;
    </p>
    <p>
     nor was it without extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound
    </p>
    <p>
     was entirely cured.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind,
    </p>
    <p>
     that all the anguish of that then present suffering was but the
    </p>
    <p>
     direct issue of a former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see,
    </p>
    <p>
     that as the most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates
    </p>
    <p>
     his kind as inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove;
    </p>
    <p>
     so, equally with every felicity, all miserable events do naturally
    </p>
    <p>
     beget their like.  Yea, more than equally, thought Ahab;
    </p>
    <p>
     since both the ancestry and posterity of Grief go further than
    </p>
    <p>
     the ancestry and posterity of Joy.  For, not to hint of this:
    </p>
    <p>
     that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings, that while
    </p>
    <p>
     some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them
    </p>
    <p>
     for the other world, but, on the contrary, shall be followed by
    </p>
    <p>
     the joy-childlessness of all hell's despair; whereas, some guilty
    </p>
    <p>
     mortal miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves
    </p>
    <p>
     an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave;
    </p>
    <p>
     not at all to hint of this, there still seems an inequality
    </p>
    <p>
     in the deeper analysis of the thing.  For, thought Ahab,
    </p>
    <p>
     while even the highest earthly felicities ever have a certain
    </p>
    <p>
     unsignifying pettiness lurking in them, but, at bottom, all heartwoes,
    </p>
    <p>
     a mystic significance, and, in some men, an archangelic grandeur;
    </p>
    <p>
     so do their diligent tracings-out not belie the obvious deduction.
    </p>
    <p>
     To trail the genealogies of these high mortal miseries,
    </p>
    <p>
     carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the gods;
    </p>
    <p>
     so that, in the face of all the glad, hay-making suns,
    </p>
    <p>
     and softcymballing, round harvest-moons, we must needs give
    </p>
    <p>
     in to this:  that the gods themselves are not for ever glad.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ineffaceable, sad birth-mark in the brow of man, is but
    </p>
    <p>
     the stamp of sorrow in the signers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps
    </p>
    <p>
     might more properly, in set way, have been disclosed before.
    </p>
    <p>
     With many other particulars concerning Ahab, always had it remained
    </p>
    <p>
     a mystery to some, why it was, that for a certain period, both before
    </p>
    <p>
     and after the sailing of the Pequod, he had hidden himself away
    </p>
    <p>
     with such Grand-Lama-like exclusiveness; and, for that one interval,
    </p>
    <p>
     sought speechless refuge, as it were, among the marble senate
    </p>
    <p>
     of the dead.  Captain Peleg's bruited reason for this thing appeared
    </p>
    <p>
     by no means adequate; though, indeed, as touching all Ahab's
    </p>
    <p>
     deeper part, every revelation partook more of significant darkness
    </p>
    <p>
     than of explanatory light.  But, in the end, it all came out;
    </p>
    <p>
     this one matter did, at least.  That direful mishap was at the bottom
    </p>
    <p>
     of his temporary recluseness.  And not only this, but to that
    </p>
    <p>
     ever-contracting, dropping circle ashore, who for any reason,
    </p>
    <p>
     possessed the privilege of a less banned approach to him;
    </p>
    <p>
     to that timid circle the above hinted casualty--remaining, as it did,
    </p>
    <p>
     moodily unaccounted for by Ahab--invested itself with terrors,
    </p>
    <p>
     not entirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails.
    </p>
    <p>
     So that, through their zeal for him, they had all conspired, so far
    </p>
    <p>
     as in them lay, to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others;
    </p>
    <p>
     and hence it was, that not till a considerable interval had elapsed,
    </p>
    <p>
     did it transpire upon the Pequod's decks.
    </p>
    <p>
     But be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod
    </p>
    <p>
     in the air, or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire,
    </p>
    <p>
     have to do or not with earthly Ahab, yet, in this present
    </p>
    <p>
     matter of his leg, he took plain practical procedures;--
    </p>
    <p>
     he called the carpenter.
    </p>
    <p>
     And when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him without
    </p>
    <p>
     delay set about making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him
    </p>
    <p>
     supplied with all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale)
    </p>
    <p>
     which had thus far been accumulated on the voyage, in order that a careful
    </p>
    <p>
     selection of the stoutest, clearest-grained stuff might be secured.
    </p>
    <p>
     This done, the carpenter received orders to have the leg
    </p>
    <p>
     completed that night; and to provide all the fittings for it,
    </p>
    <p>
     independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use.
    </p>
    <p>
     Moreover, the ship's forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its
    </p>
    <p>
     temporary idleness in the hold; and, to accelerate the affair,
    </p>
    <p>
     the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forging
    </p>
    <p>
     of whatever iron contrivances might be needed.

     CHAPTER 107

    <p>
     The Carpenter
    </p>
    <p>
     Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take
    </p>
    <p>
     high abstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a woe.  But from the same point, take mankind in mass,
    </p>
    <p>
     and for the most part, they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates,
    </p>
    <p>
     both contemporary and hereditary.  But most humble though he was,
    </p>
    <p>
     and far from furnishing an example of the high, humane abstraction;
    </p>
    <p>
     the Pequod's carpenter was no duplicate; hence, he now comes
    </p>
    <p>
     in person on this stage.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging
    </p>
    <p>
     to whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-hand, practical extent,
    </p>
    <p>
     alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own;
    </p>
    <p>
     the carpenter's pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk
    </p>
    <p>
     of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do
    </p>
    <p>
     with wood as an auxiliary material.  But, besides the application
    </p>
    <p>
     to him of the generic remark above, this carpenter of the Pequod
    </p>
    <p>
     was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical
    </p>
    <p>
     emergencies continually recurring in a large ship, upon a three
    </p>
    <p>
     or four years' voyage, in uncivilized and far-distant seas.
    </p>
    <p>
     For not to speak of his readiness in ordinary duties:--
    </p>
    <p>
     repairing stove boats, sprung spars, reforming the shape of
    </p>
    <p>
     clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull's eyes in the deck, or new
    </p>
    <p>
     tree-nails in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters
    </p>
    <p>
     more directly pertaining to his special business; he was moreover
    </p>
    <p>
     unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes,
    </p>
    <p>
     both useful and capricious.
    </p>
    <p>
     The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold,
    </p>
    <p>
     was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with
    </p>
    <p>
     several vices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood.
    </p>
    <p>
     At all times except when whales were alongside, this bench was securely
    </p>
    <p>
     lashed athwartships against the rear of the Try-works.
    </p>
    <p>
     A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole:
    </p>
    <p>
     the carpenter claps it into one of his ever ready vices,
    </p>
    <p>
     and straightway files it smaller.  A lost landbird of strange
    </p>
    <p>
     plumage strays on board, and is made a captive:  out of clean shaved
    </p>
    <p>
     rods of right-whale bone, and cross-beams of sperm whale ivory,
    </p>
    <p>
     the carpenter makes a pagoda-looking cage for it.  An oarsman
    </p>
    <p>
     sprains his wrist:  the carpenter concocts a soothing lotion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon the blade
    </p>
    <p>
     of his every oar; screwing each oar in his big vice of wood,
    </p>
    <p>
     the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation.
    </p>
    <p>
     A sailor takes a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings:
    </p>
    <p>
     the carpenter drills his ears.  Another has the toothache:
    </p>
    <p>
     the carpenter out pincers, and clapping one hand upon his bench
    </p>
    <p>
     bids him be seated there; but the poor fellow unmanageably winces
    </p>
    <p>
     under the unconcluded operation; whirling round the handle of his
    </p>
    <p>
     wooden vice, the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that,
    </p>
    <p>
     if he would have him draw the tooth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent
    </p>
    <p>
     and without respect in all.  Teeth he accounted bits of ivory;
    </p>
    <p>
     heads he deemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held
    </p>
    <p>
     for capstans.  But while now upon so wide a field thus variously
    </p>
    <p>
     accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him, too;
    </p>
    <p>
     all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
     But not precisely so.  For nothing was this man more remarkable,
    </p>
    <p>
     than for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were; impersonal, I say;
    </p>
    <p>
     for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things,
    </p>
    <p>
     that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole
    </p>
    <p>
     visible world; which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes,
    </p>
    <p>
     still eternally holds its peace, and ignores you, though you dig
    </p>
    <p>
     foundations for cathedrals.  Yet was this half-horrible stolidity
    </p>
    <p>
     in him, involving, too, as it appeared, an all-ramifying heartlessness;--
    </p>
    <p>
     yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an old, crutch-like, antediluvian,
    </p>
    <p>
     wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now and then with a certain
    </p>
    <p>
     grizzled wittiness; such as might have served to pass the time
    </p>
    <p>
     during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of Noah's ark.
    </p>
    <p>
     Was it that this old carpenter had been a life-long wanderer,
    </p>
    <p>
     whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had gathered no moss;
    </p>
    <p>
     but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings
    </p>
    <p>
     might have originally pertained to him?  He was a stript abstract;
    </p>
    <p>
     an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born babe;
    </p>
    <p>
     living without premeditated reference to this world or the next.
    </p>
    <p>
     You might almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved
    </p>
    <p>
     a sort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did not seem
    </p>
    <p>
     to work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had been
    </p>
    <p>
     tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or uneven;
    </p>
    <p>
     but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal process.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one,
    </p>
    <p>
     must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful,
    </p>
    <p>
     multum in parvo, Sheffield contrivances, assuming the exterior--
    </p>
    <p>
     though a little swelled--of a common pocket knife; but containing,
    </p>
    <p>
     not only blades of various sizes, but also screw-drivers,
    </p>
    <p>
     cork-screws, tweezers, awls, pens, rulers, nail-filers, countersinkers.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, if his superiors wanted to use the carpenter for a screw-driver,
    </p>
    <p>
     all they had to do was to open that part of him, and the screw was fast:
    </p>
    <p>
     or if for tweezers, take him up by the legs, and there they were.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter,
    </p>
    <p>
     was, after all, no mere machine of an automaton.  If he did not
    </p>
    <p>
     have a common soul in him, he had a subtle something that somehow
    </p>
    <p>
     anomalously did its duty.  What that was, whether essence of quicksilver,
    </p>
    <p>
     or a few drops of hartshorn, there is no telling.  But there it was;
    </p>
    <p>
     and there it had abided for now some sixty years or more.
    </p>
    <p>
     And this it was, this same unaccountable, cunning life-principle in him;
    </p>
    <p>
     this it was, that kept him a great part of the time soliloquizing;
    </p>
    <p>
     but only like an unreasoning wheel, which also hummingly soliloquizes;
    </p>
    <p>
     or rather, his body was a sentry-box and this soliloquizer on guard there,
    </p>
    <p>
     and talking all the time to keep himself awake.

     Ahab and the Carpenter

     The Deck - First Night Watch
    </p>
    <p>
     (Carpenter standing before his vice-bench, and by the light
    </p>
    <p>
     of two lanterns busily filing the ivory joist for the leg,
    </p>
    <p>
     which joist is firmly fixed in the vice.  Slabs of ivory,
    </p>
    <p>
     leather straps, pads, screws, and various tools of all sorts lying
    </p>
    <p>
     about the bench.  Forward, the red flame of the forge is seen,
    </p>
    <p>
     where the blacksmith is at work.)
    </p>
    <p>
     Drat the file, and drat the bone!  That is hard which should be soft,
    </p>
    <p>
     and that is soft which should be hard.  So we go, who file old jaws
    </p>
    <p>
     and shin bones.  Let's try another.  Aye, now, this works better
    </p>
    <p>
     (sneezes). Halloa, this bone dust is (sneezes)--why it's
    </p>
    <p>
     (sneezes)--yes it's (sneezes)--bless my soul, it won't let me speak!
    </p>
    <p>
     This is what an old fellow gets now for working in dead lumber.
    </p>
    <p>
     Saw a live tree, and you don't get this dust; amputate a live bone,
    </p>
    <p>
     and you don't get it (sneezes). Come, come, you old Smut, there,
    </p>
    <p>
     bear a hand, and let's have that ferrule and buckle-screw; I'll be ready
    </p>
    <p>
     for them presently.  Lucky now (sneezes) there's no knee-joint to make;
    </p>
    <p>
     that might puzzle a little; but a mere shin-bone--why it's easy
    </p>
    <p>
     as making hop-poles; only I should like to put a good finish on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Time, time; if I but only had the time, I could turn him out as
    </p>
    <p>
     neat a leg now as ever (sneezes) scraped to a lady in a parlor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those buckskin legs and calves of legs I've seen in shop windows
    </p>
    <p>
     wouldn't compare at all.  They soak water, they do; and of course
    </p>
    <p>
     get rheumatic, and have to be doctored (sneezes) with washes and lotions,
    </p>
    <p>
     just like live legs.  There; before I saw it off, now, I must call
    </p>
    <p>
     his old Mogulship, and see whether the length will be all right;
    </p>
    <p>
     too short, if anything, I guess.  Ha! that's the heel; we are in luck;
    </p>
    <p>
     here he comes, or it's somebody else, that's certain.  AHAB (advancing)
    </p>
    <p>
     (During the ensuing scene, the carpenter continues sneezing at times).
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, manmaker!
    </p>
    <p>
     Just in time, sir.  If the captain pleases, I will now mark the length.
    </p>
    <p>
     Let me measure, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
     Measured for a leg! good.  Well, it's not the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
     About it!  There; keep thy finger on it.  This is a cogent
    </p>
    <p>
     vice thou hast here, carpenter; let me feel its grip once.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, so; it does pinch some.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, sir, it will break bones--beware, beware!
    </p>
    <p>
     No fear; I like a good grip; I like to feel something in this
    </p>
    <p>
     slippery world that can hold, man.  What's Prometheus about there?--
    </p>
    <p>
     the blacksmith, I mean--what's he about?
    </p>
    <p>
     He must be forging the buckle-screw, sir, now.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right.  It's a partnership; he supplies the muscle part.
    </p>
    <p>
     He makes a fierce red flame there!
    </p>
    <p>
     Aye, sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work.
    </p>
    <p>
     Um-m. So he must.  I do deem it now a most meaning thing,
    </p>
    <p>
     that that old Greek, Prometheus, who made men, they say, should have
    </p>
    <p>
     been a blacksmith, and animated them with fire; for what's made
    </p>
    <p>
     in fire must properly belong to fire; and so hell's probable.
    </p>
    <p>
     How the soot flies!  This must be the remainder the Greek made
    </p>
    <p>
     the Africans of.  Carpenter, when he's through with that buckle,
    </p>
    <p>
     tell him to forge a pair of steel shoulder-blades; there's a pedlar
    </p>
    <p>
     aboard with a crushing pack.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sir?
    </p>
    <p>
     Hold; while Prometheus is about it, I'll order a complete man
    </p>
    <p>
     after a desirable pattern.  Imprimis, fifty feet high in his socks;
    </p>
    <p>
     then, chest modelled after the Thames Tunnel then, legs with roots
    </p>
    <p>
     to 'em, to stay in one place; then, arms three feet through the wrist;
    </p>
    <p>
     no heart at all, brass forehead, and about a quarter of an acre
    </p>
    <p>
     of fine brains; and let me see--shall I order eyes to see outwards?
    </p>
    <p>
     No, but put a sky-light on top of his head to illuminate inwards.
    </p>
    <p>
     There, take the order, and away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, what's he speaking about, and who's he speaking to,
    </p>
    <p>
     I should like to know?  Shall I keep standing here? (aside.)
    </p>
    <p>
     'Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome; here's one.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, no, no; I must have a lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ho, ho!  That's it, hey?  Here are two, sir; one will serve my turn.
    </p>
    <p>
     What art thou thrusting that thief-catcher into my face for, man?
    </p>
    <p>
     Thrusted light is worse than presented pistols.
    </p>
    <p>
     I thought, sir, that you spoke to carpenter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Carpenter? why that's--but no;--a very tidy, and, I may say, an extremely
    </p>
    <p>
     gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here, carpenter;--or would'st
    </p>
    <p>
     thou rather work in clay?
    </p>
    <p>
     Sir?--Clay? clay, sir?  That's mud; we leave clay to ditchers, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fellow's impious!  What art thou sneezing about?
    </p>
    <p>
     Bone is rather dusty, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
     Take the hint, then; and when thou art dead, never bury thyself
    </p>
    <p>
     under living people's noses.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sir?--oh! ah!--I guess so; so;--yes, yes--oh dear!
    </p>
    <p>
     Look ye, carpenter, I dare say thou callest thyself a right good
    </p>
    <p>
     workmanlike workman, eh?  Well, then, will it speak thoroughly well
    </p>
    <p>
     for thy work, if, when I come to mount this leg thou makest, I shall
    </p>
    <p>
     nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it;
    </p>
    <p>
     that is, carpenter, my old lost leg; the flesh and blood one, I mean.
    </p>
    <p>
     Canst thou not drive that old Adam away?
    </p>
    <p>
     Truly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, I have heard something curious on that score, sir;
    </p>
    <p>
     how that a dismasted man never entirely loses the feeling
    </p>
    <p>
     of his old spar, but it will be still pricking him at times.
    </p>
    <p>
     May I humbly ask if it be really so, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
     It is, man.  Look, put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was;
    </p>
    <p>
     so, now, here is only one distinct leg to the eye, yet two to the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
     Where thou feelest tingling life; there, exactly there, there to a hair,
    </p>
    <p>
     do I. Is't a riddle?
    </p>
    <p>
     I should humbly call it a poser, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hist, then.  How dost thou know that some entire, living, thinking thing
    </p>
    <p>
     may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely
    </p>
    <p>
     where thou now standest; aye, and standing there in thy spite?
    </p>
    <p>
     In thy most solitary hours, then, dost thou not fear eavesdroppers?
    </p>
    <p>
     Hold, don't speak!  And if I still feel the smart of my crushed leg,
    </p>
    <p>
     though it be now so long dissolved; then, why mayest not thou, carpenter,
    </p>
    <p>
     feel the fiery pains of hell for ever, and without a body?  Hah!
    </p>
    <p>
     Good Lord!  Truly, sir, if it comes to that, I must calculate over again;
    </p>
    <p>
     I think I didn't carry a small figure, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
     Look ye, pudding-heads should never grant premises.--How long
    </p>
    <p>
     before this leg is done?
    </p>
    <p>
     Perhaps an hour, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bungle away at it then, and bring it to me (turns to go).
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, Life.  Here I am, proud as Greek god, and yet standing debtor
    </p>
    <p>
     to this blockhead for a bone to stand on!  Cursed be that mortal
    </p>
    <p>
     inter-indebtedness which will not do away with ledgers.
    </p>
    <p>
     I would be free as air; and I'm down in the whole world's books.
    </p>
    <p>
     I am so rich, I could have given bid for bid with the wealthiest
    </p>
    <p>
     Praetorians at the auction of the Roman empire (which was the world's);
    </p>
    <p>
     and yet I owe for the flesh in the tongue I brag with.  By heavens!
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll get a crucible, and into it, and dissolve myself down to one small,
    </p>
    <p>
     compendious vertebra.  So.
    </p>
    <p>
     Carpenter ( resuming his work).
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, well, well!  Stubb knows him best of all, and Stubb always says
    </p>
    <p>
     he's queer; says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer;
    </p>
    <p>
     he's queer, says Stubb; he's queer--queer, queer; and keeps dinning it
    </p>
    <p>
     into Mr. Starbuck all the time--queer--sir--queer, queer, very queer.
    </p>
    <p>
     And here's his leg.  Yes, now that I think of it, here's his bed-fellow!
    </p>
    <p>
     has a stick of whale's jaw-bone for a wife!  And this is his leg;
    </p>
    <p>
     he'll stand on this.  What was that now about one leg standing
    </p>
    <p>
     in three places, and all three places standing in one hell--
    </p>
    <p>
     how was that?  Oh!  I don't wonder he looked so scornful at me!
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm a sort of strange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that's
    </p>
    <p>
     only haphazard-like. Then, a short, little old body like me,
    </p>
    <p>
     should never undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall,
    </p>
    <p>
     heron-built captains; the water chucks you under the chin pretty quick,
    </p>
    <p>
     and there's a great cry for life-boats. And here's the heron's leg!
    </p>
    <p>
     long and slim, sure enough!  Now, for most folks one pair of legs
    </p>
    <p>
     lasts a lifetime, and that must be because they use them mercifully,
    </p>
    <p>
     as a tender-hearted old lady uses her roly-poly old coach-horses.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Ahab; oh he's a hard driver.  Look, driven one leg to death,
    </p>
    <p>
     and spavined the other for life, and now wears out bone legs by the cord.
    </p>
    <p>
     Halloa, there, you Smut! bear a hand there with those screws,
    </p>
    <p>
     and let's finish it before the resurrection fellow comes
    </p>
    <p>
     a-calling with his horn for all legs, true or false, as brewery
    </p>
    <p>
     men go round collecting old beer barrels, to fill 'em up again.
    </p>
    <p>
     What a leg this is!  It looks like a real live leg, filed down
    </p>
    <p>
     to nothing but the core; he'll be standing on this to-morrow;
    </p>
    <p>
     he'll be taking altitudes on it.  Halloa!  I almost forgot the little
    </p>
    <p>
     oval slate, smoothed ivory, where he figures up the latitude.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, so; chisel, file, and sand-paper, now!

     CHAPTER 109
    </head>
    <p>
     Ahab and Starbuck in the Cabin
    </p>
    <p>
     According to usage they were pumping the ship next morning;
    </p>
    <p>
     and lo! no inconsiderable oil came up with the water;
    </p>
    <p>
     the casks below must have sprung a bad leak.  Much concern
    </p>
    <p>
     was shown; and Starbuck went down into the cabin to report
    </p>
    <p>
     this unfavorable affair.*
    </p>
    <p>
     *In Sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board,
    </p>
    <p>
     it is a regular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold,
    </p>
    <p>
     and drench the casks with sea-water; which afterwards,
    </p>
    <p>
     at varying intervals, is removed by the ship's pumps.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hereby the casks are sought to be kept damply tight; while by
    </p>
    <p>
     the changed character of the withdrawn water, the mariners
    </p>
    <p>
     readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa
    </p>
    <p>
     and the Bashee Isles, between which lies one of the tropical outlets
    </p>
    <p>
     from the China waters into the Pacific.  And so Starbuck found Ahab
    </p>
    <p>
     with a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him;
    </p>
    <p>
     and another separate one representing the long eastern coasts
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Japanese islands--Niphon, Matsmai, and Sikoke.  With his
    </p>
    <p>
     snow-white new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table,
    </p>
    <p>
     and with a long pruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand, the wondrous
    </p>
    <p>
     old man, with his back to the gangway door, was wrinkling his brow,
    </p>
    <p>
     and tracing his old courses again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Who's there?" hearing the footstep at the door, but not turning
    </p>
    <p>
     round to it.  "On deck!  Begone!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Captain Ahab mistakes; it is I. The oil in the hold is leaking, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
     We must up Burtons and break out."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Up Burtons and break out?  Now that we are nearing Japan;
    </p>
    <p>
     heave-to here for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Either do that, sir, or waste in one day more oil than we
    </p>
    <p>
     may make good in a year.  What we come twenty thousand miles
    </p>
    <p>
     to get is worth saving, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
     "So it is, so it is; if we get it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I was speaking of the oil in the hold, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Begone!  Let it leak!  I'm all aleak myself.  Aye! leaks in leaks!
    </p>
    <p>
     not only full of leaky casks, but those leaky casks are in a
    </p>
    <p>
     leaky ship; and that's a far worse plight than the Pequod's, man.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet I don't stop to plug my leak; for who can find it in
    </p>
    <p>
     the deep-loaded hull; or how hope to plug it, even if found,
    </p>
    <p>
     in this life's howling gale?  Starbuck!  I'll not have
    </p>
    <p>
     the Burtons hoisted."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What will the owners say, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell
    </p>
    <p>
     the Typhoons.  What cares Ahab?  Owners, owners?  Thou art
    </p>
    <p>
     always prating to me, Starbuck, about those miserly owners,
    </p>
    <p>
     as if the owners were my conscience.  But look ye, the only real
    </p>
    <p>
     owner of anything is its commander; and hark ye, my conscience
    </p>
    <p>
     is in this ship's keel.--On deck!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Captain Ahab," said the reddening mate, moving further into the cabin,
    </p>
    <p>
     with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation
    </p>
    <p>
     of itself, but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself;
    </p>
    <p>
     "A better man than I might well pass over in thee what he would quickly
    </p>
    <p>
     enough resent in a younger man; aye, and in a happier, Captain Ahab."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Devils!  Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think
    </p>
    <p>
     of me?--On deck!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nay, sir, not yet; I do entreat.  And I do dare, sir--to be forbearing!
    </p>
    <p>
     Shall we not understand each other better than hitherto, Captain Ahab?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack (forming part of most
    </p>
    <p>
     South-Sea-men's cabin furniture), and pointing it towards
    </p>
    <p>
     Starbuck, exclaimed:  "There is one God that is Lord over the earth,
    </p>
    <p>
     and one Captain that is lord over the Pequod.--On deck!"
    </p>
    <p>
     For an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery cheeks,
    </p>
    <p>
     you would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze
    </p>
    <p>
     of the levelled tube.  But, mastering his emotion, he half calmly rose,
    </p>
    <p>
     and as he quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thou hast outraged, not insulted me, Sir; but for that I ask thee not to
    </p>
    <p>
     beware of Starbuck; thou wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab beware of Ahab;
    </p>
    <p>
     beware of thyself, old man."
    </p>
    <p>
     "He waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful
    </p>
    <p>
     bravery that!" murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What's that he said--Ahab beware of Ahab--there's something there!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Then unconsciously using the musket for a staff, with an iron
    </p>
    <p>
     brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin; but presently
    </p>
    <p>
     the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed, and returning the gun
    </p>
    <p>
     to the rack, he went to the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thou art but too good a fellow, Starbuck," he said lowly to the mate;
    </p>
    <p>
     then raising his voice to the crew:  "Furl the t'gallant-sails,
    </p>
    <p>
     and close-reef the top-sails, fore and aft; back the main-yard;
    </p>
    <p>
     up Burtons, and break out in the main-hold."
    </p>
    <p>
     It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as respecting
    </p>
    <p>
     Starbuck, Ahab thus acted.  It may have been a flash of honesty
    </p>
    <p>
     in him; or mere prudential policy which, under the circumstance,
    </p>
    <p>
     imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection,
    </p>
    <p>
     however transient, in the important chief officer of his ship.
    </p>
    <p>
     However it was, his orders were executed; and the Burtons were hoisted.

    <p>
     Queequeg in His Coffin
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold
    </p>
    <p>
     were perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further off.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, it being calm weather, they broke out deeper and deeper,
    </p>
    <p>
     disturbing the slumbers of the huge ground-tier butts;
    </p>
    <p>
     and from that black midnight sending those gigantic moles
    </p>
    <p>
     into the daylight above.  So deep did they go; and so ancient,
    </p>
    <p>
     and corroded, and weedy the aspect of the lowermost puncheons,
    </p>
    <p>
     that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner-stone cask
    </p>
    <p>
     containing coins of Captain Noah, with copies of the posted placards,
    </p>
    <p>
     vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tierce after tierce, too, of water, and bread, and beef,
    </p>
    <p>
     and shooks of staves, and iron bundles of hoops, were hoisted out,
    </p>
    <p>
     till at last the piled decks were hard to get about; and the hollow
    </p>
    <p>
     hull echoed under foot, as if you were treading over empty catacombs,
    </p>
    <p>
     and reeled and rolled in the sea like an air-freighted demijohn.
    </p>
    <p>
     Top-heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all Aristotle
    </p>
    <p>
     in his head.  Well was it that the Typhoons did not visit them then.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion,
    </p>
    <p>
     and fast bosom-friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever,
    </p>
    <p>
     which brought him nigh to his endless end.
    </p>
    <p>
     Be it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown;
    </p>
    <p>
     dignity and danger go hand in hand; till you get to be Captain,
    </p>
    <p>
     the higher you rise the harder you toil.  So with poor Queequeg,
    </p>
    <p>
     who, as harpooneer, must not only face all the rage of the
    </p>
    <p>
     living whale, but--as we have elsewhere seen--mount his dead back
    </p>
    <p>
     in a rolling sea; and finally descend into the gloom of the hold,
    </p>
    <p>
     and bitterly sweating all day in that subterraneous confinement,
    </p>
    <p>
     resolutely manhandle the clumsiest casks and see to their stowage.
    </p>
    <p>
     To be short, among whalemen, the harpooneers are the holders, so called.
    </p>
    <p>
     Poor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled,
    </p>
    <p>
     you should have stooped over the hatchway, and peered down
    </p>
    <p>
     upon him there; where, stripped to his woollen drawers,
    </p>
    <p>
     the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that dampness
    </p>
    <p>
     and slime, like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well.
    </p>
    <p>
     And a well, or an ice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor pagan;
    </p>
    <p>
     where, strange to say, for all the heat of his sweatings,
    </p>
    <p>
     he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever;
    </p>
    <p>
     and at last, after some days' suffering, laid him in his hammock,
    </p>
    <p>
     close to the very sill of the door of death.  How he wasted
    </p>
    <p>
     and wasted away in those few long-lingering days, till there
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing.
    </p>
    <p>
     But as all else in him thinned, and his cheek-bones grew sharper,
    </p>
    <p>
     his eyes, nevertheless, seemed growing fuller and fuller;
    </p>
    <p>
     they became of a strange softness of lustre; and mildly but
    </p>
    <p>
     deeply looked out at you there from his sickness, a wondrous
    </p>
    <p>
     testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die,
    </p>
    <p>
     or be weakened.  And like circles on the water, which, as they
    </p>
    <p>
     grow fainter, expand; so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding,
    </p>
    <p>
     like the rings of Eternity.  An awe that cannot be named would
    </p>
    <p>
     steal over you as you sat by the side of this waning savage,
    </p>
    <p>
     and saw as strange things in his face, as any beheld who were
    </p>
    <p>
     bystanders when Zoroaster died.  For whatever is truly wondrous
    </p>
    <p>
     and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books.
    </p>
    <p>
     And the drawing near of Death, which alike levels all,
    </p>
    <p>
     alike impresses all with a last revelation, which only an author
    </p>
    <p>
     from the dead could adequately tell.  So that--let us say it again--
    </p>
    <p>
     no dying Chaldee or Greek had higher and holier thoughts
    </p>
    <p>
     than those, whose mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face
    </p>
    <p>
     of poor Queequeg, as he quietly lay in his swaying hammock,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final rest,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the ocean's invisible flood-tide lifted him higher and higher
    </p>
    <p>
     towards his destined heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself,
    </p>
    <p>
     what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious
    </p>
    <p>
     favor he asked.  He called one to him in the grey morning watch,
    </p>
    <p>
     when the day was just breaking, and taking his hand,
    </p>
    <p>
     said that while in Nantucket he had chanced to see certain little
    </p>
    <p>
     canoes of dark wood, like the rich war-wood of his native isle;
    </p>
    <p>
     and upon inquiry, he had learned that all whalemen who died
    </p>
    <p>
     in Nantucket, were laid in those same dark canoes, and that the fancy
    </p>
    <p>
     of being so laid had much pleased him; for it was not unlike
    </p>
    <p>
     the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a dead warrior,
    </p>
    <p>
     stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be floated
    </p>
    <p>
     away to the starry archipelagoes; for not only do they believe
    </p>
    <p>
     that the stars are isles, but that far beyond all visible horizons,
    </p>
    <p>
     their own mild, uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue heavens;
    </p>
    <p>
     and so form the white breakers of the milky way.  He added,
    </p>
    <p>
     that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock,
    </p>
    <p>
     according to the usual sea-custom, tossed like something vile
    </p>
    <p>
     to the death-devouring sharks.  No:  he desired a canoe like those
    </p>
    <p>
     of Nantucket, all the more congenial to him, being a whaleman,
    </p>
    <p>
     that like a whale-boat these coffin-canoes were without a keel;
    </p>
    <p>
     though that involved but uncertain steering, and much lee-way
    </p>
    <p>
     adown the dim ages.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft,
    </p>
    <p>
     the carpenter was at once commanded to do Queequeg's bidding,
    </p>
    <p>
     whatever it might include.  There was some heathenish,
    </p>
    <p>
     coffin-colored old lumber aboard, which, upon a long previous voyage,
    </p>
    <p>
     had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the Lackaday islands,
    </p>
    <p>
     and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to be made.
    </p>
    <p>
     No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order, than taking
    </p>
    <p>
     his rule, he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude
    </p>
    <p>
     of his character, proceeded into the forecastle and took
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg's measure with great accuracy, regularly chalking
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg's person as he shifted the rule.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ah! poor fellow! he'll have to die now," ejaculated the
    </p>
    <p>
     Long Island sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Going to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake
    </p>
    <p>
     and general reference, now transferringly measured on it
    </p>
    <p>
     the exact length the coffin was to be, and then made the transfer
    </p>
    <p>
     permanent by cutting two notches at its extremities.
    </p>
    <p>
     This done, he marshalled the planks and his tools, and to work.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted,
    </p>
    <p>
     he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it,
    </p>
    <p>
     inquiring whether they were ready for it yet in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
     Overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which
    </p>
    <p>
     the people on deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg,
    </p>
    <p>
     to every one's consternation, commanded that the thing should
    </p>
    <p>
     be instantly brought to him, nor was there any denying him;
    </p>
    <p>
     seeing that, of all mortals, some dying men are the most tyrannical;
    </p>
    <p>
     and certainly, since they will shortly trouble us so little
    </p>
    <p>
     for evermore, the poor fellows ought to be indulged.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin
    </p>
    <p>
     with an attentive eye.  He then called for his harpoon,
    </p>
    <p>
     had the wooden stock drawn from it, and then had the iron part
    </p>
    <p>
     placed in the coffin along with one of the paddles of his boat.
    </p>
    <p>
     All by his own request, also, biscuits were then ranged round
    </p>
    <p>
     the sides within; a flask of fresh water was placed at the head,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot;
    </p>
    <p>
     and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for a pillow,
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed,
    </p>
    <p>
     that he might make trial of its comforts, if any it had.
    </p>
    <p>
     He lay without moving a few minutes, then told one to go
    </p>
    <p>
     to his bag and bring out his little god, Yojo.  Then crossing
    </p>
    <p>
     his arms on his breast with Yojo between, he called for
    </p>
    <p>
     the coffin lid (hatch he called it) to be placed over him.
    </p>
    <p>
     The head part turned over with a leather hinge, and there lay
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance
    </p>
    <p>
     in view.  "Rarmai" (it will do; it is easy), he murmured at last,
    </p>
    <p>
     and signed to be replaced in his hammock.
    </p>
    <p>
     But ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all
    </p>
    <p>
     the while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings,
    </p>
    <p>
     took him by the hand; in the other, holding his tambourine.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving?
    </p>
    <p>
     Where go ye now?  But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles
    </p>
    <p>
     where the beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye do one
    </p>
    <p>
     little errand for me?  Seek out one Pip, who's now been missing long:
    </p>
    <p>
     I think he's in those far Antilles.  If ye find him, then comfort him;
    </p>
    <p>
     for he must be very sad; for look! he's left his tambourine behind;--
    </p>
    <p>
     I found it.  Rig-a-dig, dig, dig!  Now, Queequeg, die; and I'll beat
    </p>
    <p>
     ye your dying march."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I have heard," murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, "that in
    </p>
    <p>
     violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues;
    </p>
    <p>
     and that when the mystery is probed, it turns out always
    </p>
    <p>
     that in their wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues
    </p>
    <p>
     had been really spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholars.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, to my fond faith, poor Pip, in this strange sweetness of
    </p>
    <p>
     his lunacy, brings heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Where learned he that, but there?--Hark! he speaks again;
    </p>
    <p>
     but more wildly now."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Form two and two!  Let's make a General of him!  Ho, where's
    </p>
    <p>
     his harpoon?  Lay it across here.--Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza!
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh for a game cock now to sit upon his head and crow!
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg dies game!--mind ye that; Queequeg dies game!--
    </p>
    <p>
     take ye good heed of that; Queequeg dies game!
    </p>
    <p>
     I say; game, game, game! but base little Pip, he died a coward;
    </p>
    <p>
     died all a'shiver;--out upon Pip!  Hark ye; if ye find Pip,
    </p>
    <p>
     tell all the Antilles he's a runaway; a coward, a coward,
    </p>
    <p>
     a coward!  Tell them he jumped from a whale-boat! I'd never
    </p>
    <p>
     beat my tambourine over base Pip, and hail him General,
    </p>
    <p>
     if he were once more dying here.  No, no! shame upon all cowards--
    </p>
    <p>
     shame upon them!  Let'em go drown like Pip, that jumped from
    </p>
    <p>
     a whale-boat. Shame! shame!"
    </p>
    <p>
     During all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pip was led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.
    </p>
    <p>
     But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death;
    </p>
    <p>
     now that his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied;
    </p>
    <p>
     soon there seemed no need of the carpenter's box; and thereupon,
    </p>
    <p>
     when some expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance,
    </p>
    <p>
     said, that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this;--
    </p>
    <p>
     at a critical moment, he had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he
    </p>
    <p>
     was leaving undone; and therefore had changed his mind about dying:
    </p>
    <p>
     he could not die yet, he averred.  They asked him, then, whether to
    </p>
    <p>
     live or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
     He answered, certainly.  In a word, it was Queequeg's conceit,
    </p>
    <p>
     that if a man made up his mind to live, mere sickness could not kill him:
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable,
    </p>
    <p>
     unintelligent destroyer of that sort.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized;
    </p>
    <p>
     that while a sick, civilized man may be six months convalescing,
    </p>
    <p>
     generally speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well again
    </p>
    <p>
     in a day.  So, in good time my Queequeg gained strength;
    </p>
    <p>
     and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days
    </p>
    <p>
     (but eating with a vigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to his feet,
    </p>
    <p>
     threw out his arms and legs, gave himself a good stretching, yawned a
    </p>
    <p>
     little bit, and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat,
    </p>
    <p>
     and poising a harpoon, pronounced himself fit for a fight.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest;
    </p>
    <p>
     and emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of grotesque
    </p>
    <p>
     figures and drawings; and it seemed that hereby he was striving,
    </p>
    <p>
     in his rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on his body.
    </p>
    <p>
     And this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and seer
    </p>
    <p>
     of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written
    </p>
    <p>
     out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth; so that Queequeg
    </p>
    <p>
     in his own proper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous work
    </p>
    <p>
     in one volume; but whose mysteries not even himself could read,
    </p>
    <p>
     though his own live heart beat against them; and these mysteries
    </p>
    <p>
     were therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the living
    </p>
    <p>
     parchment whereon they were inscribed, and so be unsolved to the last.
    </p>
    <p>
     And this thought it must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild
    </p>
    <p>
     exclamation of his, when one morning turning away from surveying poor
    </p>
    <p>
     Queequeg--"Oh, devilish tantalization of the gods!"

     The Pacific
    </p>
    <p>
     When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great
    </p>
    <p>
     South Sea; were it not for other things I could have greeted my dear
    </p>
    <p>
     Pacific with uncounted thanks, for now the long supplication of my youth
    </p>
    <p>
     was answered; that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousand
    </p>
    <p>
     leagues of blue.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     whose gently awful stirrings seems to speak of some hidden soul beneath;
    </p>
    <p>
     like those fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried
    </p>
    <p>
     Evangelist St. John.  And meet it is, that over these sea-pastures,
    </p>
    <p>
     wide-rolling watery prairies and Potters' Fields of all four continents,
    </p>
    <p>
     the waves should rise and fall, and ebb and flow unceasingly;
    </p>
    <p>
     for here, millions of mixed shades and shadows, drowned dreams,
    </p>
    <p>
     somnambulisms, reveries; all that we call lives and souls,
    </p>
    <p>
     lie dreaming, dreaming, still; tossing like slumberers in their beds;
    </p>
    <p>
     the ever-rolling waves but made so by their restlessness.
    </p>
    <p>
     To any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld,
    </p>
    <p>
     must ever after be the sea of his adoption.  It rolls the midmost
    </p>
    <p>
     waters of the world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms.
    </p>
    <p>
     The same waves wash the moles of the new-built California towns,
    </p>
    <p>
     but yesterday planted by the recentest race of men and lave the faded
    </p>
    <p>
     but still gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands, older than Abraham;
    </p>
    <p>
     while all between float milky-ways of coral isles, and low-lying, endless,
    </p>
    <p>
     unknown Archipelagoes, and impenetrable Japans.  Thus this mysterious,
    </p>
    <p>
     divine Pacific zones the world's whole bulk about; makes all
    </p>
    <p>
     coasts one bay to it; seems the tide-beating heart of earth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lifted by those eternal swells, you needs must own the seductive god,
    </p>
    <p>
     bowing your head to Pan.
    </p>
    <p>
     But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab's brain, as standing, like an iron
    </p>
    <p>
     statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging, with one
    </p>
    <p>
     nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee isles
    </p>
    <p>
     (in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking), and with
    </p>
    <p>
     the other consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea;
    </p>
    <p>
     that sea in which the hated White Whale must even then be swimming.
    </p>
    <p>
     Launched at length upon these almost final waters, and gliding
    </p>
    <p>
     towards the Japanese cruising-ground, the old man's purpose
    </p>
    <p>
     intensified itself.  His firm lips met like the lips of a vice;
    </p>
    <p>
     the Delta of his forehead's veins swelled like overladen brooks;
    </p>
    <p>
     in his very sleep, his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull,
    </p>
    <p>
     "Stern all! the White Whale spouts thick blood!"

     The Blacksmith
    </p>
    <p>
     Availing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned
    </p>
    <p>
     in these latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active
    </p>
    <p>
     pursuits shortly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered
    </p>
    <p>
     old blacksmith, had not removed his portable forge to the hold again,
    </p>
    <p>
     after concluding his contributory work for Ahab's leg, but still
    </p>
    <p>
     retained it on deck, fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast;
    </p>
    <p>
     being now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen, and harpooneers,
    </p>
    <p>
     and bowsmen to do some little job for them; altering, or repairing,
    </p>
    <p>
     or new shaping their various weapons and boat furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
     Often he would be surrounded by an eager circle, all waiting

    <p>
     to be served; holding boat-spades, pikeheads, harpoons, and lances,

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
     Nevertheless, this old man's was a patient hammer wielded by a

    <p>
     from him.  Silent, slow, and solemn; bowing over still further his
    </p>
    <p>
     chronically broken back, he toiled away, as if toil were life itself,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     And so it was.--Most miserable!
    </p>
    <p>
     A peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful
    </p>
    <p>
     appearing yawing in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage
    </p>
    <p>
     excited the curiosity of the mariners.  And to the importunity
    </p>
    <p>
     of their persisted questionings he had finally given in;
    </p>
    <p>
     and so it came to pass that every one now knew the shameful
    </p>
    <p>
     story of his wretched fate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Belated, and not innocently, one bitter winter's midnight,
    </p>
    <p>
     on the road running between two country towns, the blacksmith
    </p>
    <p>
     half-stupidly felt the deadly numbness stealing over him,
    </p>
    <p>
     and sought refuge in a leaning, dilapidated barn.
    </p>
    <p>
     The issue was, the loss of the extremities of both feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Out of this revelation, part by part, at last came out the four
    </p>
    <p>
     acts of the gladness, and the one long, and as yet uncatastrophied
    </p>
    <p>
     fifth act of the grief of his life's drama.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly
    </p>
    <p>
     encountered that thing in sorrow's technicals called ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had been an artisan of famed excellence, and with plenty
    </p>
    <p>
     to do; owned a house and garden; embraced a youthful,
    </p>
    <p>
     daughter-like, loving wife, and three blithe, ruddy children;
    </p>
    <p>
     every Sunday went to a cheerful-looking church, planted in a grove.
    </p>
    <p>
     But one night, under cover of darkness, and further concealed
    </p>
    <p>
     in a most cunning disguisement, a desperate burglar slid
    </p>
    <p>
     into his happy home, and robbed them all of everything.
    </p>
    <p>
     And darker yet to tell, the blacksmith himself did
    </p>
    <p>
     ignorantly conduct this burglar into his family's heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the Bottle Conjuror!  Upon the opening of that fatal cork,
    </p>
    <p>
     forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home.  Now, for prudent,
    </p>
    <p>
     most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith's shop was in
    </p>
    <p>
     the basement of his dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it;
    </p>
    <p>
     so that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened
    </p>
    <p>
     with no unhappy nervousness, but with vigorous pleasure,
    </p>
    <p>
     to the stout ringing of her young-armed old husband's hammer;
    </p>
    <p>
     whose reverberations, muffled by passing through the floors
    </p>
    <p>
     and walls, came up to her, not unsweetly, in her nursery;
    </p>
    <p>
     and so, to stout Labor's iron lullaby, the blacksmith's infants
    </p>
    <p>
     were rocked to slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, woe on woe!  Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely?
    </p>
    <p>
     Hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin
    </p>
    <p>
     came upon him, then had the young widow had a delicious grief,
    </p>
    <p>
     and her orphans a truly venerable, legendary sire to dream of in
    </p>
    <p>
     their after years; and all of them a care-killing competency.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Death plucked down some virtuous elder brother, on whose whistling
    </p>
    <p>
     daily toil solely hung the responsibilities of some other family,
    </p>
    <p>
     and left the worse than useless old man standing, till the hideous
    </p>
    <p>
     rot of life should make him easier to harvest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why tell the whole?  The blows of the basement hammer every day
    </p>
    <p>
     grew more and more between; and each blow every day grew fainter
    </p>
    <p>
     than the last; the wife sat frozen at the window, with tearless eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
     glitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children;
    </p>
    <p>
     the bellows fell; the forge choked up with cinders; the house
    </p>
    <p>
     was sold; the mother dived down into the long church-yard grass;
    </p>
    <p>
     her children twice followed her thither; and the houseless,
    </p>
    <p>
     familyless old man staggered off a vagabond in crape; his every
    </p>
    <p>
     woe unreverenced; his grey head a scorn to flaxen curls!
    </p>
    <p>
     Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this;
    </p>
    <p>
     but Death is only a launching into the region of the strange Untried;
    </p>
    <p>
     it is but the first salutation to the possibilities
    </p>
    <p>
     of the immense Remote, the Wild, the Watery, the Unshored;
    </p>
    <p>
     therefore, to the death-longing eyes of such men, who still
    </p>
    <p>
     have left in them some interior compunctions against suicide,
    </p>
    <p>
     does the all-contributed and all-receptive ocean alluringly spread
    </p>
    <p>
     forth his whole plain of unimaginable, taking terrors, and wonderful,
    </p>
    <p>
     new-life adventures; and from the hearts of infinite Pacifics,
    </p>
    <p>
     the thousand mermaids sing to them--"Come hither, broken-hearted;
    </p>
    <p>
     here is another life without the guilt of intermediate death;
    </p>
    <p>
     here are wonders supernatural, without dying for them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Come hither! bury thyself in a life which, to your now equally
    </p>
    <p>
     abhorred and abhorring, landed world, is more oblivious than death.
    </p>
    <p>
     Come hither! put up thy grave-stone, too, within the churchyard,
    </p>
    <p>
     and come hither, till we marry thee!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Hearkening to these voices, East and West, by early sunrise,
    </p>
    <p>
     and by fall of eve, the blacksmith's soul responded, Aye, I come!
    </p>
    <p>
     And so Perth went a-whaling.

     CHAPTER 113
    </head>
    <p>
     The Forge
    </p>
    <p>
     With matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron,
    </p>
    <p>
     about mid-day, Perth was standing between his forge and anvil,
    </p>
    <p>
     the latter placed upon an iron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head
    </p>
    <p>
     in the coals, and with the other at his forge's lungs, when Captain Ahab
    </p>
    <p>
     came along, carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag.
    </p>
    <p>
     While yet a little distance from the forge, moody Ahab paused;
    </p>
    <p>
     till at last, Perth, withdrawing his iron from the fire, began hammering
    </p>
    <p>
     it upon the anvil--the red mass sending off the sparks in thick
    </p>
    <p>
     hovering flights, some of which flew close to Ahab.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are these thy Mother Carey's chickens, Perth? they are always flying
    </p>
    <p>
     in thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all;--look here,
    </p>
    <p>
     they burn; but thou--thou liv'st among them without a scorch."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Because I am scorched all over, Captain Ahab," answered Perth,
    </p>
    <p>
     resting for a moment on his hammer; "I am past scorching-,
    </p>
    <p>
     not easily can'st thou scorch a scar."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, well; no more.  Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely woeful
    </p>
    <p>
     to me.  In no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery in others
    </p>
    <p>
     that is not mad.  Thou should'st go mad, blacksmith; say, why dost
    </p>
    <p>
     thou not go mad?  How can'st thou endure without being mad?
    </p>
    <p>
     Do the heavens yet hate thee, that thou can'st not go mad?--
    </p>
    <p>
     What wert thou making there?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Welding an old pike-head, sir; there were seams and dents in it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And can'st thou make it all smooth again, blacksmith, after such hard
    </p>
    <p>
     usage as it had?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I think so, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And I suppose thou can'st smoothe almost any seams and dents;
    </p>
    <p>
     never mind how hard the metal, blacksmith?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, sir, I think I can; all seams and dents but one."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Look ye here then," cried Ahab, passionately advancing, and leaning
    </p>
    <p>
     with both hands on Perth's shoulders; "look ye here--here--can ye
    </p>
    <p>
     smoothe out a seam like this, blacksmith," sweeping one hand across
    </p>
    <p>
     his ribbed brow; "if thou could'st, blacksmith, glad enough would
    </p>
    <p>
     I lay my head upon thy anvil, and feel thy heaviest hammer between
    </p>
    <p>
     my eyes.  Answer!  Can'st thou smoothe this seam?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh! that is the one, sir!  Said I not all seams and dents but one?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable;
    </p>
    <p>
     for though thou only see'st it here in my flesh, it has worked down
    </p>
    <p>
     into the bone of my skull--that is all wrinkles!  But, away with
    </p>
    <p>
     child's play; no more gaffs and pikes to-day. Look ye here!"
    </p>
    <p>
     jingling the leathern bag, as if it were full of gold coins.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I, too, want a harpoon made; one that a thousand yoke of fiends could
    </p>
    <p>
     not part, Perth; something that will stick in a whale like his own
    </p>
    <p>
     fin-bone. There's the stuff," flinging the pouch upon the anvil.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Look ye, blacksmith, these are the gathered nail-stubbs of the steel
    </p>
    <p>
     shoes of racing horses."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Horse-shoe stubbs, sir?  Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then,
    </p>
    <p>
     the best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue
    </p>
    <p>
     from the melted bones of murderers.  Quick! forge me the harpoon.
    </p>
    <p>
     And forge me first, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist,
    </p>
    <p>
     and hammer these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a
    </p>
    <p>
     tow-line. Quick!  I'll blow the fire."
    </p>
    <p>
     When at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one,
    </p>
    <p>
     by spiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt.
    </p>
    <p>
     "A flaw!" rejecting the last one.  "Work that over again, Perth."
    </p>
    <p>
     This done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one,
    </p>
    <p>
     when Ahab stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron.
    </p>
    <p>
     As, then, with regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil,
    </p>
    <p>
     Perth passing to him the glowing rods, one after the other,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight flame,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Parsee passed silently, and bowing over his head towards
    </p>
    <p>
     the fire, seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, as Ahab looked up, he slid aside.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What's that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?" muttered Stubb,
    </p>
    <p>
     looking on from the forecastle.  "That Parsee smells fire like a fusee;
    </p>
    <p>
     and smells of it himself, like a hot musket's powder-pan."
    </p>
    <p>
     At last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat;
    </p>
    <p>
     and as Perth, to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask
    </p>
    <p>
     of water near by, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab's bent face.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Would'st thou brand me, Perth?" wincing for a moment with the pain;
    </p>
    <p>
     "have I been but forging my own branding-iron, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Pray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab.  Is not this
    </p>
    <p>
     harpoon for the White Whale?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "For the white fiend!  But now for the barbs; thou must make
    </p>
    <p>
     them thyself, man.  Here are my razors--the best of steel;
    </p>
    <p>
     here, and make the barbs sharp as the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea."
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would
    </p>
    <p>
     fain not use them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Take them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither shave,
    </p>
    <p>
     sup, nor pray till--but here--to work!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the shank,
    </p>
    <p>
     the steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the blacksmith
    </p>
    <p>
     was about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to tempering them,
    </p>
    <p>
     he cried to Ahab to place the water-cask near.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, no--no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahoy, there!  Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo!  What say ye, pagans!  Will ye
    </p>
    <p>
     give me as much blood as will cover this barb?" holding it high up.
    </p>
    <p>
     A cluster of dark nods replied, Yes.  Three punctures were made
    </p>
    <p>
     in the heathen flesh, and the White Whale's barbs were then tempered.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!"
    </p>
    <p>
     deliriously howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly
    </p>
    <p>
     devoured the baptismal blood.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of hickory,
    </p>
    <p>
     with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the socket
    </p>
    <p>
     of the iron.  A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and some fathoms
    </p>
    <p>
     of it taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great tension.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pressing his foot upon it, till the rope hummed like a harp-string,
    </p>
    <p>
     then eagerly bending over it, and seeing no strandings, Ahab exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good! and now for the seizings."
    </p>
    <p>
     At one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread
    </p>
    <p>
     yarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon;
    </p>
    <p>
     the pole was then driven hard up into the socket; from the lower
    </p>
    <p>
     end the rope was traced halfway along the pole's length,
    </p>
    <p>
     and firmly secured so, with inter-twistings of twine.
    </p>
    <p>
     This done, pole, iron, and rope--like the Three Fates--
    </p>
    <p>
     remained inseparable, and Ahab moodily stalked away with the weapon;
    </p>
    <p>
     the sound of his ivory leg, and the sound of the hickory pole,
    </p>
    <p>
     both hollowly ringing along every plank.  But ere he entered
    </p>
    <p>
     his cabin, a light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet most piteous
    </p>
    <p>
     sound was heard.  Oh!  Pip, thy wretched laugh, thy idle
    </p>
    <p>
     but unresting eye; all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly
    </p>
    <p>
     blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship,
    </p>
    <p>
     and mocked it!

     The Gilder
    </p>
    <p>
     Penetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese
    </p>
    <p>
     cruising ground the Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery.
    </p>
    <p>
     Often, in mild, pleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen,
    </p>
    <p>
     and twenty hours on the stretch, they were engaged in the boats,
    </p>
    <p>
     steadily pulling, or sailing, or paddling after the whales,
    </p>
    <p>
     or for an interlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaiting
    </p>
    <p>
     their uprising; though with but small success for their pains.
    </p>
    <p>
     At such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth,
    </p>
    <p>
     slow heaving swells; seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe;
    </p>
    <p>
     and so sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves,
    </p>
    <p>
     that like hearth-stone cats they purr against the gunwale;
    </p>
    <p>
     these are the times of dreamy quietude, when beholding the tranquil
    </p>
    <p>
     beauty and brilliancy of the ocean's skin, one forgets the tiger
    </p>
    <p>
     heart that pants beneath it; and would not willingly remember,
    </p>
    <p>
     that this velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang.
    </p>
    <p>
     These are the times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels
    </p>
    <p>
     a certain filial, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he
    </p>
    <p>
     regards it as so much flowery earth; and the distant ship revealing
    </p>
    <p>
     only the tops of her masts, seems struggling forward, not through high
    </p>
    <p>
     rolling waves, but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie:
    </p>
    <p>
     as when the western emigrants' horses only show their erected ears,
    </p>
    <p>
     while their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure.
    </p>
    <p>
     The long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides;
    </p>
    <p>
     as over these there steals the hush, the hum; you almost swear
    </p>
    <p>
     that play-wearied children lie sleeping in these solitudes,
    </p>
    <p>
     in some glad May-time, when the flowers of the woods are plucked.
    </p>
    <p>
     And all this mixes with your most mystic mood; so that fact and fancy,
    </p>
    <p>
     half-way meeting, interpenetrate, and form one seamless whole.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least
    </p>
    <p>
     as temporary an effect on Ahab.  But if these secret golden
    </p>
    <p>
     keys did seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries,
    </p>
    <p>
     yet did his breath upon them prove but tarnishing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, grassy glades! oh ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul;
    </p>
    <p>
     in ye,--though long parched by the dead drought of the earthly life,--
    </p>
    <p>
     in ye, men yet may roll, like young horses in new morning clover;
    </p>
    <p>
     and for some few fleeting moments, feel the cool dew of the life
    </p>
    <p>
     immortal on them.  Would to God these blessed calms would last.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the mingled, mingling threads of life are woven by warp
    </p>
    <p>
     and woof:  calms crossed by storms, a storm for every calm.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is no steady unretracing progress in this life; we do not
    </p>
    <p>
     advance through fixed gradations, and at the last one pause:--
    </p>
    <p>
     through infancy's unconscious spell, boyhood's thoughtless
    </p>
    <p>
     faith, adolescence' doubt (the common doom), then scepticism,
    </p>
    <p>
     then disbelief, resting at last in manhood's pondering repose
    </p>
    <p>
     of If.  But once gone through, we trace the round again;
    </p>
    <p>
     and are infants, boys, and men, and Ifs eternally.
    </p>
    <p>
     Where lies the final harbor, whence we unmoor no more?
    </p>
    <p>
     In what rapt ether sails the world, of which the weariest
    </p>
    <p>
     will never weary?  Where is the foundling's father hidden?
    </p>
    <p>
     Our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die
    </p>
    <p>
     in bearing them:  the secret of our paternity lies in their grave,
    </p>
    <p>
     and we must there to learn it.
    </p>
    <p>
     And that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat's side
    </p>
    <p>
     into that same golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:--
    </p>
    <p>
     "Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride's eyes!--
    </p>
    <p>
     Tell me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy kidnapping cannibal ways.
    </p>
    <p>
     Let faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; I look deep down
    </p>
    <p>
     and do believe."
    </p>
    <p>
     And Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in that
    </p>
    <p>
     same golden light:--
    </p>
    <p>
     "I am Stubb, and Stubb has his history; but here Stubb takes
    </p>
    <p>
     oaths that he has always been jolly!"

    <p>
     The Pequod Meets The Bachelor
    </p>
    <p>
     And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down
    </p>
    <p>
     before the wind, some few weeks after Ahab's harpoon had been welded.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged
    </p>
    <p>
     in her last cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches;
    </p>
    <p>
     and now, in glad holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat
    </p>
    <p>
     vain-gloriously, sailing round among the widely-separated ships
    </p>
    <p>
     on the ground, previous to pointing her prow for home.
    </p>
    <p>
     The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red
    </p>
    <p>
     bunting at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended,
    </p>
    <p>
     bottom down; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long
    </p>
    <p>
     lower jaw of the last whale they had slain.  Signals, ensigns,
    </p>
    <p>
     and jacks of all colors were flying from her rigging, on every side.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels
    </p>
    <p>
     of sperm; above which, in her top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender
    </p>
    <p>
     breakers of the same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck
    </p>
    <p>
     was a brazen lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
     As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with
    </p>
    <p>
     the most surprising success; all the more wonderful,
    </p>
    <p>
     for that while cruising in the same seas numerous other vessels
    </p>
    <p>
     had gone entire months without securing a single fish.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make
    </p>
    <p>
     room for the far more valuable sperm, but additional supplemental
    </p>
    <p>
     casks had been bartered for, from the ships she had met; and these
    </p>
    <p>
     were stowed along the deck, and in the captain's and officers'
    </p>
    <p>
     state-rooms. Even the cabin table itself had been knocked
    </p>
    <p>
     into kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head
    </p>
    <p>
     of an oil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the forecastle, the sailors had actually caulked and pitched
    </p>
    <p>
     their chests, and filled them; it was humorously added, that the
    </p>
    <p>
     cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler, and filled it;
    </p>
    <p>
     that the steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filled it;
    </p>
    <p>
     that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons
    </p>
    <p>
     and filled them; that indeed everything was filled with sperm,
    </p>
    <p>
     except the captain's pantaloons pockets, and those he reserved
    </p>
    <p>
     to thrust his hands into, in self-complacent testimony of
    </p>
    <p>
     his entire satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
     As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod,
    </p>
    <p>
     the barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle;
    </p>
    <p>
     and drawing still nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing
    </p>
    <p>
     round her huge try-pots, which, covered with the parchment-like
    </p>
    <p>
     poke or stomach skin of the black fish, gave forth a loud
    </p>
    <p>
     roar to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the quarter-deck, the mates and harpooneers were dancing with the
    </p>
    <p>
     olive-hued girls who had eloped with them from the Polynesian Isles;
    </p>
    <p>
     while suspended in an ornamented boat, firmly secured aloft between
    </p>
    <p>
     the foremast and mainmast, three Long Island negroes, with glittering
    </p>
    <p>
     fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were presiding over the hilarious jig.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meanwhile, others of the ship's company were tumultuously busy at
    </p>
    <p>
     the masonry of the try-works, from which the huge pots had been removed.
    </p>
    <p>
     You would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed Bastille,
    </p>
    <p>
     such wild cries they raised, as the now useless brick and mortar
    </p>
    <p>
     were being hurled into the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect
    </p>
    <p>
     on the ship's elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing
    </p>
    <p>
     drama was full before him, and seemed merely contrived for his
    </p>
    <p>
     own individual diversion.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black,
    </p>
    <p>
     with a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other's wakes--
    </p>
    <p>
     one all jubilations for things passed, the other all forebodings
    </p>
    <p>
     as to things to come--their two captains in themselves impersonated
    </p>
    <p>
     the whole striking contrast of the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come aboard, come aboard!" cried the gay Bachelor's commander,
    </p>
    <p>
     lifting a glass and a bottle in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hast seen the White Whale?" gritted Ahab in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No; only heard of him; but don't believe in him at all,"
    </p>
    <p>
     said the other good-humoredly. "Come aboard!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thou art too damned jolly.  Sail on.  Hast lost any men?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not enough to speak of--two islanders, that's all;--but come aboard,
    </p>
    <p>
     old hearty, come along.  I'll soon take that black from your brow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Come along, will ye (merry's the play); a full ship and homeward-bound."
    </p>
    <p>
     "How wondrous familiar is a fool!" muttered Ahab; then aloud, "Thou art
    </p>
    <p>
     a full ship and homeward bound, thou sayest; well, then, call me
    </p>
    <p>
     an empty ship, and outward-bound. So go thy ways, and I will mine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Forward there!  Set all sail, and keep her to the wind!"
    </p>
    <p>
     And thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze,
    </p>
    <p>
     the other stubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted;
    </p>
    <p>
     the crew of the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances
    </p>
    <p>
     towards the receding Bachelor; but the Bachelor's men never heeding
    </p>
    <p>
     their gaze for the lively revelry they were in.  And as Ahab,
    </p>
    <p>
     leaning over the taffrail, eyed the homewardbound craft, he took
    </p>
    <p>
     from his pocket a small vial of sand, and then looking from the ship
    </p>
    <p>
     to the vial, seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together,
    </p>
    <p>
     for that vial was filled with Nantucket soundings.

     The Dying Whale
    </p>
    <p>
     Not seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune's favorites
    </p>
    <p>
     sail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat
    </p>
    <p>
     of the rushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out.
    </p>
    <p>
     So seemed it with the Pequod.  For next day after encountering
    </p>
    <p>
     the gay Bachelor, whales were seen and four were slain;
    </p>
    <p>
     and one of them by Ahab.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the crimson
    </p>
    <p>
     fight were done; and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky,
    </p>
    <p>
     sun and whale both stilly died together; then, such a sweetness and
    </p>
    <p>
     such plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air,
    </p>
    <p>
     that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Manilla isles, the Spanish land-breeze, wantonly turned sailor,
    </p>
    <p>
     had gone to sea, freighted with these vesper hymns.
    </p>
    <p>
     Soothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had sterned
    </p>
    <p>
     off from the whale, sat intently watching his final wanings from
    </p>
    <p>
     the now tranquil boat.  For that strange spectacle observable in all
    </p>
    <p>
     sperm whales dying--the turning sunwards of the head, and so expiring--
    </p>
    <p>
     that strange spectacle, beheld of such a placid evening, somehow to Ahab
    </p>
    <p>
     conveyed a wondrousness unknown before.
    </p>
    <p>
     "He turns and turns him to it,--how slowly, but how steadfastly,
    </p>
    <p>
     his homage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions.
    </p>
    <p>
     He too worships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the sun!--
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh that these too-favoring eyes should see these too-favoring sights.
    </p>
    <p>
     Look! here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of human weal or woe;
    </p>
    <p>
     in these most candid and impartial seas; where to traditions no rocks
    </p>
    <p>
     furnish tablets; where for long Chinese ages, the billows have still
    </p>
    <p>
     rolled on speechless and unspoken to, as stars that shine upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the Niger's unknown source; here, too, life dies sunwards full of faith,
    </p>
    <p>
     but see! no sooner dead, than death whirls round the corpse, and it
    </p>
    <p>
     heads some other way.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, thou dark Hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast builded
    </p>
    <p>
     thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas;
    </p>
    <p>
     thou art an infidel, thou queen, and too truly speakest to me in the
    </p>
    <p>
     wide-slaughtering Typhoon, and the hushed burial of its after calm.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head, and then gone
    </p>
    <p>
     round again, without a lesson to me.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, trebly hooped and welded hip of power!  Oh, high aspiring,
    </p>
    <p>
     rainbowed jet!--that one strivest, this one jettest all in vain!
    </p>
    <p>
     In vain, oh whale, dost thou seek intercedings with yon
    </p>
    <p>
     all-quickening sun, that only calls forth life, but gives it not again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet dost thou darker half, rock me with a prouder, if a darker faith.
    </p>
    <p>
     All thy unnamable imminglings float beneath me here; I am buoyed
    </p>
    <p>
     by breaths of once living things, exhaled as air, but water now.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Then hail, for ever hail, O sea, in whose eternal tossings the wild
    </p>
    <p>
     fowl finds his only rest.  Born of earth, yet suckled by the sea;

     The Whale Watch
    </p>
    <p>
     The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart;
    </p>
    <p>
     one, far to windward; one less distant, to leeward; one ahead;
    </p>
    <p>
     one astern.  These last three were brought alongside ere nightfall;
    </p>
    <p>
     but the windward one could not be reached till morning;
    </p>
    <p>
     and the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night;
    </p>
    <p>
     and that boat was Ahab's.
    </p>
    <p>
     The waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale's spout-hole;
    </p>
    <p>
     and the lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering glare
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the black, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight waves,
    </p>
    <p>
     which gently chafed the whale's broad flank, like soft surf upon a beach.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab and all his boat's crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who crouching
    </p>
    <p>
     in the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played round
    </p>
    <p>
     the whale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails.
    </p>
    <p>
     A sound like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven
    </p>
    <p>
     ghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.
    </p>
    <p>
     Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee;
    </p>
    <p>
     and hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men
    </p>
    <p>
     in a flooded world.  "I have dreamed it again," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of the hearses?  Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse
    </p>
    <p>
     nor coffin can be thine?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "And who are hearsed that die on the sea?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "But I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage,
    </p>
    <p>
     two hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not
    </p>
    <p>
     made by mortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must
    </p>
    <p>
     be grown in America."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee!--a hearse and its plumes floating
    </p>
    <p>
     over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers. Ha!  Such a sight
    </p>
    <p>
     we shall not soon see."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Believe it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And what was that saying about thyself?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Though it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thy pilot."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And when thou art so gone before--if that ever befall--then ere
    </p>
    <p>
     I can follow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still?--
    </p>
    <p>
     Was it not so?  Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot!
    </p>
    <p>
     I have here two pledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Take another pledge, old man," said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted
    </p>
    <p>
     up like fire-flies in the gloom--"Hemp only can kill thee."
    </p>
    <p>
     "The gallows, ye mean.--I am immortal then, on land and on sea,"
    </p>
    <p>
     cried Ahab, with a laugh of derision;--"Immortal on land and on sea!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Both were silent again, as one man.  The grey dawn came on,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the slumbering crew arose from the boat's bottom, and ere
    </p>
    <p>
     noon the dead whale was brought to the ship.

    <p>
     The season for the Line at length drew near; and every
    </p>
    <p>
     day when Ahab, coming from his cabin cast his eyes aloft,
    </p>
    <p>
     the vigilant helmsman would ostentatiously handle his spokes,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the eager mariners quickly run to the braces, and would stand
    </p>
    <p>
     there with all their eyes centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon;
    </p>
    <p>
     impatient for the order to point the ship's prow for the equator.
    </p>
    <p>
     In good time the order came.  It was hard upon high noon;
    </p>
    <p>
     and Ahab, seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat,
    </p>
    <p>
     was about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun

    <p>
     to determine his latitude.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets

    </p>
    <p>
     seems the blazing focus of the glassy ocean's immeasurable
    </p>
    <p>
     burning-glass. The sky looks lacquered; clouds there are none;

     radiance is as the insufferable splendors of God's throne.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well that Ahab's quadrant was furnished with colored glasses,
    </p>
    <p>
     through which to take sight of that solar fire.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship,
    </p>
    <p>
     and with his astrological-looking instrument placed to his eye,
    </p>
    <p>
     he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise
    </p>
    <p>
     instant when the sun should gain its precise meridian.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meantime while his whole attention was absorbed, the Parsee
    </p>
    <p>
     was kneeling beneath him on the ship's deck, and with face
    </p>
    <p>
     thrown up like Ahab's, was eyeing the same sun with him;
    </p>
    <p>
     only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and his
    </p>
    <p>
     wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness.
    </p>
    <p>
     At length the desired observation was taken; and with his pencil
    </p>
    <p>
     upon his ivory leg, Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must
    </p>
    <p>
     be at that precise instant.  Then falling into a moment's revery,
    </p>
    <p>
     he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thou seamark! thou high and mighty Pilot! thou tellest me truly
    </p>
    <p>
     where I am--but canst thou cast the least hint where I shall be?
    </p>
    <p>
     Or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this
    </p>
    <p>
     moment living?  Where is Moby Dick?  This instant thou must
    </p>
    <p>
     be eyeing him.  These eyes of mine look into the very eye
    </p>
    <p>
     that is even now beholding him; aye, and into the eye that
    </p>
    <p>
     is even now equally beholding the objects on the unknown,
    </p>
    <p>
     thither side of thee, thou sun!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Then gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other,
    </p>
    <p>
     its numerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again,
    </p>
    <p>
     and muttered:  "Foolish toy! babies' plaything of haughty Admirals,
    </p>
    <p>
     and Commodores, and Captains; the world brags of thee,
    </p>
    <p>
     of thy cunning and might; but what after all canst thou do,
    </p>
    <p>
     but tell the poor, pitiful point, where thou thyself happenest
    </p>
    <p>
     to be on this wide planet, and the hand that holds thee:
    </p>
    <p>
     no! not one jot more!  Thou canst not tell where one drop
    </p>
    <p>
     of water or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet
    </p>
    <p>
     with thy impotence thou insultest the sun!  Science!  Curse thee,
    </p>
    <p>
     thou vain toy; and cursed be all the things that cast man's eyes
    </p>
    <p>
     aloft to that heaven, whose live vividness but scorches him,
    </p>
    <p>
     as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy light, O sun!
    </p>
    <p>
     Level by nature to this earth's horizon are the glances of man's eyes;
    </p>
    <p>
     not shot from the crown of his head, as if God had meant
    </p>
    <p>
     him to gaze on his firmament.  Curse thee, thou quadrant!"
    </p>
    <p>
     dashing it to the deck, "no longer will I guide my earthly way
    </p>
    <p>
     by thee; the level ship's compass, and the level deadreckoning,
    </p>
    <p>
     by log and by line; these shall conduct me, and show me my place
    </p>
    <p>
     on the sea.  Aye," lighting from the boat to the deck, "thus I
    </p>
    <p>
     trample on thee, thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high;
    </p>
    <p>
     thus I split and destroy thee!"
    </p>
    <p>
     As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live
    </p>
    <p>
     and dead feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself--
    </p>
    <p>
     these passed over the mute, motionless Parsee's face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Unobserved he rose and glided away; while, awestruck by the aspect
    </p>
    <p>
     of their commander, the seamen clustered together on the forecastle,
    </p>
    <p>
     till Ahab, troubledly pacing the deck, shouted out--"To the braces!
    </p>
    <p>
     Up helm!--square in!"
    </p>
    <p>
     In an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled
    </p>
    <p>
     upon her heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised
    </p>
    <p>
     upon her long, ribbed hull, seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting
    </p>
    <p>
     on one sufficient steed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Standing between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the Pequod's
    </p>
    <p>
     tumultuous way, and Ahab's also, as he went lurching along the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow,
    </p>
    <p>
     full of its tormented flaming life; and I have seen it wane
    </p>
    <p>
     at last, down, down, to dumbest dust.  Old man of oceans!
    </p>
    <p>
     of all this fiery life of thine, what will at length remain
    </p>
    <p>
     but one little heap of ashes!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye," cried Stubb, "but sea-coal ashes--mind ye that, Mr. Starbuck--
    </p>
    <p>
     sea-coal, not your common charcoal.  Well, well!  I heard
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab mutter, 'Here some one thrusts these cards into these old
    </p>
    <p>
     hands of mine; swears that I must play them, and no others.'
    </p>
    <p>
     And damn me, Ahab, but thou actest right; live in the game,
    </p>
    <p>
     and die in it!"

     The Candles

    <p>
     Warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs:  the tiger
    </p>
    <p>
     of Bengal crouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Skies the most effulgent but basket the deadliest thunders:
    </p>
    <p>
     gorgeous Cuba knows tornadoes that never swept tame
    </p>
    <p>
     northern lands.  So, too, it is, that in these resplendent
    </p>
    <p>
     Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of all storms,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Typhoon.  It will sometimes burst from out that cloudless sky,
    </p>
    <p>
     like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town.
    </p>
    <p>
     Towards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas,
    </p>
    <p>
     and bare-poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck
    </p>
    <p>
     her directly ahead.  When darkness came on, sky and sea roared
    </p>
    <p>
     and split with the thunder, and blazed with the lightning,
    </p>
    <p>
     that showed the disabled mast fluttering here and there
    </p>
    <p>
     with the rags which the first fury of the tempest had left
    </p>
    <p>
     for its after sport.
    </p>
    <p>
     Holding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck;
    </p>
    <p>
     at every flash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see
    </p>
    <p>
     what additional disaster might have befallen the intricate
    </p>
    <p>
     hamper there; while Stubb and Flask were directing the men
    </p>
    <p>
     in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boats.
    </p>
    <p>
     But all their pains seemed naught.  Though lifted to the very top
    </p>
    <p>
     of the cranes, the windward quarter boat (Ahab's) did not escape.
    </p>
    <p>
     A great rolling sea, dashing high up against the reeling ship's
    </p>
    <p>
     high teetering side, stove in the boat's bottom at the stern,
    </p>
    <p>
     and left it again, all dripping through like a sieve.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bad work, bad work!  Mr. Starbuck," said Stubb, regarding the wreck,
    </p>
    <p>
     "but the sea will have its way.  Stubb, for one, can't fight it.
    </p>
    <p>
     You see, Mr. Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it leaps,
    </p>
    <p>
     all round the world it runs, and then comes the spring!  But as for me,
    </p>
    <p>
     all the start I have to meet it, is just across the deck here.
    </p>
    <p>
     But never mind; it's all in fun:  so the old song says;"--(sings.)
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh! jolly is the gale,
    </p>
    <p>
     And a joker is the whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     A' flourishin' his tail,--
    </p>
    <p>
     Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky
    </p>
    <p>
     lad, is the Ocean, oh!
    </p>
    <p>
     The scud all a flyin',
    </p>
    <p>
     That's his flip only foamin';
    </p>
    <p>
     When he stirs in the spicin',--
    </p>
    <p>
     Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky
    </p>
    <p>
     lad, is the Ocean, oh!
    </p>
    <p>
     Thunder splits the ships,
    </p>
    <p>
     But he only smacks his lips,
    </p>
    <p>
     A tastin' of this flip,--
    </p>
    <p>
     Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky
    </p>
    <p>
     lad, is the Ocean, oh!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Avast Stubb," cried Starbuck, "let the Typhoon sing, and strike
    </p>
    <p>
     his harp here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou
    </p>
    <p>
     wilt hold thy peace."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man;
    </p>
    <p>
     I am a coward; and I sing to keep up my spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
     And I tell you what it is, Mr. Starbuck, there's no way
    </p>
    <p>
     to stop my singing in this world but to cut my throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     And when that's done, ten to one I sing ye the doxology
    </p>
    <p>
     for a wind-up."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Madman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else,
    </p>
    <p>
     never mind how foolish?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Here!" cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing
    </p>
    <p>
     his hand towards the weather bow, "markest thou not that the gale
    </p>
    <p>
     comes from the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick?
    </p>
    <p>
     the very course he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat there;
    </p>
    <p>
     where is that stove?  In the stern-sheets, man; where he is wont to stand--
    </p>
    <p>
     his stand-point is stove, man!  Now jump overboard, and sing away,
    </p>
    <p>
     if thou must!
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't half understand ye:  what's in the wind?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to Nantucket,"
    </p>
    <p>
     soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubb's question.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn it into a fair
    </p>
    <p>
     wind that will drive us towards home.  Yonder, to windward, all is
    </p>
    <p>
     blackness of doom; but to leeward, homeward--I see it lightens up there;
    </p>
    <p>
     but not with the lightning."
    </p>
    <p>
     At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness,
    </p>
    <p>
     following the flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost
    </p>
    <p>
     at the same instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Who's there?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Old Thunder!" said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks
    </p>
    <p>
     to his pivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain
    </p>
    <p>
     to him by elbowed lances of fire.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off
    </p>
    <p>
     the perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some
    </p>
    <p>
     ships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
     But as this conductor must descend to considerable depth,
    </p>
    <p>
     that its end may avoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover,
    </p>
    <p>
     if kept constantly towing there, it would be liable to many mishaps,
    </p>
    <p>
     besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging, and more
    </p>
    <p>
     or less impeding the vessel's way in the water; because of all this,
    </p>
    <p>
     the lower parts of a ship's lightning-rods are not always overboard;
    </p>
    <p>
     but are generally made in long slender links, so as to be the more
    </p>
    <p>
     readily hauled up into the chains outside, or thrown down into the sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     as occasion may require.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The rods! the rods!" cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished
    </p>
    <p>
     to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeaux,
    </p>
    <p>
     to light Ahab to his post.  "Are they overboard? drop them over,
    </p>
    <p>
     fore and aft.  Quick!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Avast!" cried Ahab; "let's have fair play here, though we be
    </p>
    <p>
     the weaker side.  Yet I'll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs
    </p>
    <p>
     and Andes, that all the world may be secured; but out on privileges!
    </p>
    <p>
     Let them be, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Look aloft!" cried Starbuck.  "The corpusants! the corpusants!
    </p>
    <p>
     All the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at
    </p>
    <p>
     each tri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames,
    </p>
    <p>
     each of the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air,
    </p>
    <p>
     like three gigantic wax tapers before an altar.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Blast the boat! let it go!" cried Stubb at this instant,
    </p>
    <p>
     as a swashing sea heaved up under his own little craft so that its
    </p>
    <p>
     gunwale violently jammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Blast it!"--but slipping backward on the deck, his uplifted eyes
    </p>
    <p>
     caught the flames; and immediately shifting his tone he cried--"The
    </p>
    <p>
     corpusants have mercy on us all!"
    </p>
    <p>
     To sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear
    </p>
    <p>
     in the trance of the calm, and in the teeth of the tempest;
    </p>
    <p>
     they will imprecate curses from the topsail-yard-arms, when most
    </p>
    <p>
     they teeter over to a seething sea; but in all my voyagings,
    </p>
    <p>
     seldom have I heard a common oath when God's burning finger has
    </p>
    <p>
     been laid on the ship; when His "Mene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin"
    </p>
    <p>
     has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage.
    </p>
    <p>
     While this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from
    </p>
    <p>
     the enchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle,
    </p>
    <p>
     all their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a faraway
    </p>
    <p>
     constellation of stars.  Relieved against the ghostly light,
    </p>
    <p>
     the gigantic jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature,
    </p>
    <p>
     and seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come.
    </p>
    <p>
     The parted mouth of Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth,
    </p>
    <p>
     which strangely gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants;
    </p>
    <p>
     while lit up by the preternatural light, Queequeg's tattooing burned
    </p>
    <p>
     like Satanic blue flames on his body.
    </p>
    <p>
     The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once
    </p>
    <p>
     more the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall.
    </p>
    <p>
     A moment or two passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against
    </p>
    <p>
     some one.  It was Stubb.  "What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy cry;
    </p>
    <p>
     it was not the same in the song."
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, no, it wasn't; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all;
    </p>
    <p>
     and I hope they will, still.  But do they only have
    </p>
    <p>
     mercy on long faces?--have they no bowels for a laugh?
    </p>
    <p>
     And look ye, Mr. Starbuck--but it's too dark to look.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hear me, then; I take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign
    </p>
    <p>
     of good luck; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is
    </p>
    <p>
     going to be chock a' block with sperm-oil, d'ye see; and so,
    </p>
    <p>
     all that sperm will work up into the masts, like sap in a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, our three masts will yet be as three spermaceti candles--
    </p>
    <p>
     that's the good promise we saw."
    </p>
    <p>
     At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb's face slowly
    </p>
    <p>
     beginning to glimmer into sight.  Glancing upwards, he cried:
    </p>
    <p>
     "See! see!" and once more the high tapering flames were beheld
    </p>
    <p>
     with what seemed redoubled supernaturalness in their pallor.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The corpusants have mercy on us all," cried Stubb, again.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the base of the main-mast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Parsee was kneeling in Ahab's front, but with his head bowed away
    </p>
    <p>
     from him; while near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging,
    </p>
    <p>
     where they had just been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen,
    </p>
    <p>
     arrested by the glare, now cohered together, and hung pendulous,
    </p>
    <p>
     like a knot of numbed wasps from a drooping, orchard twig.
    </p>
    <p>
     In various enchanted attitudes like the standing, or stepping,
    </p>
    <p>
     or running skeletons in Herculaneum, others remained rooted to the deck;
    </p>
    <p>
     but all their eyes upcast.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, aye, men!" cried Ahab.  "Look up at it; mark it well;
    </p>
    <p>
     the white flame but lights the way to the White Whale!  Hand me
    </p>
    <p>
     those mainmast links there; I would fain feel this pulse,
    </p>
    <p>
     and let mine beat against it; blood against fire!  So."
    </p>
    <p>
     Then turning--the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his foot
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right arm,
    </p>
    <p>
     he stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as
    </p>
    <p>
     Persian once did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned
    </p>
    <p>
     by thee, that to this hour I bear the scar; I now know thee,
    </p>
    <p>
     thou clear spirit, and I now know that thy right worship
    </p>
    <p>
     is defiance.  To neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind;
    </p>
    <p>
     and e'en for hate thou canst but kill; and all are killed.
    </p>
    <p>
     No fearless fool now fronts thee.  I own thy speechless,
    </p>
    <p>
     placeless power; but to the last gasp of my earthquake life
    </p>
    <p>
     will dispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the midst of the personified impersonal, a personality stands here.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though but a point at best; whenceso'er I came; whereso'er I go;
    </p>
    <p>
     yet while I earthly live, the queenly personality lives in me,
    </p>
    <p>
     and feels her royal rights.  But war is pain, and hate is woe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Come in thy lowest form of love, and I will kneel and kiss thee;
    </p>
    <p>
     but at thy highest, come as mere supernal power; and though
    </p>
    <p>
     thou launchest navies of full-freighted worlds, there's that in
    </p>
    <p>
     here that still remains indifferent.  Oh, thou clear spirit,
    </p>
    <p>
     of thy fire thou madest me, and like a true child of fire,
    </p>
    <p>
     I breathe it back to thee."
    </p>
    <p>
     [Sudden, repeated flashes of lightning; the nine flames leap lengthwise
    </p>
    <p>
     to thrice their previous height; Ahab, with the rest, closes his eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
     his right hand pressed hard upon them.]
    </p>
    <p>
     "I own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so?
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor was it wrung from me; nor do I now drop these links.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thou canst blind; but I can then grope.  Thou canst consume;
    </p>
    <p>
     but I can then be ashes.  Take the homage of these poor eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
     and shutter-hands. I would not take it.  The lightning
    </p>
    <p>
     flashes through my skull; mine eyeballs ache and ache;
    </p>
    <p>
     my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some
    </p>
    <p>
     stunning ground.  Oh, oh!  Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to thee.
    </p>
    <p>
     Light though thou be, thou leapest out of darkness;
    </p>
    <p>
     but I am darkness leaping out of light, leaping out of thee!
    </p>
    <p>
     The javelins cease; open eyes; see, or not?  There burn the flames!
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, thou magnanimous! now do I do glory in my genealogy.
    </p>
    <p>
     But thou art but my fiery father; my sweet mother, I know not.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, cruel! what hast thou done with her?  There lies my puzzle;
    </p>
    <p>
     but thine is greater.  Thou knowest not how came ye,
    </p>
    <p>
     hence callest thyself unbegotten; certainly knowest not
    </p>
    <p>
     thy beginning, hence callest thyself unbegun.  I know that of me,
    </p>
    <p>
     which thou knowest not of thyself, oh, thou omnipotent.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou clear spirit,
    </p>
    <p>
     to whom all thy eternity is but time, all thy creativeness mechanical.
    </p>
    <p>
     Through thee, thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly see it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, thou foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too
    </p>
    <p>
     hast thy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here again with haughty agony, I read my sire.  Leap! leap up,
    </p>
    <p>
     and lick the sky!  I leap with thee; I burn with thee;
    </p>
    <p>
     would fain be welded with thee; defyingly I worship thee!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "The boat! the boat!" cried Starbuck, "look at thy boat, old man!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab's harpoon, the one forged at Perth's fire, remained firmly
    </p>
    <p>
     lashed in its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond
    </p>
    <p>
     his whale-boat's bow; but the sea that had stove its bottom had
    </p>
    <p>
     caused the loose leather sheath to drop off; and from the keen
    </p>
    <p>
     steel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale, forked fire.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the silent harpoon burned there like a serpent's tongue,
    </p>
    <p>
     Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm--"God, God is against thee,
    </p>
    <p>
     old man; forbear! 't is an ill voyage! ill begun, ill continued;
    </p>
    <p>
     let me square the yards, while we may, old man, and make a fair
    </p>
    <p>
     wind of it homewards, to go on a better voyage than this."
    </p>
    <p>
     Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly
    </p>
    <p>
     ran to the braces--though not a sail was left aloft.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the moment all the aghast mate's thoughts seemed theirs;
    </p>
    <p>
     they raised a half mutinous cry.  But dashing the rattling
    </p>
    <p>
     lightning links to the deck, and snatching the burning harpoon,
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab waved it like a torch among them; swearing to transfix
    </p>
    <p>
     with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope's end.
    </p>
    <p>
     Petrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from
    </p>
    <p>
     the fiery dart that he held, the men fell back in dismay,
    </p>
    <p>
     and Ahab again spoke:--
    </p>
    <p>
     "All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine;
    </p>
    <p>
     and heart, soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound.
    </p>
    <p>
     And that ye may know to what tune this heart beats:  look ye here;
    </p>
    <p>
     thus I blow out the last fear!"  And with one blast of his breath
    </p>
    <p>
     he extinguished the flame.
    </p>
    <p>
     As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood
    </p>
    <p>
     of some lone, gigantic elm, whose very height and strength but render it
    </p>
    <p>
     so much the more unsafe, because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts;
    </p>
    <p>
     so at those last words of Ahab's many of the mariners did run from him
    </p>
    <p>
     in a terror of dismay.

     Stubb and Flask mounted on them, and passing additional lashings
    </p>
    <p>
     over the anchors there hanging.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, Stubb; you may pound that knot there as much as you please,
    </p>
    <p>
     but you will never pound into me what you were just now saying.
    </p>
    <p>
     And how long ago is it since you said the very contrary?
    </p>
    <p>
     Didn't you once say that whatever ship Ahab sails in,
    </p>
    <p>
     that ship should pay something extra on its insurance policy,
    </p>
    <p>
     just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft and boxes
    </p>
    <p>
     of lucifers forward?  Stop, now; didn't you say so?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, suppose I did?  What then!  I've part changed my flesh
    </p>
    <p>
     since that time, why not my mind?  Besides, supposing we
    </p>
    <p>
     are loaded with powder barrels aft and lucifers forward;
    </p>
    <p>
     how the devil could the lucifers get afire in this drenching
    </p>
    <p>
     spray here?  Why, my little man, you have pretty red hair,
    </p>
    <p>
     but you couldn't get afire now.  Shake yourself; you're Aquarius,
    </p>
    <p>
     or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill pitchers at your
    </p>
    <p>
     coat collar.  Don't you see, then, that for these extra
    </p>
    <p>
     risks the Marine Insurance companies have extra guarantees?
    </p>
    <p>
     Here are hydrants, Flask.  But hark, again, and I'll answer
    </p>
    <p>
     ye the other thing.  First take your leg off from the crown
    </p>
    <p>
     of the anchor here, though, so I can pass the rope; now listen.
    </p>
    <p>
     What's the mighty difference between holding a mast's
    </p>
    <p>
     lightning-rod in the storm, and standing close by a mast
    </p>
    <p>
     that hasn't got any lightning-rod at all in a storm?
    </p>
    <p>
     Don't you see, you timber-head, that no harm can come
    </p>
    <p>
     to the holder of the rod, unless the mast is first struck?
    </p>
    <p>
     What are you talking about, then?  Not one ship in a hundred
    </p>
    <p>
     carries rods, and Ahab,--aye, man, and all of us,--were in no
    </p>
    <p>
     more danger then, in my poor opinion, than all the crews in ten
    </p>
    <p>
     thousand ships now sailing the seas.  Why, you King-Post, you,
    </p>
    <p>
     I suppose you would have every man in the world go about with a small
    </p>
    <p>
     lightning-rod running up the corner of his hat, like a militia
    </p>
    <p>
     officer's skewered feather, and trailing behind like his sash.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why don't ye be sensible, Flask? it's easy to be sensible;
    </p>
    <p>
     why don't ye, then? any man with half an eye can be sensible."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't know that, Stubb.  You sometimes find it rather hard."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, when a fellow's soaked through, it's hard to be sensible,
    </p>
    <p>
     that's a fact.  And I am about drenched with this spray.  Never mind;
    </p>
    <p>
     catch the turn there, and pass it.  Seems to me we are lashing down
    </p>
    <p>
     these anchors now as if they were never going to be used again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tying these two anchors here, Flask, seems like tying a man's hands
    </p>
    <p>
     behind him.  And what big generous hands they are, to be sure.
    </p>
    <p>
     These are your iron fists, hey?  What a hold they have, too!
    </p>
    <p>
     I wonder, Flask, whether the world is anchored anywhere;
    </p>
    <p>
     if she is, she swings with an uncommon long cable, though.
    </p>
    <p>
     There, hammer that knot down, and we've done.  So; next to
    </p>
    <p>
     touching land, lighting on deck is the most satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
     I say, just wring out my jacket skirts, will ye?  Thank ye.
    </p>
    <p>
     They laugh at long-togs so, Flask; but seems to me,
    </p>
    <p>
     a long-tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat.
    </p>
    <p>
     The tails tapering down that way, serve to carry off the water,
    </p>
    <p>
     d'ye see.  Same with cocked hats; the cocks form gable-end
    </p>
    <p>
     eave-troughs, Flask.  No more monkey-jackets and tarpaulins for me;
    </p>
    <p>
     I must mount a swallow-tail, and drive down a beaver; so.
    </p>
    <p>
     Halloa! whew! there goes my tarpaulin overboard; Lord, Lord,
    </p>
    <p>
     that the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly!

     This is a nasty night, lad."

    <p>
     The Musket
    </p>
    <p>
     During the most violent shocks of the Typhoon, the man at the Pequod's
    </p>
    <p>
     jaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by its
    </p>
    <p>
     spasmodic motions even though preventer tackles had been attached to it--
    </p>
    <p>
     for they were slack--because some play to the tiller was indispensable.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed
    </p>
    <p>
     shuttlecock to the blast, it is by no means uncommon to see
    </p>
    <p>
     the needles in the compasses, at intervals, go round and round.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was thus with the Pequod's; at almost every shock the helmsman
    </p>
    <p>
     had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they
    </p>
    <p>
     revolved upon the cards; it is a sight that hardly anyone can
    </p>
    <p>
     behold without some sort of unwonted emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much,
    </p>
    <p>
     that through the strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb--
    </p>
    <p>
     one engaged forward and the other aft--the shivered remnants of
    </p>
    <p>
     the jib and fore and main-top-sails were cut adrift from the spars,
    </p>
    <p>
     and went eddying away to leeward, like the feathers of an albatross,
    </p>
    <p>
     which sometimes are cast to the winds when that storm-tossed bird
    </p>
    <p>
     is on the wing.
    </p>
    <p>
     The three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a storm-trysail was set further aft; so that the ship soon
    </p>
    <p>
     went through the water with some precision again; and the course--
    </p>
    <p>
     for the present, East-south-east--which he was to steer, if practicable,
    </p>
    <p>
     was once more given to the helmsman.  For during the violence
    </p>
    <p>
     of the gale, he had only steered according to its vicissitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
     But as he was now bringing the ship as near her course as possible,
    </p>
    <p>
     watching the compass meanwhile, lo! a good sign! the wind seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     coming round astern; aye, the foul breeze became fair!
    </p>
    <p>
     Instantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of "Ho!
    </p>
    <p>
     the fair wind! oh-ye-ho cheerly, men!" the crew singing for joy,
    </p>
    <p>
     that so promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil
    </p>
    <p>
     portents preceding it.
    </p>
    <p>
     In compliance with the standing order of his commander--
    </p>
    <p>
     to report immediately, and at any one of the twenty-four hours,
    </p>
    <p>
     any decided change in the affairs of the deck,--Starbuck had
    </p>
    <p>
     no sooner trimmed the yards to the breeze--however reluctantly
    </p>
    <p>
     and gloomily,--than he mechanically went below to apprise
    </p>
    <p>
     Captain Ahab of the circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ere knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused before it
    </p>
    <p>
     a moment.  The cabin lamp--taking long swings this way and that--
    </p>
    <p>
     was burning fitfully, and casting fitful shadows upon the old
    </p>
    <p>
     man's bolted door,--a thin one, with fixed blinds inserted,
    </p>
    <p>
     in place of upper panels.  The isolated subterraneousness
    </p>
    <p>
     of the cabin made a certain humming silence to reign there,
    </p>
    <p>
     though it was hooped round by all the roar of the elements.
    </p>
    <p>
     The loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed,
    </p>
    <p>
     as they stood upright against the forward bulkhead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Starbuck was an honest, upright man; but out of Starbuck's heart,
    </p>
    <p>
     at that instant when he saw the muskets, there strangely
    </p>
    <p>
     evolved an evil thought; but so blent with its neutral or good
    </p>
    <p>
     accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     "He would have shot me once," he murmured, "yes, there's the very
    </p>
    <p>
     musket that he pointed at me;--that one with the studded stock;
    </p>
    <p>
     let me touch it--lift it.  Strange, that I, who have
    </p>
    <p>
     handled so many deadly lances, strange, that I should shake
    </p>
    <p>
     so now.  Loaded?  I must see.  Aye, aye; and powder in the pan;--
    </p>
    <p>
     that's not good.  Best spill it?--wait.  I'll cure myself of this.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll hold the musket boldly while I think.--I come to report
    </p>
    <p>
     a fair wind to him.  But how fair?  Fair for death and doom,--
    </p>
    <p>
     that's fair for Moby Dick.  It's a fair wind that's only fair for
    </p>
    <p>
     that accursed fish.--The very tube he pointed at me!--the very one;
    </p>
    <p>
     this one--I hold it here; he would have killed me with the very
    </p>
    <p>
     thing I handle now.--Aye and he would fain kill all his crew.
    </p>
    <p>
     Does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale?
    </p>
    <p>
     Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant? and in these same
    </p>
    <p>
     perilous seas, gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning
    </p>
    <p>
     of the error-abounding log? and in this very Typhoon, did he not
    </p>
    <p>
     swear that he would have no lightning-rods? But shall this crazed
    </p>
    <p>
     old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship's company down
    </p>
    <p>
     to doom with him?--Yes, it would make him the wilful murderer
    </p>
    <p>
     of thirty men and more, if this ship come to any deadly harm;
    </p>
    <p>
     and come to deadly harm, my soul swears this ship will,
    </p>
    <p>
     if Ahab have his way.  If, then, he were this instant--
    </p>
    <p>
     put aside, that crime would not be his.  Ha! is he muttering
    </p>
    <p>
     in his sleep?  Yes, just there,--in there, he's sleeping.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sleeping? aye, but still alive, and soon awake again.
    </p>
    <p>
     I can't withstand thee, then, old man.  Not reasoning;
    </p>
    <p>
     not remonstrance; not entreaty wilt thou hearken to;
    </p>
    <p>
     all this thou scornest.  Flat obedience to thy own flat commands,
    </p>
    <p>
     this is all thou breathest.  Aye, and say'st the men have vow'd
    </p>
    <p>
     thy vow; say'st all of us are Ahabs.  Great God forbid!--
    </p>
    <p>
     But is there no other way? no lawful way?--Make him a prisoner
    </p>
    <p>
     to be taken home?  What! hope to wrest this old man's living
    </p>
    <p>
     power from his own living hands?  Only a fool would try it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Say he were pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes
    </p>
    <p>
     and hawsers; chained down to ring-bolts on this cabin floor;
    </p>
    <p>
     he would be more hideous than a caged tiger, then.  I could
    </p>
    <p>
     not endure the sight; could not possibly fly his howlings;
    </p>
    <p>
     all comfort, sleep itself, inestimable reason would leave me
    </p>
    <p>
     on the long intolerable voyage.  What, then, remains?  The land
    </p>
    <p>
     is hundreds of leagues away, and locked Japan the nearest.
    </p>
    <p>
     I stand alone here upon an open sea, with two oceans and a
    </p>
    <p>
     whole continent between me and law.--Aye, aye, 'tis so.--
    </p>
    <p>
     Is heaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a would-be
    </p>
    <p>
     murderer in his bed, tindering sheets and skin together?--
    </p>
    <p>
     And would I be a murderer, then, if"--and slowly, stealthily,
    </p>
    <p>
     and half sideways looking, he placed the loaded musket's end
    </p>
    <p>
     against the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     "On this level, Ahab's hammock swings within; his head this way.
    </p>
    <p>
     A touch, and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again.--
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh Mary!  Mary!--boy! boy! boy!--But if I wake thee not to death,
    </p>
    <p>
     old man, who can tell to what unsounded deeps Starbuck's body this day
    </p>
    <p>
     week may sink, with all the crew!  Great God, where art Thou?  Shall I?
    </p>
    <p>
     shall I?--The wind has gone down and shifted, sir; the fore and main
    </p>
    <p>
     topsails are reefed and set! she heads her course."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Stern all!  Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man's
    </p>
    <p>
     tormented sleep, as if Starbuck's voice had caused the long dumb
    </p>
    <p>
     dream to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
     The yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard's arm against the panel;
    </p>
    <p>
     Starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel, but turning from the door,
    </p>
    <p>
     he placed the death-tube in its rack, and left the place.
    </p>
    <p>
     "He's too sound asleep, Mr. Stubb; go thou down, and wake him,
    </p>
    <p>
     and tell him.  I must see to the deck here.  Thou know'st
    </p>
    <p>
     what to say."

     CHAPTER 124
    </head>
    <p>
     The Needle
    </p>
    <p>
     Next morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow
    </p>
    <p>
     billows of mighty bulk, and striving in the Pequod's
    </p>
    <p>
     gurgling track, pushed her on like giants' palms outspread.
    </p>
    <p>
     The strong unstaggering breeze abounded so, that sky and air
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed vast outbellying sails; the whole world boomed before
    </p>
    <p>
     the wind.  Muffled in the full morning light, the invisible
    </p>
    <p>
     sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place;
    </p>
    <p>
     where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks.  Emblazonings, as of
    </p>
    <p>
     crowned Babylonian kings and queens, reigned over everything.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sea was as a crucible of molten gold, that bubblingly leaps
    </p>
    <p>
     with light and heat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Long maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every
    </p>
    <p>
     time the teetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit,
    </p>
    <p>
     he turned to eye the bright sun's rays produced ahead;
    </p>
    <p>
     and when she profoundly settled by the stern, he turned behind,
    </p>
    <p>
     and saw the sun's rearward place, and how the same yellow rays
    </p>
    <p>
     were blending with his undeviating wake.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot of
    </p>
    <p>
     the sun.  Ho, ho! all ye nations before my prow, I bring the sun to ye!
    </p>
    <p>
     Yoke on the further billows; hallo! a tandem, I drive the sea!"
    </p>
    <p>
     But suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hurried towards
    </p>
    <p>
     the helm, huskily demanding how the ship was heading.
    </p>
    <p>
     "East-sou-east, sir," said the frightened steersman.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thou liest!" smiting him with his clenched fist.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Heading East at this hour in the morning, and the sun astern?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just
    </p>
    <p>
     then observed by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else;
    </p>
    <p>
     but its very blinding palpableness must have been the cause.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thrusting his head half-way into the binnacle, Ahab caught
    </p>
    <p>
     one glimpse of the compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell;
    </p>
    <p>
     for a moment he almost seemed to stagger.  Standing behind
    </p>
    <p>
     him Starbuck looked, and lo! the two compasses pointed East,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the Pequod was as infallibly going West.
    </p>
    <p>
     But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the old
    </p>
    <p>
     man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, "I have it!  It has happened before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Starbuck, last night's thunder turned our compasses--that's all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thou hast before now heard of such a thing, I take it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye; but never before has it happened to me, sir," said the
    </p>
    <p>
     pale mate, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have
    </p>
    <p>
     in more than one case occurred to ships in violent storms.
    </p>
    <p>
     The magnetic energy, as developed in the mariner's needle, is,
    </p>
    <p>
     as all know, essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven;
    </p>
    <p>
     hence it is not to be much marvelled at, that such things should be.
    </p>
    <p>
     In instances where the lightning has actually struck the vessel,
    </p>
    <p>
     so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging, the effect upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the needle has at times been still more fatal; all its loadstone
    </p>
    <p>
     virtue being annihilated, so that the before magnetic steel was of no
    </p>
    <p>
     more use than an old wife's knitting needle.  But in either case,
    </p>
    <p>
     the needle never again, of itself, recovers the original virtue
    </p>
    <p>
     thus marred or lost; and if the binnacle compasses be affected,
    </p>
    <p>
     the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship;
    </p>
    <p>
     even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson.
    </p>
    <p>
     Deliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing
    </p>
    <p>
     the transpointed compasses, the old man, with the sharp
    </p>
    <p>
     of his extended hand, now took the precise bearing of the sun,
    </p>
    <p>
     and satisfied that the needles were exactly inverted, shouted out
    </p>
    <p>
     his orders for the ship's course to be changed accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     The yards were hard up; and once more the Pequod thrust her
    </p>
    <p>
     undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair
    </p>
    <p>
     one had only been juggling her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck
    </p>
    <p>
     said nothing, but quietly he issued all requisite orders;
    </p>
    <p>
     while Stubb and Flask--who in some small degree seemed then
    </p>
    <p>
     to be sharing his feelings--likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced.
    </p>
    <p>
     As for the men, though some of them lowly rumbled, their fear
    </p>
    <p>
     of Ahab was greater than their fear of Fate.  But as ever before,
    </p>
    <p>
     the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed;
    </p>
    <p>
     or if impressed, it was only with a certain magnetism shot
    </p>
    <p>
     into their congenial hearts from inflexible Ahab's.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries.
    </p>
    <p>
     But chancing to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed
    </p>
    <p>
     copper sight-tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed
    </p>
    <p>
     to the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun's pilot! yesterday I
    </p>
    <p>
     wrecked thee, and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, so.  But Ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Starbuck--a lance without the pole; a top-maul, and the smallest
    </p>
    <p>
     of the sail-maker's needles.  Quick!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Accessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about
    </p>
    <p>
     to do, were certain prudential motives, whose object might have been
    </p>
    <p>
     to revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill,
    </p>
    <p>
     in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses.
    </p>
    <p>
     Besides, the old man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles,
    </p>
    <p>
     though clumsily practicable, was not a thing to be passed over by
    </p>
    <p>
     superstitious sailors, without some shudderings and evil portents.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Men," said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate
    </p>
    <p>
     handed him the things he had demanded, "my men, the thunder
    </p>
    <p>
     turned old Ahab's needles; but out of this bit of steel Ahab
    </p>
    <p>
     can make one of his own, that will point as true as any."
    </p>
    <p>
     Abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors,
    </p>
    <p>
     as this was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever
    </p>
    <p>
     magic might follow.  But Starbuck looked away.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of
    </p>
    <p>
     the lance, and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining,
    </p>
    <p>
     bade him hold it upright, without its touching the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, with the maul, after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this
    </p>
    <p>
     iron rod, he placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it,
    </p>
    <p>
     and less strongly hammered that, several times, the mate still holding
    </p>
    <p>
     the rod as before.  Then going through some small strange motions
    </p>
    <p>
     with it--whether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel,
    </p>
    <p>
     or merely intended to augment the awe of the crew, is uncertain--
    </p>
    <p>
     he called for linen thread; and moving to the binnacle, slipped out
    </p>
    <p>
     the two reversed needles there, and horizontally suspended the
    </p>
    <p>
     sail-needle by its middle, over one of the compass cards.  At first,
    </p>
    <p>
     the steel went round and round, quivering and vibrating at either end;
    </p>
    <p>
     but at last it settled to its place, when Ahab, who had been intently
    </p>
    <p>
     watching for this result, stepped frankly back from the binnacle,
    </p>
    <p>
     and pointing his stretched arm towards it, exclaimed,--"Look ye,
    </p>
    <p>
     for yourselves, if Ahab be not the lord of the level loadstone!
    </p>
    <p>
     The sun is East, and that compass swears it!"
    </p>
    <p>
     One after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes
    </p>
    <p>
     could persuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another
    </p>
    <p>
     they slunk away.
    </p>
    <p>
     In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab
    </p>
    <p>
     in all his fatal pride.

     CHAPTER 125

    <p>
     The Log and Line
    </p>
    <p>
     While now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage,
    </p>
    <p>
     the log and line had but very seldom been in use.
    </p>
    <p>
     Owing to a confident reliance upon other means of determining
    </p>
    <p>
     the vessel's place, some merchantmen, and many whalemen,
    </p>
    <p>
     especially when cruising, wholly neglect to heave the log;
    </p>
    <p>
     though at the same time, and frequently more for form's sake
    </p>
    <p>
     than anything else, regularly putting down upon the customary
    </p>
    <p>
     slate the course steered by the ship, as well as the presumed
    </p>
    <p>
     average rate of progression every hour.  It had been thus
    </p>
    <p>
     with the Pequod.  The wooden reel and angular log attached hung,
    </p>
    <p>
     long untouched, just beneath the railing of the after bulwarks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rains and spray had damped it; the sun and wind had warped it;
    </p>
    <p>
     all the elements had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly.
    </p>
    <p>
     But heedless of all this, his mood seized Ahab, as he happened
    </p>
    <p>
     to glance upon the reel, not many hours after the magnet scene,
    </p>
    <p>
     and he remembered how his quadrant was no more, and recalled
    </p>
    <p>
     his frantic oath about the level log and line.  The ship was
    </p>
    <p>
     sailing plungingly; astern the billows rolled in riots.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Forward, there!  Heave the log!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Two seamen came.  The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Take the reel, one of ye, I'll heave."
    </p>
    <p>
     They went towards the extreme stern, on the ship's lee side,
    </p>
    <p>
     where the deck, with the oblique energy of the wind, was now
    </p>
    <p>
     almost dipping into the creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting
    </p>
    <p>
     handle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line revolved,
    </p>
    <p>
     so stood with the angular log hanging downwards, till Ahab
    </p>
    <p>
     advanced to him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty
    </p>
    <p>
     or forty turns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard,
    </p>
    <p>
     when the old Manxman, who was intently eyeing both him and the line,
    </p>
    <p>
     made bold to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sir, I mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet
    </p>
    <p>
     have spoiled it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Twill hold, old gentleman.  Long heat and wet, have they spoiled thee?
    </p>
    <p>
     Thou seem'st to hold.  Or, truer perhaps, life holds thee; not thou it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I hold the spool, sir.  But just as my captain says.
    </p>
    <p>
     With these grey hairs of mine 'tis not worth while disputing,
    </p>
    <p>
     'specially with a superior, who'll ne'er confess."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What's that?  There now's a patched professor in Queen Nature's
    </p>
    <p>
     granite-founded College; but methinks he's too subservient.
    </p>
    <p>
     Where wert thou born?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "In the little rocky Isle of Man, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Excellent!  Thou'st hit the world by that."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know not, sir, but I was born there."
    </p>
    <p>
     "In the Isle of Man, hey?  Well, the other way, it's good.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here's a man from Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now
    </p>
    <p>
     unmanned of Man; which is sucked in--by what?  Up with the reel!
    </p>
    <p>
     The dead, blind wall butts all inquiring heads at last.
    </p>
    <p>
     Up with it!  So."
    </p>
    <p>
     The log was heaved.  The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long
    </p>
    <p>
     dragging line astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to whirl.
    </p>
    <p>
     In turn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows, the towing
    </p>
    <p>
     resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hold hard!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Snap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon;
    </p>
    <p>
     the tugging log was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles,
    </p>
    <p>
     and now the mad sea parts the log-line. But Ahab can mend all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Haul in here, Tahitian; reel up, Manxman.  And look ye,
    </p>
    <p>
     let the carpenter make another log, and mend thou the line.
    </p>
    <p>
     See to it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "There he goes now; to him nothing's happened; but to me,
    </p>
    <p>
     the skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     Haul in, haul in, Tahitian!  These lines run whole, and whirling out:
    </p>
    <p>
     come in broken, and dragging slow.  Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Pip? whom call ye Pip?  Pip jumped from the whaleboat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pip's missing.  Let's see now if ye haven't fished him
    </p>
    <p>
     up here, fisherman.  It drags hard; I guess he's holding on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jerk him, Tahiti!  Jerk him off we haul in no cowards here.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ho! there's his arm just breaking water.  A hatchet! a hatchet!
    </p>
    <p>
     cut it off--we haul in no cowards here.  Captain Ahab! sir,
    </p>
    <p>
     sir! here's Pip, trying to get on board again."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Peace, thou crazy loon," cried the Manxman, seizing him by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Away from the quarter-deck!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser," muttered Ahab, advancing.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hands off from that holiness!  Where sayest thou Pip was, boy?
    </p>
    <p>
     "Astern there, sir, astern!  Lo! lo!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "And who art thou, boy?  I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils
    </p>
    <p>
     of thy eyes.  Oh God! that man should be a thing for immortal souls
    </p>
    <p>
     to sieve through!  Who art thou, boy?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bell-boy, sir; ship's-crier; ding, dong, ding!  Pip!  Pip!  Pip!  One
    </p>
    <p>
     hundred pounds of clay reward for Pip; five feet high--looks cowardly--
    </p>
    <p>
     quickest known by that!  Ding, dong, ding!  Who's seen Pip the coward?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "There can be no hearts above the snow-line. Oh, ye frozen
    </p>
    <p>
     heavens! look down here.  Ye did beget this luckless child,
    </p>
    <p>
     and have abandoned him, ye creative libertines.  Here, boy;
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab's cabin shall be Pip's home henceforth, while Ahab lives.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thou touchest my inmost centre, boy; thou art tied to me by cords
    </p>
    <p>
     woven of my heart-strings. Come, let's down."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What's this? here's velvet shark-skin," intently gazing at Ahab's hand,
    </p>
    <p>
     and feeling it.  "Ah, now, had poor Pip but felt so kind a thing as this,
    </p>
    <p>
     perhaps he had ne'er been lost!  This seems to me, sir, as a man-rope;
    </p>
    <p>
     something that weak souls may hold by.  Oh, sir, let old Perth now come
    </p>
    <p>
     and rivet these two hands together; the black one with the white,
    </p>
    <p>
     for I will not let this go."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, boy, nor will I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee
    </p>
    <p>
     to worse horrors than are here.  Come, then, to my cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lo! ye believers in gods all goodness, and in man all ill,
    </p>
    <p>
     lo you! see the omniscient gods oblivious of suffering man;
    </p>
    <p>
     and man, though idiotic, and knowing not what he does, yet full
    </p>
    <p>
     of the sweet things of love and gratitude.  Come!  I feel prouder
    </p>
    <p>
     leading thee by thy black hand, than though I grasped an Emperor's!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "There go two daft ones now," muttered the old Manxman.
    </p>
    <p>
     "One daft with strength, the other daft with weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
     But here's the end of the rotten line--all dripping, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mend it, eh?  I think we had best have a new line altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll see Mr. Stubb about it."

     CHAPTER 126
    </head>
    <p>
     The Life-Buoy
    </p>
    <p>
     Steering now south-eastward by Ahab's levelled steel,
    </p>
    <p>
     and her progress solely determined by Ahab's level log and line;
    </p>
    <p>
     the Pequod held on her path towards the Equator.  Making so long
    </p>
    <p>
     a passage through such unfrequented waters, descrying no ships,
    </p>
    <p>
     and ere long, sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds,
    </p>
    <p>
     over waves monotonously mild; all these seemed the strange calm
    </p>
    <p>
     things preluding some riotous and desperate scene.
    </p>
    <p>
     At last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were,
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Equatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that
    </p>
    <p>
     goes before the dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets;
    </p>
    <p>
     the watch--then headed by Flask--was startled by a cry so plaintively
    </p>
    <p>
     wild and unearthly--like half-articulated wailings of the ghosts
    </p>
    <p>
     of all Herod's murdered Innocents--that one and all, they started
    </p>
    <p>
     from their reveries, and for the space of some moments stood,
    </p>
    <p>
     or sat, or leaned all transfixed by listening, like the carved
    </p>
    <p>
     Roman slave, while that wild cry remained within hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Christian or civilized part of the crew said it was mermaids,
    </p>
    <p>
     and shuddered; but the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet the grey Manxman--the oldest mariner of all--declared that
    </p>
    <p>
     the wild thrilling sounds that were heard, were the voices of newly
    </p>
    <p>
     drowned men in the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Below in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn,
    </p>
    <p>
     when he came to the deck; it was then recounted to him by Flask,
    </p>
    <p>
     not unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings.  He hollowly laughed,
    </p>
    <p>
     and thus explained the wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers
    </p>
    <p>
     of seals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or some dams
    </p>
    <p>
     that had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and kept
    </p>
    <p>
     company with her, crying and sobbing with their human sort of wail.
    </p>
    <p>
     But this only the more affected some of them, because most mariners
    </p>
    <p>
     cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals, arising not only from
    </p>
    <p>
     their peculiar tones when in distress, but also from the human look
    </p>
    <p>
     of their round heads and semi-intelligent faces, seen peeringly uprising
    </p>
    <p>
     from the water alongside.  In the sea, under certain circumstances,
    </p>
    <p>
     seals have more than once been mistaken for men.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible
    </p>
    <p>
     confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     At sun-rise this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore;
    </p>
    <p>
     and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep
    </p>
    <p>
     (for sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state), whether it
    </p>
    <p>
     was thus with the man, there is now no telling; but, be that as it may,
    </p>
    <p>
     he had not been long at his perch, when a cry was heard--a cry
    </p>
    <p>
     and a rushing--and looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air;
    </p>
    <p>
     and looking down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue
    </p>
    <p>
     of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     The life-buoy--a long slender cask--was dropped from the stern, where it
    </p>
    <p>
     always hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to seize it,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken, so that it
    </p>
    <p>
     slowly filled, and the parched wood also filled at its every pore;
    </p>
    <p>
     and the studded iron-bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom,
    </p>
    <p>
     as if to yield him his pillow, though in sooth but a hard one.
    </p>
    <p>
     And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast
    </p>
    <p>
     to look out for the White Whale, on the White Whale's own
    </p>
    <p>
     peculiar ground; that man was swallowed up in the deep.
    </p>
    <p>
     But few, perhaps, thought of that at the time.  Indeed, in some sort,
    </p>
    <p>
     they were not grieved at this event, at least as a portent;
    </p>
    <p>
     for they regarded it, not as a fore-shadowing of evil in
    </p>
    <p>
     the future, but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged.
    </p>
    <p>
     They declared that now they knew the reason of those wild
    </p>
    <p>
     shrieks they had heard the night before.  But again the old
    </p>
    <p>
     Manxman said nay.
    </p>
    <p>
     The lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed
    </p>
    <p>
     to see to it; but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found,
    </p>
    <p>
     and as in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis
    </p>
    <p>
     of the voyage, all hands were impatient of any toil but what was
    </p>
    <p>
     directly connected with its final end, whatever that might prove
    </p>
    <p>
     to be; therefore, they were going to leave the ship's stern unprovided
    </p>
    <p>
     with a buoy, when by certain strange signs and inuendoes Queequeg
    </p>
    <p>
     hinted a hint concerning his coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
     "A life-buoy of a coffin!" cried Starbuck, starting.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rather queer, that, I should say," said Stubb.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It will make a good enough one," said Flask, "the carpenter here can
    </p>
    <p>
     arrange it easily."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bring it up; there's nothing else for it," said Starbuck,
    </p>
    <p>
     after a melancholy pause.  "Rig it, carpenter; do not look at me so--
    </p>
    <p>
     the coffin, I mean.  Dost thou hear me?  Rig it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And shall I nail down the lid, sir?" moving his hand as with a hammer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And shall I caulk the seams, sir?" moving his hand as
    </p>
    <p>
     with a caulking-iron.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir?" moving his hand
    </p>
    <p>
     as with a pitch-pot.
    </p>
    <p>
     Away!  What possesses thee to this?  Make a life-buoy of the coffin,
    </p>
    <p>
     and no more.--Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward with me."
    </p>
    <p>
     "He goes off in a huff.  The whole he can endure; at the parts
    </p>
    <p>
     he baulks.  Now I don't like this.  I make a leg for Captain Ahab,
    </p>
    <p>
     and he wears it like a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg,
    </p>
    <p>
     and he won't put his head into it.  Are all my pains to go for nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     with that coffin?  And now I'm ordered to make a life-buoy of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's like turning an old coat; going to bring the flesh on
    </p>
    <p>
     the other side now.  I don't like this cobbling sort of business--
    </p>
    <p>
     I don't like it at all; it's undignified; it's not my place.
    </p>
    <p>
     Let tinkers' brats do tinkerings; we are their betters.  I like to take
    </p>
    <p>
     in hand none but clean, virgin, fair-and-square mathematical jobs,
    </p>
    <p>
     something that regularly begins at the beginning, and is at the middle
    </p>
    <p>
     when midway, and comes to an end at the conclusion; not a cobbler's job,
    </p>
    <p>
     that's at an end in the middle, and at the beginning at the end.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's the old woman's tricks to be giving cobbling jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lord! what an affection all old women have for tinkers.  I know an old
    </p>
    <p>
     woman of sixty-five who ran away with a bald-headed young tinker once.
    </p>
    <p>
     And that's the reason I never would work for lonely widow old
    </p>
    <p>
     women ashore when I kept my job-shop in the Vineyard; they might
    </p>
    <p>
     have taken it into their lonely old heads to run off with me.
    </p>
    <p>
     But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps. Let me see.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay over the same with pitch;
    </p>
    <p>
     batten them down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over
    </p>
    <p>
     the ship's stern.  Were ever such things done before with a coffin?
    </p>
    <p>
     Some superstitious old carpenters, now, would be tied up in the rigging,
    </p>
    <p>
     ere they would do the job.  But I'm made of knotty Aroostook hemlock;
    </p>
    <p>
     I don't budge.  Cruppered with a coffin!  Sailing about with
    </p>
    <p>
     a grave-yard tray!  But never mind.  We workers in woods make
    </p>
    <p>
     bridal bedsteads and card-tables, as well as coffins and hearses.
    </p>
    <p>
     We work by the month, or by the job, or by the profit; not for us to ask
    </p>
    <p>
     the why and wherefore of our work, unless it be too confounded cobbling,
    </p>
    <p>
     and then we stash it if we can.  Hem!  I'll do the job, now, tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll have me--let's see--how many in the ship's company, all told?
    </p>
    <p>
     But I've forgotten.  Any way, I'll have me thirty separate, Turk's-headed
    </p>
    <p>
     life-lines, each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, if the hull go down, there'll be thirty lively fellows all
    </p>
    <p>
     fighting for one coffin, a sight not seen very often beneath the sun!
    </p>
    <p>
     Come hammer, caulking-iron, pitch-pot, and marling-spike! Let's to it."

     from thy shop?"
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
     "Then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling,

    <p>
     monopolizing, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs,

    <p>
     the craters for volcanoes; and the grave-digger in the play sings,
    </p>
    <p>
     spade in hand.  Dost thou never?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sing, sir?  Do I sing?  Oh, I'm indifferent enough, sir, for that;
    </p>
    <p>
     but the reason why the grave-digger made music must have been because
    </p>
    <p>
     there was none in his spade, sir.  But the caulking mallet is full of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hark to it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, and that's because the lid there's a sounding-board;
    </p>
    <p>
     and what in all things makes the sounding-board is this--
    </p>
    <p>
     there's naught beneath.  And yet, a coffin with a body in it rings
    </p>
    <p>
     pretty much the same, Carpenter.  Hast thou ever helped carry a bier,
    </p>
    <p>
     and heard the coffin knock against the churchyard gate, going in?
    </p>
    <p>
     "Faith, sir, I've-"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Faith?  What's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, faith, sir, it's only a sort of exclamation-like--
    </p>
    <p>
     that's all, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Um, um; go on."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I was about to say, sir, that-"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Art thou a silk-worm? Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself?
    </p>
    <p>
     Look at thy bosom!  Despatch! and get these traps out of sight."
    </p>
    <p>
     "He goes aft.  That was sudden, now; but squalls come sudden
    </p>
    <p>
     in hot latitudes.  I've heard that the Isle of Albermarle,
    </p>
    <p>
     one of the Gallipagos, is cut by the Equator right in the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seems to me some sort of Equator cuts yon old man, too, right in
    </p>
    <p>
     his middle.  He's always under the Line--fiery hot, I tell ye!
    </p>
    <p>
     He's looking this way--come, oakum; quick.  Here we go again.
    </p>
    <p>
     This wooden mallet is the cork, and I'm the professor of
    </p>
    <p>
     musical glasses--tap, tap!"
    </p>
    <p>
     (Ahab to himself)
    </p>
    <p>
     "There's a sight!  There's a sound!  The greyheaded wood-pecker
    </p>
    <p>
     tapping the hollow tree!  Blind and dumb might well be envied now.
    </p>
    <p>
     See! that thing rests on two line-tubs, full of tow-lines.
    </p>
    <p>
     A most malicious wag, that fellow.  Rat-tat! So man's
    </p>
    <p>
     seconds tick!  Oh! how immaterial are all materials!
    </p>
    <p>
     What things real are there, but imponderable thoughts?
    </p>
    <p>
     Here now's the very dreaded symbol of grim death, by a mere hap,
    </p>
    <p>
     made the expressive sign of the help and hope of most
    </p>
    <p>
     endangered life.  A life-buoy of a coffin!  Does it go further?
    </p>
    <p>
     Can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is, after all,
    </p>
    <p>
     but an immortality-preserver! I'll think of that.  But no.
    </p>
    <p>
     So far gone am I in the dark side of earth, that its other side,
    </p>
    <p>
     the theoretic bright one, seems but uncertain twilight to me.
    </p>
    <p>
     Will ye never have done, Carpenter, with that accursed sound?
    </p>
    <p>
     I go below; let me not see that thing here when I return again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, then, Pip, we'll talk this over; I do suck most wondrous
    </p>
    <p>
     philosophies from thee!  Some unknown conduits from the unknown
    </p>
    <p>
     worlds must empty into thee!"

     CHAPTER 128
    </head>
    <p>
     The Pequod Meets The Rachel
    </p>
    <p>
     Next day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing directly
    </p>
    <p>
     down upon the Pequod, all her spars thickly clustering with men.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the time the Pequod was making good speed through the water;
    </p>
    <p>
     but as the broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her,
    </p>
    <p>
     the boastful sails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst,
    </p>
    <p>
     and all life fled from the smitten hull.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bad news; she brings bad news," muttered the old Manxman.  But ere
    </p>
    <p>
     her commander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat;
    </p>
    <p>
     ere he could hopefully hail, Ahab's voice was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hast seen the White Whale?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, yesterday.  Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Throttling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question;
    </p>
    <p>
     and would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the stranger
    </p>
    <p>
     captain himself, having stopped his vessel's way, was seen
    </p>
    <p>
     descending her side.  A few keen pulls, and his boat-hook soon
    </p>
    <p>
     clinched the Pequod's main-chains, and he sprang to the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately he was recognized by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
     But no formal salutation was exchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where was he?--not killed!--not killed!" cried Ahab, closely advancing.
    </p>
    <p>
     "How was it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous,
    </p>
    <p>
     while three of the stranger's boats were engaged with a shoal
    </p>
    <p>
     of whales, which had led them some four or five miles from the ship;
    </p>
    <p>
     and while they were yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump
    </p>
    <p>
     and head of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the blue water,
    </p>
    <p>
     not very far to leeward; whereupon, the fourth rigged boat--
    </p>
    <p>
     a reserved one--had been instantly lowered in chase.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a keen sail before the wind, this fourth boat--the swiftest
    </p>
    <p>
     keeled of all--seemed to have succeeded in fastening--at least,
    </p>
    <p>
     as well as the man at the mast-head could tell anything about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat; and then a swift
    </p>
    <p>
     gleam of bubbling white water; and after that nothing more;
    </p>
    <p>
     whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have
    </p>
    <p>
     indefinitely run away with his pursuers, as often happens.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was some apprehension, but no positive alarm, as yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     The recall signals were placed in the rigging; darkness came on;
    </p>
    <p>
     and forced to pick up her three far to windward boats--ere going
    </p>
    <p>
     in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction--
    </p>
    <p>
     the ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat
    </p>
    <p>
     to its fate till near midnight, but, for the time, to increase
    </p>
    <p>
     her distance from it.  But the rest of her crew being at last
    </p>
    <p>
     safe aboard, she crowded all sail--stunsail on stunsail--
    </p>
    <p>
     after the missing boat; kindling a fire in her try-pots for a beacon;
    </p>
    <p>
     and every other man aloft on the look-out. But though when she
    </p>
    <p>
     had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place
    </p>
    <p>
     of the absent ones when last seen; though she then paused to lower
    </p>
    <p>
     her spare boats to pull all around her; and not finding anything,
    </p>
    <p>
     had again dashed on; again paused, and lowered her boats;
    </p>
    <p>
     and though she had thus continued doing till daylight;
    </p>
    <p>
     yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen.
    </p>
    <p>
     The story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal
    </p>
    <p>
     his object in boarding the Pequod.  He desired that ship to unite
    </p>
    <p>
     with his own in the search; by sailing over the sea some four or five
    </p>
    <p>
     miles apart, on parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon,
    </p>
    <p>
     as it were.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will wager something now," whispered Stubb to Flask, "that some one
    </p>
    <p>
     in that missing boat wore off that Captain's best coat; mayhap, his watch--
    </p>
    <p>
     he's so cursed anxious to get it back.  Who ever heard of two pious
    </p>
    <p>
     whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-boat in the height
    </p>
    <p>
     of the whaling season?  See, Flask, only see how pale he looks--
    </p>
    <p>
     pale in the very buttons of his eyes--look--it wasn't the coat--
    </p>
    <p>
     it must have been the-"
    </p>
    <p>
     "My boy, my own boy is among them.  For God's sake--I beg, I conjure"--
    </p>
    <p>
     here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far had but
    </p>
    <p>
     icily received his petition.  "For eight-and-forty hours let me
    </p>
    <p>
     charter your ship--I will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for it--
    </p>
    <p>
     if there be no other way--for eight-and-forty hours only--only that--
    </p>
    <p>
     you must, oh, you must, and you shall do this thing."
    </p>
    <p>
     "His son!" cried Stubb, "oh, it's his son he's lost!
    </p>
    <p>
     I take back the coat and watch--what says Ahab?  We must
    </p>
    <p>
     save that boy."
    </p>
    <p>
     "He's drowned with the rest on 'em, last night," said the old Manx
    </p>
    <p>
     sailor standing behind them; "I heard; all of ye heard their spirits."
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the Rachel's
    </p>
    <p>
     the more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was one
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Captain's sons among the number of the missing boat's crew;
    </p>
    <p>
     but among the number of the other boats' crews, at the same time,
    </p>
    <p>
     but on the other hand, separated from the ship during the dark
    </p>
    <p>
     vicissitudes of the chase, there had been still another son;
    </p>
    <p>
     as that for a time, the wretched father was plunged to the bottom
    </p>
    <p>
     of the cruellest perplexity; which was only solved for him
    </p>
    <p>
     by his chief mate's instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure
    </p>
    <p>
     of a whaleship in such emergencies, that is, when placed between
    </p>
    <p>
     jeopardized but divided boats, always to pick up the majority first.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the captain, for some unknown constitutional reason,
    </p>
    <p>
     had refrained from mentioning all this, and not till forced to it
    </p>
    <p>
     by Ahab's iciness did he allude to his one yet missing boy;
    </p>
    <p>
     a little lad, but twelve years old, whose father with the earnest
    </p>
    <p>
     but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer's paternal love,
    </p>
    <p>
     had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders
    </p>
    <p>
     of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor does it unfrequently occur, that Nantucket captains will
    </p>
    <p>
     send a son of such tender age away from them, for a protracted
    </p>
    <p>
     three or four years' voyage in some other ship than their own;
    </p>
    <p>
     so that their first knowledge of a whaleman's career shall
    </p>
    <p>
     be unenervated by any chance display of a father's natural
    </p>
    <p>
     but untimely partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and concern.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of Ahab;
    </p>
    <p>
     and Ahab still stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but without
    </p>
    <p>
     the least quivering of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will not go," said the stranger, "till you say aye to me.
    </p>
    <p>
     Do to me as you would have me do to you in the like case.
    </p>
    <p>
     For you too have a boy, Captain Ahab--though but a child,
    </p>
    <p>
     and nestling safely at home now--a child of your old age too--
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, yes, you relent; I see it--run, run, men, now, and stand
    </p>
    <p>
     by to square in the yards."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Avast," cried Ahab--"touch not a rope-yarn"; then in a voice that
    </p>
    <p>
     prolongingly moulded every word--"Captain Gardiner, I will not do it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even now I lose time, Good-bye, good-bye. God bless ye, man, and may I
    </p>
    <p>
     forgive myself, but I must go.  Mr. Starbuck, look at the binnacle watch,
    </p>
    <p>
     and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers;
    </p>
    <p>
     then brace forward again, and let the ship sail as before."
    </p>
    <p>
     Hurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into
    </p>
    <p>
     his cabin, leaving the strange captain transfixed at this
    </p>
    <p>
     unconditional and utter rejection of his so earnest suit.
    </p>
    <p>
     But starting from his enchantment, Gardiner silently hurried
    </p>
    <p>
     to the side; more fell than stepped into his boat, and returned
    </p>
    <p>
     to his ship.
    </p>
    <p>
     Soon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange
    </p>
    <p>
     vessel was in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every
    </p>
    <p>
     dark spot, however small, on the sea.  This way and that her yards
    </p>
    <p>
     were swung around; starboard and larboard, she continued to tack;
    </p>
    <p>
     now she beat against a head sea; and again it pushed her before it;
    </p>
    <p>
     while all the while, her masts and yards were thickly clustered
    </p>
    <p>
     with men, as three tall cherry trees, when the boys are cherrying
    </p>
    <p>
     among the boughs.
    </p>
    <p>
     But by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly saw
    </p>
    <p>
     that this ship that so wept with spray, still remained without comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was Rachel, weeping for her children, because they were not.

     The Cabin
    </p>
    <p>
     (Ahab moving to go on deck; Pip catches him by the hand to follow.)
    </p>
    <p>
     Lad, lad, I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hour is coming when Ahab would not scare thee from him,
    </p>
    <p>
     yet would not have thee by him.  There is that in thee, poor lad,
    </p>
    <p>
     which I feel too curing to my malady.  Like cures like;
    </p>
    <p>
     and for this hunt, my malady becomes my most desired health.
    </p>
    <p>
     Do thou abide below here, where they shall serve thee,
    </p>
    <p>
     as if thou wert the captain.  Aye, lad, thou shalt sit here
    </p>
    <p>
     in my own screwed chair; another screw to it, thou must be."
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, no, no! ye have not a whole body, sir; do ye but use poor me
    </p>
    <p>
     for your one lost leg; only tread upon me, sir; I ask no more,
    </p>
    <p>
     so I remain a part of ye."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh! spite of million villains, this makes me a bigot in the fadeless
    </p>
    <p>
     fidelity of man!--and a black! and crazy!--but methinks like-cures-like
    </p>
    <p>
     applies to him too; he grows so sane again."
    </p>
    <p>
     "They tell me, sir, that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip,
    </p>
    <p>
     whose drowned bones now show white, for all the blackness of his
    </p>
    <p>
     living skin.  But I will never desert ye, sir, as Stubb did him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sir, I must go with ye."
    </p>
    <p>
     "If thou speakest thus to me much more, Ahab's purpose keels up in him.
    </p>
    <p>
     I tell thee no; it cannot be."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh good master, master, master!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Weep so, and I will murder thee! have a care, for Ahab too is mad.
    </p>
    <p>
     Listen, and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck,
    </p>
    <p>
     and still know that I am there.  And now I quit thee.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thy hand!--Met!  True art thou, lad, as the circumference to

    <p>
     its centre.  So:  God for ever bless thee; and if it come to that,--
    </p>
    <p>
     God for ever save thee, let what will befall."
    </p>
    <p>
     (Ahab goes; Pip steps one step forward.)
    </p>
    <p>
     "Here he this instant stood, I stand in his air,--but I'm alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now were even poor Pip here I could endure it, but he's missing.

    <p>
     Pip!  Pip!  Ding, dong, ding!  Who's seen Pip?  He must be up here;
    </p>
    <p>
     let's try the door.  What? neither lock, nor bolt, nor bar;
    </p>
    <p>
     and yet there's no opening it.  It must be the spell; he told me
    </p>
    <p>
     to stay here:  Aye, and told me this screwed chair was mine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here, then, I'll seat me, against the transom, in the ship's

    <p>
     sit at table, and lord it over rows of captains and lieutenants.

     Ha! what's this? epaulets! epaulets! the epaulets all come crowding.

     What an odd feeling, now, when a black boy's host to white men
    </p>
    <p>
     with gold lace upon their coats!--Monsieurs, have ye seen one Pip?--
    </p>

     a little negro lad, five feet high, hang-dog look, and cowardly!

    <p>
     Jumped from a whale-boat once;--seen him?  No!  Well then,
    </p>
    <p>
     fill up again, captains, and let's drink shame upon all cowards!
    </p>
    <p>
     I name no names.  Shame upon them!  Put one foot upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shame upon all cowards.--Hist! above there, I hear ivory--
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, master! master!  I am indeed down-hearted when you walk over me.
    </p>
    <p>
     But here I'll stay, though this stern strikes rocks; and they
    </p>
    <p>
     bulge through; and oysters come to join me."

     CHAPTER 130
    </head>
    <p>
     The Hat
    </p>
    <p>
     And now that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide
    </p>
    <p>
     a preliminary cruise, Ahab,--all other whaling waters swept--
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to have chased his foe into an oceanfold, to slay him
    </p>
    <p>
     the more securely there; now, that he found himself hard
    </p>
    <p>
     by the very latitude and longitude where his tormenting wound
    </p>
    <p>
     had been inflicted; now that a vessel had been spoken which on
    </p>
    <p>
     the very day preceding had actually encountered Moby Dick;--
    </p>
    <p>
     and now that all his successive meetings with various ships
    </p>
    <p>
     contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which
    </p>
    <p>
     the white whale tore his hunters, whether sinning or sinned against;
    </p>
    <p>
     now it was that there lurked a something in the old man's eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
     which it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the unsetting polar star, which through the livelong, arctic,
    </p>
    <p>
     six months' night sustains its piercing, steady, central gaze;
    </p>
    <p>
     so Ahab's purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constant
    </p>
    <p>
     midnight of the gloomy crew.  It domineered above them so,
    </p>
    <p>
     that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings, fears, were fain
    </p>
    <p>
     to hide beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a single
    </p>
    <p>
     spear or leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
     In this foreshadowing interval, too, all humor, forced
    </p>
    <p>
     or natural, vanished.  Stubb no more strove to raise a smile;
    </p>
    <p>
     Starbuck no more strove to check one.  Alike, joy and sorrow,
    </p>
    <p>
     hope and fear, seemed ground to finest dust, and powdered,
    </p>
    <p>
     for the time, in the clamped mortar of Ahab's iron soul.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like machines, they dumbly moved about the deck, ever conscious
    </p>
    <p>
     that the old man's despot eye was on them.
    </p>
    <p>
     But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential
    </p>
    <p>
     hours when he thought no glance but one was on him;
    </p>
    <p>
     then you would have seen that even as Ahab's eyes so awed
    </p>
    <p>
     the crew's, the inscrutable Parsee's glance awed his;
    </p>
    <p>
     or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at times affected it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Such an added, gliding strangeness began to invest the thin
    </p>
    <p>
     Fedallah now; such ceaseless shudderings shook him;
    </p>
    <p>
     that the men looked dubious at him; half uncertain,
    </p>
    <p>
     as it seemed, whether indeed he were a mortal substance,
    </p>
    <p>
     or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen
    </p>
    <p>
     being's body.  And that shadow was always hovering there.
    </p>
    <p>
     For not by night, even, had Fedallah ever certainly been known
    </p>
    <p>
     to slumber, or go below.  He would stand still for hours:
    </p>
    <p>
     but never sat or leaned; his wan but wondrous eyes did plainly say--
    </p>
    <p>
     We two watchmen never rest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners
    </p>
    <p>
     now step upon the deck, unless Ahab was before them;
    </p>
    <p>
     either standing in his pivot-hole, or exactly pacing the planks
    </p>
    <p>
     between two undeviating limits,--the main-mast and the mizen;
    </p>
    <p>
     or else they saw him standing in the cabin-scuttle,--his living
    </p>
    <p>
     foot advanced upon the deck, as if to step; his hat slouched
    </p>
    <p>
     heavily over his eyes; so that however motionless he stood,
    </p>
    <p>
     however the days and nights were added on, that he had not
    </p>
    <p>
     swung in his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat,
    </p>
    <p>
     they could never tell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes
    </p>
    <p>
     were really closed at times; or whether he was still intently
    </p>
    <p>
     scanning them; no matter, though he stood so in the scuttle
    </p>
    <p>
     for a whole hour on the stretch, and the unheeded night-damp
    </p>
    <p>
     gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat and hat.
    </p>
    <p>
     The clothes that the night had wet, the next day's sunshine
    </p>
    <p>
     dried upon him; and so, day after day, and night after night;
    </p>
    <p>
     he went no more beneath the planks; whatever he wanted from
    </p>
    <p>
     the cabin that thing he sent for.
    </p>
    <p>
     He ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,--
    </p>
    <p>
     breakfast and dinner:  supper he never touched; nor reaped
    </p>
    <p>
     his beard; which darkly grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots
    </p>
    <p>
     of trees blown over, which still grow idly on at naked base,
    </p>
    <p>
     though perished in the upper verdure.  But though his whole
    </p>
    <p>
     life was now become one watch on deck; and though the Parsee's
    </p>
    <p>
     mystic watch was without intermission as his own; yet these two
    </p>
    <p>
     never seemed to speak--one man to the other--unless at long
    </p>
    <p>
     intervals some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain;
    </p>
    <p>
     openly, and to the awe-struck crew, they seemed pole-like asunder.
    </p>
    <p>
     If by day they chanced to speak one word; by night, dumb men
    </p>
    <p>
     were both, so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange.
    </p>
    <p>
     At times, for longest hours, without a single hail, they stood
    </p>
    <p>
     far parted in the starlight; Ahab in his scuttle, the Parsee
    </p>
    <p>
     by the main-mast; but still fixedly gazing upon each other;
    </p>
    <p>
     as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab
    </p>
    <p>
     the Parsee his abandoned substance.
    </p>
    <p>
     And yet, somehow, did Ahab--in his own proper self, as daily, hourly,
    </p>
    <p>
     and every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,--
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab seemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still again both seemed yoked together, and an unseen
    </p>
    <p>
     tyrant driving them; the lean shade siding the solid rib.
    </p>
    <p>
     For be this Parsee what he may, all rib and keel was solid Ahab.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was
    </p>
    <p>
     heard from aft,--"Man the mast-heads!"--and all through the day,
    </p>
    <p>
     till after sunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour,
    </p>
    <p>
     at the striking of the helmsman's bell, was heard--"What d'ye see?--
    </p>
    <p>
     sharp! sharp! sharp!"
    </p>
    <p>
     But when three or four days had slided by, after meeting
    </p>
    <p>
     the children-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen;
    </p>
    <p>
     the monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crew's fidelity;
    </p>
    <p>
     at least, of nearly all except the Pagan harpooneers; he seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     to doubt, even, whether Stubb and Flask might not willingly overlook
    </p>
    <p>
     the sight he sought.  But if these suspicions were really his,
    </p>
    <p>
     he sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them,
    </p>
    <p>
     however his actions might seem to hint them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will have the first sight of the whale myself,"--
    </p>
    <p>
     he said.  "Aye!  Ahab must have the doubloon! and with
    </p>
    <p>
     his own hands he rigged a nest of basketed bowlines;
    </p>
    <p>
     and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved block,
    </p>
    <p>
     to secure to the mainmast head, he received the two ends of
    </p>
    <p>
     the downwardreeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared
    </p>
    <p>
     a pin for the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
     This done, with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin,
    </p>
    <p>
     he looked round upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other;
    </p>
    <p>
     pausing his glance long upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego;
    </p>
    <p>
     but shunning Fedallah; and then settling his firm relying eye
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the chief mate, said,--"Take the rope, sir--I give it into
    </p>
    <p>
     thy hands, Starbuck."  Then arranging his person in the basket,
    </p>
    <p>
     he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch, Starbuck being
    </p>
    <p>
     the one who secured the rope at last; and afterwards stood near it.
    </p>
    <p>
     And thus, with one hand clinging round the royal mast,
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles,--ahead astern,
    </p>
    <p>
     this side, and that,--within the wide expanded circle commanded
    </p>
    <p>
     at so great a height.
    </p>
    <p>
     When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place
    </p>
    <p>
     in the rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor
    </p>
    <p>
     at sea is hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope;
    </p>
    <p>
     under these circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given
    </p>
    <p>
     in strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because in such a wilderness of running rigging, whose various
    </p>
    <p>
     different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned
    </p>
    <p>
     by what is seen of them at the deck; and when the deck-ends of these
    </p>
    <p>
     ropes are being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings,
    </p>
    <p>
     it would be but a natural fatality, if, unprovided with a
    </p>
    <p>
     constant watchman, the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness
    </p>
    <p>
     of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     So Ahab's proceedings in this matter were not unusual;
    </p>
    <p>
     the only strange thing about them seemed to be, that Starbuck,
    </p>
    <p>
     almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him
    </p>
    <p>
     with anything in the slightest degree approaching to decision--
    </p>
    <p>
     one of those too, whose faithfulness on the look-out he had seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     to doubt somewhat; it was strange, that this was the very man
    </p>
    <p>
     he should select for his watchman; freely giving his whole life
    </p>
    <p>
     into such an otherwise distrusted person's hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there
    </p>
    <p>
     ten minutes; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often
    </p>
    <p>
     fly incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen
    </p>
    <p>
     in these latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming
    </p>
    <p>
     round his head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then it darted a thousand feet straight up into the air;
    </p>
    <p>
     then spiralized downwards, and went eddying again round his head.
    </p>
    <p>
     But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon,
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any
    </p>
    <p>
     one else have marked it much, it being no uncommon circumstance;
    </p>
    <p>
     only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort
    </p>
    <p>
     of cunning meaning in almost every sight.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Your hat, your hat, sir!" suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman,
    </p>
    <p>
     who being posted at the mizen-mast-head, stood directly behind Ahab,
    </p>
    <p>
     though somewhat lower than his level, and with a deep gulf
    </p>
    <p>
     of air dividing them.
    </p>
    <p>
     But already the sable wing was before the old man's eyes;
    </p>
    <p>
     the long hooked bill at his head:  with a scream, the black
    </p>
    <p>
     hawk darted away with his prize.
    </p>
    <p>
     An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin's head, removing his cap to
    </p>
    <p>
     replace it, and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that Tarquin
    </p>
    <p>
     would be king of Rome.  But only by the replacing of the cap
    </p>
    <p>
     was that omen accounted good.  Ahab's hat was never restored;
    </p>
    <p>
     the wild hawk flew on and on with it; far in advance of the prow:
    </p>
    <p>
     and at last disappeared; while from the point of that disappearance,
    </p>
    <p>
     a minute black spot was dimly discerned, falling from that vast
    </p>
    <p>
     height into the sea.

     CHAPTER 131
    </head>
    <p>
     The Pequod Meets The Delight
    </p>
    <p>
     The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by;
    </p>
    <p>
     the life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship,
    </p>
    <p>
     most miserably misnamed the Delight, was descried.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she drew nigh, all eyes were fixed upon her broad beams,
    </p>
    <p>
     called shears, which, in some whaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck
    </p>
    <p>
     at the height of eight or nine feet; serving to carry the spare,
    </p>
    <p>
     unrigged, or disabled boats.
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon the stranger's shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs,
    </p>
    <p>
     and some few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat;
    </p>
    <p>
     but you now saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see through
    </p>
    <p>
     the peeled, half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hast seen the White Whale?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Look!" replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail;
    </p>
    <p>
     and with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hast killed him?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "The harpoon is not yet forged that will ever will do that,"
    </p>
    <p>
     answered the other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on
    </p>
    <p>
     the deck, whose gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy
    </p>
    <p>
     in sewing together.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not forged!" and snatching Perth's levelled iron from the crotch,
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab held it out, exclaiming--"Look ye, Nantucketer; here in this
    </p>
    <p>
     hand I hold his death!  Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning
    </p>
    <p>
     are these barbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place
    </p>
    <p>
     behind the fin, where the White Whale most feels his accursed life!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Then God keep thee, old man--see'st thou that"--
    </p>
    <p>
     pointing to the hammock--"I bury but one of five stout men,
    </p>
    <p>
     who were alive only yesterday; but were dead ere night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Only that one I bury; the rest were buried before they died;
    </p>
    <p>
     you sail upon their tomb."  Then turning to his crew--"Are
    </p>
    <p>
     ye ready there? place the plank then on the rail, and lift
    </p>
    <p>
     the body; so, then--Oh!  God"--advancing towards the hammock
    </p>
    <p>
     with uplifted hands--"may the resurrection and the life-"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Brace forward!  Up helm!" cried Ahab like lightning to his men.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape
    </p>
    <p>
     the sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea;
    </p>
    <p>
     not so quick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles might have
    </p>
    <p>
     sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-buoy
    </p>
    <p>
     hanging at the Pequod's stern came into conspicuous relief.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ha! yonder! look yonder, men!" cried a foreboding voice in her wake.
    </p>
    <p>
     "In vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn us
    </p>
    <p>
     your taffrail to show us your coffin!"

     CHAPTER 132
    </head>
    <p>
     The Symphony
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a clear steel-blue day.  The firmaments of air and sea were
    </p>
    <p>
     hardly separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air
    </p>
    <p>
     was transparently pure and soft, with a woman's look, and the robust
    </p>
    <p>
     and man-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells,
    </p>
    <p>
     as Samson's chest in his sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small,
    </p>
    <p>
     unspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air;
    </p>
    <p>
     but to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue,
    </p>
    <p>
     rushed mighty leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were
    </p>
    <p>
     the strong, troubled, murderous thinkings of the masculine sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     But though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades
    </p>
    <p>
     and shadows without; those two seemed one; it was only the sex,
    </p>
    <p>
     as it were, that distinguished them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Aloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this
    </p>
    <p>
     gentle air to this bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom.
    </p>
    <p>
     And at the girdling line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion--
    </p>
    <p>
     most seen here at the Equator--denoted the fond, throbbing trust,
    </p>
    <p>
     the loving alarms, with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles;
    </p>
    <p>
     haggardly firm and unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals,
    </p>
    <p>
     that still glow in the ashes of ruin; untottering Ahab stood
    </p>
    <p>
     forth in the clearness of the morn; lifting his splintered
    </p>
    <p>
     helmet of a brow to the fair girl's forehead of heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure!
    </p>
    <p>
     Invisible winged creatures that frolic all round us!
    </p>
    <p>
     Sweet childhood of air and sky! how oblivious were ye of old Ahab's
    </p>
    <p>
     close-coiled woe!  But so have I seen little Miriam and Martha,
    </p>
    <p>
     laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol around their old sire;
    </p>
    <p>
     sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on the marge
    </p>
    <p>
     of that burnt-out crater of his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side
    </p>
    <p>
     and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze,
    </p>
    <p>
     the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel,
    </p>
    <p>
     for a moment, the cankerous thing in his soul.  That glad,
    </p>
    <p>
     happy air, that winsome sky, did at last stroke and caress him;
    </p>
    <p>
     the step-mother world, so long cruel--forbidding--now threw
    </p>
    <p>
     affectionate arms round his stubborn neck, and did seem to joyously
    </p>
    <p>
     sob over him, as if over one, that however wilful and erring,
    </p>
    <p>
     she could yet find it in her heart to save and to bless.
    </p>
    <p>
     From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into the sea;
    </p>
    <p>
     nor did all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop.
    </p>
    <p>
     Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the side;
    </p>
    <p>
     and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless
    </p>
    <p>
     sobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity around.
    </p>
    <p>
     Careful not to touch him, or be noticed by him, he yet drew near
    </p>
    <p>
     to him, and stood there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab turned.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Starbuck!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sir."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky.
    </p>
    <p>
     On such a day--very much such a sweetness as this--I struck
    </p>
    <p>
     my first whale--a boy-harpooneer of eighteen!  Forty--forty--
    </p>
    <p>
     forty years ago!--ago!  Forty years of continual whaling! forty
    </p>
    <p>
     years of privation, and peril, and storm-time! forty years on
    </p>
    <p>
     the pitiless sea! for forty years has Ahab forsaken the peaceful land,
    </p>
    <p>
     for forty years to make war on the horrors of the deep!
    </p>
    <p>
     Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of those forty years I have not
    </p>
    <p>
     spent three ashore.  When I think of this life I have led;
    </p>
    <p>
     the desolation of solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town of
    </p>
    <p>
     a Captain's exclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any
    </p>
    <p>
     sympathy from the green country without--oh, weariness! heaviness!
    </p>
    <p>
     Guinea-coast slavery of solitary command!--when I think of all this;
    </p>
    <p>
     only half-suspected, not so keenly known to me before--
    </p>
    <p>
     and how for forty years I have fed upon dry salted fare--
    </p>
    <p>
     fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soul!--when the poorest
    </p>
    <p>
     landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand, and broken
    </p>
    <p>
     the world's fresh bread to my mouldy crusts--away, whole oceans away,
    </p>
    <p>
     from that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and sailed for
    </p>
    <p>
     Cape Horn the next day, leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow--
    </p>
    <p>
     wife? wife?--rather a widow with her husband alive?  Aye, I widowed
    </p>
    <p>
     that poor girl when I married her, Starbuck; and then,
    </p>
    <p>
     the madness, the frenzy, the boiling blood and the smoking brow,
    </p>
    <p>
     with which, for a thousand lowerings old Ahab has furiously,
    </p>
    <p>
     foamingly chased his prey--more a demon than a man!--aye, aye! what
    </p>
    <p>
     a forty years' fool--fool--old fool, has old Ahab been!
    </p>
    <p>
     Why this strife of the chase? why weary, and palsy the arm
    </p>
    <p>
     at the oar, and the iron, and the lance? how the richer
    </p>
    <p>
     or better is Ahab now?  Behold.  Oh, Starbuck! is it not hard,
    </p>
    <p>
     that with this weary load I bear, one poor leg should have been
    </p>
    <p>
     snatched from under me?  Here, brush this old hair aside;
    </p>
    <p>
     it blinds me, that I seem to weep.  Locks so grey did never grow
    </p>
    <p>
     but from out some ashes!  But do I look very old, so very,
    </p>
    <p>
     very old, Starbuck?  I feel deadly faint, bowed, and humped,
    </p>
    <p>
     as though I were Adam, staggering beneath the piled centuries
    </p>
    <p>
     since Paradise.  God!  God!  God!--crack my heart!--stave my brain!--
    </p>
    <p>
     mockery! mockery! bitter, biting mockery of grey hairs, have I lived
    </p>
    <p>
     enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus intolerably old?
    </p>
    <p>
     Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into a human eye;
    </p>
    <p>
     it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to gaze
    </p>
    <p>
     upon God.  By the green land; by the bright hearthstone! this
    </p>
    <p>
     is the magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, no; stay on board, on board!--lower not when I do; when branded
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab gives chase to Moby Dick.  That hazard shall not be thine.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, no! not with the far away home I see in that eye!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart,
    </p>
    <p>
     after all! why should any one give chase to that hated fish!
    </p>
    <p>
     Away with me! let us fly these deadly waters! let us home!
    </p>
    <p>
     Wife and child, too, are Starbuck's--wife and child of
    </p>
    <p>
     his brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow youth; even as thine, sir,
    </p>
    <p>
     are the wife and child of thy loving, longing, paternal old age!
    </p>
    <p>
     Away! let us away!--this instant let me alter the course!
    </p>
    <p>
     How cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would we bowl
    </p>
    <p>
     on our way to see old Nantucket again!  I think, sir, they have
    </p>
    <p>
     some such mild blue days, even as this, in Nantucket."
    </p>
    <p>
     "They have, they have.  I have seen them--some summer days
    </p>
    <p>
     in the morning.  About this time--yes, it is his noon nap now--
    </p>
    <p>
     the boy vivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells
    </p>
    <p>
     him of me, of cannibal old me; how I am abroad upon the deep,
    </p>
    <p>
     but will yet come back to dance him again."
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Tis my Mary, my Mary herself!  She promised that my boy,
    </p>
    <p>
     every morning, should be carried to the hill to catch the first
    </p>
    <p>
     glimpse of his father's sail!  Yes, yes! no more! it is done!
    </p>
    <p>
     we head for Nantucket!  Come, my Captain, study out the course,
    </p>
    <p>
     and let us away!  See, see! the boy's face from the window!
    </p>
    <p>
     the boy's hand on the hill!"
    </p>
    <p>
     But Ahab's glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he shook,
    </p>
    <p>
     and cast his last, cindered apple to the soil.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it;
    </p>
    <p>
     what cozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor
    </p>
    <p>
     commands me; that against all natural lovings and longings,
    </p>
    <p>
     I so keep pushing, and crowding, and jamming myself on all the time;
    </p>
    <p>
     recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper, natural heart,
    </p>
    <p>
     I durst not so much as dare?  Is Ahab, Ahab?  Is it I, God, or who,
    </p>
    <p>
     that lifts this arm?  But if the great sun move not of himself;
    </p>
    <p>
     but is as an errand-boy in heaven; nor one single star can revolve,
    </p>
    <p>
     but by some invisible power; how then can this one small heart beat;
    </p>
    <p>
     this one small brain think thoughts; unless God does that beating,
    </p>
    <p>
     does that thinking, does that living, and not I. By heaven, man,
    </p>
    <p>
     we are turned round and round in this world, like yonder windlass,
    </p>
    <p>
     and Fate is the handspike.  And all the time, lo! that smiling sky,
    </p>
    <p>
     and this unsounded sea!  Look! see yon Albicore! who put it into him
    </p>
    <p>
     to chase and fang that flying-fish? Where do murderers go, man!
    </p>
    <p>
     Who's to doom, when the judge himself is dragged to the bar?
    </p>
    <p>
     But it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky; and the airs
    </p>
    <p>
     smells now, as if it blew from a far-away meadow; they have been making
    </p>
    <p>
     hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes, Starbuck, and the mowers
    </p>
    <p>
     are sleeping among the new-mown hay.  Sleeping?  Aye, toil we how
    </p>
    <p>
     we may, we all sleep at last on the field.  Sleep?  Aye, and rust
    </p>
    <p>
     amid greenness; as last year's scythes flung down, and left
    </p>
    <p>
     in the half-cut swarths--Starbuck!"
    </p>
    <p>
     But blanched to a corpse's hue with despair, the Mate had stolen away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side;
    </p>
    <p>
     but started at two reflected, fixed eyes in the water there,
    </p>
    <p>
     Fedallah was motionlessly leaning over the same rail.

     CHAPTER 133
    </head>
    <p>
     The Chase - First Day
    </p>
    <p>
     That night, in the mid-watch when the old man--as his wont
    </p>
    <p>
     at intervals--stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned,
    </p>
    <p>
     and went to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely,
    </p>
    <p>
     snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ship's dog will, in drawing
    </p>
    <p>
     nigh to some barbarous isle.  He declared that a whale must be near.
    </p>
    <p>
     Soon that peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given
    </p>
    <p>
     forth by the living sperm whale, was palpable to all the watch;
    </p>
    <p>
     nor was any mariner surprised when, after inspecting the compass,
    </p>
    <p>
     and then the dog-vane, and then ascertaining the precise bearing
    </p>
    <p>
     of the odor as nearly as possible, Ahab rapidly ordered the ship's
    </p>
    <p>
     course to be slightly altered, and the sail to be shortened.
    </p>
    <p>
     The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently
    </p>
    <p>
     vindicated at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek
    </p>
    <p>
     on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil,
    </p>
    <p>
     and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering it,
    </p>
    <p>
     the polished metallic-like marks of some swift tide-rip, at
    </p>
    <p>
     the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Man the mast-heads! Call all hands!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on
    </p>
    <p>
     the forecastle deck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such
    </p>
    <p>
     judgment claps that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle,
    </p>
    <p>
     so instantaneously did they appear with their clothes
    </p>
    <p>
     in their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What d'ye see?" cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nothing, nothing sir!" was the sound hailing down in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
     "T'gallant sails!--stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!"
    </p>
    <p>
     All sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved
    </p>
    <p>
     for swaying him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments
    </p>
    <p>
     they were hoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds
    </p>
    <p>
     of the way aloft, and while peering ahead through the horizontal
    </p>
    <p>
     vacancy between the main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised
    </p>
    <p>
     a gull-like cry in the air.  "There she blows!--there she blows!
    </p>
    <p>
     A hump like a snow-hill! It is Moby Dick!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three
    </p>
    <p>
     look-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous
    </p>
    <p>
     whale they had so long been pursuing.  Ahab had now gained
    </p>
    <p>
     his final perch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego
    </p>
    <p>
     standing just beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast,
    </p>
    <p>
     so that the Indian's head was almost on a level with Ahab's heel.
    </p>
    <p>
     From this height the whale was now seen some mile or so ahead,
    </p>
    <p>
     at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump,
    </p>
    <p>
     and regularly jetting his silent spout into the air.
    </p>
    <p>
     To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they
    </p>
    <p>
     had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And did none of ye see it before?" cried Ahab, hailing the perched
    </p>
    <p>
     men all around him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did,
    </p>
    <p>
     and I cried out," said Tashtego.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not the same instant; not the same--no, the doubloon is mine,
    </p>
    <p>
     Fate reserved the doubloon for me.  I only; none of ye could have
    </p>
    <p>
     raised the White Whale first.  There she blows! there she blows!--
    </p>
    <p>
     there she blows!--there she blows!  There again!--there again!"
    </p>
    <p>
     he cried, in long-drawn, lingering, methodic tones, attuned to the gradual
    </p>
    <p>
     prolongings of the whale's visible jets.  "He's going to sound!
    </p>
    <p>
     In stunsails!  Down top-gallant-sails! Stand by three boats.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay on board, and keep the ship.  Helm there!
    </p>
    <p>
     Luff, luff a point!  So; steady, man, steady!  There go flukes!  No, no;
    </p>
    <p>
     only black water!  All ready the boats there?  Stand by, stand by!
    </p>
    <p>
     Lower me, Mr. Starbuck; lower, lower,--quick, quicker!" and he slid
    </p>
    <p>
     through the air to the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
     "He is heading straight to leeward, sir," cried Stubb, "right away
    </p>
    <p>
     from us; cannot have seen the ship yet."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Be dumb, man!  Stand by the braces!  Hard down the helm!--brace up!
    </p>
    <p>
     Shiver her!--shiver her!--So; well that!  Boats, boats!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Soon all the boats but Starbuck's were dropped; all the boat-sails set--
    </p>
    <p>
     all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to leeward;
    </p>
    <p>
     and Ahab heading the onset.  A pale, death-glimmer lit up Fedallah's
    </p>
    <p>
     sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea;
    </p>
    <p>
     but only slowly they neared the foe.  As they neared him, the ocean grew
    </p>
    <p>
     still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a
    </p>
    <p>
     noon-meadow, so serenely it spread.  At length the breathless hunter came
    </p>
    <p>
     so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling hump
    </p>
    <p>
     was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing,
    </p>
    <p>
     and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy, greenish foam.
    </p>
    <p>
     He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting
    </p>
    <p>
     head beyond.  Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged waters,
    </p>
    <p>
     went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky forehead, a musical
    </p>
    <p>
     rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and behind, the blue waters
    </p>
    <p>
     interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake;
    </p>
    <p>
     and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
     But these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay
    </p>
    <p>
     fowls softly feathering the sea, alternate with their fitful flight;
    </p>
    <p>
     and like to some flag-staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy,
    </p>
    <p>
     the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white
    </p>
    <p>
     whale's back; and at intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed
    </p>
    <p>
     fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish,
    </p>
    <p>
     silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail feathers
    </p>
    <p>
     streaming like pennons.
    </p>
    <p>
     A gentle joyousness--a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness,
    </p>
    <p>
     invested the gliding whale.  Not the white bull Jupiter swimming
    </p>
    <p>
     away with ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns;
    </p>
    <p>
     his lovely, leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid;
    </p>
    <p>
     with smooth bewitching fleetness, rippling straight for the nuptial
    </p>
    <p>
     bower in Crete; not Jove, not that great majesty Supreme! did
    </p>
    <p>
     surpass the glorified White Whale as he so divinely swam.
    </p>
    <p>
     On each soft side--coincident with the parted swell,
    </p>
    <p>
     that but once leaving him then flowed so wide away--on each
    </p>
    <p>
     bright side, the whale shed off enticings.  No wonder there
    </p>
    <p>
     had been some among the hunters who namelessly transported
    </p>
    <p>
     and allured by all this serenity, had ventured to assail it;
    </p>
    <p>
     but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of tornadoes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all
    </p>
    <p>
     who for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in that same
    </p>
    <p>
     way thou mayst have bejuggled and destroyed before.
    </p>
    <p>
     And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     among waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture,
    </p>
    <p>
     Moby Dick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his
    </p>
    <p>
     submerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
     But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water;
    </p>
    <p>
     for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch,
    </p>
    <p>
     like Virginia's Natural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered
    </p>
    <p>
     flukes in the air, the grand god revealed himself, sounded and went
    </p>
    <p>
     out of sight.  Hoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing,
    </p>
    <p>
     the white sea-fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool
    </p>
    <p>
     that he left.
    </p>
    <p>
     With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift,
    </p>
    <p>
     the three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick's reappearance.
    </p>
    <p>
     "An hour," said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat's stern; and he gazed
    </p>
    <p>
     beyond the whale's place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing
    </p>
    <p>
     vacancies to leeward.  It was only an instant; for again his eyes
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle.
    </p>
    <p>
     The breeze now freshened; the sea began to swell.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The birds!--the birds!" cried Tashtego.
    </p>
    <p>
     In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds
    </p>
    <p>
     were now all flying towards Ahab's boat; and when within a few
    </p>
    <p>
     yards began fluttering over the water there, wheeling round
    </p>
    <p>
     and round, with joyous, expectant cries.  Their vision was
    </p>
    <p>
     keener than man's; Ahab could discover no sign in the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     But suddenly as he peered down and down into its depths, he profoundly
    </p>
    <p>
     saw a white living spot no bigger than a white weasel, with wonderful
    </p>
    <p>
     celerity uprising, and magnifying as it rose, till it turned,
    </p>
    <p>
     and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of white,
    </p>
    <p>
     glistening teeth, floating up from the undiscoverable bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was Moby Dick's open mouth and scrolled jaw; his vast,
    </p>
    <p>
     shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored
    </p>
    <p>
     marble tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar,
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous apparition.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, calling upon Fedallah to change places with him, went forward
    </p>
    <p>
     to the bows, and seizing Perth's harpoon, commanded his crew
    </p>
    <p>
     to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,
    </p>
    <p>
     its bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale's head
    </p>
    <p>
     while yet under water.  But as if perceiving this stratagem,
    </p>
    <p>
     Moby Dick, with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him,
    </p>
    <p>
     sidelingly transplanted himself, as it were, in an instant,
    </p>
    <p>
     shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Through and through; through every plank and each rib,
    </p>
    <p>
     it thrilled for an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back,
    </p>
    <p>
     in the manner of a biting shark slowly and feelingly taking
    </p>
    <p>
     its bows full within his mouth, so that the long, narrow,
    </p>
    <p>
     scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air, and one
    </p>
    <p>
     of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish pearl-white
    </p>
    <p>
     of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab's head,
    </p>
    <p>
     and reached higher than that.  In this attitude the White Whale
    </p>
    <p>
     now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
     With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms;
    </p>
    <p>
     but the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other's heads
    </p>
    <p>
     to gain the uttermost stern.
    </p>
    <p>
     And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out,
    </p>
    <p>
     as the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way;
    </p>
    <p>
     and from his body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be
    </p>
    <p>
     darted at from the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him,
    </p>
    <p>
     as it were; and while the other boats involuntarily paused,
    </p>
    <p>
     as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand, then it was that
    </p>
    <p>
     monomaniac Ahab, furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe,
    </p>
    <p>
     which placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated;
    </p>
    <p>
     frenzied with all this, he seized the long bone with his
    </p>
    <p>
     naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe.
    </p>
    <p>
     As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him;
    </p>
    <p>
     the frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped,
    </p>
    <p>
     as both jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding further aft,
    </p>
    <p>
     bit the craft completely in twain, and locked themselves fast
    </p>
    <p>
     again in the sea, midway between the two floating wrecks.
    </p>
    <p>
     These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at
    </p>
    <p>
     the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold
    </p>
    <p>
     fast to the oars to lash them across.
    </p>
    <p>
     At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first
    </p>
    <p>
     to perceive the whale's intent, by the crafty upraising of his head,
    </p>
    <p>
     a movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his
    </p>
    <p>
     hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite.
    </p>
    <p>
     But only slipping further into the whale's mouth, and tilting over
    </p>
    <p>
     sideways as it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw;
    </p>
    <p>
     spilled him out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell
    </p>
    <p>
     flat-faced upon the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a
    </p>
    <p>
     little distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up
    </p>
    <p>
     and down in the billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his
    </p>
    <p>
     whole spindled body; so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose--
    </p>
    <p>
     some twenty or more feet out of the water--the now rising swells,
    </p>
    <p>
     with all their confluent waves, dazzlingly broke against it;
    </p>
    <p>
     vindictively tossing their shivered spray still higher into
    </p>
    <p>
     the air.* So, in a gale, the but half baffled Channel billows only
    </p>
    <p>
     recoil from the base of the Eddystone, triumphantly to overleap
    </p>
    <p>
     its summit with their scud.
    </p>
    <p>
     *This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale.  It receives its designation
    </p>
    <p>
     (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary up-and-down
    </p>
    <p>
     poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called pitchpoling,
    </p>
    <p>
     previously described.  By this motion the whale must best and most
    </p>
    <p>
     comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him.
    </p>
    <p>
     But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly
    </p>
    <p>
     round and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his
    </p>
    <p>
     vengeful wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more
    </p>
    <p>
     deadly assault.  The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him,
    </p>
    <p>
     as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus's
    </p>
    <p>
     elephants in the book of Maccabees.  Meanwhile Ahab half smothered
    </p>
    <p>
     in the foam of the whale's insolent tail, and too much of a cripple
    </p>
    <p>
     to swim,--though he could still keep afloat, even in the heart
    </p>
    <p>
     of such a whirlpool as that; helpless Ahab's head was seen,
    </p>
    <p>
     like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst.
    </p>
    <p>
     From the boat's fragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and mildly
    </p>
    <p>
     eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not
    </p>
    <p>
     succor him; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
     For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale's aspect,
    </p>
    <p>
     and so planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles
    </p>
    <p>
     he made, that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
     And though the other boats, unharmed, still hovered hard by;
    </p>
    <p>
     still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike, lest that should be
    </p>
    <p>
     the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways,
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab and all; nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
     With straining eyes, then, they remained on the outer edge of
    </p>
    <p>
     the direful zone, whose centre had now become the old man's head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship's
    </p>
    <p>
     mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene;
    </p>
    <p>
     and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!--"Sail on the"--
    </p>
    <p>
     but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and whelmed
    </p>
    <p>
     him for the time.  But struggling out of it again, and chancing to rise
    </p>
    <p>
     on a towering crest, he shouted,--"Sail on the whale!--Drive him off!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The Pequod's prows were pointed-, and breaking up the charmed circle,
    </p>
    <p>
     she effectually parted the white whale from his victim.
    </p>
    <p>
     As he sullenly swam off, the boats flew to the rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dragged into Stubb's boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
     the white brine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension
    </p>
    <p>
     of Ahab's bodily strength did crack, and helplessly he yielded
    </p>
    <p>
     to his body's doom for a time, lying all crushed in the bottom
    </p>
    <p>
     of Stubb's boat, like one trodden under foot of herds of elephants.
    </p>
    <p>
     Far inland, nameless wails came from him, as desolate sounds
    </p>
    <p>
     from out ravines.
    </p>
    <p>
     But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much
    </p>
    <p>
     the more abbreviate it.  In an instant's compass, great hearts
    </p>
    <p>
     sometimes condense to one deep pang, the sum total of those
    </p>
    <p>
     shallow pains kindly diffused through feebler men's whole lives.
    </p>
    <p>
     And so, such hearts, though summary in each one suffering;
    </p>
    <p>
     still, if the gods decree it, in their life-time aggregate
    </p>
    <p>
     a whole age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous intensities;
    </p>
    <p>
     for even in their pointless centres, those noble natures contain
    </p>
    <p>
     the entire circumferences of inferior souls.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The harpoon," said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning
    </p>
    <p>
     on one bended arm--"is it safe?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it," said Stubb, showing it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Lay it before me;--any missing men?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "One, two, three, four, five;--there were five oars, sir, and here
    </p>
    <p>
     are five men."
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's good.--Help me, man; I wish to stand.  So, so, I see him!
    </p>
    <p>
     there! there! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!--
    </p>
    <p>
     Hands off from me!  The eternal sap runs up in Ahab's bones again!
    </p>
    <p>
     Set the sail; out oars; the helm!"
    </p>
    <p>
     It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew,
    </p>
    <p>
     being picked up by another boat, help to work that second boat;
    </p>
    <p>
     and the chase is thus continued with what is called double-banked oars.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was thus now.  But the added power of the boat did not equal
    </p>
    <p>
     the added power of the whale, for he seemed to have treble-banked
    </p>
    <p>
     his every fin; swimming with a velocity which plainly showed,
    </p>
    <p>
     that if now, under these circumstances, pushed on, the chase
    </p>
    <p>
     would prove an indefinitely prolonged, if not a hopeless one;
    </p>
    <p>
     nor could any crew endure for so long a period, such an unintermitted,
    </p>
    <p>
     intense straining at the oar; a thing barely tolerable only in some one
    </p>
    <p>
     brief vicissitude.  The ship itself, then, as it sometimes happens,
    </p>
    <p>
     offered the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase.
    </p>
    <p>
     Accordingly, the boats now made for her, and were soon swayed up
    </p>
    <p>
     to their cranes--the two parts of the wrecked boat having been
    </p>
    <p>
     previously secured by her--and then hoisting everything to her side,
    </p>
    <p>
     and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways outstretching it
    </p>
    <p>
     with stunsails, like the double-jointed wings of an albatross;
    </p>
    <p>
     the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby Dick.  At the well known,
    </p>
    <p>
     methodic intervals, the whale's glittering spout was regularly
    </p>
    <p>
     announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be reported
    </p>
    <p>
     as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing the deck,
    </p>
    <p>
     binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the allotted
    </p>
    <p>
     hour expired, his voice was heard.--"Whose is the doubloon now?
    </p>
    <p>
     D'ye see him?" and if the reply was No, sir! straightway he commanded
    </p>
    <p>
     them to lift him to his perch.  In this way the day wore on;
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab, now aloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the planks.
    </p>
    <p>
     As he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men aloft,
    </p>
    <p>
     or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to a still
    </p>
    <p>
     greater breadth--thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched hat,
    </p>
    <p>
     at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been dropped upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow to shattered stern.
    </p>
    <p>
     At last he paused before it; and as in an already over-clouded sky fresh
    </p>
    <p>
     troops of clouds will sometimes sail across, so over the old man's face
    </p>
    <p>
     there now stole some such added gloom as this.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though,
    </p>
    <p>
     to evince his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place
    </p>
    <p>
     in his Captain's mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck exclaimed--
    </p>
    <p>
     "The thistle the ass refused; it pricked his mouth too keenly, sir;
    </p>
    <p>
     ha! ha! ha!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck?
    </p>
    <p>
     Man, man! did I not know thee brave as fearless fire
    </p>
    <p>
     (and as mechanical) I could swear thou wert a poltroon.
    </p>
    <p>
     Groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, sir," said Starbuck drawing near, "'tis a solemn sight;
    </p>
    <p>
     an omen, and an ill one."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Omen? omen?--the dictionary!  If the gods think to speak outright
    </p>
    <p>
     to man, they will honorably speak outright; not shake their heads,
    </p>
    <p>
     and give an old wives' darkling hint.--Begone!  Ye two are
    </p>
    <p>
     the opposite poles of one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed,
    </p>
    <p>
     and Stubb is Starbuck; and ye two are all mankind; and Ahab stands
    </p>
    <p>
     alone among the millions of the peopled earth, nor gods nor men
    </p>
    <p>
     his neighbors!  Cold, cold--I shiver!--How now?  Aloft there!
    </p>
    <p>
     D'ye see him?  Sing out for every spout, though he spout ten
    </p>
    <p>
     times a second!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was rustling.
    </p>
    <p>
     Soon it was almost dark, but the look-out men still remained unset.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can't see the spout now, sir;--too dark"--cried a voice from the air.
    </p>
    <p>
     "How heading when last seen?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "As before, sir,--straight to leeward."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good! he will travel slower now 'tis night.  Down royals and
    </p>
    <p>
     top-gallant stunsails, Mr. Starbuck.  We must not run over him
    </p>
    <p>
     before morning; he's making a passage now, and may heave-to a while.
    </p>
    <p>
     Helm there! keep her full before the wind!--Aloft! come down!--
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Stubb, send a fresh hand to the fore-mast head, and see
    </p>
    <p>
     it manned till morning."--Then advancing towards the doubloon
    </p>
    <p>
     in the main-mast--"Men, this gold is mine, for I earned it;
    </p>
    <p>
     but I shall let it abide here till the White Whale is dead;
    </p>
    <p>
     and then, whosoever of ye first raises him, upon the day he shall
    </p>
    <p>
     be killed, this gold is that man's; and if on that day I shall again
    </p>
    <p>
     raise him, then, ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye!
    </p>
    <p>
     Away now! the deck is thine, sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
     And so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle,
    </p>
    <p>
     and slouching his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at
    </p>
    <p>
     intervals rousing himself to see how the night wore on.

    <p>
     The Chase - Second Day
    </p>
    <p>
     At day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
     "D'ye see him?" cried Ahab after allowing a little space
    </p>
    <p>
     for the light to spread.
    </p>
    <p>
     "See nothing, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought for;--
    </p>
    <p>
     the top-gallant sails!--aye, they should have been kept on her all night.
    </p>
    <p>
     But no matter--'tis but resting for the rush."
    </p>
    <p>
     Here be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale,
    </p>
    <p>
     continued through day into night, and through night into day,
    </p>
    <p>
     is a thing by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery.
    </p>
    <p>
     For such is the wonderful skill, prescience of experience,
    </p>
    <p>
     and invincible confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among
    </p>
    <p>
     the Nantucket commanders; that from the simple observation of a whale
    </p>
    <p>
     when last descried, they will, under certain given circumstances,
    </p>
    <p>
     pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue
    </p>
    <p>
     to swim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his probable
    </p>
    <p>
     rate of progression during that period.  And, in these cases,
    </p>
    <p>
     somewhat as a pilot, when about losing sight of a coast, whose general
    </p>
    <p>
     trending he well knows, and which he desires shortly to return to again,
    </p>
    <p>
     but at some further point; like as this pilot stands by his compass,
    </p>
    <p>
     and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present visible,
    </p>
    <p>
     in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen headland,
    </p>
    <p>
     eventually to be visited:  so does the fisherman, at his compass,
    </p>
    <p>
     with the whale; for after being chased, and diligently marked,
    </p>
    <p>
     through several hours of daylight, then, when night obscures
    </p>
    <p>
     the fish, the creature's future wake through the darkness is almost
    </p>
    <p>
     as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter, as the pilot's
    </p>
    <p>
     coast is to him.  So that to this hunter's wondrous skill,
    </p>
    <p>
     the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water, a wake,
    </p>
    <p>
     is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly
    </p>
    <p>
     known in its every pace, that, with watches in their hands, men time
    </p>
    <p>
     his rate as doctors that of a baby's pulse; and lightly say of it,
    </p>
    <p>
     the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot,
    </p>
    <p>
     at such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions
    </p>
    <p>
     when these Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep,
    </p>
    <p>
     according to the observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves,
    </p>
    <p>
     so many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles,
    </p>
    <p>
     will have about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude.
    </p>
    <p>
     But to render this acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind
    </p>
    <p>
     and the sea must be the whaleman's allies; for of what present avail
    </p>
    <p>
     to the becalmed or wind-bound mariner is the skill that assures him
    </p>
    <p>
     he is exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port?
    </p>
    <p>
     Inferable from these statements, are many collateral subtile matters
    </p>
    <p>
     touching the chase of whales.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when
    </p>
    <p>
     a cannonball, missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up
    </p>
    <p>
     the level field.
    </p>
    <p>
     "By salt and hemp!" cried Stubb, "but this swift motion of the deck
    </p>
    <p>
     creeps up one's legs and tingles at the heart.  This ship and I
    </p>
    <p>
     are two brave fellows!--Ha, ha!  Some one take me up, and launch me,
    </p>
    <p>
     spine-wise, on the sea,--for by live-oaks! my spine's a keel.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ha, ha! we go the gait that leaves no dust behind!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "There she blows--she blows!--she blows!--right ahead!"
    </p>
    <p>
     was now the mast-head cry.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, aye!" cried Stubb, "I knew it--ye can't escape--blow on and split
    </p>
    <p>
     your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow your trump--
    </p>
    <p>
     blister your lungs!--Ahab will dam off your blood, as a miller shuts
    </p>
    <p>
     his watergate upon the stream!"
    </p>
    <p>
     And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew.
    </p>
    <p>
     The frenzies of the chase had by this time worked them
    </p>
    <p>
     bubblingly up, like old wine worked anew.  Whatever pale
    </p>
    <p>
     fears and forebodings some of them might have felt before;
    </p>
    <p>
     these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing
    </p>
    <p>
     awe of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed,
    </p>
    <p>
     as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hand of Fate had snatched all their souls; and by the stirring
    </p>
    <p>
     perils of the previous day; the rack of the past night's suspense;
    </p>
    <p>
     the fixed, unfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild
    </p>
    <p>
     craft went plunging towards its flying mark; by all these things,
    </p>
    <p>
     their hearts were bowled along.  The wind that made great bellies
    </p>
    <p>
     of their sails, and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible
    </p>
    <p>
     as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency
    </p>
    <p>
     which so enslaved them to the race.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were one man, not thirty.  For as the one ship that held them all;
    </p>
    <p>
     though it was put together of all contrasting things--oak, and maple,
    </p>
    <p>
     and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp--yet all these ran
    </p>
    <p>
     into each other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way,
    </p>
    <p>
     both balanced and directed by the long central keel; even so,
    </p>
    <p>
     all the individualities of the crew, this man's valor, that man's fear;
    </p>
    <p>
     guilt and guiltiness, all varieties were welded into oneness,
    </p>
    <p>
     and were all directed to that fatal goal which Ahab their one lord
    </p>
    <p>
     and keel did point to.
    </p>
    <p>
     The rigging lived.  The mast-heads, like the tops of
    </p>
    <p>
     tall palms, were outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Clinging to a spar with one hand, some reached forth the other
    </p>
    <p>
     with impatient wavings; others, shading their eyes from the
    </p>
    <p>
     vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking yards; all the spars
    </p>
    <p>
     in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for their fate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ah! how they still strove through that infinite blueness to seek
    </p>
    <p>
     out the thing that might destroy them!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?" cried Ahab, when, after the
    </p>
    <p>
     lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd
    </p>
    <p>
     jet that way, and then disappears."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken
    </p>
    <p>
     some other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved;
    </p>
    <p>
     for hardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed
    </p>
    <p>
     to its pin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an orchestra,
    </p>
    <p>
     that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharge of rifles.
    </p>
    <p>
     The triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, as--
    </p>
    <p>
     much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet,
    </p>
    <p>
     less than a mile ahead--Moby Dick bodily burst into view!
    </p>
    <p>
     For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not by the peaceable gush
    </p>
    <p>
     of that mystic fountain in his head, did the White Whale now reveal
    </p>
    <p>
     his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure
    </p>
    <p>
     element of air, and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam,
    </p>
    <p>
     shows his place to the distance of seven miles and more.
    </p>
    <p>
     In those moments, the torn, enraged waves he shakes off, seem his mane;
    </p>
    <p>
     in some cases, this breaching is his act of defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There she breaches! there she breaches!" was the cry, as in his
    </p>
    <p>
     immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like
    </p>
    <p>
     to Heaven.  So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved
    </p>
    <p>
     against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised,
    </p>
    <p>
     for the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier;
    </p>
    <p>
     and stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first
    </p>
    <p>
     sparkling intensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower
    </p>
    <p>
     in a vale.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!" cried Ahab, "thy hour and
    </p>
    <p>
     thy harpoon are at hand!--Down! down all of ye, but one man at the fore.
    </p>
    <p>
     The boats!--stand by!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men,
    </p>
    <p>
     like shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays
    </p>
    <p>
     and halyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly
    </p>
    <p>
     was dropped from his perch.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Lower away," he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat--a spare one,
    </p>
    <p>
     rigged the afternoon previous.  "Mr. Starbuck, the ship is thine--
    </p>
    <p>
     keep away from the boats, but keep near them.  Lower, all!"
    </p>
    <p>
     As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being
    </p>
    <p>
     the first assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now
    </p>
    <p>
     coming for the three crews.  Ahab's boat was central; and cheering
    </p>
    <p>
     his men, he told them he would take the whale head-and-head,--
    </p>
    <p>
     that is, pull straight up to his forehead,--a not uncommon thing;
    </p>
    <p>
     for when within a certain limit, such a course excludes
    </p>
    <p>
     the coming onset from the whale's sidelong vision.
    </p>
    <p>
     But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all
    </p>
    <p>
     three boats were plain as the ship's three masts to his eye;
    </p>
    <p>
     the White Whale churning himself into furious speed, almost in
    </p>
    <p>
     an instant as it were, rushing among the boats with open jaws,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a lashing tail, offered appalling battle on every side;
    </p>
    <p>
     and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat,
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank
    </p>
    <p>
     of which those boats were made.  But skilfully manoeuvred,
    </p>
    <p>
     incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field;
    </p>
    <p>
     the boats for a while eluded him; though, at times, but by a
    </p>
    <p>
     plank's breadth; while all the time, Ahab's unearthly slogan
    </p>
    <p>
     tore every other cry but his to shreds.
    </p>
    <p>
     But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so
    </p>
    <p>
     crossed and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack
    </p>
    <p>
     of the three lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened,
    </p>
    <p>
     and, of themselves, warped the devoted boats towards the planted
    </p>
    <p>
     irons in him; though now for a moment the whale drew aside
    </p>
    <p>
     a little, as if to rally for a more tremendous charge.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more line;
    </p>
    <p>
     and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again--
    </p>
    <p>
     hoping that way to disencumber it of some snarls--when lo!--
    </p>
    <p>
     a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of sharks!
    </p>
    <p>
     Caught and twisted--corkscrewed in the mazes of the line,
    </p>
    <p>
     loose harpoons and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points,
    </p>
    <p>
     came flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab's boat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Only one thing could be done.  Seizing the boat-knife, he critically
    </p>
    <p>
     reached within--through--and then, without--the rays of steel;
    </p>
    <p>
     dragged in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman,
    </p>
    <p>
     and then, twice sundering the rope near the chocks--dropped the
    </p>
    <p>
     intercepted fagot of steel into the sea; and was all fast again.
    </p>
    <p>
     That instant, the White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining
    </p>
    <p>
     tangles of the other lines; by so doing, irresistibly dragged
    </p>
    <p>
     the more involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes;
    </p>
    <p>
     dashed them together like two rolling husks on a surf-beaten beach,
    </p>
    <p>
     and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a boiling maelstrom,
    </p>
    <p>
     in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced
    </p>
    <p>
     round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred
    </p>
    <p>
     bowl of punch.
    </p>
    <p>
     While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out
    </p>
    <p>
     after the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture,
    </p>
    <p>
     while aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial,
    </p>
    <p>
     twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks;
    </p>
    <p>
     and Stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up;
    </p>
    <p>
     and while the old man's line--now parting--admitted of his
    </p>
    <p>
     pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he could;--
    </p>
    <p>
     in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted perils,--
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab's yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards Heaven by
    </p>
    <p>
     invisible wires,--as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly from the sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom,
    </p>
    <p>
     and sent it turning over and over, into the air; till it fell again--
    </p>
    <p>
     gunwale downwards--and Ahab and his men struggled out from under it,
    </p>
    <p>
     like seals from a sea-side cave.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first uprising momentum of the whale--modifying its direction
    </p>
    <p>
     as he struck the surface--involuntarily launched him along it,
    </p>
    <p>
     to a little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made;
    </p>
    <p>
     and with his back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling
    </p>
    <p>
     with his flukes from side to side; and whenever a stray oar,
    </p>
    <p>
     bit of plank, the least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin,
    </p>
    <p>
     his tail swiftly drew back, and came sideways smiting the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     But soon, as if satisfied that his work for that time was done,
    </p>
    <p>
     he pushed his pleated forehead through the ocean, and trailing
    </p>
    <p>
     after him the intertangled lines, continued his leeward way
    </p>
    <p>
     at a traveller's methodic pace.
    </p>
    <p>
     As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight,
    </p>
    <p>
     again came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat,
    </p>
    <p>
     picked up the floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else
    </p>
    <p>
     could be caught at, and safely landed them on her decks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some sprained shoulders, wrists, and ankles; livid contusions;
    </p>
    <p>
     wrenched harpoons and lances; inextricable intricacies of rope;
    </p>
    <p>
     shattered oars and planks; all these were there; but no
    </p>
    <p>
     fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one.
    </p>
    <p>
     As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now found grimly clinging
    </p>
    <p>
     to his boat's broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy float;
    </p>
    <p>
     nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day's mishap.
    </p>
    <p>
     But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him;
    </p>
    <p>
     as instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder
    </p>
    <p>
     of Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him.
    </p>
    <p>
     His ivory leg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp splinter.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, aye, Starbuck, 'tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner
    </p>
    <p>
     who he will; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has."
    </p>
    <p>
     "The ferrule has not stood, sir," said the carpenter, now coming up;
    </p>
    <p>
     I put good work into that leg."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But no bones broken, sir, I hope," said Stubb with true concern.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!--d'ye see it.--
    </p>
    <p>
     But even with a broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account
    </p>
    <p>
     no living bone of mine one jot more me, than this dead one
    </p>
    <p>
     that's lost.  Nor white whale, nor man, nor fiend, can so much
    </p>
    <p>
     as graze old Ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being.
    </p>
    <p>
     Can any lead touch yonder floor, any mast scrape yonder roof?--
    </p>
    <p>
     Aloft there! which way?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Dead to leeward, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down
    </p>
    <p>
     the rest of the spare boats and rig them--Mr. Starbuck away,
    </p>
    <p>
     and muster the boat's crews."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now!  Accursed fate!
    </p>
    <p>
     that the unconquerable captain in the soul should have such
    </p>
    <p>
     a craven mate!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "My body, man, not thee.  Give me something for a cane--there, that
    </p>
    <p>
     shivered lance will do.  Muster the men.  Surely I have not seen him yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     By heaven it cannot be!--missing?--quick! call them all."
    </p>
    <p>
     The old man's hinted thought was true.  Upon mustering the company,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Parsee was not there.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The Parsee!" cried Stubb--"he must have been caught in-"
    </p>
    <p>
     "The black vomit wrench thee!--run all of ye above,
    </p>
    <p>
     alow, cabin, forecastle--find him--not gone--not gone!"
    </p>
    <p>
     But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee
    </p>
    <p>
     was nowhere to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, sir," said Stubb--"caught among the tangles of your line--
    </p>
    <p>
     I thought I saw him dragging under."
    </p>
    <p>
     "My line! my line?  Gone?--gone?  What means that little word?--
    </p>
    <p>
     What death-knell rings in it, that old Ahab shakes as if he were
    </p>
    <p>
     the belfry.  The harpoon, too!--toss over the litter there,--
    </p>
    <p>
     d'ye see it?--the forged iron, men, the white whale's--no, no, no,--
    </p>
    <p>
     blistered fool; this hand did dart it!--'tis in the fish!--Aloft there!
    </p>
    <p>
     Keep him nailed-Quick!--all hands to the rigging of the boats--
    </p>
    <p>
     collect the oars--harpooneers! the irons, the irons!--hoist the
    </p>
    <p>
     royals higher--a pull on all the sheets!--helm there! steady,
    </p>
    <p>
     steady for your life!  I'll ten times girdle the unmeasured globe;
    </p>
    <p>
     yea and dive straight through it, but I'll slay him yet!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Great God! but for one single instant show thyself,"
    </p>
    <p>
     cried Starbuck; "never, never wilt thou capture him, old man--
    </p>
    <p>
     In Jesus' name no more of this, that's worse than devil's madness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Two days chased; twice stove to splinters; thy very leg once
    </p>
    <p>
     more snatched from under thee; thy evil shadow gone--all good
    </p>
    <p>
     angels mobbing thee with warnings:--what more wouldst thou have?--
    </p>
    <p>
     Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he swamps the last man?
    </p>
    <p>
     Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea?
    </p>
    <p>
     Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world?  Oh, oh,--
    </p>
    <p>
     Impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Starbuck, of late I've felt strangely moved to thee; ever since
    </p>
    <p>
     that hour we both saw--thou know'st what, in one another's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     But in this matter of the whale, be the front of thy face
    </p>
    <p>
     to me as the palm of this hand--a lipless, unfeatured blank.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab is for ever Ahab, man.  This whole act's immutably decreed.
    </p>
    <p>
     'Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion years before this
    </p>
    <p>
     ocean rolled.  Fool!  I am the Fates' lieutenant; I act under orders.
    </p>
    <p>
     Look thou, underling! that thou obeyest mine.--Stand round men, men.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ye see an old man cut down to the stump; leaning on a shivered lance;
    </p>
    <p>
     propped up on a lonely foot.  'Tis Ahab--his body's part;
    </p>
    <p>
     but Ahab's soul's a centipede, that moves upon a hundred legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     I feel strained, half-stranded, as ropes that tow dismasted frigates
    </p>
    <p>
     in a gale; and I may look so.  But ere I break, yell hear me crack;
    </p>
    <p>
     and till ye hear that, know that Ahab's hawser tows his purpose yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Believe ye, men, in the things called omens?  Then laugh aloud,
    </p>
    <p>
     and cry encore!  For ere they drown, drowning things will twice
    </p>
    <p>
     rise to the surface; then rise again, to sink for evermore.
    </p>
    <p>
     So with Moby Dick--two days he's floated--to-morrow will be the third.
    </p>
    <p>
     Aye, men, he'll rise once more,--but only to spout his last!
    </p>
    <p>
     D'ye feel brave men, brave?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "As fearless fire," cried Stubb.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And as mechanical," muttered Ahab.  Then as the men went forward,
    </p>
    <p>
     he muttered on:  "The things called omens!  And yesterday I talked
    </p>
    <p>
     the same to Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat.  Oh! how valiantly
    </p>
    <p>
     I seek to drive out of others' hearts what's clinched so fast in mine!--
    </p>
    <p>
     The Parsee--the Parsee!--gone, gone? and he was to go before:--
    </p>
    <p>
     but still was to be seen again ere I could perish--How's that?--
    </p>
    <p>
     There's a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts
    </p>
    <p>
     of the whole line of judges:--like a hawk's beak it pecks my brain.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll, I'll solve it, though!"
    </p>
    <p>
     When dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.
    </p>
    <p>
     So once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed
    </p>
    <p>
     nearly as on the previous night; only, the sound of hammers,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the hum of the grindstone was heard till nearly daylight,
    </p>
    <p>
     as the men toiled by lanterns in the complete and careful
    </p>
    <p>
     rigging of the spare boats and sharpening their fresh weapons
    </p>
    <p>
     for the morrow.  Meantime, of the broken keel of Ahab's wrecked
    </p>
    <p>
     craft the carpenter made him another leg; while still as on
    </p>
    <p>
     the night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed within his scuttle;
    </p>
    <p>
     his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial;
    </p>
    <p>
     sat due eastward for the earliest sun.

     CHAPTER 135
    </head>
    <p>
     The Chase - Third Day
    </p>
    <p>
     The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once
    </p>
    <p>
     more the solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved
    </p>
    <p>
     by crowds of the daylight look-outs, who dotted every mast
    </p>
    <p>
     and almost every spar.
    </p>
    <p>
     "D'ye see him?" cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
     "In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that's all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Helm there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going.
    </p>
    <p>
     What a lovely day again! were it a new-made world, and made for
    </p>
    <p>
     a summer-house to the angels, and this morning the first of its
    </p>
    <p>
     throwing open to them, a fairer day could not dawn upon that world.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here's food for thought, had Ahab time to think; but Ahab never thinks;
    </p>
    <p>
     he only feels, feels, feels; that's tingling enough for mortal
    </p>
    <p>
     man! to think's audacity.  God only has that right and privilege.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness and a calmness; and our
    </p>
    <p>
     poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too much for that.
    </p>
    <p>
     And yet, I've sometimes thought my brain was very calm--
    </p>
    <p>
     frozen calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which
    </p>
    <p>
     the contents turned to ice, and shiver it.  And still this hair
    </p>
    <p>
     is growing now; this moment growing, and heat must breed it;
    </p>
    <p>
     but no, it's like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere,
    </p>
    <p>
     between the earthy clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava.
    </p>
    <p>
     How the wild winds blow it; they whip it about me as the torn
    </p>
    <p>
     shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to.
    </p>
    <p>
     A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors
    </p>
    <p>
     and cells, and wards of hospitals, and ventilated them, and now comes
    </p>
    <p>
     blowing hither as innocent as fleeces.  Out upon it!--it's tainted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Were I the wind, I'd blow no more on such a wicked, miserable world.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'd crawl somewhere to a cave, and slink there.  And yet,
    </p>
    <p>
     'tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind! who ever conquered it?
    </p>
    <p>
     In every fight it has the last and bitterest blow.  Run tilting
    </p>
    <p>
     at it, and you but run through it.  Ha! a coward wind that strikes
    </p>
    <p>
     stark naked men, but will not stand to receive a single blow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even Ahab is a braver thing--a nobler thing than that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Would now the wind but had a body; but all the things that most
    </p>
    <p>
     exasperate and outrage mortal man, all these things are bodiless,
    </p>
    <p>
     but only bodiless as objects, not as agents.  There's a
    </p>
    <p>
     most special, a most cunning, oh, a most malicious difference!
    </p>
    <p>
     And yet, I say again, and swear it now, that there's something
    </p>
    <p>
     all glorious and gracious in the wind.  These warm Trade Winds,
    </p>
    <p>
     at least, that in the clear heavens blow straight on, in strong
    </p>
    <p>
     and steadfast, vigorous mildness; and veer not from their mark,
    </p>
    <p>
     however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack,
    </p>
    <p>
     and mightiest Mississippies of the land swift and swerve about,
    </p>
    <p>
     uncertain where to go at last.  And by the eternal Poles!
    </p>
    <p>
     these same Trades that so directly blow my good ship on;
    </p>
    <p>
     these Trades, or something like them--something so unchangeable,
    </p>
    <p>
     and full as strong, blow my keeled soul along!  To it!  Aloft there!
    </p>
    <p>
     What d'ye see?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nothing, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nothing! and noon at hand!  The doubloon goes a-begging! See
    </p>
    <p>
     the sun!  Aye, aye, it must be so.  I've over-sailed him.
    </p>
    <p>
     How, got the start?  Aye, he's chasing me now; not I, him--
    </p>
    <p>
     that's bad; I might have known it, too.  Fool! the lines--
    </p>
    <p>
     the harpoons he's towing.  Aye, aye, I have run him by last night.
    </p>
    <p>
     About! about!  Come down, all of ye, but the regular look outs!
    </p>
    <p>
     Man the braces!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Steering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the
    </p>
    <p>
     Pequod's quarter, so that now being pointed in the reverse direction,
    </p>
    <p>
     the braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned
    </p>
    <p>
     the cream in her own white wake.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw," murmured Starbuck
    </p>
    <p>
     to himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
     "God keep us, but already my bones feel damp within me, and from
    </p>
    <p>
     the inside wet my flesh.  I misdoubt me that I disobey my God
    </p>
    <p>
     in obeying him!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Stand by to sway me up!" cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen basket.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We should meet him soon."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, aye, sir," and straightway Starbuck did Ahab's bidding,
    </p>
    <p>
     and once more Ahab swung on high.
    </p>
    <p>
     A whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages.
    </p>
    <p>
     Time itself now held long breaths with keen suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
     But at last, some three points off the weather bow, Ahab descried
    </p>
    <p>
     the spout again, and instantly from the three mast-heads
    </p>
    <p>
     three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Forehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick!
    </p>
    <p>
     On deck there!--brace sharper up; crowd her into the wind's eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     He's too far off to lower yet, Mr. Starbuck.  The sails shake!
    </p>
    <p>
     Stand over that helmsman with a top-maul! So, so; he travels fast,
    </p>
    <p>
     and I must down.  But let me have one more good round look aloft
    </p>
    <p>
     here at the sea; there's time for that.  An old, old sight, and yet
    </p>
    <p>
     somehow so young; aye, and not changed a wink since I first saw it,
    </p>
    <p>
     a boy, from the sand-hills of Nantucket!  The same--the same!--
    </p>
    <p>
     the same to Noah as to me.  There's a soft shower to leeward.
    </p>
    <p>
     Such lovely leewardings!  They must lead somewhere--
    </p>
    <p>
     to something else than common land, more palmy than the palms.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leeward! the white whale goes that way; look to windward, then;
    </p>
    <p>
     the better if the bitterer quarter.  But good bye, good bye,
    </p>
    <p>
     old mast-head! What's this?--green? aye, tiny mosses in these
    </p>
    <p>
     warped cracks.  No such green weather stains on Ahab's head!
    </p>
    <p>
     There's the difference now between man's old age and matter's.
    </p>
    <p>
     But aye, old mast, we both grow old together; sound in our hulls,
    </p>
    <p>
     though are we not, my ship?  Aye, minus a leg, that's all.
    </p>
    <p>
     By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way.
    </p>
    <p>
     I can't compare with it; and I've known some ships made of dead trees
    </p>
    <p>
     outlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of vital fathers.
    </p>
    <p>
     What's that he said? he should still go before me, my pilot;
    </p>
    <p>
     and yet to be seen again?  But where?  Will I have eyes at
    </p>
    <p>
     the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs?
    </p>
    <p>
     and all night I've been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Aye, aye, like many more thou told'st direful truth as
    </p>
    <p>
     touching thyself, O Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short.
    </p>
    <p>
     Good bye, mast-head--keep a good eye upon the whale, the while I'm gone.
    </p>
    <p>
     We'll talk to-morrow, nay, to-night, when the white whale lies
    </p>
    <p>
     down there, tied by head and tail."
    </p>
    <p>
     He gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered
    </p>
    <p>
     through the cloven blue air to the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
     In due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his
    </p>
    <p>
     shallop's stern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent,
    </p>
    <p>
     he waved to the mate,--who held one of the tackle--ropes on deck--
    </p>
    <p>
     and bade him pause.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Starbuck!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "For the third time my soul's ship starts upon this voyage, Starbuck."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aye, sir, thou wilt have it so."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Some ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards
    </p>
    <p>
     are missing, Starbuck!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Truth, sir:  saddest truth."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Some men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full
    </p>
    <p>
     of the flood;--and I feel now like a billow that's all one
    </p>
    <p>
     crested comb, Starbuck.  I am old;--shake hands with me, man."
    </p>
    <p>
     Their hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuck's tears the glue.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, my captain, my captain!--noble heart--go not--go not!--see, it's a
    </p>
    <p>
     brave man that weeps; how great the agony of the persuasion then!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Lower away!"-cried Ahab, tossing the mate's arm from him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Stand by for the crew!"
    </p>
    <p>
     In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The sharks! the sharks!" cried a voice from the low cabin-window there;
    </p>
    <p>
     "O master, my master, come back!"
    </p>
    <p>
     But Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then;
    </p>
    <p>
     and the boat leaped on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship,
    </p>
    <p>
     when numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters
    </p>
    <p>
     beneath the hull, maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars,
    </p>
    <p>
     every time they dipped in the water; and in this way accompanied
    </p>
    <p>
     the boat with their bites.  It is a thing not uncommonly happening
    </p>
    <p>
     to the whale-boats in those swarming seas; the sharks at times
    </p>
    <p>
     apparently following them in the same prescient way that vultures
    </p>
    <p>
     hover over the banners of marching regiments in the east.
    </p>
    <p>
     But these were the first sharks that had been observed by the Pequod
    </p>
    <p>
     since the White Whale had been first descried; and whether it
    </p>
    <p>
     was that Ahab's crew were all such tiger-yellow barbarians,
    </p>
    <p>
     and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the sharks--
    </p>
    <p>
     a matter sometimes well known to affect them,--however it was,
    </p>
    <p>
     they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Heart of wrought steel!" murmured Starbuck gazing over the side,
    </p>
    <p>
     and following with his eyes the receding boat--"canst thou
    </p>
    <p>
     yet ring boldly to that sight?--lowering thy keel among
    </p>
    <p>
     ravening sharks, and followed by them, open-mouthed to the chase;
    </p>
    <p>
     and this the critical third day?--For when three days
    </p>
    <p>
     flow together in one continuous intense pursuit; be sure
    </p>
    <p>
     the first is the morning, the second the noon, and the third
    </p>
    <p>
     the evening and the end of that thing--be that end what it may.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh! my God! what is this that shoots through me, and leaves me
    </p>
    <p>
     so deadly calm, yet expectant,--fixed at the top of a shudder!
    </p>
    <p>
     Future things swim before me, as in empty outlines and skeletons;
    </p>
    <p>
     all the past is somehow grown dim.  Mary, girl; thou fadest
    </p>
    <p>
     in pale glories behind me; boy!  I seem to see but thy eyes
    </p>
    <p>
     grown wondrous blue.  Strangest problems of life seem clearing;
    </p>
    <p>
     but clouds sweep between--Is my journey's end coming?
    </p>
    <p>
     My legs feel faint; like his who has footed it all day.
    </p>
    <p>
     Feel thy heart,--beats it yet?  Stir thyself, Starbuck!--
    </p>
    <p>
     stave it off--move, move! speak aloud!--Mast-head there!
    </p>
    <p>
     See ye my boy's hand on the hill?--Crazed; aloft there!--
    </p>
    <p>
     keep thy keenest eye upon the boats:--mark well the whale!--
    </p>
    <p>
     Ho! again!--drive off that hawk! see! he pecks--he tears the vane"--
    </p>
    <p>
     pointing to the red flag flying at the main-truck--"Ha, he soars
    </p>
    <p>
     away with it!--Where's the old man now? see'st thou that sight,
    </p>
    <p>
     oh Ahab!--shudder, shudder!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the mast-heads--
    </p>
    <p>
     a downward pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had sounded;
    </p>
    <p>
     but intending to be near him at the next rising, he held on his way
    </p>
    <p>
     a little sideways from the vessel; the becharmed crew maintaining
    </p>
    <p>
     the profoundest silence, as the head-bent waves hammered and hammered
    </p>
    <p>
     against the opposing bow.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Drive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost
    </p>
    <p>
     heads drive them in! ye but strike a thing without a lid;
    </p>
    <p>
     and no coffin and no hearse can be mine:--and hemp only can
    </p>
    <p>
     kill me!  Ha! ha!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles;
    </p>
    <p>
     then quickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged
    </p>
    <p>
     berg of ice, swiftly rising to the surface.  A low rumbling sound
    </p>
    <p>
     was heard; a subterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths;
    </p>
    <p>
     as bedraggled with trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances,
    </p>
    <p>
     a vast form shot lengthwise, but obliquely from the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist, it hovered for a moment
    </p>
    <p>
     in the rainbowed air; and then fell swamping back into the deep.
    </p>
    <p>
     Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for an instant
    </p>
    <p>
     like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of flakes,
    </p>
    <p>
     leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble
    </p>
    <p>
     trunk of the whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Give way!" cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward to
    </p>
    <p>
     the attack; but maddened by yesterday's fresh irons that corroded in him,
    </p>
    <p>
     Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell
    </p>
    <p>
     from heaven.  The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad
    </p>
    <p>
     white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted together;
    </p>
    <p>
     as head on, he came churning his tail among the boats; and once more
    </p>
    <p>
     flailed them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from the two mates'
    </p>
    <p>
     boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows,
    </p>
    <p>
     but leaving Ahab's almost without a scar.
    </p>
    <p>
     While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks;
    </p>
    <p>
     and as the whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed
    </p>
    <p>
     one entire flank as he shot by them again; at that moment
    </p>
    <p>
     a quick cry went up.  Lashed round and round to the fish's back;
    </p>
    <p>
     pinioned in the turns upon turns in which, during the past night,
    </p>
    <p>
     the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him,
    </p>
    <p>
     the half torn body of the Parsee was seen; his sable raiment
    </p>
    <p>
     frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full upon old Ahab.
    </p>
    <p>
     The harpoon dropped from his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Befooled, befooled!"--drawing in a long lean breath--"Aye, Parsee!  I see
    </p>
    <p>
     thee again.--Aye, and thou goest before; and this, this then is the hearse
    </p>
    <p>
     that thou didst promise.  But I hold thee to the last letter of thy word.
    </p>
    <p>
     Where is the second hearse?  Away, mates, to the ship! those boats
    </p>
    <p>
     are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and return to me;
    </p>
    <p>
     if not, Ahab is enough to die--Down, men! the first thing that but
    </p>
    <p>
     offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I harpoon.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ye are not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey me.--
    </p>
    <p>
     Where's the whale? gone down again?"
    </p>
    <p>
     But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping
    </p>
    <p>
     with the corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last
    </p>
    <p>
     encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick
    </p>
    <p>
     was now again steadily swimming forward; and had almost passed
    </p>
    <p>
     the ship,--which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction
    </p>
    <p>
     to him, though for the present her headway had been stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
     He seemed swimming with his utmost velocity, and now only intent
    </p>
    <p>
     upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh!  Ahab," cried Starbuck, "not too late is it, even now,
    </p>
    <p>
     the third day, to desist.  See!  Moby Dick seeks thee not.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is thou, thou, that madly seekest him!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Setting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was
    </p>
    <p>
     swiftly impelled to leeward, by both oars and canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
     And at last when Ahab was sliding by the vessel, so near
    </p>
    <p>
     as plainly to distinguish Starbuck's face as he leaned
    </p>
    <p>
     over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about,
    </p>
    <p>
     and follow him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval.
    </p>
    <p>
     Glancing upwards he saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo,
    </p>
    <p>
     eagerly mounting to the three mast-heads; while the oarsmen
    </p>
    <p>
     were rocking in the two staved boats which had but just been
    </p>
    <p>
     hoisted to the side, and were busily at work in repairing them.
    </p>
    <p>
     One after the other, through the port-holes, as he sped,
    </p>
    <p>
     he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask,
    </p>
    <p>
     busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances.
    </p>
    <p>
     As he saw all this; as he heard the hammers in the broken boats;
    </p>
    <p>
     far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     But he rallied.  And now marking that the vane or flag
    </p>
    <p>
     was gone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego,
    </p>
    <p>
     who had just gained that perch, to descend again for another flag,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a hammer and nails, and so nail it to the mast.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether fagged by the three days' running chase, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     resistance to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore;
    </p>
    <p>
     or whether it was some latent deceitfulness and malice in him:
    </p>
    <p>
     whichever was true, the White Whale's way now began to abate,
    </p>
    <p>
     as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly nearing him once more;
    </p>
    <p>
     though indeed the whale's last start had not been so long a one
    </p>
    <p>
     as before.  And still as Ahab glided over the waves the unpitying
    </p>
    <p>
     sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat;
    </p>
    <p>
     and so continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades
    </p>
    <p>
     became jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in the sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     at almost every dip.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pull on! 'tis the better rest, the sharks' jaw than the yielding water."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "They will last long enough! pull on!--But who can tell"--
    </p>
    <p>
     he muttered--"whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale
    </p>
    <p>
     or on Ahab?--But pull on!  Aye, all alive, now--we near him.
    </p>
    <p>
     The helm! take the helm! let me pass,"--and so saying two of the
    </p>
    <p>
     oarsmen helped him forward to the bows of the still flying boat.
    </p>
    <p>
     At length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging
    </p>
    <p>
     along with the White Whale's flank, he seemed strangely
    </p>
    <p>
     oblivious of its advance--as the whale sometimes will--and Ahab
    </p>
    <p>
     was fairly within the smoky mountain mist, which, thrown off
    </p>
    <p>
     from the whale's spout, curled round his great Monadnock hump;
    </p>
    <p>
     he was even thus close to him; when, with body arched back,
    </p>
    <p>
     and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the poise, he darted
    </p>
    <p>
     his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the hated whale.
    </p>
    <p>
     As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked into
    </p>
    <p>
     a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled
    </p>
    <p>
     his nigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole
    </p>
    <p>
     in it, so suddenly canted the boat over, that had it not been
    </p>
    <p>
     for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung,
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     As it was, three of the oarsmen--who foreknew not the precise
    </p>
    <p>
     instant of the dart, and were therefore unprepared for its effects--
    </p>
    <p>
     these were flung out; but so fell, that, in an instant two
    </p>
    <p>
     of them clutched the gunwale again, and rising to its level on
    </p>
    <p>
     a combing wave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again; the third
    </p>
    <p>
     man helplessly dropping astern, but still afloat and swimming.
    </p>
    <p>
     Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,
    </p>
    <p>
     instantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the
    </p>
    <p>
     weltering sea.  But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take
    </p>
    <p>
     new turns with the line, and hold it so; and commanded the crew
    </p>
    <p>
     to turn round on their seats, and tow the boat up to the mark;
    </p>
    <p>
     the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug,
    </p>
    <p>
     it snapped in the empty air!
    </p>
    <p>
     "What breaks in me?  Some sinew cracks!--'tis whole again; oars! oars!
    </p>
    <p>
     Burst in upon him!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale
    </p>
    <p>
     wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay; but in
    </p>
    <p>
     that evolution, catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship;
    </p>
    <p>
     seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions;
    </p>
    <p>
     bethinking it--it may be--a larger and nobler foe; of a sudden,
    </p>
    <p>
     he bore down upon its advancing prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery
    </p>
    <p>
     showers of foam.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead.  "I grow blind;
    </p>
    <p>
     hands! stretch out before me that I may yet grope my way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Is't night?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "The whale!  The ship!" cried the cringing oarsmen.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oars! oars!  Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea that ere
    </p>
    <p>
     it be for ever too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time
    </p>
    <p>
     upon his mark!  I see:  the ship! the ship!  Dash on, my men!
    </p>
    <p>
     Will ye not save my ship?"
    </p>
    <p>
     But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through
    </p>
    <p>
     the sledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends
    </p>
    <p>
     of two planks burst through, and in an instant almost,
    </p>
    <p>
     the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves;
    </p>
    <p>
     its half-wading, splashing crew, trying hard to stop the gap
    </p>
    <p>
     and bale out the pouring water.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego's mast-head
    </p>
    <p>
     hammer remained suspended in his hand; and the red flag,
    </p>
    <p>
     half-wrapping him as with a plaid, then streamed itself
    </p>
    <p>
     straight out from him, as his own forward-flowing heart;
    </p>
    <p>
     while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the bowsprit beneath,
    </p>
    <p>
     caught sight of the down-coming monster just as soon as he.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The whale, the whale!  Up helm, up helm!  Oh, all ye sweet powers
    </p>
    <p>
     of air, now hug me close!  Let not Starbuck die, if die he must,
    </p>
    <p>
     in a woman's fainting fit.  Up helm, I say--ye fools, the jaw! the jaw!
    </p>
    <p>
     Is this the end of all my bursting prayers? all my life-long fidelities?
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, Ahab, Ahab, lo, thy work.  Steady! helmsman, steady.  Nay, nay!
    </p>
    <p>
     Up helm again!  He turns to meet us!  Oh, his unappeasable brow
    </p>
    <p>
     drives on towards one, whose duty tells him he cannot depart.
    </p>
    <p>
     My God, stand by me now!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Stand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will
    </p>
    <p>
     now help Stubb; for Stubb, too, sticks here.  I grin at thee,
    </p>
    <p>
     thou grinning whale!  Who ever helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake,
    </p>
    <p>
     but Stubb's own unwinking eye?  And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon
    </p>
    <p>
     a mattrass that is all too soft; would it were stuffed with brushwood!
    </p>
    <p>
     I grin at thee, thou grinning whale!  Look ye, sun, moon, and stars!
    </p>
    <p>
     I call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
     For all that, I would yet ring glasses with ye, would ye but hand
    </p>
    <p>
     the cup!  Oh, oh! oh, oh! thou grinning whale, but there'll be
    </p>
    <p>
     plenty of gulping soon!  Why fly ye not, O Ahab!  For me, off shoes
    </p>
    <p>
     and jacket to it; let Stubb die in his drawers!  A most mouldy
    </p>
    <p>
     and over salted death, though;--cherries! cherries! cherries!
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, Flask, for one red cherry ere we die!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Cherries?  I only wish that we were where they grow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, Stubb, I hope my poor mother's drawn my part-pay ere this;
    </p>
    <p>
     if not, few coppers will now come to her, for the voyage is up."
    </p>
    <p>
     From the ship's bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive;
    </p>
    <p>
     hammers, bits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained
    </p>
    <p>
     in their hands, just as they had darted from their various employments;
    </p>
    <p>
     all their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale, which from side
    </p>
    <p>
     to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head, sent a broad
    </p>
    <p>
     band of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Retribution, swift vengeance, eternal malice were in his whole aspect,
    </p>
    <p>
     and spite of all that mortal man could do, the solid white buttress of his
    </p>
    <p>
     forehead smote the ship's starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some fell flat upon their faces.  Like dislodged trucks,
    </p>
    <p>
     the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their bull-like necks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Through the breach, they heard the waters pour, as mountain torrents
    </p>
    <p>
     down a flume.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The ship!  The hearse!--the second hearse!" cried Ahab from the boat;
    </p>
    <p>
     "its wood could only be American!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Diving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its keel;
    </p>
    <p>
     but turning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far off
    </p>
    <p>
     the other bow, but within a few yards of Ahab's boat, where, for a time,
    </p>
    <p>
     he lay quiescent.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I turn my body from the sun.  What ho, Tashtego!  Let me
    </p>
    <p>
     hear thy hammer.  Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine;
    </p>
    <p>
     thou uncracked keel; and only god-bullied hull; thou firm deck,
    </p>
    <p>
     and haughty helm, and Pole-pointed prow,--death--glorious ship! must
    </p>
    <p>
     ye then perish, and without me?  Am I cut off from the last fond pride
    </p>
    <p>
     of meanest shipwrecked captains?  Oh, lonely death on lonely life!
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, now I feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ho, ho! from all your furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows
    </p>
    <p>
     of my whole foregone life, and top this one piled comber of my death!
    </p>
    <p>
     Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale;
    </p>
    <p>
     to the last I grapple with thee; from hell's heart I stab at thee;
    </p>
    <p>
     for hate's sake I spit my last breath at thee.  Sink all coffins
    </p>
    <p>
     and all hearses to one common pool! and since neither can be mine,
    </p>
    <p>
     let me then tow to pieces, while still chasing thee, though tied
    </p>
    <p>
     to thee, thou damned whale!  Thus, I give up the spear!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The harpoon was darted; the stricken whale flew forward;
    </p>
    <p>
     with igniting velocity the line ran through the grooves;--ran foul.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahab stooped to clear it; he did clear it; but the flying turn caught him
    </p>
    <p>
     round the neck, and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim,
    </p>
    <p>
     he was shot out of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Next instant, the heavy eye-splice in the rope's final end flew out
    </p>
    <p>
     of the stark-empty tub, knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     disappeared in its depths.
    </p>
    <p>
     For an instant, the tranced boat's crew stood still; then turned.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The ship?  Great God, where is the ship?"  Soon they through dim,
    </p>
    <p>
     bewildering mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the gaseous
    </p>
    <p>
     Fata Morgana; only the uppermost masts out of water; while fixed
    </p>
    <p>
     by infatuation, or fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty perches,
    </p>
    <p>
     the pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking look-outs on
    </p>
    <p>
     the sea.  And now, concentric circles seized the lone boat itself,
    </p>
    <p>
     and all its crew, and each floating oar, and every lancepole,
    </p>
    <p>
     and spinning, animate and inanimate, all round and round in one vortex,
    </p>
    <p>
     carried the smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
     But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over
    </p>
    <p>
     the sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches
    </p>
    <p>
     of the erect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards
    </p>
    <p>
     of the flag, which calmly undulated, with ironical coincidings,
    </p>
    <p>
     over the destroying billows they almost touched;--at that instant, a red
    </p>
    <p>
     arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act
    </p>
    <p>
     of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar.
    </p>
    <p>
     A sky-hawk that tauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards
    </p>
    <p>
     from its natural home among the stars, pecking at the flag,
    </p>
    <p>
     and incommoding Tashtego there; this bird now chanced to intercept
    </p>
    <p>
     its broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood;
    </p>
    <p>
     and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill, the submerged
    </p>
    <p>
     savage beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his hammer frozen there;
    </p>
    <p>
     and so the bird of heaven, with archangelic shrieks, and his imperial
    </p>
    <p>
     beak thrust upwards, and his whole captive form folded in the flag
    </p>
    <p>
     of Ahab, went down with his ship, which, like Satan, would not sink
    </p>
    <p>
     to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her,
    </p>
    <p>
     and helmeted herself with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf;
    </p>
    <p>
     a sullen white surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five
    </p>
    <p>
     thousand years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     Epilogue
    </p>
    <p>
     "AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE"
    </p>
    <p>
     Job.
    </p>
    <p>
     The drama's done.  Why then here does any one step forth?--
    </p>
    <p>
     Because one did survive the wreck.
    </p>
    <p>
     It so chanced, that after the Parsee's disappearance, I was
    </p>
    <p>
     he whom the Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab's bowsman,
    </p>
    <p>
     when that bowsman assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on
    </p>
    <p>
     the last day the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat,
    </p>
    <p>
     was dropped astern.  So, floating on the margin of the ensuing scene,
    </p>
    <p>
     and in full sight of it, when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship
    </p>
    <p>
     reached me, I was then, but slowly, drawn towards the closing vortex.
    </p>
    <p>
     When I reached it, it had subsided to a creamy pool.
    </p>
    <p>
     Round and round, then, and ever contracting towards the button-like
    </p>
    <p>
     black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle,
    </p>
    <p>
     like another Ixion I did revolve.  Till, gaining that vital centre,
    </p>
    <p>
     the black bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by reason of its
    </p>
    <p>
     cunning spring, and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising with great force,
    </p>
    <p>
     the coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea, fell over,
    </p>
    <p>
     and floated by my side.  Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost
    </p>
    <p>
     one whole day and night, I floated on a soft and dirgelike main.
    </p>
    <p>
     The unharming sharks, they glided by as if with padlocks on
    </p>
    <p>
     their mouths; the savage sea-hawks sailed with sheathed beaks.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the second day, a sail drew near, nearer, and picked me up at last.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the devious-cruising Rachel, that in her retracing search
    </p>
    <p>
     after her missing children, only found another orphan.
