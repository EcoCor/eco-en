     CHAPTER I
    </head>
    <p>
     A PRIVATE LESSON FROM A BULLDOG.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Want to be a school-master, do you? You? Well, what would _you_ do in
    </p>
    <p>
     Flat Crick deestrick, _I'd_ like to know? Why, the boys have driv off
    </p>
    <p>
     the last two, and licked the one afore them like blazes. You might teach
    </p>
    <p>
     a summer school, when nothin' but children come. But I 'low it takes a
    </p>
    <p>
     right smart _man_ to be school-master in Flat Crick in the winter.
    </p>
    <p>
     They'd pitch you out of doors, sonny, neck and heels, afore Christmas."
    </p>
    <p>
     The young man, who had walked ten miles to get the school in this
    </p>
    <p>
     district, and who had been mentally reviewing his learning at every step
    </p>
    <p>
     he took, trembling lest the committee should find that he did not know
    </p>
    <p>
     enough, was not a little taken aback at this greeting from "old Jack
    </p>
    <p>
     Means," who was the first trustee that he lighted on. The impression
    </p>
    <p>
     made by these ominous remarks was emphasized by the glances which he
    </p>
    <p>
     received from Jack Means's two sons. The older one eyed him from the top
    </p>
    <p>
     of his brawny shoulders with that amiable look which a big dog turns on
    </p>
    <p>
     a little one before shaking him. Ralph Hartsook had never thought of
    </p>
    <p>
     being measured by the standard of muscle. This notion of beating
    </p>
    <p>
     education into young savages in spite of themselves dashed his ardor.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had walked right to where Jack Means was at work shaving shingles in
    </p>
    <p>
     his own front yard. While Mr. Means was making the speech which we have
    </p>
    <p>
     set down above, and punctuating it with expectorations, a large brindle
    </p>
    <p>
     bulldog had been sniffing at Ralph's heels, and a girl in a new
    </p>
    <p>
     linsey-woolsey dress, standing by the door, had nearly giggled her head
    </p>
    <p>
     off at the delightful prospect of seeing a new school-teacher eaten up
    </p>
    <p>
     by the ferocious brute.
    </p>
    <p>
     The disheartening words of the old man, the immense muscles of the young
    </p>
    <p>
     man who was to be his rebellious pupil, the jaws of the ugly bulldog,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the heartless giggle of the girl, gave Ralph a delightful sense of
    </p>
    <p>
     having precipitated himself into a den of wild beasts. Faint with
    </p>
    <p>
     weariness and discouragement, and shivering with fear, he sat down on a
    </p>
    <p>
     wheelbarrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You, Bull!" said the old man to the dog, which was showing more and
    </p>
    <p>
     more a disposition to make a meal of the incipient pedagogue, "you,
    </p>
    <p>
     Bull! git aout[2], you pup!" The dog walked sullenly off, but not until
    </p>
    <p>
     he had given Ralph a look full of promise of what he meant to do when he
    </p>
    <p>
     got a good chance. Ralph wished himself back in the village of
    </p>
    <p>
     Lewisburg, whence he had come.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You see," continued Mr. Means, spitting in a meditative sort of a way,
    </p>
    <p>
     "you see, we a'n't none of your saft sort in these diggings. It takes a
    </p>
    <p>
     _man_ to boss this deestrick. Howsumdever, ef you think you kin trust
    </p>
    <p>
     your hide in Flat Crick school-house I ha'n't got no 'bjection. But ef
    </p>
    <p>
     you git licked, don't come on us. Flat Crick don't pay no 'nsurance, you
    </p>
    <p>
     bet! Any other trustees? Wal, yes. But as I pay the most taxes, t'others
    </p>
    <p>
     jist let me run the thing. You can begin right off a Monday. They a'n't
    </p>
    <p>
     been no other applications. You see, it takes grit to apply for this
    </p>
    <p>
     school. The last master had a black eye for a month. But, as I wuz
    </p>
    <p>
     sayin', you can jist roll up and wade in. I 'low you've got spunk,
    </p>
    <p>
     maybe, and that goes for a heap sight more'n sinnoo with boys. Walk in,
    </p>
    <p>
     and stay over Sunday with me. You'll hev' to board roun', and I guess
    </p>
    <p>
     you better begin here."
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph did not go in, but sat out on the wheelbarrow, watching the old
    </p>
    <p>
     man shave shingles, while the boys split the blocks and chopped wood.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bull smelled of the new-comer again in an ugly way, and got a good kick
    </p>
    <p>
     from the older son for his pains. But out of one of his red eyes the dog
    </p>
    <p>
     warned the young school-master that _he_ should yet suffer for all kicks
    </p>
    <p>
     received on his account.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ef Bull once takes a holt, heaven and yarth can't make him let go,"
    </p>
    <p>
     said the older son to Ralph, by way of comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was well for Ralph that he began to "board roun'" by stopping at Mr.
    </p>
    <p>
     Means's. Ralph felt that Flat Creek was what he needed. He had lived a
    </p>
    <p>
     bookish life; but here was his lesson in the art of managing people, for
    </p>
    <p>
     he who can manage the untamed and strapping youths of a winter school in
    </p>
    <p>
     Hoopole County has gone far toward learning one of the hardest of
    </p>
    <p>
     lessons. And in Ralph's time, things were worse than they are now. The
    </p>
    <p>
     older son of Mr. Means was called Bud Means. What his real name was,
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph could not find out, for in many of these families the nickname of
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bud" given to the oldest boy, and that of "Sis," which is the
    </p>
    <p>
     birth-right of the oldest girl, completely bury the proper Christian
    </p>
    <p>
     name. Ralph saw his first strategic point, which was to capture Bud
    </p>
    <p>
     Means.
    </p>
    <p>
     After supper, the boys began to get ready for something. Bull stuck up
    </p>
    <p>
     his ears in a dignified way, and the three or four yellow curs who were
    </p>
    <p>
     Bull's satellites yelped delightedly and discordantly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bill," said Bud Means to his brother, "ax the master ef he'd like to
    </p>
    <p>
     hunt coons. I'd like to take the starch out uv the stuck-up feller."
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Nough said[3]," was Bill's reply.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You durn't[4] do it," said Bud.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't take no sech a dare[5]," returned Bill, and walked down to the
    </p>
    <p>
     gate, by which Ralph stood watching the stars come out, and half wishing
    </p>
    <p>
     he had never seen Flat Creek.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I say, mister," began Bill, "mister, they's a coon what's been a eatin'
    </p>
    <p>
     our chickens lately, and we're goin' to try to ketch[6] the varmint.
    </p>
    <p>
     You wouldn't like to take a coon hunt nor nothin', would you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, yes," said Ralph, "there's nothing I should like better, if I
    </p>
    <p>
     could only be sure Bull wouldn't mistake me for the coon."
    </p>
    <p>
     And so, as a matter of policy, Ralph dragged his tired legs eight or ten
    </p>
    <p>
     miles, on hill and in hollow, after Bud, and Bill, and Bull, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     coon. But the raccoon[7] climbed a tree. The boys got into a quarrel
    </p>
    <p>
     about whose business it was to have brought the axe, and who was to
    </p>
    <p>
     blame that the tree could not be felled. Now, if there was anything
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph's muscles were good for, it was climbing. So, asking Bud to give
    </p>
    <p>
     him a start, he soon reached the limb above the one on which the raccoon
    </p>
    <p>
     was. Ralph did not know how ugly a customer a raccoon can be, and so
    </p>
    <p>
     got credit for more courage than he had. With much peril to his legs
    </p>
    <p>
     from the raccoon's teeth, he succeeded in shaking the poor creature off
    </p>
    <p>
     among the yelping brutes and yelling boys. Ralph could not help
    </p>
    <p>
     sympathizing with the hunted animal, which sold its life as dearly as
    </p>
    <p>
     possible, giving the dogs many a scratch and bite. It seemed to him that
    </p>
    <p>
     he was like the raccoon, precipitated into the midst of a party of dogs
    </p>
    <p>
     who would rejoice in worrying _his_ life out, as Bull and his crowd were
    </p>
    <p>
     destroying the poor raccoon. When Bull at last seized the raccoon and
    </p>
    <p>
     put an end to it, Ralph could not but admire the decided way in which he
    </p>
    <p>
     did it, calling to mind Bud's comment, "Ef Bull once takes a holt,
    </p>
    <p>
     heaven and yarth[8] can't make him let go."
    </p>
    <p>
     But as they walked home, Bud carrying the raccoon by the tail, Ralph
    </p>
    <p>
     felt that his hunt had not been in vain. He fancied that even red-eyed
    </p>
    <p>
     Bull, walking uncomfortably close to his heels, respected him more
    </p>
    <p>
     since he had climbed that tree.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Purty peart kind of a master," remarked the old man to Bud, after Ralph
    </p>
    <p>
     had gone to bed. "Guess you better be a little easy on him. Hey?"
    </p>
    <p>
     But Bud deigned no reply. Perhaps because he knew that Ralph heard the
    </p>
    <p>
     conversation through the thin partition.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph woke delighted to find it raining. He did not want to hunt or fish
    </p>
    <p>
     on Sunday, and this steady rain would enable him to make friends with
    </p>
    <p>
     Bud. I do not know how he got started, but after breakfast he began to
    </p>
    <p>
     tell stories. Out of all the books he had ever read he told story after
    </p>
    <p>
     story. And "old man Means," and "old _Miss_ Means," and Bud Means, and
    </p>
    <p>
     Bill Means, and Sis Means listened with great eyes while he told of
    </p>
    <p>
     Sinbad's adventures, of the Old Man of the Sea, of Robinson Crusoe, of
    </p>
    <p>
     Captain Gulliver's experiences in Liliput, and of Baron Munchausen's
    </p>
    <p>
     exploits.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph had caught his fish. The hungry minds of these backwoods people
    </p>
    <p>
     were refreshed with the new life that came to their imaginations in
    </p>
    <p>
     these stories. For there was but one book in the Means library, and
    </p>
    <p>
     that, a well-thumbed copy of "Captain Riley's Narrative," had long since
    </p>
    <p>
     lost all freshness.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'll be dog-on'd[9]," said Bill, emphatically, "ef I hadn't 'ruther
    </p>
    <p>
     hear the master tell them whoppin' yarns than to go to a circus the best
    </p>
    <p>
     day I ever seed!" Bill could pay no higher compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
     What Ralph wanted was to make a friend of Bud. It's a nice thing to
    </p>
    <p>
     have the seventy-four-gun ship on your own side, and the more Hartsook
    </p>
    <p>
     admired the knotted muscles of Bud Means the more he desired to attach
    </p>
    <p>
     him to himself. So, whenever he struck out a peculiarly brilliant
    </p>
    <p>
     passage, he anxiously watched Bud's eye. But the young Philistine kept
    </p>
    <p>
     his own counsel. He listened, but said nothing, and the eyes under his
    </p>
    <p>
     shaggy brows gave no sign. Ralph could not tell whether those eyes were
    </p>
    <p>
     deep and inscrutable or only stolid. Perhaps a little of both. When
    </p>
    <p>
     Monday morning came, Ralph was nervous. He walked to school with Bud.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I guess you're a little skeered by what the old man said, a'n't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph was about to deny it, but on reflection concluded that it was best
    </p>
    <p>
     to speak the truth. He said that Mr. Means's description of the school
    </p>
    <p>
     had made him feel a little down-hearted.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What will you do with the tough boys? You a'n't no match for 'em." And
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph felt Bud's eyes not only measuring his muscles, but scrutinizing
    </p>
    <p>
     his countenance. He only answered:
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What would you do with me, for instance?" and Bud stretched himself up
    </p>
    <p>
     as if to shake out the reserve power coiled up in his great muscles.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I sha'n't have any trouble with you."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, I'm the wust chap of all. I thrashed the last master, myself."
    </p>
    <p>
     And again the eyes of Bud Means looked out sharply from his shadowing
    </p>
    <p>
     brows to see the effect of this speech on the slender young man.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You won't thrash me, though," said Ralph.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Pshaw! I 'low I could whip you in an inch of your life with my left
    </p>
    <p>
     hand, and never half try," said young Means, with a threatening sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know that as well as you do."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, a'n't you afraid of me, then?" and again he looked sidewise at
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not a bit," said Ralph, wondering at his own courage.
    </p>
    <p>
     They walked on in silence a minute. Bud was turning the matter over.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why a'n't you afraid of me?" he said presently.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Because you and I are going to be friends."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And what about t'others?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I am not afraid of all the other boys put together."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You a'n't! The mischief! How's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, I'm not afraid of them because you and I are going to be friends,
    </p>
    <p>
     and you can whip all of them together. You'll do the fighting and I'll
    </p>
    <p>
     do the teaching."
    </p>
    <p>
     The diplomatic Bud only chuckled a little at this; whether he assented
    </p>
    <p>
     to the alliance or not Ralph could not tell.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Ralph looked round on the faces of the scholars--the little faces
    </p>
    <p>
     full of mischief and curiosity, the big faces full of an expression
    </p>
    <p>
     which was not further removed than second-cousin from contempt--when
    </p>
    <p>
     when young Hartsook looked into these faces, his heart palpitated with
    </p>
    <p>
     stage-fright. There is no audience so hard to face as one of
    </p>
    <p>
     school-children, as many a man has found to his cost. Perhaps it is that
    </p>
    <p>
     no conventional restraint can keep down their laughter when you do or
    </p>
    <p>
     say anything ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hartsook's first day was hurried and unsatisfactory. He was not of
    </p>
    <p>
     himself, and consequently not master of anybody else. When evening came,
    </p>
    <p>
     there were symptoms of insubordination through the whole school. Poor
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph was sick at heart. He felt that if there had ever been the shadow
    </p>
    <p>
     of an alliance between himself and Bud, it was all "off" now. It seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     to Hartsook that even Bull had lost his respect for the teacher. Half
    </p>
    <p>
     that night the young man lay awake. At last comfort came to him. A
    </p>
    <p>
     reminiscence of the death of the raccoon flashed on him like a vision.
    </p>
    <p>
     He remembered that quiet and annihilating bite which Bull gave. He
    </p>
    <p>
     remembered Bud's certificate, that "Ef Bull once takes a holt, heaven
    </p>
    <p>
     and yarth can't make him let go." He thought that what Flat Creek needed
    </p>
    <p>
     was a bulldog. He would be a bulldog, quiet, but invincible. He would
    </p>
    <p>
     take hold in such a way that nothing should make him let go. And then he
    </p>
    <p>
     went to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the morning Ralph got out of bed slowly. He put his clothes on
    </p>
    <p>
     slowly. He pulled on his boots in a bulldog mood. He tried to move as he
    </p>
    <p>
     thought Bull would move if he were a man. He ate with deliberation, and
    </p>
    <p>
     looked everybody in the eyes with a manner that made Bud watch him
    </p>
    <p>
     curiously. He found himself continually comparing himself with Bull. He
    </p>
    <p>
     found Bull possessing a strange fascination for him. He walked to school
    </p>
    <p>
     alone, the rest having gone on before. He entered the school-room
    </p>
    <p>
     preserving a cool and dogged manner. He saw in the eyes of the boys that
    </p>
    <p>
     there was mischief brewing. He did not dare sit down in his chair for
    </p>
    <p>
     fear of a pin. Everybody looked solemn. Ralph lifted the lid of his
    </p>
    <p>
     desk. "Bow-wow! wow-wow!" It was the voice of an imprisoned puppy, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the school giggled and then roared. Then everything was quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
     The scholars expected an outburst of wrath from the teacher. For they
    </p>
    <p>
     had come to regard the whole world as divided into two classes, the
    </p>
    <p>
     teacher on the one side representing lawful authority, and the pupils on
    </p>
    <p>
     the other in a state of chronic rebellion. To play a trick on the master
    </p>
    <p>
     was an evidence of spirit; to "lick" the master was to be the crowned
    </p>
    <p>
     hero of Flat Creek district. Such a hero was Bud Means; and Bill, who
    </p>
    <p>
     had less muscle, saw a chance to distinguish himself on a teacher of
    </p>
    <p>
     slender frame. Hence the puppy in the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph Hartsook grew red in the face when he saw the puppy. But the cool,
    </p>
    <p>
     repressed, bulldog mood in which he had kept himself saved him. He
    </p>
    <p>
     lifted the dog into his arms and stroked him until the laughter
    </p>
    <p>
     subsided. Then, in a solemn and set way, he began:
    </p>
    <p>
     "I am sorry," and he looked round the room with a steady, hard
    </p>
    <p>
     eye--everybody felt that there was a conflict coming--"I am sorry that
    </p>
    <p>
     any scholar in this school could be so mean"--the word was uttered with
    </p>
    <p>
     a sharp emphasis, and all the big boys felt sure that there would be a
    </p>
    <p>
     fight with Bill Means, and perhaps with Bud--"could be so _mean_--as
    </p>
    <p>
     to--shut up his _brother_ in such a place as that!"
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a long, derisive laugh. The wit was indifferent, but by one
    </p>
    <p>
     stroke Ralph had carried the whole school to his side. By the
    </p>
    <p>
     significant glances of the boys, Hartsook detected the perpetrator of
    </p>
    <p>
     the joke, and with the hard and dogged look in his eyes, with just such
    </p>
    <p>
     a look as Bull would give a puppy, but with the utmost suavity in his
    </p>
    <p>
     voice, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
     "William Means, will you be so good as to put this dog out of doors?"

     [Footnote 8: This prefixed _y_ is a mark of a very illiterate or antique
    </p>
    <p>
     form of the dialect. I have known _piece yarthen_ used for "a piece of
    </p>
    <p>
     earthen" [ware], the preposition getting lost in the sound of the _y_. I
    </p>
    <p>
     leave it to etymologists to determine its relation to that ancient
    </p>
    <p>
     prefix that differentiates _earn_ in one sense from _yearn_. But the
    </p>
    <p>
     article before a vowel may account for it if we consider it a
    </p>
    <p>
     corruption. "The earth" pronounced in a drawling way will produce _the
    </p>
    <p>
     yearth_. In the New York Documents is a letter from one Barnard Hodges,
    </p>
    <p>
     a settler in Delaware in the days of Governor Andros, whose spelling
    </p>
    <p>
     indicates a free use of the parasitic _y_. He writes "yunless,"
    </p>
    <p>
     "yeunder" (under), "yunderstanding," "yeundertake," and "yeouffeis"
    </p>
    <p>
     (office).]
    </p>
    <p>
     [Footnote 9: Like many of the ear-marks of this dialect, the verb
    </p>
    <p>
     "dog-on" came from Scotland, presumably by the way of the north of
    </p>
    <p>
     Ireland. A correspondent of _The Nation_ calls attention to the use of
    </p>
    <p>
     "dagon" as Scotch dialect in Barrie's "Little Minister," a recent book.
    </p>
    <p>
     On examining that story, I find that the word has precisely the sense of
    </p>
    <p>
     our Hoosier "dog-on," which is to be pronounced broadly as a Hoosier
    </p>
    <p>
     pronounces dog--"daug-on." If Mr. Barrie gives his _a_ the broad sound,
    </p>
    <p>
     his "dagon" is nearly identical with "dog-on." Here are some detached
    </p>
    <p>
     sentences from "The Little Minister:"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Beattie spoke for more than himself when he said: 'Dagon that Manse! I
    </p>
    <p>
     never gie a swear but there it is glowering at me.'"
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Dagon religion,' Rob retorted fiercely; 't spoils a' thing.'"
    </p>
    <p>
     "There was some angry muttering from the crowd, and young Charles Yuill
    </p>
    <p>
     exclaimed, 'Dagon you, would you lord it ower us on week-days as well as
    </p>
    <p>
     on Sabbaths?'"
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Have you on your Sabbath shoon or have you no on your Sabbath shoon?'
    </p>
    <p>
     'Guid care you took I should ha'e the dagont things on!' retorted the
    </p>
    <p>
     farmer."
    </p>
    <p>
     It will be seen that "dagont," as used above, is the Scotch form of
    </p>
    <p>
     "dog-oned." But Mr. Barrie uses the same form apparently for "dog-on it"
    </p>
    <p>
     in the following passage:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ay, there was Ruth when she was na wanted, but Ezra, dagont, it looked
    </p>
    <p>
     as if Ezra had jumped clean out o' the Bible!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Strangely enough, this word as a verb is not to be found in Jamieson's
    </p>
    <p>
     dictionary of the Scottish dialect, but Jamieson gives "dugon" as a
    </p>
    <p>
     noun. It is given in the supplement to Jamieson, however, as "dogon,"
    </p>
    <p>
     but still as a noun, with an ancient plural _dogonis_. It is explained
    </p>
    <p>
     as "a term of contempt." The example cited by Jamieson is Hogg's "Winter
    </p>
    <p>
     Tales," I. 292, and is as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
     "What wad my father say if I were to marry a man that loot himsel' be
    </p>
    <p>
     thrashed by Tommy Potts, a great supple wi' a back nae stiffer than a
    </p>
    <p>
     willy brand? . . . When one comes to close quarters wi' him he's but a
    </p>
    <p>
     dugon."
    </p>
    <p>
     Halliwell and Wright give _dogon_ as a noun, and mark it Anglo-Norman,
    </p>
    <p>
     but they apparently know it only from Jamieson and the supplement to
    </p>
    <p>
     Jamieson, where _dogguin_ is cited from Cotgrave as meaning "a filthie
    </p>
    <p>
     old curre," and _doguin_ from Roquefort, defined by "brutal, currish"
    </p>
    <p>
     [hargneux]. A word with the same orthography, _doguin_, is still used in
    </p>
    <p>
     French for puppy. It is of course a question whether the noun _dogon_
    </p>
    <p>
     and its French antecedents are connected with the American verb
    </p>
    <p>
     _dog-on_. It is easy to conceive that such an epithet as _dogon_ might
    </p>
    <p>
     get itself mixed up with the word dog, and so become an imprecation. For
    </p>
    <p>
     instance, a servant in the family of a friend of mine in Indiana,
    </p>
    <p>
     wishing to resign her place before the return of some daughters of the
    </p>
    <p>
     house whom she had never seen, announced that she was going to leave
    </p>
    <p>
     "before them dog-on girls got home." Here the word might have been the
    </p>
    <p>
     old epithet, or an abbreviated participle. _Dogged_ is apparently a
    </p>
    <p>
     corruption of dog-on in the phrase "I'll be dogged." I prefer _dog-on_
    </p>
    <p>
     to _dogone_, because in the dialect the sense of setting a dog on is
    </p>
    <p>
     frequently present to the speaker, though far enough away from the
    </p>
    <p>
     primitive sense of the word; perhaps.]

    <p>
     A SPELL COMING.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a moment of utter stillness; but the magnetism of Ralph's eye
    </p>
    <p>
     was too much for Bill Means. The request was so polite, the master's
    </p>
    <p>
     look was so innocent and yet so determined. Bill often wondered
    </p>
    <p>
     afterward that he had not "fit" rather than obeyed the request. But
    </p>
    <p>
     somehow he put the dog out. He was partly surprised, partly inveighed,
    </p>
    <p>
     partly awed into doing just what he had not intended to do. In the week
    </p>
    <p>
     that followed, Bill had to fight half a dozen boys for calling him
    </p>
    <p>
     "Puppy Means." Bill said he wished he'd licked the master on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
     'Twould 'a' saved five fights out of the six.
    </p>
    <p>
     And all that day and the next, the bulldog in the master's eye was a
    </p>
    <p>
     terror to evil-doers. At the close of school on the second day Bud was
    </p>
    <p>
     heard to give it as his opinion that "the master wouldn't be much in a
    </p>
    <p>
     tussle, but he had a heap of thunder and lightning in him."
    </p>
    <p>
     Did he inflict corporal punishment? inquires some philanthropic friend.
    </p>
    <p>
     Would you inflict corporal punishment if you were tiger-trainer in Van
    </p>
    <p>
     Amburgh's happy family? But poor Ralph could never satisfy his
    </p>
    <p>
     constituency in this regard.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't believe he'll do," was Mr. Pete Jones's comment to Mr. Means.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't thrash enough. Boys won't l'arn 'less you thrash 'em, says I.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leastways, mine won't. Lay it on good is what I says to a master. Lay it
    </p>
    <p>
     on good. Don't do no harm. Lickin' and l'arnin' goes together. No
    </p>
    <p>
     lickin', no l'arnin', says I. Lickin' and l'arnin,' lickin' and larnin',
    </p>
    <p>
     is the good ole way."
    </p>
    <p>
     And Mr. Jones, like some wiser people, was the more pleased with his
    </p>
    <p>
     formula that it had an alliterative sound. Nevertheless, Ralph was
    </p>
    <p>
     master from this time until the spelling-school came. If only it had not
    </p>
    <p>
     been for that spelling-school! Many and many a time after the night of
    </p>
    <p>
     the fatal spelling-school Ralph used to say, "If only it had not been
    </p>
    <p>
     for that spelling-school!"
    </p>
    <p>
     There had to be a spelling-school. Not only for the sake of my story,
    </p>
    <p>
     which would not have been worth the telling if the spelling-school had
    </p>
    <p>
     not taken place, but because Flat Creek district had to have a
    </p>
    <p>
     spelling-school. It is the only public literary exercise known in
    </p>
    <p>
     Hoopole County. It takes the place of lyceum lecture and debating club.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sis Means, or, as she wished now to be called, Mirandy Means, expressed
    </p>
    <p>
     herself most positively in favor of it. She said that she 'lowed the
    </p>
    <p>
     folks in that district couldn't in no wise do without it. But it was
    </p>
    <p>
     rather to its social than to its intellectual benefits that she
    </p>
    <p>
     referred. For all the spelling-schools ever seen could not enable her to
    </p>
    <p>
     stand anywhere but at the foot of the class. There is one branch
    </p>
    <p>
     diligently taught in a backwoods school. The public mind seems impressed
    </p>
    <p>
     with the difficulties of English orthography, and there is a solemn
    </p>
    <p>
     conviction that the chief end of man is to learn to spell. "'Know
    </p>
    <p>
     Webster's Elementary' came down from Heaven," would be the backwoods
    </p>
    <p>
     version of the 'Greek saying but that, unfortunately for the Greeks,
    </p>
    <p>
     their fame has not reached so far. It often happens that the pupil does
    </p>
    <p>
     not know the meaning of a single word in the lesson. This is of no
    </p>
    <p>
     consequence. What do you want to know the meaning of a word for? Words
    </p>
    <p>
     were made to be spelled, and men were probably created that they might
    </p>
    <p>
     spell them. Hence the necessity for sending a pupil through the
    </p>
    <p>
     spelling-book five times before you allow him to begin to read, or
    </p>
    <p>
     indeed to do anything else. Hence the necessity for those long
    </p>
    <p>
     spelling-classes at the close of each forenoon and afternoon session of
    </p>
    <p>
     the school, to stand at the head of which is the cherished ambition of
    </p>
    <p>
     every scholar. Hence, too, the necessity for devoting the whole of the
    </p>
    <p>
     afternoon session of each Friday to a "spelling-match." In fact,
    </p>
    <p>
     spelling is the "national game" in Hoopole County. Baseball and croquet
    </p>
    <p>
     matches are as unknown as Olympian chariot-races. Spelling and
    </p>
    <p>
     shucking[10] are the only public competitions.
    </p>
    <p>
     So the fatal spelling-school had to be appointed for the Wednesday of
    </p>
    <p>
     the second week of the session, just when Ralph felt himself master of
    </p>
    <p>
     the situation. Not that he was without his annoyances. One of Ralph's
    </p>
    <p>
     troubles in the week before the spelling-school was that he was loved.
    </p>
    <p>
     The other that he was hated. And while the time between the appointing
    </p>
    <p>
     of the spelling tournament and the actual occurrence of that remarkable
    </p>
    <p>
     event is engaged in elapsing, let me narrate two incidents that made it
    </p>
    <p>
     for Ralph a trying time.
    </p>

     FOOTNOTES:
    </p>
    <p>
     [Footnote 10: In naming the several parts of the Indian corn and the
    </p>
    <p>
     dishes made from it, the English language was put to many shifts. Such
    </p>
    <p>
     words as _tassel_ and _silk_ were poetically applied to the blossoms;
    </p>
    <p>
     _stalk_, _blade_, and _ear_ were borrowed from other sorts of corn, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the Indian tongues were forced to pay tribute to name the dishes
    </p>
    <p>
     borrowed from the savages. From them we have _hominy_, _pone_, _supawn_,
    </p>
    <p>
     and _succotash_. For other nouns words were borrowed from English
    </p>
    <p>
     provincial dialects. _Shuck_ is one of these. On the northern belt,
    </p>
    <p>
     shucks are the outer covering of nuts; in the middle and southern
    </p>
    <p>
     regions the word is applied to what in New England is called the husks
    </p>
    <p>
     of the corn. _Shuck_, however, is much more widely used than _husk_ in
    </p>
    <p>
     colloquial speech--the farmers in more than half of the United States
    </p>
    <p>
     are hardly acquainted with the word _husk_ as applied to the envelope of

    <p>
     the ear. _Husk_, in the Middle States, and in some parts of the South
    </p>
    <p>
     and West, means the bran of the cornmeal, as notably in Davy Crockett's
    </p>
    <p>
     verse:
    </p>
    <p>
     "She sifted the meal, she gimme the hus';
    </p>
    <p>
     She baked the bread, she gimme the crus';
    </p>
    <p>
     She b'iled the meat, she gimme the bone;
    </p>
    <p>
     She gimme a kick and sent me home."
    </p>
    <p>
     In parts of Virginia, before the war, the word _husk_ or _hus'_ meant
    </p>
    <p>
     the cob or spike of the corn. "I smack you over wid a cawn-hus'" is a
    </p>
    <p>
     threat I have often heard one negro boy make to another. _Cob_ is
    </p>
    <p>
     provincial English for ear, and I have known "a cob of corn" used in
    </p>
    <p>
     Canada for an ear of Indian corn. While writing this note "a cob of
    </p>
    <p>
     Indian corn "--meaning an ear--appears in the report of an address by a
    </p>
    <p>
     distinguished man at a recent meeting of the Royal Geographical Society.
    </p>
    <p>
     A lady tells me that she met, in the book of an English traveller, the
    </p>
    <p>
     remarkable statement that "the Americans are very fond of the young
    </p>
    <p>
     grain called cob." These Indian-corn words have reached an accepted
    </p>
    <p>
     meaning after a competition. To _shell_ corn, among the earliest
    </p>
    <p>
     settlers of Virginia, meant to take it out of the envelope, which was
    </p>
    <p>
     presumably called the shell. The analogy is with the shelling of pulse.]

    <p>
     MIRANDY, HANK, AND SHOCKY.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mirandy had nothing but contempt for the new master until he developed
    </p>
    <p>
     the bulldog in his character. Mirandy fell in love with the bulldog.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like many other girls of her class, she was greatly enamored with the
    </p>
    <p>
     "subjection of women," and she stood ready to fall in love with any man
    </p>
    <p>
     strong enough to be her master. Much has been said of the strong-minded
    </p>
    <p>
     woman. I offer this psychological remark as a contribution to the
    </p>
    <p>
     natural history of the weak-minded woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was at the close of that very second day on which Ralph had achieved
    </p>
    <p>
     his first victory over the school, and in which Mirandy had been seized
    </p>
    <p>
     with her desperate passion for him, that she told him about it. Not in
    </p>
    <p>
     words. We do not allow _that_ in the most civilized countries, and still
    </p>
    <p>
     less would it be tolerated in Hoopole County. But Mirandy told the
    </p>
    <p>
     master the fact that she was in love with him, though no word passed her
    </p>
    <p>
     lips. She walked by him from school. She cast at him what are commonly
    </p>
    <p>
     called sheep's-eyes. Ralph thought them more like calf's eyes. She
    </p>
    <p>
     changed the whole tone of her voice. She whined ordinarily. Now she
    </p>
    <p>
     whimpered. And so by ogling him, by blushing at him, by tittering at
    </p>
    <p>
     him, by giggling at him, by snickering at him, by simpering at him, by
    </p>
    <p>
     making herself tenfold more a fool even than nature had made her, she
    </p>
    <p>
     managed to convey to the dismayed soul of the young teacher the
    </p>
    <p>
     frightful intelligence that he was loved by the richest, the ugliest,
    </p>
    <p>
     the silliest, the coarsest, and the most entirely contemptible girl in
    </p>
    <p>
     Flat Creek district.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph sat by the fire the next morning trying to read a few minutes
    </p>
    <p>
     before school-time, while the boys were doing the chores and the bound
    </p>
    <p>
     girl was milking the cows, with no one in the room but the old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was generally as silent as Bud, but now she seemed for some
    </p>
    <p>
     unaccountable reason disposed to talk. She had sat down on the broad
    </p>
    <p>
     hearth to have her usual morning smoke; the poplar table, adorned by no
    </p>
    <p>
     cloth, stood in the middle of the floor; the unwashed blue teacups sat
    </p>
    <p>
     in the unwashed blue saucers; the unwashed blue plates kept company with
    </p>
    <p>
     the begrimed blue pitcher. The dirty skillets by the fire were kept in
    </p>
    <p>
     countenance by the dirtier pots, and the ashes were drifted and strewn
    </p>
    <p>
     over the hearth-stones in a most picturesque way.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You see," said the old woman, knocking the residuum from her cob pipe,
    </p>
    <p>
     and chafing some dry leaf between her withered hands preparatory to
    </p>
    <p>
     filling it again, "you see, Mr. Hartsook, my ole man's purty well along
    </p>
    <p>
     in the world. He's got a right smart lot of this world's plunder[11],
    </p>
    <p>
     one way and another." And while she stuffed the tobacco into her pipe
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph wondered why she should mention it to him. "You see, we moved in
    </p>
    <p>
     here nigh upon twenty-five years ago. 'Twas when my Jack, him as died
    </p>
    <p>
     afore Bud was born, was a baby. Bud'll be twenty-one the fif' of next
    </p>
    <p>
     June."
    </p>
    <p>
     Here Mrs. Means stopped to rake a live coal out of the fire with her
    </p>
    <p>
     skinny finger, and then to carry it in her skinny palm to the bowl--or
    </p>
    <p>
     to the _hole_--of her cob pipe. When she got the smoke a-going, she
    </p>
    <p>
     proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
     "You see, this yere bottom land was all Congress land[12] in them there
    </p>
    <p>
     days, and it sold for a dollar and a quarter, and I says to my ole man,
    </p>
    <p>
     'Jack,' says I, 'Jack, do you git a plenty while you're a-gittin'. Git a
    </p>
    <p>
     plenty while you're a-gittin',' says I, 'fer 'twon't never be no
    </p>
    <p>
     cheaper'n 'tis now,' and it ha'n't been; I knowed 'twouldn't," and Mrs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Means took the pipe from her mouth to indulge in a good chuckle at the
    </p>
    <p>
     thought of her financial shrewdness. "'Git a plenty while you're
    </p>
    <p>
     a-gittin' says I. I could see, you know, they was a powerful sight of
    </p>
    <p>
     money in Congress land. That's what made me say, 'Git a plenty while
    </p>
    <p>
     you're a-gittin'.' And Jack, he's wuth lots and gobs of money, all made
    </p>
    <p>
     out of Congress land. Jack didn't git rich by hard work. Bless you, no!
    </p>
    <p>
     Not him. That a'n't his way. Hard work a'n't, you know. 'Twas that air
    </p>
    <p>
     six hundred dollars he got along of me, all salted down into Flat Crick
    </p>
    <p>
     bottoms at a dollar and a quarter a' acre, and 'twas my sayin' 'Git a
    </p>
    <p>
     plenty while you're a gittin'' as done it." And here the old ogre
    </p>
    <p>
     laughed, or grinned horribly, at Ralph, showing her few straggling,
    </p>
    <p>
     discolored teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she got up and knocked the ashes out of her pipe, and laid the pipe
    </p>
    <p>
     away and walked round In front of Ralph. After adjusting the chunks[13]
    </p>
    <p>
     so that the fire would burn, she turned her yellow face toward Ralph,
    </p>
    <p>
     and scanning him closely came out with the climax of her speech in the
    </p>
    <p>
     remark: "You see as how, Mr. Hartsook, the man what gits my Mirandy'll
    </p>
    <p>
     do well. Flat Crick land's wuth nigt upon a hundred a' acre."
    </p>
    <p>
     This gentle hint came near knocking Ralph down. Had Flat Creek land been
    </p>
    <p>
     worth a hundred times a hundred dollars an acre, and had he owned five
    </p>
    <p>
     hundred times Means's five hundred acres, he would have given it all
    </p>
    <p>
     just at that moment to have annihilated the whole tribe of Meanses.
    </p>
    <p>
     Except Bud. Bud was a giant, but a good-natured one. He thought he would
    </p>
    <p>
     except Bud from the general destruction. As for the rest, he mentally
    </p>
    <p>
     pictured to himself the pleasure of attending their funerals. There was
    </p>
    <p>
     one thought, however, between him and despair. He felt confident that
    </p>
    <p>
     the cordiality, the intensity, and the persistency of his dislike of Sis
    </p>
    <p>
     Means were such that he should never inherit a foot of the Flat Creek
    </p>
    <p>
     bottoms.
    </p>
    <p>
     But what about Bud? What if he joined the conspiracy to marry him to
    </p>
    <p>
     this weak-eyed, weak-headed wood-nymph, or backwoods nymph?
    </p>
    <p>
     If Ralph felt it a misfortune to be loved by Mirandy Means, he found
    </p>
    <p>
     himself almost equally unfortunate in having incurred the hatred of the
    </p>
    <p>
     meanest boy in school. "Hank" Banta, low-browed, smirky, and crafty, was
    </p>
    <p>
     the first sufferer by Ralph's determination to use corporal punishment,
    </p>
    <p>
     and so Henry Banta, who was a compound of deceit and resentment, never
    </p>
    <p>
     lost an opportunity to annoy the young school-master, who was obliged to
    </p>
    <p>
     live perpetually on his guard against his tricks.
    </p>
    <p>
     One morning, as Ralph walked toward the school-house, he met little
    </p>
    <p>
     Shocky. What the boy's first name or last name was the teacher did not
    </p>
    <p>
     know. He had given his name as Shocky, and all the teacher knew was that
    </p>
    <p>
     he was commonly called Shocky, that he was an orphan, that he lived with
    </p>
    <p>
     a family named Pearson over in Rocky Hollow, and that he was the most
    </p>
    <p>
     faithful and affectionate child in the school. On this morning that I
    </p>
    <p>
     speak of, Ralph had walked toward the school early to avoid the company
    </p>
    <p>
     of Mirandy. But not caring to sustain his dignity longer than was
    </p>
    <p>
     necessary, he loitered along the road, admiring the trunks of the
    </p>
    <p>
     maples, and picking up a beech-nut now and then. Just as he was about
    </p>
    <p>
     to go on toward the school, he caught sight of little Shocky running
    </p>
    <p>
     swiftly toward him, but looking from side to side, as if afraid of being
    </p>
    <p>
     seen.
    </p>
    <p>
     [Illustration: BETSY SHORT]
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, Shocky, what is it?" and Ralph put his hand kindly on the great
    </p>
    <p>
     bushy head of white hair from which came Shocky's nickname. Shocky had
    </p>
    <p>
     to pant a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, Mr. Hartsook," he gasped, scratching his head, "they's a pond down
    </p>
    <p>
     under the school-house," and here Shocky's breath gave out entirely for
    </p>
    <p>
     a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, Shocky, I know that. What about it? The trustees haven't come to
    </p>
    <p>
     fill it up, have they?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh! no, sir; but Hank Banta, you know--" and Shocky took another
    </p>
    <p>
     breathing spell, standing as dose to Ralph as he could, for poor Shocky
    </p>
    <p>
     got all his sunshine from the master's presence.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Has Henry fallen in and got a ducking, Shocky?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh! no, sir; he wants to git you in, you see."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, I won't go in, though, Shocky."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But, you see, he's been and gone and pulled back the board that you
    </p>
    <p>
     have to step on to git ahind your desk; he's been and gone and pulled
    </p>
    <p>
     back the board so as you can't help a-tippin' it up, and a-sowsin' right
    </p>
    <p>
     in ef you step there."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And so you came to tell me." There was a huskiness in Ralph's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had, then, one friend in Flat Creek district--poor little Shocky. He
    </p>
    <p>
     put his arm around Shocky just a moment, and then told him to hasten
    </p>
    <p>
     across to the other road, so as to come back to the school-house in a
    </p>
    <p>
     direction at right angles to the master's approach. But the caution was
    </p>
    <p>
     not needed. Shocky had taken care to leave in that way, and was
    </p>
    <p>
     altogether too cunning to be seen coming down the road with Mr.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hartsook. But after he got over the fence to go through the "sugar camp"
    </p>
    <p>
     (or sugar _orchard_, as they say at the East), he stopped and turned
    </p>
    <p>
     back once or twice, just to catch one more smile from Ralph. And then he
    </p>
    <p>
     hied away through the tall trees, a very happy boy, kicking and
    </p>
    <p>
     ploughing the brown leaves before him in his perfect delight, saying
    </p>
    <p>
     over and over again: "How he looked at me! how he did look!" And when
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph came up to the school-house door, there was Shocky sauntering
    </p>
    <p>
     along from the other direction, throwing bits of limestone at fence
    </p>
    <p>
     rails, and smiling still clear down to his shoes at thought of the
    </p>
    <p>
     master's kind words.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What a quare boy Shocky is!" remarked Betsey Short, with a giggle. "He
    </p>
    <p>
     just likes to wander round alone. I see him a-comin' out of the sugar
    </p>
    <p>
     camp just now. He's been in there half an hour." And Betsey giggled
    </p>
    <p>
     again; for Betsey Short could giggle on slighter provocation than any
    </p>
    <p>
     other girl on Flat Creek.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Ralph Hartsook, with the quiet, dogged tread that he was
    </p>
    <p>
     cultivating, walked into the school-room, he took great care not to seem
    </p>
    <p>
     to see the trap set for him; but he carelessly stepped over the board
    </p>
    <p>
     that had been so nicely adjusted. The boys who were Hank's confidants in
    </p>
    <p>
     the plot were very busy over their slates, and took pains not to show
    </p>
    <p>
     their disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
     The morning session wore on without incident. Ralph several times caught
    </p>
    <p>
     two people looking at him. One was Mirandy. Her weak and watery eyes
    </p>
    <p>
     stole loving glances over the top of her spelling-book, which she would
    </p>
    <p>
     not study. Her looks made Ralph's spirits sink to forty below zero, and
    </p>
    <p>
     congeal.
    </p>
    <p>
     But on one of the backless little benches that sat in the middle of the
    </p>
    <p>
     school-room was little Shocky, who also cast many love glances at the
    </p>
    <p>
     young master; glances as grateful to his heart as Mirandy's ogling--he
    </p>
    <p>
     was tempted to call it ogring--was hateful.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Look at Shocky," giggled Betsey Short, behind her slate. "He looks as
    </p>
    <p>
     if he was a-goin' to eat the master up, body and soul."
    </p>
    <p>
     And so the forenoon wore on as usual, and those who laid the trap had
    </p>
    <p>
     forgotten it, themselves. The morning session was drawing to a close.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fire in the great old fire-place had burnt low. The flames, which
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to Shocky to be angels, had disappeared, and now the bright
    </p>
    <p>
     coals, which had played the part of men and women and houses in Shocky's
    </p>
    <p>
     fancy, had taken on a white and downy covering of ashes, and the great
    </p>
    <p>
     half-burnt back-log lay there smouldering like a giant asleep in a
    </p>
    <p>
     snow-drift. Shocky longed to wake him up.
    </p>
    <p>
     As for Henry Banta, he was too much bothered to get the answer to a
    </p>
    <p>
     "sum" he was doing, to remember anything about his trap. In fact, he had
    </p>
    <p>
     quite forgotten that half an hour ago in the all-absorbing employment of
    </p>
    <p>
     drawing ugly pictures on his slate and coaxing Betsey Short to giggle by
    </p>
    <p>
     showing them slyly across the school-room. Once or twice Ralph had been
    </p>
    <p>
     attracted to Betsey's extraordinary fits of giggling, and had come so
    </p>
    <p>
     near to catching Hank that the boy thought it best not to run any
    </p>
    <p>
     further risk of the beech switches, four or five feet long, laid up
    </p>
    <p>
     behind the master in sight of the school as a prophylactic. Hence his
    </p>
    <p>
     application just now to his "sum" in long division, and hence his
    </p>
    <p>
     puzzled look, for, idler that he was, his "sums" did not solve
    </p>
    <p>
     themselves easily. As usual in such cases, he came up in front of the
    </p>
    <p>
     master's desk to have the difficulty explained. He had to wait a minute
    </p>
    <p>
     until Ralph got through with showing Betsey Short, who had been seized
    </p>
    <p>
     with a studying fit, and who could hardly give any attention to the
    </p>
    <p>
     teacher's explanations, she did want to giggle so much! Not at anything
    </p>
    <p>
     in particular, but just at things in general.
    </p>
    <p>
     While Ralph was "doing" Betsey's "sum" for her, he was solving a much
    </p>
    <p>
     more difficult question. A plan had flashed upon him, but the punishment
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed a severe one. He gave it up once or twice, but he remembered how
    </p>
    <p>
     turbulent the Flat Creek elements were; and had he not inly resolved to
    </p>
    <p>
     be as unrelenting as a bulldog? He fortified himself by recalling again
    </p>
    <p>
     the oft-remembered remark of Bud, "Ef Bull wunst takes a holt, heaven
    </p>
    <p>
     and yarth can't make him let go." And so he resolved to give Hank and
    </p>
    <p>
     the whole school one good lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Just step round behind me, Henry, and you can see how I do this," said
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hank was entirely off his guard, and, with his eyes fixed upon the slate
    </p>
    <p>
     on the teacher's desk, he sidled round upon the broad loose board
    </p>
    <p>
     misplaced by his own hand, and in an instant the other end of the board
    </p>
    <p>
     rose up in the middle of the school-room, almost striking Shocky in the
    </p>
    <p>
     face, while Henry Banta went down into the ice-cold water beneath the
    </p>
    <p>
     school-house.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, Henry!" cried Ralph, jumping to his feet with well-feigned
    </p>
    <p>
     surprise. "How _did_ this happen?" him by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
     Betsey Short giggled.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shocky was so tickled that he could hardly keep his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
     The boys who were in the plot looked very serious indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph made some remarks by way of improving the occasion. He spoke
    </p>
    <p>
     strongly of the utter meanness of the one who could play so heartless a
    </p>
    <p>
     trick on a schoolmate. He said that it was as much thieving to get your
    </p>
    <p>
     fun at the expense of another as to steal his money. And while he
    </p>
    <p>
     talked, all eyes were turned on Hank--all except the eyes of Mirandy
    </p>
    <p>
     Means. They looked simperingly at Ralph. All the rest looked at Hank.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fire had made his face very red. Shocky noticed that. Betsey Short
    </p>
    <p>
     noticed it, and giggled. The master wound up with an appropriate
    </p>
    <p>
     quotation from Scripture. He said that the person who displaced that
    </p>
    <p>
     board had better not be encouraged by the success--he said _success_
    </p>
    <p>
     with a curious emphasis--of the present experiment to attempt another
    </p>
    <p>
     trick of the kind. For it was set down in the Bible that if a man dug a
    </p>
    <p>
     pit for the feet of another he would be very likely to fall in it
    </p>
    <p>
     himself. Which made all the pupils look solemn, except Betsey Short, who
    </p>
    <p>
     giggled. And Shocky wanted to. And Mirandy cast an expiring look at
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph. And if the teacher was not love-sick, he certainly was sick of
    </p>
    <p>
     Mirandy's love.
    </p>
    <p>
     [Illustration: HANK BANTA'S IMPROVED PLUNGE BATH]
    </p>
    <p>
     When school was "let out," Ralph gave Hank every caution that he could
    </p>
    <p>
     about taking cold, and even lent him his overcoat, very much against
    </p>
    <p>
     Hank's will. For Hank had obstinately refused to go home before the
    </p>
    <p>
     school was dismissed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then the master walked out in a quiet and subdued way to spend the noon
    </p>
    <p>
     recess in the woods, while Shocky watched his retreating footsteps with
    </p>
    <p>
     loving admiration. And the pupils not in the secret canvassed the
    </p>
    <p>
     question of who moved the board. Bill Means said he'd bet Hank did it,
    </p>
    <p>
     which set Betsey Short off in an uncontrollable giggle. And Shocky
    </p>
    <p>
     listened innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
     But that night Bud said slyly: "Thunder and lightning! what a manager
    </p>
    <p>
     you _air_, Mr. Hartsook!" To which Ralph returned no reply except a
    </p>
    <p>
     friendly smile. Muscle paid tribute to brains that time.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Ralph had no time for exultation; for just here came the
    </p>
    <p>
     spelling-school.

     [Footnote 11: This word _plunder_ is probably from Pennsylvania, as it
    </p>
    <p>
     is exactly equivalent to the German word _plunder_, in the sense of
    </p>
    <p>
     household effects, the original meaning of the word in German. Any kind
    </p>
    <p>
     of baggage may be called _plunder_, but the most accepted sense is
    </p>
    <p>
     household goods. It is quite seriously used. I have seen bills of lading
    </p>
    <p>
     on the Western waters certifying that A.B. had shipped "1 lot of
    </p>
    <p>
     plunder;" that is, household goods. It is here used figuratively for
    </p>
    <p>
     goods in general.]

    <p>
     for the ends of the sticks of cord-wood burned in the great fireplaces.

    <p>
     As the sticks burned in two, the chunks fell down or rolled back on the

    <p>
     wall side of the andirons. By putting the chunks together, a new fire

     CHAPTER IV.

    <p>
     SPELLING DOWN THE MASTER.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I 'low," said Mrs. Means, as she stuffed the tobacco into her cob pipe
    </p>
    <p>
     after supper on that eventful Wednesday evening: "I 'low they'll app'int
    </p>
    <p>
     the Squire to gin out the words to-night. They mos' always do, you see,
    </p>
    <p>
     kase he's the peartest[14] _ole_ man in this deestrick; and I 'low some
    </p>
    <p>
     of the young fellers would have to git up and dust ef they would keep up
    </p>
    <p>
     to him. And he uses sech remarkable smart words. He speaks so polite,
    </p>
    <p>
     too. But laws! don't I remember when he was poarer nor Job's turkey?
    </p>
    <p>
     Twenty year ago, when he come to these 'ere diggings, that air Squire
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins was a poar Yankee school-master, that said 'pail' instid of
    </p>
    <p>
     bucket, and that called a cow a 'caow,' and that couldn't tell to save
    </p>
    <p>
     his gizzard what we meant by '_low_[15] and by _right smart_[16]. But
    </p>
    <p>
     he's larnt our ways now, an' he's jest as civilized as the rest of us.
    </p>
    <p>
     You would-n know he'd ever been a Yankee. He didn't stay poar long. Not
    </p>
    <p>
     he. He jest married a right rich girl! He! he!" And the old woman
    </p>
    <p>
     grinned at Ralph, and then at Mirandy, and then at the rest, until Ralph
    </p>
    <p>
     shuddered. Nothing was so frightful to him as to be fawned on by this
    </p>
    <p>
     grinning ogre, whose few lonesome, blackish teeth seemed ready to devour
    </p>
    <p>
     him. "He didn't stay poar, you bet a hoss!" and with this the coal was
    </p>
    <p>
     deposited on the pipe, and the lips began to crack like parchment as
    </p>
    <p>
     each puff of smoke escaped. "He married rich, you see," and here another
    </p>
    <p>
     significant look at the young master, and another fond look at Mirandy,
    </p>
    <p>
     as she puffed away reflectively. "His wife hadn't no book-larnin'. She'd
    </p>
    <p>
     been through the spellin'-book wunst, and had got as fur as 'asperity'
    </p>
    <p>
     on it a second time. But she couldn't read a word when she was married,
    </p>
    <p>
     and never could. She warn't overly smart. She hadn't hardly got the
    </p>
    <p>
     sense the law allows. But schools was skase in them air days, and,
    </p>
    <p>
     besides, book-larnin' don't do no good to a woman. Makes her stuck up. I
    </p>
    <p>
     never knowed but one gal in my life as had ciphered into fractions, and
    </p>
    <p>
     she was so dog-on stuck up that she turned up her nose one night at a
    </p>
    <p>
     apple-peelin' bekase I tuck a sheet off the bed to splice out the
    </p>
    <p>
     table-cloth, which was rather short. And the sheet was mos' clean too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Had-n been slep on more'n wunst or twicet. But I was goin' fer to say
    </p>
    <p>
     that when Squire Hawkins married Virginny Gray he got a heap o' money,
    </p>
    <p>
     or, what's the same thing mostly, a heap o' good land. And that's
    </p>
    <p>
     better'n book-larnin', says I. Ef a gal had gone clean through all
    </p>
    <p>
     eddication, and got to the rule of three itself, that would-n buy a
    </p>
    <p>
     feather-bed. Squire Hawkins jest put eddication agin the gal's farm, and
    </p>
    <p>
     traded even, an' ef ary one of 'em got swindled, I never heerd no
    </p>
    <p>
     complaints."
    </p>
    <p>
     And here she looked at Ralph in triumph, her hard face splintering into
    </p>
    <p>
     the hideous semblance of a smile. And Mirandy cast a blushing, gushing,
    </p>
    <p>
     all-imploring, and all-confiding look on the young master.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I say, ole woman," broke in old Jack, "I say, wot is all this 'ere
    </p>
    <p>
     spoutin' about the Square fer?" and old Jack, having bit off an ounce of
    </p>
    <p>
     "pigtail," returned the plug to his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
     As for Ralph, he fell into a sort of terror. He had a guilty feeling
    </p>
    <p>
     that this speech of the old lady's had somehow committed him beyond
    </p>
    <p>
     recall to Mirandy. He did not see visions of breach-of-promise suits.
    </p>
    <p>
     But he trembled at the thought of an avenging big brother.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hanner, you kin come along, too, ef you're a mind, when you git the
    </p>
    <p>
     dishes washed," said Mrs. Means to the bound girl, as she shut and
    </p>
    <p>
     latched the back door. The Means family had built a new house in front
    </p>
    <p>
     of the old one, as a sort of advertisement of bettered circumstances, an
    </p>
    <p>
     eruption of shoddy feeling; but when the new building was completed,
    </p>
    <p>
     they found themselves unable to occupy it for anything else than a
    </p>
    <p>
     lumber room, and so, except a parlor which Mirandy had made an effort to
    </p>
    <p>
     furnish a little (in hope of the blissful time when somebody should "set
    </p>
    <p>
     up" with her of evenings), the new building was almost unoccupied, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the family went in and out through the back door, which, indeed, was the
    </p>
    <p>
     front door also, for, according to a curious custom, the "front" of the
    </p>
    <p>
     house was placed toward the south, though the "big road" (Hoosier for
    </p>
    <p>
     _highway_) ran along the north-west side, or, rather, past the
    </p>
    <p>
     north-west corner of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the old woman had spoken thus to Hannah and had latched the door,
    </p>
    <p>
     she muttered, "That gal don't never show no gratitude fer favors;" to
    </p>
    <p>
     which Bud rejoined that he didn't think she had no great sight to be
    </p>
    <p>
     pertickler thankful fer. To which Mrs. Means made no reply, thinking it
    </p>
    <p>
     best, perhaps, not to wake up her dutiful son on so interesting a theme
    </p>
    <p>
     as her treatment of Hannah. Ralph felt glad that he was this evening to
    </p>
    <p>
     go to another boarding place. He should not hear the rest of the
    </p>
    <p>
     controversy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph walked to the school-house with Bill. They were friends again. For
    </p>
    <p>
     when Hank Banta's ducking and his dogged obstinacy in sitting in his wet
    </p>
    <p>
     clothes had brought on a serious fever, Ralph had called together the
    </p>
    <p>
     big boys, and had said: "We must take care of one another, boys. Who
    </p>
    <p>
     will volunteer to take turns sitting up with Henry?" He put his own name
    </p>
    <p>
     down, and all the rest followed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "William Means and myself will sit up to-night," said Ralph. And poor
    </p>
    <p>
     Bill had been from that moment the teacher's friend. He was chosen to be
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph's companion. He was Puppy Means no longer! Hank could not be
    </p>
    <p>
     conquered by kindness, and the teacher was made to feel the bitterness
    </p>
    <p>
     of his resentment long after. But Bill Means was for the time entirely
    </p>
    <p>
     placated, and he and Ralph went to spelling-school together.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every family furnished a candle. There were yellow dips and white dips,
    </p>
    <p>
     burning, smoking, and flaring. There was laughing, and talking, and
    </p>
    <p>
     giggling, and simpering, and ogling, and flirting, and courting. What a
    </p>
    <p>
     full-dress party is to Fifth Avenue, a spelling-school is to Hoopole
    </p>
    <p>
     County. It is an occasion which is metaphorically inscribed with this
    </p>
    <p>
     legend: "Choose your partners." Spelling is only a blind in Hoopole
    </p>
    <p>
     County, as is dancing on Fifth Avenue. But as there are some in society
    </p>
    <p>
     who love dancing for its own sake, so in Flat Creek district there were
    </p>
    <p>
     those who loved spelling for its own sake, and who, smelling the battle
    </p>
    <p>
     from afar, had come to try their skill in this tournament, hoping to
    </p>
    <p>
     freshen the laurels they had won in their school-days.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I 'low," said Mr. Means, speaking as the principal school trustee, "I
    </p>
    <p>
     'low our friend the Square is jest the man to boss this 'ere consarn
    </p>
    <p>
     to-night. Ef nobody objects, I'll app'int him. Come, Square, don't be
    </p>
    <p>
     bashful. Walk up to the trough, fodder or no fodder, as the man said to
    </p>
    <p>
     his donkey."
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a general giggle at this, and many of the young swains took
    </p>
    <p>
     occasion to nudge the girls alongside them, ostensibly for the purpose
    </p>
    <p>
     of making them see the joke, but really for the pure pleasure of
    </p>
    <p>
     nudging. The Greeks figured Cupid as naked, probably because he wears so
    </p>
    <p>
     many disguises that they could not select a costume for him.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Squire came to the front. Ralph made an inventory of the
    </p>
    <p>
     agglomeration which bore the name of Squire Hawkins, as follows:
    </p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>
     1. A swallow-tail coat of indefinite age, worn only on state occasions^
    </head>
    <p>
     when its owner was called to figure in his public capacity. Either the
    </p>
    <p>
     Squire had grown too large or the coat too small.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>
     2. A pair of black gloves, the most phenomenal, abnormal, and unexpected
    </head>
    <p>
     apparition conceivable in Flat Creek district, where the preachers wore
    </p>
    <p>
     no coats in the summer, and where a black glove was never seen except on
    </p>
    <p>
     the hands of the Squire.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>
     3. A wig of that dirty, waxen color so common to wigs. This one showed a
    </head>
    <p>
     continual inclination to slip off the owner's smooth, bald pate, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     Squire had frequently to adjust it. As his hair had been red, the wig
    </p>
    <p>
     did not accord with his face, and the hair ungrayed was doubly
    </p>
    <p>
     discordant with a countenance shrivelled by age.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>
     4. A semicircular row of whiskers hedging the edge of the jaw and chin.
    </head>
    <p>
     These were dyed a frightful dead-black, such a color as belonged to no
    </p>
    <p>
     natural hair or beard that ever existed. At the roots there was a
    </p>
    <p>
     quarter of an inch of white, giving the whiskers the appearance of
    </p>
    <p>
     having been stuck on.
    </p>
   </div>

     5. A pair of spectacles "with tortoise-shell rim." Wont to slip off.

    <head>
     6. A glass eye, purchased of a peddler, and differing in color from its
    </head>
    <p>
     natural mate, perpetually getting out of focus by turning in or out.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>
     7. A set of false teeth, badly fitted, and given to bobbing up and

    <p>
     down.

   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>
     8. The Squire proper, to whom these patches were loosely attached.
    </head>
    <p>
     It is an old story that a boy wrote home to his father begging him to
    </p>
    <p>
     come West, because "mighty mean men get into office out here." But Ralph
    </p>
    <p>
     concluded that some Yankees had taught school in Hoopole County who
    </p>
    <p>
     would not have held a high place in the educational institutions of
    </p>
    <p>
     Massachusetts. Hawkins had some New England idioms, but they were well
    </p>
    <p>
     overlaid by a Western pronunciation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ladies and gentlemen," he began, shoving up his spectacles, and sucking
    </p>
    <p>
     his lips over his white teeth to keep them in place, "ladies and
    </p>
    <p>
     gentlemen, young men and maidens, raley I'm obleeged to Mr. Means fer
    </p>
    <p>
     this honor," and the Squire took both hands and turned the top of his
    </p>
    <p>
     head round half an inch. Then he adjusted his spectacles. Whether he was
    </p>
    <p>
     obliged to Mr. Means for the honor of being compared to a donkey was not
    </p>
    <p>
     clear. "I feel in the inmost compartments of my animal spirits a most
    </p>
    <p>
     happifying sense of the success and futility of all my endeavors to
    </p>
    <p>
     sarve the people of Flat Creek deestrick, and the people of Tomkins
    </p>
    <p>
     township, in my weak way and manner." This burst of eloquence was
    </p>
    <p>
     delivered with a constrained air and an apparent sense of a danger that
    </p>
    <p>
     he, Squire Hawkins, might fall to pieces in his weak way and manner,
    </p>
    <p>
     and of the success and futility of all attempts at reconstruction. For
    </p>
    <p>
     by this time the ghastly pupil of the left eye, which was black, was
    </p>
    <p>
     looking away round to the left, while the little blue one on the right
    </p>
    <p>
     twinkled cheerfully toward the front. The front teeth would drop down so
    </p>
    <p>
     that the Squire's mouth was kept nearly closed, and his words whistled
    </p>
    <p>
     through.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I feel as if I could be grandiloquent on this interesting occasion,"
    </p>
    <p>
     twisting his scalp round, "but raley I must forego any such exertions.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is spelling you want. Spelling is the corner-stone, the grand,
    </p>
    <p>
     underlying subterfuge, of a good eddication. I put the spellin'-book
    </p>
    <p>
     prepared by the great Daniel Webster alongside the Bible. I do, raley. I
    </p>
    <p>
     think I may put it ahead of the Bible. For if it wurn't fer
    </p>
    <p>
     spellin'-books and sich occasions as these, where would the Bible be? I
    </p>
    <p>
     should like to know. The man who got up, who compounded this work of
    </p>
    <p>
     inextricable valoo was a benufactor to the whole human race or any
    </p>
    <p>
     other." Here the spectacles fell off. The Squire replaced them in some
    </p>
    <p>
     confusion, gave the top of his head another twist, and felt of his glass
    </p>
    <p>
     eye, while poor Shocky stared in wonder, and Betsey Short rolled from
    </p>
    <p>
     side to side in the effort to suppress her giggle. Mrs. Means and the
    </p>
    <p>
     other old ladies looked the applause they could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I app'int Larkin Lanham and Jeems Buchanan fer captings," said the
    </p>
    <p>
     Squire. And the two young men thus named took a stick and tossed it from
    </p>
    <p>
     hand to hand to decide which should have the "first choice." One tossed
    </p>
    <p>
     the stick to the other, who held it fast just where he happened to catch
    </p>
    <p>
     it. Then the first placed his hand above the second, and so the hands
    </p>
    <p>
     were alternately changed to the top. The one who held the stick last
    </p>
    <p>
     without room for the other to take hold had gained the lot. This was
    </p>
    <p>
     tried three times. As Larkin held the stick twice out of three times, he
    </p>
    <p>
     had the choice. He hesitated a moment. Everybody looked toward tall Jim
    </p>
    <p>
     Phillips. But Larkin was fond of a venture on unknown seas, and so he
    </p>
    <p>
     said, "I take the master," while a buzz of surprise ran round the room,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the captain of the other side, as if afraid his opponent would
    </p>
    <p>
     withdraw the choice, retorted quickly, and with a little smack of
    </p>
    <p>
     exultation and defiance in his voice, "And _I_ take Jeems Phillips."
    </p>
    <p>
     And soon all present, except a few of the old folks, found themselves
    </p>
    <p>
     ranged in opposing hosts, the poor spellers lagging in, with what grace
    </p>
    <p>
     they could, at the foot of the two divisions. The Squire opened his
    </p>
    <p>
     spelling-book and began to give out the words to the two captains, who
    </p>
    <p>
     stood up and spelled against each other. It was not long until Larkin
    </p>
    <p>
     spelled "really" with one _l_, and had to sit down in confusion, while a
    </p>
    <p>
     murmur of satisfaction ran through the ranks of the opposing forces. His
    </p>
    <p>
     own side bit their lips. The slender figure of the young teacher took
    </p>
    <p>
     the place of the fallen leader, and the excitement made the house very
    </p>
    <p>
     quiet. Ralph dreaded the loss of prestige he would suffer if he should
    </p>
    <p>
     be easily spelled down. And at the moment of rising he saw in the
    </p>
    <p>
     darkest corner the figure of a well-dressed young man sitting in the
    </p>
    <p>
     shadow. Why should his evil genius haunt him? But by a strong effort he
    </p>
    <p>
     turned his attention away from Dr. Small, and listened carefully to the
    </p>
    <p>
     words which the Squire did not pronounce very distinctly, spelling them
    </p>
    <p>
     with extreme deliberation. This gave him an air of hesitation which
    </p>
    <p>
     disappointed those on his own side. They wanted him to spell with a
    </p>
    <p>
     dashing assurance. But he did not begin a word until he had mentally
    </p>
    <p>
     felt his way through it. After ten minutes of spelling hard words Jeems
    </p>
    <p>
     Buchanan, the captain on the other side, spelled "atrocious" with an _s_
    </p>
    <p>
     instead of a _c_, and subsided, his first choice, Jeems Phillips, coming
    </p>
    <p>
     up against the teacher. This brought the excitement to fever-heat. For
    </p>
    <p>
     though Ralph was chosen first, it was entirely on trust, and most of
    </p>
    <p>
     the company were disappointed. The champion who now stood up against the
    </p>
    <p>
     school-master was a famous speller.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jim Phillips was a tall, lank, stoop-shouldered fellow who had never
    </p>
    <p>
     distinguished himself in any other pursuit than spelling. Except in this
    </p>
    <p>
     one art of spelling he was of no account. He could not catch well or bat
    </p>
    <p>
     well in ball. He could not throw well enough to make his mark in that
    </p>
    <p>
     famous West ern game of bull-pen. He did not succeed well in any study
    </p>
    <p>
     but that of Webster's Elementary. But in that he was--to use the usual
    </p>
    <p>
     Flat Creek locution--in that he was "a boss." This genius for spelling
    </p>
    <p>
     is in some people a sixth sense, a matter of intuition. Some spellers
    </p>
    <p>
     are born, and not made, and their facility reminds one of the
    </p>
    <p>
     mathematical prodigies that crop out every now and then to bewilder the
    </p>
    <p>
     world. Bud Means, foreseeing that Ralph would be pitted against Jim
    </p>
    <p>
     Phillips, had warned his friend that Jim could "spell like thunder and
    </p>
    <p>
     lightning," and that it "took a powerful smart speller" to beat him, for
    </p>
    <p>
     he knew "a heap of spelling-book." To have "spelled down the master" is
    </p>
    <p>
     next thing to having whipped the biggest bully in Hoopole County, and
    </p>
    <p>
     Jim had "spelled down" the last three masters. He divided the
    </p>
    <p>
     hero-worship of the district with Bud Means.
    </p>
    <p>
     For half an hour the Squire gave out hard words. What a blessed thing
    </p>
    <p>
     our crooked orthography is! Without it there could be no
    </p>
    <p>
     spelling-schools. As Ralph discovered his opponent's mettle he became
    </p>
    <p>
     more and more cautious. He was now satisfied that Jim would eventually
    </p>
    <p>
     beat him. The fellow evidently knew more about the spelling-book than
    </p>
    <p>
     old Noah Webster himself. As he stood there, with his dull face and long
    </p>
    <p>
     sharp nose, his hands behind his back, and his voice spelling
    </p>
    <p>
     infallibly, it seemed to Hartsook that his superiority must lie in his
    </p>
    <p>
     nose. Ralph's cautiousness answered a double purpose; it enabled him to
    </p>
    <p>
     tread surely, and it was mistaken by Jim for weakness. Phillips was now
    </p>
    <p>
     confident that he should carry off the scalp of the fourth school-master
    </p>
    <p>
     before the evening was over. He spelled eagerly, confidently,
    </p>
    <p>
     brilliantly. Stoop-shouldered as he was, he began to straighten up. In
    </p>
    <p>
     the minds of all the company the odds were in his favor. He saw this,
    </p>
    <p>
     and became ambitious to distinguish himself by spelling without giving
    </p>
    <p>
     the matter any thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph always believed that he would have been speedily defeated by
    </p>
    <p>
     Phillips had it not been for two thoughts which braced him. The sinister
    </p>
    <p>
     shadow of young Dr. Small sitting in the dark corner by the water-bucket
    </p>
    <p>
     nerved him. A victory over Phillips was a defeat to one who wished only
    </p>
    <p>
     ill to the young school-master. The other thought that kept his pluck
    </p>
    <p>
     alive was the recollection of Bull. He approached a word as Bull
    </p>
    <p>
     approached the raccoon. He did not take hold until he was sure of his
    </p>
    <p>
     game. When he took hold, it was with a quiet assurance of success. As
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph spelled in this dogged way for half an hour the hardest words the
    </p>
    <p>
     Squire could find, the excitement steadily rose in all parts of the
    </p>
    <p>
     house, and Ralph's friends even ventured to whisper that "maybe Jim had
    </p>
    <p>
     cotched his match, after all!"
    </p>
    <p>
     But Phillips never doubted of his success.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Theodolite," said the Squire.
    </p>
    <p>
     "T-h-e, the o-d, od, theod, o, theodo, l-y-t-e, theodolite," spelled the
    </p>
    <p>
     champion.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Next," said the Squire, nearly losing his teeth In his excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph spelled the word slowly and correctly, and the conquered champion
    </p>
    <p>
     sat down In confusion. The excitement was so great for some minutes that
    </p>
    <p>
     the spelling was suspended. Everybody In the house had shown sympathy
    </p>
    <p>
     with one or the other of the combatants, except the silent shadow in the
    </p>
    <p>
     corner. It had not moved during the contest, and did not show any
    </p>
    <p>
     interest now in the result.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Gewhilliky crickets! Thunder and lightning! Licked him all to smash!"
    </p>
    <p>
     said Bud, rubbing his hands on his knees, "That beats my time all
    </p>
    <p>
     holler!"
    </p>
    <p>
     And Betsey Short giggled until her tuck-comb fell out, though she was on
    </p>
    <p>
     the defeated side.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shocky got up and danced with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
     But one suffocating look from the aqueous eyes of Mirandy destroyed the
    </p>
    <p>
     last spark of Ralph's pleasure in his triumph, and sent that awful
    </p>
    <p>
     below-zero feeling all through him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "He's powerful smart, is the master," said old Jack to Mr. Pete Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
     "He'll beat the whole kit and tuck of 'em afore he's through. I know'd
    </p>
    <p>
     he was smart. That's the reason I tuck him," proceeded Mr. Means.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yaas, but he don't lick enough. Not nigh," answered Pete Jones. "No
    </p>
    <p>
     lickin', no larnin', says I."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was now not so hard. The other spellers on the opposite side went
    </p>
    <p>
     down quickly under the hard words which the Squire gave out. The master
    </p>
    <p>
     had mowed down all but a few, his opponents had given up the battle, and
    </p>
    <p>
     all had lost their keen interest in a contest to which there could be
    </p>
    <p>
     but one conclusion, for there were only the poor spellers left. But
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph Hartsook ran against a stump where he was least expecting it. It
    </p>
    <p>
     was the Squire's custom, when one of the smaller scholars or poorer
    </p>
    <p>
     spellers rose to spell against the master, to give out eight or ten
    </p>
    <p>
     easy words, that they might have some breathing-spell before being
    </p>
    <p>
     slaughtered, and then to give a poser or two which soon settled them. He
    </p>
    <p>
     let them run a little, as a cat does a doomed mouse. There was now but
    </p>
    <p>
     one person left on the opposite side, and, as she rose in her blue
    </p>
    <p>
     calico dress, Ralph recognized Hannah, the bound girl at old Jack
    </p>
    <p>
     Means's. She had not attended school in the district, and had never
    </p>
    <p>
     spelled in spelling-school before, and was chosen last as an uncertain
    </p>
    <p>
     quantity. The Squire began with easy words of two syllables, from that
    </p>
    <p>
     page of Webster, so well known to all who ever thumbed it, as "baker,"
    </p>
    <p>
     from the word that stands at the top of the page. She spelled these
    </p>
    <p>
     words in an absent and uninterested manner. As everybody knew that she
    </p>
    <p>
     would have to go down as soon as this preliminary skirmishing was over,
    </p>
    <p>
     everybody began to get ready to go home, and already there was the buzz
    </p>
    <p>
     of preparation. Young men were timidly asking girls if "they could see
    </p>
    <p>
     them safe home," which was the approved formula, and were trembling in
    </p>
    <p>
     mortal fear of "the mitten." Presently the Squire, thinking it time to
    </p>
    <p>
     close the contest, pulled his scalp forward, adjusted his glass eye,
    </p>
    <p>
     which had been examining his nose long enough, and turned over the
    </p>
    <p>
     leaves of the book to the great words at the place known to spellers as
    </p>
    <p>
     "incomprehensibility," and began to give out those "words of eight
    </p>
    <p>
     syllables with the accent on the sixth." Listless scholars now turned
    </p>
    <p>
     round, and ceased to whisper, in order to be in at the master's final
    </p>
    <p>
     triumph. But to their surprise "ole Miss Meanses' white nigger," as some
    </p>
    <p>
     of them called her in allusion to her slavish life, spelled these great
    </p>
    <p>
     words with as perfect ease as the master. Still not doubting the result,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Squire turned from place to place and selected all the hard words he
    </p>
    <p>
     could find. The school became utterly quiet, the excitement was too
    </p>
    <p>
     great for the ordinary buzz. Would "Meanses' Hanner" beat the master?
    </p>
    <p>
     beat the master that had laid out Jim Phillips? Everybody's sympathy was
    </p>
    <p>
     now turned to Hannah. Ralph noticed that even Shocky had deserted him,
    </p>
    <p>
     and that his face grew brilliant every time Hannah spelled a word. In
    </p>
    <p>
     fact, Ralph deserted himself. As he saw the fine, timid face of the girl
    </p>
    <p>
     so long oppressed flush and shine with interest; as he looked at the
    </p>
    <p>
     rather low but broad and intelligent brow and the fresh, white
    </p>
    <p>
     complexion and saw the rich, womanly nature coming to the surface under
    </p>
    <p>
     the influence of applause and sympathy--he did not want to beat. If he
    </p>
    <p>
     had not felt that a victory given would insult her, he would have missed
    </p>
    <p>
     intentionally. The bulldog, the stern, relentless setting of the will,
    </p>
    <p>
     had gone, he knew not whither. And there had come in its place, as he
    </p>
    <p>
     looked in that face, a something which he did not understand. You did
    </p>
    <p>
     not, gentle reader, the first time it came to you.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Squire was puzzled. He had given out all the hard words in the book.
    </p>
    <p>
     He again pulled the top of his head forward. Then he wiped his
    </p>
    <p>
     spectacles and put them on. Then out of the depths of his pocket he
    </p>
    <p>
     fished up a list of words just coming into use in those days--words not
    </p>
    <p>
     in the spelling-book. He regarded the paper attentively with his blue
    </p>
    <p>
     right eye. His black left eye meanwhile fixed itself in such a stare on
    </p>
    <p>
     Mirandy Means that she shuddered and hid her eyes in her red silk
    </p>
    <p>
     handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Daguerreotype," sniffed the Squire. It was Ralph's turn.
    </p>
    <p>
     "D-a-u, dau--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Next."
    </p>
    <p>
     And Hannah spelled it right.
    </p>
    <p>
     Such a buzz followed that Betsey Short's giggle could not be heard, but
    </p>
    <p>
     Shocky shouted: "Hanner beat! my Hanner spelled down the master!" And
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph went over and congratulated her.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Dr. Small sat perfectly still in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then the Squire called them to order, and said: "As our friend
    </p>
    <p>
     Hanner Thomson is the only one left on her side, she will have to spell
    </p>
    <p>
     against nearly all on t'other side. I shall therefore take the liberty
    </p>
    <p>
     of procrastinating the completion of this interesting and exacting
    </p>
    <p>
     contest until to-morrow evening. I hope our friend Hanner may again
    </p>
    <p>
     carry off the cypress crown of glory. There is nothing better for us
    </p>
    <p>
     than healthful and kindly simulation."
    </p>
    <p>
     Dr. Small, who knew the road to practice, escorted Mirandy, and Bud went
    </p>
    <p>
     home with somebody else. The others of the Means family hurried on,
    </p>
    <p>
     while Hannah, the champion, stayed behind a minute to speak to Shocky.
    </p>
    <p>
     Perhaps it was because Ralph saw that Hannah must go alone that he
    </p>
    <p>
     suddenly remembered having left something which was of no consequence,
    </p>
    <p>
     and resolved to go round by Mr. Means's and get it.

     [Footnote 14: _Peart_ or peert is only another form of the old word

     _pert_--probably an older form. Bartlett cites an example of _peart_ as

    <p>
     far back as Sir Philip Sidney; and Halliwell finds it in various English

    <p>
     dialects. Davies, afterward president of Princeton College, describes

    <p>
     Dr. Lardner, in 1754, as "a little pert old gent." I do not know that

    <p>
     Dr. Daries pronounced his _pert_ as though it were _peart_, but he uses
    </p>
    <p>
     it in the sense it has in the text, viz., bright-witted, intelligent.

     The general sense of _peart_ is lively, either in body or mind.]

    <p>
     gave a Low Latin original of similar sound. I have not been able to

    <p>
     trace any such word, but Mr. Lowell had so much linguistic knowledge of

    <p>
     the out-of-the-way sort that it may be worth while to record his

     his attempts to explain dialect outside of New England. It does not mean

    <p>
     "to declare, assert, maintain," etc. It is nearly the equivalent of
    </p>
    <p>
     _guess_ in the Northern and Middle States, and of _reckon_ in the South.
    </p>
    <p>
     It agrees precisely with the New England _calk'late_. Like all the rest
    </p>
    <p>
     of these words it may have a strong sense by irony. When a man says, "I
    </p>
    <p>
     'low that is a purty peart sort of a hoss," he understates for the sake
    </p>
    <p>
     of emphasis. It is rarely or never _allow_, but simply _'low_. In common
    </p>
    <p>
     with _calk'late_, it has sometimes a sense of purpose or expectation, as
    </p>
    <p>
     when a man says, "I 'low to go to town to-morry."]
    </p>
    <p>
     [Footnote 16: No phrase of the Hoosier and South-western dialect is such
    </p>
    <p>
     a stumbling-block to the outsider as _right smart_. The writer from the
    </p>
    <p>
     North or East will generally use it wrongly. Mrs. Stowe says, "I sold
    </p>
    <p>
     right smart of eggs," but the Hoosier woman as I knew her would have
    </p>
    <p>
     said "a right smart lot of eggs" or "a right smart of eggs," using the
    </p>
    <p>
     article and understanding the noun. A farmer omitting the preposition
    </p>
    <p>
     boasts of having "raised right smart corn" this year. No expression
    </p>
    <p>
     could have a more vague sense than this. In the early settlement of
    </p>
    <p>
     Minnesota it was a custom of the land officers to require a residence of
    </p>
    <p>
     about ten days on "a claim" in order to the establishment of a
    </p>
    <p>
     pre-emption right. One of the receivers at a land office under
    </p>
    <p>
     Buchanan's administration was a German of much intelligence who was very
    </p>
    <p>
     sensitive regarding his knowledge of English. "How long has the claimant
    </p>
    <p>
     lived on his claim?" he demanded of a Hoosier witness. "Oh, a right
    </p>
    <p>
     smart while," was the reply. The receiver had not the faintest notion of
    </p>
    <p>
     the meaning of the answer, but fearing to betray his ignorance of
    </p>
    <p>
     English he allowed the land to be entered, though the claimant had spent
    </p>
    <p>
     but about two hours in residing on his quarter-section.]

     CHAPTER V.
    </head>
    <p>
     THE WALK HOME.
    </p>
    <p>
     You expect me to describe that walk. You have had enough of the Jack
    </p>
    <p>
     Meanses and the Squire Hawkinses, and the Pete Joneses, and the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
     You wish me to tell you now of this true-hearted girl and her lover; of
    </p>
    <p>
     how the silvery moonbeams came down in a shower--to use Whittier's
    </p>
    <p>
     favorite metaphor--through the maple boughs, flecking the frozen ground
    </p>
    <p>
     with light and shadow. You would have me tell of the evening star, not
    </p>
    <p>
     yet gone down, which shed its benediction on them. But I shall do no
    </p>
    <p>
     such thing. For the moon was not shining, neither did the stars give
    </p>
    <p>
     their light. The tall, black trunks of the maples swayed and shook in
    </p>
    <p>
     the wind, which moaned through their leafless boughs. Novelists always
    </p>
    <p>
     make lovers walk in the moonlight. But if love is not, as the cynics
    </p>
    <p>
     believe, all moonshine, it can at least make its own light. Moonlight is
    </p>
    <p>
     never so little needed or heeded, never so much of an impertinence, as
    </p>
    <p>
     in a love-scene. It was at the bottom of the first hollow beyond the
    </p>
    <p>
     school-house that Ralph overtook the timid girl walking swiftly through
    </p>
    <p>
     the dark. He did not ask permission to walk with her. Love does not go
    </p>
    <p>
     by words, and there are times when conventionality is impossible. There
    </p>
    <p>
     are people who understand one another at once. When one soul meets
    </p>
    <p>
     another, it is not by pass-word, nor by hailing sign, nor by mysterious
    </p>
    <p>
     grip that they recognize. The subtlest freemasonry in the world is this
    </p>
    <p>
     freemasonry of the spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph and Hannah knew and trusted. Ralph had admired and wondered at the
    </p>
    <p>
     quiet drudge. But it was when, in the unaccustomed sunshine of praise,
    </p>
    <p>
     she spread her wings a little, that he loved her. He had seen her awake.
    </p>
    <p>
     You, Miss Amelia, wish me to repeat all their love-talk. I am afraid
    </p>
    <p>
     you'd find it dull. Love can pipe through any kind of a reed. Ralph
    </p>
    <p>
     talked love to Hannah when he spoke of the weather, of the crops, of the
    </p>
    <p>
     spelling-school. Weather, crops, and spelling-school--these were what
    </p>
    <p>
     his words would say if reported. But below all these commonplaces there
    </p>
    <p>
     vibrated something else. One can make love a great deal better when one
    </p>
    <p>
     doesn't speak of love. Words are so poor! Tones and modulations are
    </p>
    <p>
     better. It is an old story that Whitefield could make an audience weep
    </p>
    <p>
     by his way of pronouncing the word Mesopotamia. A lover can sound the
    </p>
    <p>
     whole gamut of his affection in saying Good-morning. The solemnest
    </p>
    <p>
     engagements ever made have been without the intervention of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
     And you, my Gradgrind friend, you think me sentimental. Two young fools
    </p>
    <p>
     they were, walking so slowly though the night was sharp, dallying under
    </p>
    <p>
     the trees, and dreaming of a heaven they could not have realized if all
    </p>
    <p>
     their wishes had been granted. Of course they were fools! Either they
    </p>
    <p>
     were fools to be so happy, or else some other people are fools not to
    </p>
    <p>
     be. After all, dear Gradgrind, let them be. There's no harm in it.
    </p>
    <p>
     They'll get trouble enough before morning. Let them enjoy the evening. I
    </p>
    <p>
     am not sure but these lovers whom we write down fools are the only wise
    </p>
    <p>
     people after all. Is it not wise to be happy? Let them alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the first time in three years, for the first time since she had
    </p>
    <p>
     crossed the threshold of "Old Jack Means" and come under the domination
    </p>
    <p>
     of Mrs. Old Jack Means, Hannah talked cheerfully, almost gayly. It was
    </p>
    <p>
     something to have a companion to talk to. It was something to be the
    </p>
    <p>
     victor even in a spelling-match, and to be applauded even by Flat Creek.
    </p>
    <p>
     And so, chatting earnestly about the most uninteresting themes, Ralph
    </p>
    <p>
     courteously helped Hannah over the fence, and they took the usual
    </p>
    <p>
     short-cut through the "blue-grass pasture." There came up a little
    </p>
    <p>
     shower, hardly more than a sprinkle, but then It was so nice to have a
    </p>
    <p>
     shower just as they reached the box-elder tree by the spring! It was so
    </p>
    <p>
     thoughtful in Ralph to suggest that the shade of a box-elder is dense,
    </p>
    <p>
     and that Hannah might take cold! And it was so easy for Hannah to yield
    </p>
    <p>
     to the suggestion! Just as though she had not milked the cows in the
    </p>
    <p>
     open lot in the worst storms of the last three years! And just as though
    </p>
    <p>
     the house were not within a stone's-throw! Doubtless it was not prudent
    </p>
    <p>
     to stop here. But let us deal gently with them. Who would not stay in an
    </p>
    <p>
     earthy paradise ten minutes longer, even though it did make purgatory
    </p>
    <p>
     the hotter afterward? And so Hannah stayed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Tell me your circumstances," said Ralph, at last. "I am sure I can help
    </p>
    <p>
     you in something."
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, no! you cannot," and Hannah's face was clouded. "No one can help
    </p>
    <p>
     me. Only time and God. I must go, Mr. Hartsook." And they walked on to
    </p>
    <p>
     the front gate in silence and in some constraint. But still in
    </p>
    <p>
     happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
     As they came to the gate, Dr. Small pushed past them in his cool,
    </p>
    <p>
     deliberate way, and mounted his horse. Ralph bade Hannah good-night,
    </p>
    <p>
     having entirely forgotten the errand which had been his excuse to
    </p>
    <p>
     himself for coming out of his way. He hastened to his new home, the
    </p>
    <p>
     house of Mr. Pete Jones, the same who believed in the inseparableness of
    </p>
    <p>
     "lickin' and larnin'."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're a purty gal, a'n't you? You're a purty gal, a'n't you? _You_
    </p>
    <p>
     air! Yes, you _air_" and Mrs. Means seemed so impressed with Hannah's
    </p>
    <p>
     prettiness that she choked on it, and could get no further. "A purty
    </p>
    <p>
     gal! you! Yes! you air a mighty purty gal!" and the old woman's voice
    </p>
    <p>
     rose till it could have been heard half a mile. "To be a-santerin' along
    </p>
    <p>
     the big road after ten o'clock with the master! Who knows whether he's a
    </p>
    <p>
     fit man fer anybody to go with? Arter all I've been and gone and done
    </p>
    <p>
     fer you! That's the way you pay me! Disgrace me! Yes, I say disgrace me!
    </p>
    <p>
     You're a mean, deceitful thing. Stuck up bekase you spelt the master
    </p>
    <p>
     down. Ketch _me_ lettin' you got to spellin'-school to-morry night!
    </p>
    <p>
     Ketch ME! Yes, ketch ME, I say!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Looky here, marm," said Bud, "it seems to me you're a-makin' a blamed
    </p>
    <p>
     furss about nothin'. Don't yell so's they'll hear you three or four
    </p>
    <p>
     mile. You'll have everybody 'tween here and Clifty waked up." For Mrs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Means had become so excited over the idea of being caught allowing
    </p>
    <p>
     Hannah to go to spelling-school that she had raised her last "Ketch
    </p>
    <p>
     me!" to a perfect whoop.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's the way I'm treated," whimpered the old woman, who knew how to
    </p>
    <p>
     take the "injured innocence" dodge as well as anybody. "That's the way
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm treated. You allers take sides with that air hussy agin your own
    </p>
    <p>
     flesh and blood. You don't keer how much trouble I have. Not you. Not a
    </p>
    <p>
     dog-on'd bit. I may be disgraced by that air ongrateful critter, and you
    </p>
    <p>
     set right here in my own house and sass me about it. A purty fellow you
    </p>
    <p>
     air! An' me a-delvin' and a-drudgin' fer you all my born days. A purty
    </p>
    <p>
     son, a'n't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Bud did not say another word. He sat in the chimney-corner and whistled
    </p>
    <p>
     "Dandy Jim from Caroline." His diversion had produced the effect he
    </p>
    <p>
     sought: for while his tender-hearted mother poured her broadside into
    </p>
    <p>
     his iron-clad feelings, Hannah had slipped up the stairs to her garret
    </p>
    <p>
     bedroom, and when Mrs. Means turned from the callous Bud to finish her
    </p>
    <p>
     assault upon the sensitive girl, she could only gnash her teeth in
    </p>
    <p>
     disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stung by the insults to which she could not grow insensible, Hannah lay
    </p>
    <p>
     awake until the memory of that walk through the darkness came into her
    </p>
    <p>
     soul like a benediction. The harsh voice of the scold died out, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     gentle and courteous voice of Hartsook filled her soul. She recalled
    </p>
    <p>
     piece by piece the whole conversation--all the commonplace remarks about
    </p>
    <p>
     the weather; all the insignificant remarks about the crops; all the
    </p>
    <p>
     unimportant words about the spelling-school. Not for the sake of the
    </p>
    <p>
     remarks. Not for the sake of the weather. Not for the sake of the crops.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not for the sake of the spelling-school. But for the sake of the
    </p>
    <p>
     undertone. And then she traveled back over the three years of her
    </p>
    <p>
     bondage and forward over the three years to come, and fed her heart on
    </p>
    <p>
     the dim hope of rebuilding in some form the home that had been so happy.
    </p>
    <p>
     And she prayed, with more faith than ever before, for deliverance. For
    </p>
    <p>
     love brings faith. Somewhere on in the sleepless night she stood at the
    </p>
    <p>
     window. The moon was shining now, and there was the path through the
    </p>
    <p>
     pasture, and there was the fence, and there was the box-elder.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sat there a long time. Then she saw someone come over the fence and
    </p>
    <p>
     walk to the tree, and then on toward Pete Jones's. Who could it be? She
    </p>
    <p>
     thought she recognized the figure. But she was chilled and shivering,
    </p>
    <p>
     and she crept back again into bed, and dreamed not of the uncertain days
    </p>
    <p>
     to come, but of the blessed days that were past--of a father and a
    </p>
    <p>
     mother and a brother in a happy home. But somehow the school-master was
    </p>
    <p>
     there too.

     CHAPTER VI.
    </head>
    <p>
     A NIGHT AT PETE JONES'S.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Ralph got to Pete Jones's he found that sinister-looking individual
    </p>
    <p>
     in the act of kicking one of his many dogs out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come in, stranger, come in. You'll find this 'ere house full of brats,
    </p>
    <p>
     but I guess you kin kick your way around among 'em. Take a cheer. Here,
    </p>
    <p>
     git out! go to thunder with you!" And with these mild imperatives he
    </p>
    <p>
     boxed one of his boys over in one direction and one of his girls over in
    </p>
    <p>
     the other. "I believe in trainin' up children to mind when they're spoke
    </p>
    <p>
     to," he said to Ralph apologetically. But it seemed to the teacher that
    </p>
    <p>
     he wanted them to mind just a little before they were spoken to.
    </p>
    <p>
     "P'raps you'd like a bed. Well, jest climb up the ladder on the outside
    </p>
    <p>
     of the house. Takes up a thunderin' sight of room to have a stairs
    </p>
    <p>
     inside, and we ha'n't got no room to spare. You'll find a bed in the
    </p>
    <p>
     furdest corner. My Pete's already got half of it, and you can take
    </p>
    <p>
     t'other half. Ef Pete goes to takin' his half in the middle, and tryin'
    </p>
    <p>
     to make you take yourn on both sides, jest kick him."
    </p>
    <p>
     In this comfortless bed "in the furdest corner," Ralph found sleep out
    </p>
    <p>
     of the question. Pete took three-fourths of the bed, and Hannah took all
    </p>
    <p>
     of his thoughts. So he lay, and looked out through the cracks in the
    </p>
    <p>
     "clapboards" (as they call rough shingles in the old West) at the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the clouds had now broken away. And he lay thus recounting to
    </p>
    <p>
     himself, as a miser counts the pieces that compose his hoard, every step
    </p>
    <p>
     of that road from the time he had overtaken Hannah in the hollow to the
    </p>
    <p>
     fence. Then he imagined again the pleasure of helping her over, and then
    </p>
    <p>
     he retraced the ground to the box-elder tree at the spring, and repeated
    </p>
    <p>
     to himself the conversation until he came to the part in which she said
    </p>
    <p>
     that only time and God could help her. What did she mean? What was the
    </p>
    <p>
     hidden part of her life? What was the connection between her and Shocky?
    </p>
    <p>
     Hours wore on, and still the mind of Ralph Hartsook went back and
    </p>
    <p>
     traveled the same road, over the fence, past the box-elder, up to the
    </p>
    <p>
     inexplicable part of the conversation, and stood bewildered with the
    </p>
    <p>
     same puzzling questions about the bound girl's life.
    </p>
    <p>
     At last he got up, drew on his clothes, and sat down on the top of the
    </p>
    <p>
     ladder, looking down over the blue-grass pasture which lay on the border
    </p>
    <p>
     between the land of Jones and the land of Means. The earth was white
    </p>
    <p>
     with moonlight. He could not sleep. Why not walk? It might enable him to
    </p>
    <p>
     sleep. And once determined on walking, he did not hesitate a moment as
    </p>
    <p>
     to the direction in which he should walk. The blue-grass pasture (was it
    </p>
    <p>
     not like unto the garden of Eden?) lay right before him. That box-elder
    </p>
    <p>
     stood just in sight. To spring over the fence and take the path down the
    </p>
    <p>
     hill and over the brook was as quickly done as decided upon. To stand
    </p>
    <p>
     again under the box-elder, to climb again over the farther fence, and to
    </p>
    <p>
     walk down the road toward the school-house was so easy and so delightful
    </p>
    <p>
     that it was done without thought. For Ralph was an eager man--when he
    </p>
    <p>
     saw no wrong in anything that proposed itself, he was wont to follow his
    </p>
    <p>
     impulse without deliberation. And this keeping company with the stars,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the memory of a delightful walk, were so much better than the
    </p>
    <p>
     commonplace Flat Creek life that he threw himself into his night
    </p>
    <p>
     excursion with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
     At last he stood in the little hollow where he had joined Hannah. It was
    </p>
    <p>
     the very spot at which Shocky, too, had met him a few mornings before.
    </p>
    <p>
     He leaned against the fence and tried again to solve the puzzle of
    </p>
    <p>
     Hannah's troubles. For that she had troubles he did not doubt. Neither
    </p>
    <p>
     did he doubt that he could help her if he could discover what they
    </p>
    <p>
     were. But he had no clue. In the midst of This meditations he heard the
    </p>
    <p>
     thud of horses' hoofs coming down the road. Until that moment he had not
    </p>
    <p>
     felt his own loneliness. He shrank back into the fence-corner. The
    </p>
    <p>
     horsemen were galloping. There were three of them, and there was one
    </p>
    <p>
     figure that seemed familiar to Ralph. But he could not tell who it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Neither could he remember having seen the horse, which was a sorrel with
    </p>
    <p>
     a white left forefoot and a white nose. The men noticed him and reined
    </p>
    <p>
     up a little. Why he should have been startled by the presence of these
    </p>
    <p>
     men he could not tell, but an indefinable dread seized him. They
    </p>
    <p>
     galloped on, and he stood still shivering with a nervous fear. The cold
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to have got into his bones. He remembered that the region lying
    </p>
    <p>
     on Flat Creek and Clifty Creek had the reputation of being infested with
    </p>
    <p>
     thieves, who practiced horse-stealing and house-breaking. For ever since
    </p>
    <p>
     the day when Murrell's confederate bands were paralyzed by the death of
    </p>
    <p>
     their leader, there have still existed gangs of desperadoes in parts of
    </p>
    <p>
     Southern Indiana and Illinois, and in Iowa, Missouri, Kentucky, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     Southwest. It is out of these materials that border ruffianism has
    </p>
    <p>
     grown, and the nine members of the Reno band who were hanged two or
    </p>
    <p>
     three years ago by lynch law[17], were remains of the bad blood that
    </p>
    <p>
     came into the West in the days of Daniel Boone. Shall I not say that
    </p>
    <p>
     these bands of desperadoes still found among the "poor whitey,
    </p>
    <p>
     dirt-eater" class are the outcroppings of the bad blood sent from
    </p>
    <p>
     England in convict-ships? Ought an old country to sow the fertile soil
    </p>
    <p>
     of a colony with such noxious seed?
    </p>
    <p>
     Before Ralph was able to move, he heard the hoofs of another horse
    </p>
    <p>
     striking upon the hard ground in an easy pace. The rider was Dr. Small.
    </p>
    <p>
     He checked his horse in a cool way, and stood still a few seconds while
    </p>
    <p>
     he scrutinized Ralph. Then he rode on, keeping the same easy gait as
    </p>
    <p>
     before, Ralph had a superstitious horror of Henry Small. And, shuddering
    </p>
    <p>
     with cold, he crept like a thief over the fence, past the tree, through
    </p>
    <p>
     the pasture, back to Pete Jones's, never once thinking of the eyes that
    </p>
    <p>
     looked out of the window at Means's. Climbing the ladder, he got into
    </p>
    <p>
     bed, and shook as with the ague. He tried to reason himself out of the
    </p>
    <p>
     foolish terror that possessed him, but he could not.
    </p>
    <p>
     Half an hour later he heard a latch raised. Were the robbers breaking
    </p>
    <p>
     into the house below? He heard a soft tread upon the floor. Should he
    </p>
    <p>
     rise and give the alarm? Something restrained him. He reflected that a
    </p>
    <p>
     robber would be sure to stumble over some of the "brats." So he lay
    </p>
    <p>
     still and finally slumbered, only awakening when the place in which he
    </p>
    <p>
     slept was full of the smoke of frying grease from the room below.
    </p>
    <p>
     At breakfast Pete Jones scowled. He was evidently angry about something.
    </p>
    <p>
     He treated Ralph with a rudeness not to be overlooked, as if he intended
    </p>
    <p>
     to bring on a quarrel. Hartsook kept cool, and wished he could drive
    </p>
    <p>
     from his mind all memory of the past night. Why should men on horseback
    </p>
    <p>
     have any significance to him? He was trying to regard things in this
    </p>
    <p>
     way, and from a general desire to keep on good terms with his host he
    </p>
    <p>
     went to the stable to offer his services in helping to feed the stock.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't want no saft-handed help!" was all he got in return for his
    </p>
    <p>
     well-meant offer. But just as he turned to leave the stable he saw what
    </p>
    <p>
     made him tremble again. There was the same sorrel horse with a white
    </p>
    <p>
     left forefoot and a white nose.
    </p>
    <p>
     To shake off his nervousness, Ralph started to school before the time.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, plague upon plagues! Mirandy Means, who had seen him leave Pete
    </p>
    <p>
     Jones's, started just in time to join him where he came into the big
    </p>
    <p>
     road. Ralph was not in a good humor after his wakeful night, and to be
    </p>
    <p>
     thus dogged by Mirandy did not help the matter. So he found himself
    </p>
    <p>
     speaking crabbedly to the daughter of the leading trustee, in spite of
    </p>
    <p>
     himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hanner's got a bad cold this mornin' from bein' out last night, and she
    </p>
    <p>
     can't come to spellin'-school to-night," began Mirandy, in her most
    </p>
    <p>
     simpering voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph had forgotten that there was to be another spelling-school. It
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to him an age since the orthographical conflict of the past
    </p>
    <p>
     night. This remark of Mirandy's fell upon his ear like an echo from the
    </p>
    <p>
     distant past. He had lived a lifetime since, and was not sure that he
    </p>
    <p>
     was the same man who was spelling for dear life against Jim Phillips
    </p>
    <p>
     twelve hours before. But he was sorry to hear that Hannah had a cold. It
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to him, in his depressed state, that he was to blame for it. In
    </p>
    <p>
     fact, it seemed to him that he was to blame for a good many things. He
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to have been committing sins in spite of himself. Broken nerves
    </p>
    <p>
     and sleepless nights often result in a morbid conscience. And what
    </p>
    <p>
     business had he to wander over this very road at two o'clock in the
    </p>
    <p>
     morning, and to see three galloping horsemen, one of them on a horse
    </p>
    <p>
     with a white left forefoot and a white nose? What business had he
    </p>
    <p>
     watching Dr. Small as he went home from the bedside of a dying patient
    </p>
    <p>
     near daylight in the morning? And because he felt guilty he felt cross
    </p>
    <p>
     with Mirandy, and to her remark about Hannah he only replied that
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hannah was a smart girl."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," said Mirandy, "Bud thinks so."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Does he?" said Ralph.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I should say so. What's him and her been a-courtin' fer for a year ef
    </p>
    <p>
     he didn't think she was smart? Marm don't like it; but ef Bud and her
    </p>
    <p>
     does, and they seem to, I don't see as it's marm's lookout."
    </p>
    <p>
     When one is wretched, there is a pleasure in being entirely wretched.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph felt that he must have committed some unknown crime, and that some
    </p>
    <p>
     Nemesis was following him. Was Hannah deceitful? At least, if she were
    </p>
    <p>
     not, he felt sure that he could supplant Bud. But what right had he to
    </p>
    <p>
     supplant Bud?
    </p>
    <p>
     "Did you hear the news?" cried Shocky, running out to meet him. "The
    </p>
    <p>
     Dutchman's house was robbed last night."
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph thought of the three men on horseback, and to save his life he
    </p>
    <p>
     could not help associating Dr. Small with them. And then he remembered
    </p>
    <p>
     the sorrel horse with the left forefoot and muzzle white, and he
    </p>
    <p>
     recalled the sound he had heard as of the lifting of a latch. And it
    </p>
    <p>
     really seemed to him that in knowing what he did he was in some sense
    </p>
    <p>
     guilty of the robbery.

    <p>
     OMINOUS REMARKS OF MR. JONES.
    </p>
    <p>
     The school-master's mind was like ancient Gaul--divided into three
    </p>
    <p>
     parts. With one part he mechanically performed his school duties. With
    </p>
    <p>
     another he asked himself, What shall I do about the robbery? And with
    </p>
    <p>
     the third he debated about Bud and Hannah. For Bud was not present, and
    </p>
    <p>
     it was clear that he was angry, and there was a storm brewing. In fact,
    </p>
    <p>
     it seemed to Ralph that there was a storm brewing all round the sky. For
    </p>
    <p>
     Pete Jones was evidently angry at the thought of having been watched,
    </p>
    <p>
     and it was fair to suppose that Dr. Small was not in any better humor
    </p>
    <p>
     than usual. And so, between Bud's jealousy and revenge and the suspicion
    </p>
    <p>
     and resentment of the men engaged in the robbery at "the Dutchman's" (as
    </p>
    <p>
     the only German in the whole region was called), Ralph's excited nerves
    </p>
    <p>
     had cause for tremor. At one moment he would resolve to have Hannah at
    </p>
    <p>
     all costs. In the next his conscience would question the rightfulness of
    </p>
    <p>
     the conclusion. Then he would make up his mind to tell all he knew
    </p>
    <p>
     about the robbery. But if he told his suspicions about Small, nobody
    </p>
    <p>
     would believe him. And if he told about Pete Jones, he really could tell
    </p>
    <p>
     only enough to bring vengeance upon himself. And how could he explain
    </p>
    <p>
     his own walk through the pasture and down the road? What business had he
    </p>
    <p>
     being out of bed at two o'clock in the morning? The circumstantial
    </p>
    <p>
     evidence was quite as strong against him as against the man on the horse
    </p>
    <p>
     with the white left forefoot and the white nose. Suspicion might fasten
    </p>
    <p>
     on himself. And then what would be the effect on his prospects? On the
    </p>
    <p>
     people at Lewisburg? On Hannah? It is astonishing how much instruction
    </p>
    <p>
     and comfort there is in a bulldog. This slender school-master, who had
    </p>
    <p>
     been all his life repressing the animal and developing the finer nature,
    </p>
    <p>
     now found a need of just what the bulldog had. And so, with the thought
    </p>
    <p>
     of how his friend the dog would fight in a desperate strait, he
    </p>
    <p>
     determined to take hold of his difficulties as Bull took hold of the
    </p>
    <p>
     raccoon. Moral questions he postponed for careful decision. But for the
    </p>
    <p>
     present he set his teeth together in a desperate, bulldog fashion, and
    </p>
    <p>
     he set his feet down slowly, positively, bulldoggedly. After a wretched
    </p>
    <p>
     supper at Pete Jones's he found himself at the spelling-school, which,
    </p>
    <p>
     owing to the absence of Hannah, and the excitement about the burglary,
    </p>
    <p>
     was a dull affair. Half the evening was spent in talking in little
    </p>
    <p>
     knots. Pete Jones had taken the afflicted "Dutchman" under his own
    </p>
    <p>
     particular supervision.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I s'pose," said Pete, "that them air fellers what robbed your house
    </p>
    <p>
     must a come down from Jinkins Run. They're the blamedest set up there I
    </p>
    <p>
     ever see."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ya-as," said Schroeder, "put how did Yinkins vellers know dat I sell te
    </p>
    <p>
     medder to te Shquire, hey? How tid Yinkins know anyting 'bout the
    </p>
    <p>
     Shquire's bayin' me dree huntert in te hard gash--hey?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Some scoundrels down in these 'ere parts is a-layin' in with Jinkins
    </p>
    <p>
     Run, I'll bet a hoss," said Pete. Ralph wondered whether he'd bet the
    </p>
    <p>
     one with the white left forefoot and the white nose. "Now," said Pete,
    </p>
    <p>
     "ef I could find the feller that's a-helpin' them scoundrels rob us
    </p>
    <p>
     folks, I'd help stretch him to the neardest tree."
    </p>
    <p>
     "So vood I," said Schroeder. "I'd shtretch him dill he baid me my dree
    </p>
    <p>
     huntert tollars pack, so I vood."
    </p>
    <p>
     And Betsey Short, who had found the whole affair very funny, was
    </p>
    <p>
     transported with a fit of tittering at poor Schroeder's English. Ralph,
    </p>
    <p>
     fearing that his silence would excite suspicion, tried to talk. But he
    </p>
    <p>
     could not tell what he knew, and all that he said sounded so hollow and
    </p>
    <p>
     hypocritical that it made him feel guilty. And so he shut his mouth, and
    </p>
    <p>
     meditated profitably on the subject of bull dogs. And when later he
    </p>
    <p>
     overheard the garrulous Jones declare that he'd bet a hoss he could
    </p>
    <p>
     p'int out somebody as know'd a blamed sight more'n they keerd to tell,
    </p>
    <p>
     he made up his mind that if it came to p'inting out he should try to be
    </p>
    <p>
     even with Jones.

     CHAPTER VIII.

    <p>
     THE STRUGGLE IN THE DARK
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a long, lonesome, fearful night that the school-master passed,
    </p>
    <p>
     lying with nerves on edge and eyes wide open in that comfortless bed in
    </p>
    <p>
     the "furdest corner" of the loft of Pete Jones's house, shivering with
    </p>
    <p>
     cold, while the light snow that was falling sifted in upon the ragged
    </p>
    <p>
     patch-work quilt that covered him. Nerves broken by sleeplessness
    </p>
    <p>
     imagine many things, and for the first hour Ralph felt sure that Pete
    </p>
    <p>
     would cut his throat before morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     And you, friend Callow, who have blunted your palate by swallowing the
    </p>
    <p>
     Cayenne pepper of the penny-dreadfuls, you wish me to make this night
    </p>
    <p>
     exciting by a hand-to-hand contest between Ralph and a robber. You would
    </p>
    <p>
     like it better if there were a trap-door. There's nothing so convenient
    </p>
    <p>
     as a trap-door, unless it be a subterranean passage. And you'd like
    </p>
    <p>
     something of that sort just here. It's so pleasant to have one's hair
    </p>
    <p>
     stand on end, you know, when one is safe from danger to one's self. But
    </p>
    <p>
     if you want each individual hair to bristle with such a "Struggle in
    </p>
    <p>
     the Dark," you can buy trap-doors and subterranean passages dirt cheap
    </p>
    <p>
     at the next news-stand. But it was, indeed, a real and terrible
    </p>
    <p>
     "Struggle in the Dark" that Ralph fought out at Pete Jones's.
    </p>
    <p>
     When he had vanquished his fears of personal violence by reminding
    </p>
    <p>
     himself that it would be folly for Jones to commit murder in his own
    </p>
    <p>
     house, the question of Bud and Hannah took the uppermost place in his
    </p>
    <p>
     thoughts. And as the image of Hannah spelling against the master came up
    </p>
    <p>
     to him, as the memory of the walk, the talk, the box-elder tree, and all
    </p>
    <p>
     the rest took possession of him, it seemed to Ralph that his very life
    </p>
    <p>
     depended upon his securing her love. He would shut his teeth like the
    </p>
    <p>
     jaws of a bulldog, and all Bud's muscles should not prevail over his
    </p>
    <p>
     resolution and his stratagems.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was easy to persuade himself that this was right. Hannah ought not to
    </p>
    <p>
     throw herself away on Bud Means. Men of some culture always play their
    </p>
    <p>
     conceit off against their consciences. To a man of literary habits it
    </p>
    <p>
     usually seems to be a great boon that he confers on a woman when he
    </p>
    <p>
     gives her his love. Reasoning thus, Ralph had fixed his resolution, and
    </p>
    <p>
     if the night had been shorter, or sleep possible, the color of his life
    </p>
    <p>
     might have been changed.
    </p>
    <p>
     But some time along in the tedious hours came the memory of his
    </p>
    <p>
     childhood, the words of his mother, the old Bible stories, the
    </p>
    <p>
     aspiration after nobility of spirit, the solemn resolutions to be true
    </p>
    <p>
     to his conscience. These angels of the memory came flocking back before
    </p>
    <p>
     the animal, the bull-doggedness, had "set," as workers in plaster say.
    </p>
    <p>
     He remembered the story of David and Nathan, and it seemed to him that
    </p>
    <p>
     he, with all his abilities and ambitions and prospects, was about to rob
    </p>
    <p>
     Bud of the one ewe-lamb, the only thing he had to rejoice in in his
    </p>
    <p>
     life. In getting Hannah, he would make himself unworthy of Hannah. And
    </p>
    <p>
     then there came to him a vision of the supreme value of a true
    </p>
    <p>
     character; how it was better than success, better than to be loved,
    </p>
    <p>
     better than heaven. And how near he had been to missing it! And how
    </p>
    <p>
     certain he was, when these thoughts should fade, to miss it! He was as
    </p>
    <p>
     one fighting for a great prize who feels his strength failing and is
    </p>
    <p>
     sure of defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was the real, awful "Struggle in the Dark." A human soul fighting
    </p>
    <p>
     with heaven in sight, but certain of slipping inevitably into hell! It
    </p>
    <p>
     was the same old battle. The Image of God fought with the Image of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Devil. It was the same fight that Paul described so dramatically when he
    </p>
    <p>
     represented the Spirit as contending with the Flesh. Paul also called
    </p>
    <p>
     this dreadful something the Old Adam, and I suppose Darwin would call it
    </p>
    <p>
     the remains of the Wild Beast. But call it what you will, it is the
    </p>
    <p>
     battle that every well-endowed soul must fight at some point. And to
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph it seemed that the final victory of the Evil, the Old Adam, the
    </p>
    <p>
     Flesh, the Wild Beast, the Devil, was certain. For, was not the pure,
    </p>
    <p>
     unconscious face of Hannah on the Devil's side? And so the battle had
    </p>
    <p>
     just as well be given up at once, for it must be lost in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
     But to Ralph, lying there in the still darkness, with his conscience as
    </p>
    <p>
     wide awake as if it were the Day of Doom, there seemed something so
    </p>
    <p>
     terrible in this overflow of the better nature which he knew to be
    </p>
    <p>
     inevitable as soon as the voice of conscience became blunted, that he
    </p>
    <p>
     looked about for help. He did not at first think of God; but there came
    </p>
    <p>
     into his thoughts the memory of a travel-worn Galilean peasant, hungry,
    </p>
    <p>
     sleepy, weary, tempted, tried, like other men, but having a strange,
    </p>
    <p>
     divine Victory in him by which everything evil was vanquished at his
    </p>
    <p>
     coming. He remembered how He had reached out a Hand to every helpless
    </p>
    <p>
     one, how He was the Helper of every weak one. And out of the depths of
    </p>
    <p>
     his soul he cried to the Helper, and found comfort. Not victory, but,
    </p>
    <p>
     what is better, strength. And so, without a thought of the niceties of
    </p>
    <p>
     theological distinctions, without dreaming that it was the beginning of
    </p>
    <p>
     a religious experience, he found what he needed, help. And the Helper
    </p>
    <p>
     gave His beloved sleep.

     CHAPTER IX.
    </head>
    <p>
     HAS GOD FORGOTTEN SHOCKY?
    </p>
    <p>
     "Pap wants to know ef you would spend to-morry and Sunday at our house?"
    </p>
    <p>
     said one of Squire Hawkins's girls, on the very next evening, which was
    </p>
    <p>
     Friday. The old Squire was thoughtful enough to remember that Ralph
    </p>
    <p>
     would not find it very pleasant "boarding out" all the time he was
    </p>
    <p>
     entitled to spend at Pete Jones's. For in view of the fact that Mr. Pete
    </p>
    <p>
     Jones sent seven children to the school, the "master" in Flat Creek
    </p>
    <p>
     district was bound to spend two weeks in that comfortable place,
    </p>
    <p>
     sleeping in a preoccupied bed, in the "furdest corner," with
    </p>
    <p>
     insufficient cover, under an insufficient roof, and eating floating
    </p>
    <p>
     islands of salt pork fished out of oceans of hot lard. Ralph was not
    </p>
    <p>
     slow to accept the relief offered by the hospitable justice of the
    </p>
    <p>
     peace, whose principal business seemed to be the adjustment of the
    </p>
    <p>
     pieces of which he was composed. And as Shocky traveled the same road,
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph took advantage of the opportunity to talk with him. The master
    </p>
    <p>
     could not dismiss Hannah wholly from his mind. He would at least read
    </p>
    <p>
     the mystery of her life, if Shocky could be prevailed on to furnish the
    </p>
    <p>
     clue.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Poor old tree!" said Shocky, pointing to a crooked and gnarled elm
    </p>
    <p>
     standing by itself in the middle of a field. For when the elm, naturally
    </p>
    <p>
     the most graceful of trees, once gets a "bad set," it can grow to be the
    </p>
    <p>
     most deformed. This solitary tree had not a single straight limb.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why do you say 'poor old tree'?" asked Ralph.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Cause it's lonesome. All its old friends is dead and chopped down, and
    </p>
    <p>
     there's their stumps a-standin' jes like grave-stones. It _must_ be
    </p>
    <p>
     lonesome. Some folks says it don't feel, but I think it does. Everything
    </p>
    <p>
     seems to think and feel. See it nodding its head to them other trees in
    </p>
    <p>
     the woods? and a-wantin' to shake hands! But it can't move. I think that
    </p>
    <p>
     tree must a growed in the night."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, Shocky?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Cause it's so crooked," and Shocky laughed at his own conceit; "must a
    </p>
    <p>
     growed when they was no light so as it could see how to grow."
    </p>
    <p>
     And then they walked on in silence a minute. Presently Shocky began
    </p>
    <p>
     looking up into Ralph's eyes to get a smile. "I guess that tree feels
    </p>
    <p>
     just like me. Don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, how do you feel?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Kind o' bad and lonesome, and like as if I wanted to die, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felt that way ever sence they put my father into the graveyard, and sent
    </p>
    <p>
     my mother to the poor-house and Hanner to ole Miss Means's. What kind of
    </p>
    <p>
     a place is a poor-house? Is it a poorer place than Means's? I wish I was
    </p>
    <p>
     dead and one of them clouds was a-carryin' me and Hanner and mother up
    </p>
    <p>
     to where father's gone, you know! I wonder if God forgets all about poor
    </p>
    <p>
     folks when their father dies and their mother gits into the poor-house?
    </p>
    <p>
     Do you think He does? Seems so to me. Maybe God lost track of my father
    </p>
    <p>
     when he come away from England and crossed over the sea. Don't nobody on
    </p>
    <p>
     Flat Creek keer fer God, and I guess God don't keer fer Flat Creek. But
    </p>
    <p>
     I would, though, ef he'd git my mother out of the poor-house and git
    </p>
    <p>
     Hanner away from Means's, and let me kiss my mother every night, you
    </p>
    <p>
     know, and sleep on my Hanner's arm, jes like I used to afore father
    </p>
    <p>
     died, you see."
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph wanted to speak, but he couldn't. And so Shocky, with his eyes
    </p>
    <p>
     looking straight ahead, and as if forgetting Ralph's presence, told over
    </p>
    <p>
     the thoughts that he had often talked over to the fence-rails and the
    </p>
    <p>
     trees. "It was real good in Mr. Pearson to take me, wasn't it? Else I'd
    </p>
    <p>
     a been bound out tell I was twenty-one, maybe, to some mean man like
    </p>
    <p>
     Ole Means. And I a'n't but seven. And it would take me fourteen years to
    </p>
    <p>
     git twenty-one, and I never could live with my mother again after Hanner
    </p>
    <p>
     gets done her time. 'Cause, you see, Hanner'll be through in three more
    </p>
    <p>
     year, and I'll be ten and able to work, and we'll git a little place
    </p>
    <p>
     about as big as Granny Sanders's, and--"
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph did not hear another word of what Shocky said that afternoon. For
    </p>
    <p>
     there, right before them, was Granny Sanders's log-cabin, with its row
    </p>
    <p>
     of lofty sunflower stalks, now dead and dry, in front, with its
    </p>
    <p>
     rain-water barrel by the side of the low door, and its ash-barrel by the
    </p>
    <p>
     fence. In this cabin lived alone the old and shriveled hag whose
    </p>
    <p>
     hideousness gave her a reputation for almost supernatural knowledge. She
    </p>
    <p>
     was at once doctress and newspaper. She collected and disseminated
    </p>
    <p>
     medicinal herbs and personal gossip. She was in every regard
    </p>
    <p>
     indispensable to the intellectual life of the neighborhood. In the
    </p>
    <p>
     matter of her medical skill we cannot express an opinion, for her
    </p>
    <p>
     "yarbs" are not to be found in the pharmacopoeia of science.
    </p>
    <p>
     What took Ralph's breath was to find Dr. Small's fine, faultless horse
    </p>
    <p>
     standing at the door. What did Henry Small want to visit this old quack
    </p>
    <p>
     for?
    </p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>
     CHAPTER X.
    </head>
    <p>
     THE DEVIL OF SILENCE.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph had reason to fear Small, who was a native of the same village of
    </p>
    <p>
     Lewisburg, and some five years the elder. Some facts in the doctor's
    </p>
    <p>
     life had come into Ralph's possession in such a way as to confirm
    </p>
    <p>
     life-long suspicion without giving him power to expose Small, who was
    </p>
    <p>
     firmly intrenched in the good graces of the people of the county-seat
    </p>
    <p>
     village of Lewisburg, where he had grown up, and of the little
    </p>
    <p>
     cross-roads village of Clifty, where his "shingle" now hung.
    </p>
    <p>
     Small was no ordinary villain. He was a genius. Your ordinary hypocrite
    </p>
    <p>
     talks cant. Small talked nothing. He was the coolest, the steadiest, the
    </p>
    <p>
     most silent, the most promising boy ever born in Lewisburg. He made no
    </p>
    <p>
     pretensions. He set up no claims. He uttered no professions. He went
    </p>
    <p>
     right on and lived a life above reproach. Your vulgar hypocrite makes
    </p>
    <p>
     long prayers in prayer-meeting. Small did nothing of the sort. He sat
    </p>
    <p>
     still in prayer-meeting, and listened to the elders as a modest young
    </p>
    <p>
     man should. Your commonplace hypocrite boasts. Small never alluded to
    </p>
    <p>
     himself, and thus a consummate egotist got credit for modesty. It is but
    </p>
    <p>
     an indifferent trick for a hypocrite to make temperance speeches. Dr.
    </p>
    <p>
     Small did not even belong to a temperance society. But he could never be
    </p>
    <p>
     persuaded to drink even so much as a cup of tea. There was something
    </p>
    <p>
     sublime in the quiet voice with which he would say, "Cold water, if you
    </p>
    <p>
     please," to a lady tempting him with smoking coffee on a cold morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was no exultation, no sense of merit in the act. Everything was
    </p>
    <p>
     done in a modest and matter-of-course way beautiful to behold. And his
    </p>
    <p>
     face was a neutral tint. Neither face nor voice expressed anything. Only
    </p>
    <p>
     a keen reader of character might have asked whether all there was in
    </p>
    <p>
     that eye could live contented with this cool, austere, self-contained
    </p>
    <p>
     life; whether there would not be somewhere a volcanic eruption. But if
    </p>
    <p>
     there was any sea of molten lava beneath, the world did not discover it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wild boys were sick of having Small held up to them as the most
    </p>
    <p>
     immaculate of men[18].
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph had failed to get two schools for which he had applied, and had
    </p>
    <p>
     attributed both failures to certain shrugs of Dr. Small. And now, when
    </p>
    <p>
     he found Small at the house of Granny Sanders, the center of
    </p>
    <p>
     intelligence as well as of ignorance for the neighborhood, he trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not that Small would say anything. He never said anything. He damned
    </p>
    <p>
     people by a silence worse than words.
    </p>
    <p>
     Granny Sanders was not a little flattered by the visit.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, doctor, howdy, howdy! Come in, take a cheer. I am glad to see you.
    </p>
    <p>
     I 'lowed you'd come. Old Dr. Flounder used to say he larnt lots o'
    </p>
    <p>
     things of me. But most of the doctors sence hez been kinder stuck up,
    </p>
    <p>
     you know. But I know'd you fer a man of intelligence."
    </p>
    <p>
     Meantime, Small, by his grave silence and attention, had almost
    </p>
    <p>
     smothered the old hag with flattery. "Many's the case I've cured with
    </p>
    <p>
     yarbs and things. Nigh upon twenty year ago they was a man lived over on
    </p>
    <p>
     Wild Cat Run as had a breakin'-out on his side. 'Twas the left side, jes
    </p>
    <p>
     below the waist. Doctor couldn't do nothin'. 'Twas Doctor Peacham. He
    </p>
    <p>
     never would have nothin' to do with 'ole woman's cures.' Well, the man
    </p>
    <p>
     was goin' to die. Everybody seed that. And they come a-drivin' away over
    </p>
    <p>
     here all the way from the Wild Cat. Think of that air! I never was so
    </p>
    <p>
     flustered. But as soon as I laid eyes on that air man, I says, says
    </p>
    <p>
     I, that air man, says I, has got the shingles, says I. I know'd the
    </p>
    <p>
     minute I seed it. And if they'd gone clean around, nothing could a saved
    </p>
    <p>
     him. I says, says I, git me a black cat. So I jist killed a black cat,
    </p>
    <p>
     and let the blood run all over the swellin'. I tell you, doctor, they's
    </p>
    <p>
     nothin' like it. That man was well in a month."
    </p>
    <p>
     [Illustration: MRS. MEANS]
    </p>
    <p>
     "Did you use the blood warm?" asked Small, with a solemnity most
    </p>
    <p>
     edifying.
    </p>
    <p>
     These were almost the only words he had uttered since he entered the
    </p>
    <p>
     cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Laws, yes; I jest let it run right out of the cat's tail onto the
    </p>
    <p>
     breakin'-out. And fer airesipelus, I don't know nothin' so good as the
    </p>
    <p>
     blood of a black hen."
    </p>
    <p>
     "How old?" asked the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There you showed yer science, doctor! They's no power in a pullet. The
    </p>
    <p>
     older the black hen the better. And you know the cure fer rheumatiz?"
    </p>
    <p>
     And here the old woman got down a bottle of grease. "That's ile from a
    </p>
    <p>
     black dog. Ef it's rendered right, it'll knock the hind sights off of
    </p>
    <p>
     any rheumatiz you ever see. But it must be rendered in the dark of the
    </p>
    <p>
     moon. Else a black dog's ile a'n't worth no more nor a white one's."
    </p>
    <p>
     And all this time Small was smelling of the uncorked bottle, taking a
    </p>
    <p>
     little on his finger and feeling of it, and thus feeling his way to the
    </p>
    <p>
     heart--drier than her herbs--of the old witch. And then he went round
    </p>
    <p>
     the cabin gravely, lifting each separate bunch of dried yarbs from its
    </p>
    <p>
     nail, smelling of it, and then, by making an interrogation-point of his
    </p>
    <p>
     silent face, he managed to get a lecture from her on each article in her
    </p>
    <p>
     _materia medica_&gt; with the most marvelous stories illustrative of their
    </p>
    <p>
     virtues. When the Granny had got her fill of his silent flattery, he was
    </p>
    <p>
     ready to carry forward his main purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was something weird about this silent man's ability to turn the
    </p>
    <p>
     conversation as he chose to have it go. Sitting by the Granny's
    </p>
    <p>
     tea-table, nibbling corn-bread while he drank his glass of water, having
    </p>
    <p>
     declined even her sassafras, he ceased to stimulate her medical talk and
    </p>
    <p>
     opened the vein of gossip. Once started, Granny Sanders was sure to
    </p>
    <p>
     allude to the robbery. And once on the robbery the doctor's course was
    </p>
    <p>
     clear.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I 'low somebody not fur away is in this 'ere business!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Not by a word, nor even by a nod, but by some motion of the eyelids,
    </p>
    <p>
     perhaps, Small indicated that he agreed with her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Who d'ye s'pose 'tis?"
    </p>
    <p>
     But Dr. Small was not in the habit of supposing. He moved his head in a
    </p>
    <p>
     quiet way, just the least perceptible bit, but so that the old creature
    </p>
    <p>
     understood that he could give light if he wanted to.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I dunno anybody that's been 'bout here long as could be suspected."
    </p>
    <p>
     Another motion of the eyelids indicated Small's agreement with this
    </p>
    <p>
     remark.
    </p>
    <p>
     "They a'n't nobody come in here lately 'ceppin' the master."
    </p>
    <p>
     Small looked vacantly at the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But I low he's allers bore a tip-top character."
    </p>
    <p>
     The doctor was too busy looking at his corn-bread to answer this remark
    </p>
    <p>
     even by a look.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But I think these oversmart young men'll bear looking arter, _I_ do."
    </p>
    <p>
     Dr. Small raised his eyes and let them _shine_ an assent. That was all.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Shouldn't wonder ef our master was overly fond of gals."
    </p>
    <p>
     Doctor looks down at his plate.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Had plenty of sweethearts afore he walked home with Hanner Thomson
    </p>
    <p>
     t'other night, I'll bet."
    </p>
    <p>
     Did Dr. Small shrug his shoulder? Granny thought she detected a faint
    </p>
    <p>
     motion of the sort, but she could not be sure.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And I think as how that a feller what trifles with gals' hearts and
    </p>
    <p>
     then runs off ten miles, maybe a'n't no better'n he had orter be. That's
    </p>
    <p>
     what I says, says I."
    </p>
    <p>
     To this general remark Dr. Small assented in his invisible--shall I say
    </p>
    <p>
     _intangible_?--way.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I allers think, maybe, that some folks has found it best to leave home
    </p>
    <p>
     and go away. You can't never tell. But when people is a-bein' robbed
    </p>
    <p>
     it's well to lookout. Hey?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I think so," said Small quietly, and, having taken his hat and bowed a
    </p>
    <p>
     solemn and respectful adieu, he departed.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had not spoken twenty words, but he had satisfied the news-monger of
    </p>
    <p>
     Flat Creek that Ralph was a bad character at home and worthy of
    </p>
    <p>
     suspicion of burglary.

     "It's very good for the health to dig in the elements. I was quite

     for me[19]." Time, the Saturday following the Friday on which Ralph kept
    </p>
    <p>
     Shocky company as far as the "forks" near Granny Sanders's house. Scene,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Squire's garden. Ralph helping that worthy magistrate perform sundry
    </p>
    <p>
     little jobs such as a warm winter day suggests to the farmer. Miss
    </p>
    <p>
     Martha Hawkins, the Squire's niece, and his housekeeper in his present
    </p>
    <p>
     bereaved condition, leaning over the palings--pickets she called
    </p>
    <p>
     them--of the garden fence, talking to the master. Miss Hawkins was
    </p>
    <p>
     recently from Massachusetts. How many people there are in the most
    </p>
    <p>
     cultivated communities whose education is partial!
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's very common for school-master to dig in the elements at the
    </p>
    <p>
     East," proceeded Miss Martha. Like many other people born in the
    </p>
    <p>
     celestial empires (of which there are three--China, Virginia,
    </p>
    <p>
     Massachusetts), Miss Martha was not averse to reminding outside
    </p>
    <p>
     barbarians of her good fortune in this regard. It did her good to speak
    </p>
    <p>
     of the East.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now Ralph was amused with Miss Martha. She really had a good deal of
    </p>
    <p>
     intelligence despite her affectation, and conversation with her was both
    </p>
    <p>
     interesting and diverting. It helped him to forget Hannah, and Bud, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the robbery, and all the rest, and she was so delighted to find somebody
    </p>
    <p>
     to make an impression on that she had come out to talk while Ralph was
    </p>
    <p>
     at work. But just at this moment the school-master was not so much
    </p>
    <p>
     interested in her interesting remarks, nor so much amused by her amusing
    </p>
    <p>
     remarks, as he should have been. He saw a man coming down the road
    </p>
    <p>
     riding one horse and leading another, and he recognized the horses at a
    </p>
    <p>
     distance. It must be Bud who was riding Means's bay mare and leading
    </p>
    <p>
     Bud's roan colt. Bud had been to mill, and as the man who owned the
    </p>
    <p>
     horse-mill kept but one old blind horse himself, it was necessary that
    </p>
    <p>
     Bud should take two. It required three horses to run the mill; the old
    </p>
    <p>
     blind one could have ground the grist, but the two others had to
    </p>
    <p>
     overcome the friction of the clumsy machine. But it was not about the
    </p>
    <p>
     horse-mill that Ralph was thinking nor about the two horses. Since that
    </p>
    <p>
     Wednesday evening on which he escorted Hannah home from the
    </p>
    <p>
     spelling-school he had not seen Bud Means. If he had any lingering
    </p>
    <p>
     doubts of the truth of what Mirandy had said, they had been dissipated
    </p>
    <p>
     by the absence of Bud from school.
    </p>
    <p>
     "When I was to Bosting--" Miss Martha was _to_ Boston only once in her
    </p>
    <p>
     life, but as her visit to that sacred city was the most important
    </p>
    <p>
     occurrence of her life, she did not hesitate to air her reminiscences of
    </p>
    <p>
     it frequently. "When I was to Bosting," she was just saying, when,
    </p>
    <p>
     following the indication of Ralph's eyes, she saw Bud coming up the hill
    </p>
    <p>
     near Squire Hawkins's house. Bud looked red and sulky, and to Ralph's
    </p>
    <p>
     and Miss Martha Hawkins's polite recognitions he returned only a surly
    </p>
    <p>
     nod. They both saw that he was angry. Ralph was able to guess the
    </p>
    <p>
     meaning of his wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
     Toward evening Ralph strolled through the Squire's cornfield toward the
    </p>
    <p>
     woods. The memory of the walk with Hannah was heavy upon the heart of
    </p>
    <p>
     the young master, and there was comfort in the very miserableness of the
    </p>
    <p>
     cornstalks with their disheveled blades hanging like tattered banners
    </p>
    <p>
     and rattling discordantly in the rising wind. Wandering without purpose,
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph followed the rows of stalks first one way and then the other in a
    </p>
    <p>
     zigzag line, turning a right angle every minute or two. At last he came
    </p>
    <p>
     out in a woods mostly of beech, and he pleased his melancholy fancy by
    </p>
    <p>
     kicking the dry and silky leaves before him in billows, while the
    </p>
    <p>
     soughing of the wind through the long, vibrant boughs and slender twigs
    </p>
    <p>
     of the beech forest seemed to put the world into the wailing minor key
    </p>
    <p>
     of his own despair.
    </p>
    <p>
     What a fascination there is in a path come upon suddenly without a
    </p>
    <p>
     knowledge of its termination! Here was one running in easy, irregular
    </p>
    <p>
     curves through the wood, now turning gently to the right in order to
    </p>
    <p>
     avoid a stump, now swaying suddenly to the left to gain an easier
    </p>
    <p>
     descent at a steep place, and now turning wantonly to the one side or
    </p>
    <p>
     the other, as if from very caprice in the man who by idle steps
    </p>
    <p>
     unconsciously marked the line of the foot-path at first. Ralph could not
    </p>
    <p>
     resist the impulse--who could?--to follow the path and find out its
    </p>
    <p>
     destination, and following it he came presently into a lonesome hollow,
    </p>
    <p>
     where a brook gurgled among the heaps of bare limestone rocks that
    </p>
    <p>
     filled its bed. Following the path still, he came upon a queer little
    </p>
    <p>
     cabin built of round logs, in the midst of a small garden-patch inclosed
    </p>
    <p>
     by a brush fence. The stick chimney, daubed with clay and topped with
    </p>
    <p>
     a barrel open at both ends, made this a typical cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
     [Illustration: CAPTAIN PEARSON]
    </p>
    <p>
     It flashed upon Ralph that this place must be Rocky Hollow, and that
    </p>
    <p>
     this was the house of old John Pearson, the one-legged basket-maker, and
    </p>
    <p>
     his rheumatic wife--the house that hospitably sheltered Shocky.
    </p>
    <p>
     Following his impulse, he knocked and was admitted, and was not a little
    </p>
    <p>
     surprised to find Miss Martha Hawkins there before him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You here, Miss Hawkins?" he said when he had returned Shocky's greeting
    </p>
    <p>
     and shaken hands with the old couple.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bless you, yes," said the old lady. "That blessed gyirl"--the old lady
    </p>
    <p>
     called her a girl by a sort of figure of speech perhaps--"that blessed
    </p>
    <p>
     gyirl's the kindest creetur you ever saw--comes here every day, most, to
    </p>
    <p>
     cheer a body up with somethin' or nuther."
    </p>
    <p>
     Miss Martha blushed, and said "she came because Rocky Hollow looked so
    </p>
    <p>
     much like a place she used to know at the East. Mr. and Mrs. Pearson
    </p>
    <p>
     were the kindest people. They reminded her of people she knew at the
    </p>
    <p>
     East. When she was to Bosting--"
    </p>
    <p>
     Here the old basket-maker lifted his head from his work, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Pshaw! that talk about kyindness" (he was a Kentuckian and said
    </p>
    <p>
     _kyindness_) "is all humbug. I wonder so smart a woman as you don't
    </p>
    <p>
     know better. You come nearder to bein kyind than anybody I know; but,
    </p>
    <p>
     laws a me! we're all selfish akordin' to my tell."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You wasn't selfish when you set up with my father most every night for
    </p>
    <p>
     two weeks," said Shocky as he handed the old man a splint.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, I was, too!" This in a tone that made Ralph tremble. "Your father
    </p>
    <p>
     was a miserable Britisher. I'd fit red-coats, in the war of
    </p>
    <p>
     eighteen-twelve, and lost my leg by one of 'em stickin' his dog-on'd
    </p>
    <p>
     bagonet right through it, that night at Lundy's Lane; but my messmate
    </p>
    <p>
     killed him though which is a satisfaction to think on. And I didn't like
    </p>
    <p>
     your father 'cause he was a Britisher. But ef he'd a died right here in
    </p>
    <p>
     this free country, 'though nobody to give him a drink of water, blamed
    </p>
    <p>
     ef I wouldn't a been ashamed to set on the platform at a Fourth of July
    </p>
    <p>
     barbecue, and to hold up my wooden leg fer to make the boys cheer! That
    </p>
    <p>
     was the selfishest thing I ever done. We're all selfish akordin' to my
    </p>
    <p>
     tell."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You wasn't selfish when you took me that night, you know," and Shocky's
    </p>
    <p>
     face beamed with gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, I war, too, you little sass-box! What did I take you fer? Hey?
    </p>
    <p>
     Bekase I didn't like Pete Jones nor Bill Jones. They're thieves, dog-on
    </p>
    <p>
     'em!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph shivered a little. The horse with the white forefoot and white
    </p>
    <p>
     nose galloped before his eyes again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "They're a set of thieves. That's what they air."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Please, Mr. Pearson, be careful. You'll get into trouble, you know, by
    </p>
    <p>
     talking that way," said Miss Hawkins. "You're just like a man that I
    </p>
    <p>
     knew at the East."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, do you think an old soldier like me, hobbling on a wooden leg, is
    </p>
    <p>
     afraid of them thieves? Didn't I face the Britishers? Didn't I come home
    </p>
    <p>
     late last Wednesday night? I rather guess I must a took a little too
    </p>
    <p>
     much at Welch's grocery, and laid down in the middle of the street to
    </p>
    <p>
     rest. The boys thought 'twas funny to crate[20] me. I woke up kind o'
    </p>
    <p>
     cold, 'bout one in the mornin.' 'Bout two o'clock I come up Means's
    </p>
    <p>
     hill, and didn't I see Pete Jones, and them others that robbed the
    </p>
    <p>
     Dutchman, and somebody, I dunno who, a-crossin' the blue-grass paster
    </p>
    <p>
     _towards_ Jones's?" (Ralph shivered.) "Don't shake your finger at me,
    </p>
    <p>
     old woman. Tongue is all I've got to fight with now; but I'll fight them
    </p>
    <p>
     thieves tell the sea goes dry, I will. Shocky, gim me a splint."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But you wasn't selfish when you tuck me. Shocky stuck to his point most
    </p>
    <p>
     positively.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, I was, you little tow-headed fool! I didn't take you kase I was
    </p>
    <p>
     good, not a bit of it. I hated Bill Jones what keeps the poor-house, and
    </p>
    <p>
     I knowed him and Pete would get you bound to some of their click, and I
    </p>
    <p>
     didn't want no more thieves raised; so when your mother hobbled, with
    </p>
    <p>
     you a-leadin' her, poor blind thing! all the way over here on that
    </p>
    <p>
     winter night, and said, 'Mr. Pearson, you're all the friend I've got,
    </p>
    <p>
     and I want you to save my boy,' why, you see I was selfish as ever I
    </p>
    <p>
     could be in takin' of you. Your mother's cryin' sot me a-cryin' too.
    </p>
    <p>
     We're all selfish in everything, akordin' to my tell. Blamed ef we
    </p>
    <p>
     ha'n't, Miss Hawkins, only sometimes I'd think you was real benev'lent
    </p>
    <p>
     ef I didn't know we war all selfish."

    <p>
     THE HARDSHELL PREACHER.
    </p>
    <p>
     "They's preachin' down to Bethel Meetin'-house to-day," said the Squire
    </p>
    <p>
     at breakfast. Twenty years In the West could not cure Squire Hawkins of
    </p>
    <p>
     saying "to" for "at." "I rather guess as how the old man Bosaw will give
    </p>
    <p>
     pertickeler fits to our folks to-day." For Squire Hawkins, having been
    </p>
    <p>
     expelled from the "Hardshell" church of which Mr. Bosaw was pastor, for
    </p>
    <p>
     the grave offense of joining a temperance society, had become a member
    </p>
    <p>
     of the "Reformers," the very respectable people who now call themselves
    </p>
    <p>
     "Disciples," but whom the profane will persist in calling
    </p>
    <p>
     "Campbellites." They had a church in the village of Clifty, three miles
    </p>
    <p>
     away.
    </p>
    <p>
     I know that explanations are always abominable to story readers, as they
    </p>
    <p>
     are to story writers, but as so many of my readers have never had the
    </p>
    <p>
     inestimable privilege of sitting under the gospel as it is ministered in
    </p>
    <p>
     enlightened neighborhoods like Flat Creek, I find myself under the
    </p>
    <p>
     necessity--need-cessity the Rev. Mr. Bosaw would call it--of rising to
    </p>
    <p>
     explain. Some people think the "Hardshells" a myth, and some sensitive
    </p>
    <p>
     Baptist people at the East resent all allusion to them. But the
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hardshell Baptists," or, as they are otherwise called, the "Whisky
    </p>
    <p>
     Baptists," and the "Forty-gallon Baptists," exist in all the old Western
    </p>
    <p>
     and South-western States. They call themselves "Anti-means Baptists"
    </p>
    <p>
     from their Antinomian tenets. Their confession of faith is a caricature
    </p>
    <p>
     of Calvinism, and is expressed by their preachers about as follows: "Ef
    </p>
    <p>
     you're elected, you'll be saved; ef you a'n't, you'll be damned. God'll
    </p>
    <p>
     take keer of his elect. It's a sin to run Sunday-schools, or temp'rince
    </p>
    <p>
     s'cieties, or to send missionaries. You let God's business alone. What
    </p>
    <p>
     is to be will be, and you can't hender it." This writer has attended a
    </p>
    <p>
     Sunday-school, the superintendent of which was solemnly arraigned and
    </p>
    <p>
     expelled from the Hardshell Church for "meddling with God's business" by
    </p>
    <p>
     holding a Sunday-school. Of course the Hardshells are prodigiously
    </p>
    <p>
     illiterate, and often vicious. Some of their preachers are notorious
    </p>
    <p>
     drunkards. They sing their sermons out sometimes for three hours at a
    </p>
    <p>
     stretch[21].
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph found that he was to ride the "clay-bank mare," the only one of
    </p>
    <p>
     the horses that would "carry double," and that consequently he would
    </p>
    <p>
     have to take Miss Hawkins behind him. If it had been Hannah instead,
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph might not have objected to this "young Lochinvar" mode of riding
    </p>
    <p>
     with a lady on "the croup," but Martha Hawkins was another affair. He
    </p>
    <p>
     had only this consolation; his keeping the company of Miss Hawkins might
    </p>
    <p>
     serve to disarm the resentment of Bud. At all events, he had no choice.
    </p>
    <p>
     What designs the Squire had in this arrangement he could not tell; but
    </p>
    <p>
     the clay-bank mare carried him to meeting on that December morning,
    </p>
    <p>
     with Martha Hawkins behind. And as Miss Hawkins was not used to this
    </p>
    <p>
     mode of locomotion, she was in a state of delightful fright every time
    </p>
    <p>
     the horse sank to the knees in the soft, yellow Flat Creek clay.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We don't go to church so at the East," she said. "The mud isn't so deep
    </p>
    <p>
     at the East. When I was to Bosting--" but Ralph never heard what
    </p>
    <p>
     happened when she was to Bosting, for just as she said Bosting the mare
    </p>
    <p>
     put her foot into a deep hole molded by the foot of the Squire's horse,
    </p>
    <p>
     and already full of muddy water.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the mare's foot went twelve inches down into this track, the muddy
    </p>
    <p>
     water spurted higher than Miss Hawkins's head, and mottled her dress
    </p>
    <p>
     with golden spots of clay. She gave a little shriek, and declared that
    </p>
    <p>
     she had never "seen it so at the East."
    </p>
    <p>
     The journey seemed a little long to Ralph, who found that the subjects
    </p>
    <p>
     upon which he and Miss Hawkins could converse were few; but Miss Martha
    </p>
    <p>
     was determined to keep things going, and once, when the conversation had
    </p>
    <p>
     died out entirely, she made a desperate effort to renew it by remarking,
    </p>
    <p>
     as they met a man on horseback, "That horse switches his tail just as
    </p>
    <p>
     they do at the East. When I was to Bosting I saw horses switch their
    </p>
    <p>
     tails just that way."
    </p>
    <p>
     What surprised Ralph was to see that Flat Creek went to meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everybody was there--the Meanses, the Joneses, the Bantas, and all the
    </p>
    <p>
     rest. Everybody on Flat Creek seemed to be there, except the old
    </p>
    <p>
     wooden-legged basket-maker. His family was represented by Shocky, who
    </p>
    <p>
     had come, doubtless, to get a glimpse of Hannah, not to hear Mr. Bosaw
    </p>
    <p>
     preach. In fact, few were thinking of the religious service. They went
    </p>
    <p>
     to church as a common resort to hear the news, and to find out what was
    </p>
    <p>
     the current sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
     On this particular morning there seemed to be some unusual excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph perceived it as he rode up. An excited crowd, even though it be at
    </p>
    <p>
     a church-door on Sunday morning, can not conceal its agitation. Ralph
    </p>
    <p>
     deposited Miss Hawkins on the stile, and then got down himself, and paid
    </p>
    <p>
     her the closest attention to the door. This attention was for Bud's
    </p>
    <p>
     benefit. But Bud only stood with his hands in his pockets, scowling
    </p>
    <p>
     worse than ever. Ralph did not go in at the door. It was not the Flat
    </p>
    <p>
     Creek custom. The men gossiped outside, while the women chatted within.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whatever may have been the cause of the excitement, Ralph could not get
    </p>
    <p>
     at it. When he entered a little knot of people they became embarrassed,
    </p>
    <p>
     the group dissolved, and its component parts joined other companies.
    </p>
    <p>
     What had the current of conversation to do with him? He overheard Pete
    </p>
    <p>
     Jones saying that the blamed old wooden leg was in it anyhow. He'd been
    </p>
    <p>
     seen goin' home at two in the mornin'. And he could name somebody else
    </p>
    <p>
     ef he choosed. But it was best to clean out one at a time. And just then
    </p>
    <p>
     there was a murmur: "Meetin's took up." And the masculine element filled
    </p>
    <p>
     the empty half of the "hewed-log" church.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Ralph saw Hannah looking utterly dejected, his heart smote him, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the great struggle set in again. Had it not been for the thought of the
    </p>
    <p>
     other battle, and the comforting presence of the Helper, I fear Bud's
    </p>
    <p>
     interests would have fared badly. But Ralph, with the spirit of a
    </p>
    <p>
     martyr, resolved to wait until he knew what the result of Bud's suit
    </p>
    <p>
     should be, and whether, indeed, the young Goliath had prior claims, as
    </p>
    <p>
     he evidently thought he had. He turned hopefully to the sermon,
    </p>
    <p>
     determined to pick up any crumbs of comfort that might fall from Mr.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bosaw's meager table.
    </p>
    <p>
     In reporting a single specimen passage of Mr. Bosaw's sermon, I shall
    </p>
    <p>
     not take the liberty which Thucydides and other ancient historians did,
    </p>
    <p>
     of making the sermon and putting it into the hero's mouth, but shall
    </p>
    <p>
     give that which can be vouched for.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You see, my respective hearers," he began--but alas! I can never
    </p>
    <p>
     picture to you the rich red nose, the see sawing gestures, the nasal
    </p>
    <p>
     resonance, the sniffle, the melancholy minor key, and all that. "My
    </p>
    <p>
     respective hearers-ah, you see-ah as how-ah as my tex'-ah says that the
    </p>
    <p>
     ox-ah knoweth his owner-ah, and-ah the ass-ah his master's crib-ah.
    </p>
    <p>
     A-h-h! Now, my respective hearers-ah, they're a mighty sight of
    </p>
    <p>
     resemblance-ah atwext men-ah and oxen-ah" [Ralph could not help
    </p>
    <p>
     reflecting that there was a mighty sight of resemblance between some men
    </p>
    <p>
     and asses. But the preacher did not see this analogy. It lay too close
    </p>
    <p>
     to him], "bekase-ah, you see, men-ah is mighty like oxen-ah. Fer they's
    </p>
    <p>
     a tremengious defference-ah atwixt defferent oxen-ah, jest as thar is
    </p>
    <p>
     atwext defferent men-ah; fer the ox knoweth-ah his owner-ah, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     ass-ah, his master's crib-ah. Now, my respective hearers-ah" [the
    </p>
    <p>
     preacher's voice here grew mellow, and the succeeding sentences were in
    </p>
    <p>
     the most pathetic and lugubrious tones], "you all know-ah that your
    </p>
    <p>
     humble speaker-ah has got-ah jest the best yoke of steers-ah in this
    </p>
    <p>
     township-ah." [Here Betsey Short shook the floor with a suppressed
    </p>
    <p>
     titter.] "They a'n't no sech steers as them air two of mine-ah in this
    </p>
    <p>
     whole kedentry-ah. Them crack oxen over at Clifty-ah ha'n't a patchin'
    </p>
    <p>
     to mine-ah. Fer the ox knoweth his owner-ah and the ass-ah his master's
    </p>
    <p>
     crib-ah.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now, my respective hearers-ah, they's a right smart sight of
    </p>
    <p>
     defference-ah atwext them air two oxen-ah, jest like they is atwext
    </p>
    <p>
     defferent men-ah. Fer-ah" [here the speaker grew earnest, and sawed the
    </p>
    <p>
     air, from this to the close, in a most frightful way], "fer-ah, you
    </p>
    <p>
     see-ah, when I go out-ah in the mornin'-ah to yoke-ah up-ah them air
    </p>
    <p>
     steers-ah, and I says-ah, 'Wo, Berry-ah! _Wo, Berry-ah!_ WO, BERRY-AH',
    </p>
    <p>
     why Berry-ah jest stands stock still-ah and don't hardly breathe-ah
    </p>
    <p>
     while I put on the yoke-ah, and put in the bow-ah, and put in the
    </p>
    <p>
     key-ah, fer, my brethering-ah and sistering-ah, the ox knoweth his
    </p>
    <p>
     owner-ah, and the ass-ah his master's crib-ah. Hal-le-lu-ger-ah!
    </p>
    <p>
     "But-ah, my hearers-ah, but-ah when I stand at t'other eend of the
    </p>
    <p>
     yoke-ah, and say, 'Come, Buck-ah! _Come, Buck-ah!_ COME, BUCK-AH! COME,
    </p>
    <p>
     BUCK-AH!' why what do you think-ah? Buck-ah, that ornery ole Buck-ah,
    </p>
    <p>
     'stid of comin' right along-ah and puttin' his neck under-ah, acts jest
    </p>
    <p>
     like some men-ah what is fools-ah. Buck-ah jest kinder sorter stands
    </p>
    <p>
     off-ah, and kinder sorter puts his head down-ah this 'ere way-ah, and
    </p>
    <p>
     kinder looks mad-ah, and says, Boo-_oo_-OO-OO-ah!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Alas! Hartsook found no spiritual edification there, and he was in no
    </p>
    <p>
     mood to be amused. And so, while the sermon drew on through two dreary
    </p>
    <p>
     hours, he forgot the preacher in noticing a bright green lizard which,
    </p>
    <p>
     having taken up its winter quarters behind the tin candlestick that hung
    </p>
    <p>
     just back of the preacher's head, had been deceived by the genial warmth
    </p>
    <p>
     coming from the great box-stove, and now ran out two or three feet from
    </p>
    <p>
     his shelter, looking down upon the red-nosed preacher in a most
    </p>
    <p>
     confidential and amusing manner. Sometimes he would retreat behind the
    </p>
    <p>
     candlestick, which was not twelve inches from the preacher's head, and
    </p>
    <p>
     then rush out again. At each reappearance Betsey Short would stuff her
    </p>
    <p>
     handkerchief into her mouth and shake in a most distressing way. Shocky
    </p>
    <p>
     wondered what the lizard was winking at the preacher about. And Miss
    </p>
    <p>
     Martha thought that it reminded her of a lizard that she see at the
    </p>
    <p>
     East, the time she was to Bosting, in a jar of alcohol in the Natural
    </p>
    <p>
     History Rooms. The Squire was not disappointed in his anticipation that
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Bosaw would attack his denomination with some fury. In fact, the old
    </p>
    <p>
     preacher outdid himself in his violent indignation at "these people that
    </p>
    <p>
     follow Campbell-ah, that thinks-ah that obejience-ah will save 'em-ah
    </p>
    <p>
     and that belongs-ah to temp'rince societies-ah and Sunday-schools-ah,
    </p>
    <p>
     and them air things-ah, that's not ortherized in the Bible-ah, but comes
    </p>
    <p>
     of the devil-ah, and takes folks as belongs to 'em to hell-ah."
    </p>
    <p>
     As they came out the door Ralph rallied enough to remark: "He did attack
    </p>
    <p>
     your people, Squire."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, yes," said the Squire. "Didn't you see the Sarpent inspirin' him?"
    </p>
    <p>
     But the long, long hours were ended and Ralph got on the clay-bank mare
    </p>
    <p>
     and rode up alongside the stile whence Miss Martha mounted. And as he
    </p>
    <p>
     went away with a heavy heart, he overheard Pete Jones call out to
    </p>
    <p>
     somebody:
    </p>
    <p>
     "We'll tend to his case &amp; Christmas." Christmas was two days off.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Miss Martha remarked with much trepidation that poor Pearson would
    </p>
    <p>
     have to leave. She'd always been afraid that would be the end of it. It
    </p>
    <p>
     reminded her of something she heard at the East, the time she was down
    </p>
    <p>
     to Bosting.

    <p>
     [Footnote 21: Even the Anti-means Baptists have suffered from the dire
    </p>
    <p>
     spirit of the age. They are to-day a very respectable body of people
    </p>
    <p>
     calling themselves "Primitive Baptists." Perhaps the description in the
    </p>
    <p>
     text never applied to the whole denomination, but only to the Hardshells
    </p>
    <p>
     of certain localities. Some of these intensely conservative churches, I
    </p>
    <p>
     have reason to believe, were always composed of reputable people. But
    </p>
    <p>
     what is said above is not in the least exaggerated as a description of
    </p>
    <p>
     many of the churches in Indiana and Illinois. Their opposition to the
    </p>
    <p>
     temperance reformation was both theoretical and practical. A rather able
    </p>
    <p>
     minister of the denomination whom I knew as a boy used to lie in
    </p>
    <p>
     besotted drunkenness by the roadside. I am sorry to confess that he once
    </p>
    <p>
     represented the county in the State legislature. The piece of a sermon
    </p>
    <p>
     given in this chapter was heard near Cairo, Illinois, in the days before
    </p>
    <p>
     the war. Most of the preachers were illiterate farmers. I have heard one
    </p>
    <p>
     of them hold forth two hours at a stretch. But even in that day there
    </p>
    <p>
     were men among the Hardshells whose ability and character commanded
    </p>
    <p>
     respect. This was true, especially in Kentucky, where able men like the
    </p>
    <p>
     two Dudleys held to the Antinomian wing of their denomination. But the
    </p>
    <p>
     Hardshells are perceptibly less hard than they were. You may march at
    </p>
    <p>
     the rear of the column among Hunkers and Hardshells if you will, but you
    </p>
    <p>
     are obliged to march. Those who will not go voluntarily, the
    </p>
    <p>
     time-spirit, walking behind, prods onward with a goad.]

    <p>
     A STRUGGLE FOR THE MASTERY
    </p>
    <p>
     The school had closed on Monday evening as usual. The boys had been
    </p>
    <p>
     talking in knots all day. Nothing but the bulldog in the slender,
    </p>
    <p>
     resolute young master had kept down the rising storm. A teacher who has
    </p>
    <p>
     lost moral support at home, can not long govern a school. Ralph had
    </p>
    <p>
     effectually lost his popularity in the district, and the worst of it was
    </p>
    <p>
     that he could not divine from just what quarter the ill wind came,
    </p>
    <p>
     except that he felt sure of Small's agency in it somewhere. Even Hannah
    </p>
    <p>
     had slighted him, when he called at Means's on Monday morning to draw
    </p>
    <p>
     the pittance of pay that was due him.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had expected a petition for a holiday on Christmas day. Such holidays
    </p>
    <p>
     are deducted from the teacher's time, and it is customary for the boys
    </p>
    <p>
     to "turn out" the teacher who refuses to grant them, by barring him out
    </p>
    <p>
     of the school-house on Christmas and New Year's morning. Ralph had
    </p>
    <p>
     intended to grant a holiday if it should be asked, but it was not
    </p>
    <p>
     asked. Hank Banta was the ringleader in the disaffection, and he had
    </p>
    <p>
     managed to draw the surly Bud, who was present this morning, into it. It
    </p>
    <p>
     is but fair to say that Bud was in favor of making a request before
    </p>
    <p>
     resorting to extreme measures, but he was overruled. He gave it as his
    </p>
    <p>
     solemn opinion that the master was mighty peart, and they would be beat
    </p>
    <p>
     anyhow some way, but he would lick the master fer two cents ef he warn't
    </p>
    <p>
     so slim that he'd feel like he was fighting a baby.
    </p>
    <p>
     And all that day things looked black. Ralph's countenance was cold and
    </p>
    <p>
     hard as stone, and Shocky trembled where he sat. Betsey Short tittered
    </p>
    <p>
     rather more than usual. A riot or a murder would have seemed amusing to
    </p>
    <p>
     her.
    </p>
    <p>
     School was dismissed, and Ralph, instead of returning to the Squire's,
    </p>
    <p>
     set out for the village of Clifty, a few miles away. No one knew what he
    </p>
    <p>
     went for, and some suggested that he had "sloped."
    </p>
    <p>
     But Bud said "he warn't that air kind. He was one of them air sort as
    </p>
    <p>
     died in their tracks, was Mr. Hartsook. They'd find him on the ground
    </p>
    <p>
     nex' morning, and he lowed the master war made of that air sort of stuff
    </p>
    <p>
     as would burn the dog-on'd ole school-house to ashes, or blow it into
    </p>
    <p>
     splinters, but what he'd beat. Howsumdever he'd said he was a-goin' to
    </p>
    <p>
     help, and help he would; but all the sinno in Golier wouldn't be no
    </p>
    <p>
     account again the cute they was in the head of the master."
    </p>
    <p>
     But Bud, discouraged as he was with the fear of Ralph's "cute," went
    </p>
    <p>
     like a martyr to the stake and took his place with the rest in the
    </p>
    <p>
     school-house at nine o'clock at night. It may have been Ralph's
    </p>
    <p>
     intention to preoccupy the school-house, for at ten o'clock Hank Banta
    </p>
    <p>
     was set shaking from head to foot at seeing a face that looked like the
    </p>
    <p>
     master's at the window. He waked up Bud and told him about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, what are you a-tremblin' about, you coward?" growled Bud. "He
    </p>
    <p>
     won't shoot you; but he'll beat you at this game, I'll bet a hoss, and
    </p>
    <p>
     me, too, and make us both as 'shamed of ourselves as dogs with
    </p>
    <p>
     tin-kittles to their tails. You don't know the master, though he did
    </p>
    <p>
     duck you. But he'll larn you a good lesson this time, and me too, like
    </p>
    <p>
     as not." And Bud soon snored again, but Hank shook with fear every time
    </p>
    <p>
     he looked at the blackness outside the windows. He was sure he heard
    </p>
    <p>
     foot-falls. He would have given anything to have been at home.
    </p>
    <p>
     When morning came, the pupils began to gather early. A few boys who were
    </p>
    <p>
     likely to prove of service in the coming siege were admitted through the
    </p>
    <p>
     window, and then everything was made fast, and a "snack" was eaten.
    </p>
    <p>
     "How do you 'low he'll get in?" said Hank, trying to hide his fear.
    </p>
    <p>
     "How do I 'low?" said Bud. "I don't 'low nothin' about it. You might as
    </p>
    <p>
     well ax me where I 'low the nex' shootin' star is a-goin' to drap. Mr.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hartsook's mighty onsartin. But he'll git in, though, and tan your hide
    </p>
    <p>
     fer you, you see ef he don't. _Ef_ he don't blow up the school-house
    </p>
    <p>
     with gunpowder!" This last was thrown in by way of alleviating the fears
    </p>
    <p>
     of the cowardly Hank, for whom Bud had a great contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
     The time for school had almost come. The boys inside were demoralized by
    </p>
    <p>
     waiting. They began to hope that the master had "sloped." They dreaded
    </p>
    <p>
     to see him coming.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't believe he'll come," said Hank, with a cold shiver. "It's past
    </p>
    <p>
     school-time."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, he will come, too," said Bud. "And he 'lows to come in here mighty
    </p>
    <p>
     quick. I don't know how. But he'll be a-standin' at that air desk when
    </p>
    <p>
     it's nine o'clock. I'll bet a thousand dollars on that. _Ef_ he don't
    </p>
    <p>
     take it into his head to blow us up!" Hank was now white.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some of the parents came along, accidentally of course, and stopped to
    </p>
    <p>
     see the fun, sure that Bud would thrash the master if he tried to break
    </p>
    <p>
     in. Small, on the way to see a patient perhaps, reined up in front of
    </p>
    <p>
     the door. Still no Ralph. It was just five minutes before nine. A rumor
    </p>
    <p>
     now gained currency that he had been seen going to Clifty the evening
    </p>
    <p>
     before, and that he had not come back, though in fact Ralph had come
    </p>
    <p>
     back, and had slept at Squire Hawkins's.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There's the master," cried Betsey Short, who stood out in the road
    </p>
    <p>
     shivering and giggling alternately. For Ralph at that moment emerged
    </p>
    <p>
     from the sugar-camp by the school-house, carrying a board.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ho! ho!" laughed Hank, "he thinks he'll smoke us out. I guess he'll
    </p>
    <p>
     find us ready." The boys had let the fire burn down, and there was now
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing but hot hickory coals on the hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I tell you he'll come in. He didn't go to Clifty fer nothing" said Bud,
    </p>
    <p>
     who sat still on one of the benches which leaned against the door. "I
    </p>
    <p>
     don't know how, but they's lots of ways of killing a cat besides chokin'
    </p>
    <p>
     her with butter. He'll come in--_ef_ he don't blow us all sky-high!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph's voice was now heard, demanding that the door be opened.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Let's open her," said Hank, turning livid with fear at the firm,
    </p>
    <p>
     confident tone of the master.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bud straightened himself up. "Hank, you're a coward. I've got a mind to
    </p>
    <p>
     kick you. You got me into this blamed mess, and now you want to
    </p>
    <p>
     craw-fish. You jest tech one of these 'ere fastenings, and I'll lay you
    </p>
    <p>
     out flat of your back afore you can say Jack Robinson."
    </p>
    <p>
     The teacher was climbing to the roof with the board in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That air won't win," laughed Pete Jones outside. He saw that there was
    </p>
    <p>
     no smoke. Even Bud began to hope that Ralph would fail for once. The
    </p>
    <p>
     master was now on the ridge-pole of the school-house. He took a paper
    </p>
    <p>
     from his pocket, and deliberately poured the contents down the chimney.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Pete Jones shouted "Gunpowder!" and set off down the road to be out
    </p>
    <p>
     of the way of the explosion. Dr. Small remembered, probably, that his
    </p>
    <p>
     patient might die while he sat here, and started on.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Ralph emptied the paper, and laid the board over the chimney. What a
    </p>
    <p>
     row there was inside! The benches that were braced against the door were
    </p>
    <p>
     thrown down, and Hank Banta rushed out, rubbing his eyes, coughing
    </p>
    <p>
     frantically, and sure that he had been blown up. All the rest followed,
    </p>
    <p>
     Bud bringing up the rear sulkily, but coughing and sneezing for dear
    </p>
    <p>
     life. Such a smell of sulphur as came from that school-house!
    </p>
    <p>
     Betsey had to lean against the fence to giggle.
    </p>
    <p>
     [Illustration: FIRE AND BRIMSTONE]
    </p>
    <p>
     As soon as all were out, Ralph threw the board off the chimney, leaped
    </p>
    <p>
     to the ground, entered the school-house, and opened the windows. The
    </p>
    <p>
     school soon followed him, and all was still.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Would he thrash?" This was the important question in Hank Banta's mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     And the rest looked for a battle with Bud.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It is just nine o'clock," said Ralph, consulting his watch, "and I'm
    </p>
    <p>
     glad to see you all here promptly. I should have given you a holiday if
    </p>
    <p>
     you had asked me like gentlemen yesterday. On the whole, I think I shall
    </p>
    <p>
     give you a holiday, anyhow. The school is dismissed."
    </p>
    <p>
     And Hank felt foolish.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Bud secretly resolved to thrash Hank or the master, he didn't care
    </p>
    <p>
     which.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Mirandy looked the love she could not utter.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Betsey giggled.

     CHAPTER XIV.
    </head>
    <p>
     A CRISIS WITH BUD.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph sat still at his desk. The school had gone. All at once he became
    </p>
    <p>
     conscious that Shocky sat yet in his accustomed place upon the hard,
    </p>
    <p>
     backless bench.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, Shocky, haven't you gone yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No--sir--I was waitin' to see if you warn't a-goin', too--I--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I thought it would make me feel as if God warn't quite so fur away to
    </p>
    <p>
     talk to you. It did the other day."
    </p>
    <p>
     The master rose and put his hand on Shocky's head. Was it the
    </p>
    <p>
     brotherhood in affliction that made Shocky's words choke him so? Or, was
    </p>
    <p>
     it the weird thoughts that he expressed? Or, was it the recollection
    </p>
    <p>
     that Shocky was Hannah's brother? Hannah so far, far away from him now!
    </p>
    <p>
     At any rate, Shocky, looking up for the smile on which he fed, saw the
    </p>
    <p>
     relaxing of the master's face, that had been as hard as stone, and felt
    </p>
    <p>
     just one hot tear on his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     "P'r'aps God's forgot you, too," said Shocky in a sort of half
    </p>
    <p>
     soliloquy. "Better get away from Flat Creek. You see God forgets
    </p>
    <p>
     everybody down here. 'Cause 'most everybody forgets God, 'cept Mr.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bosaw, and I 'low God don't no ways keer to be remembered by sich as
    </p>
    <p>
     him. Leastways I wouldn't if I was God, you know. I wonder what becomes
    </p>
    <p>
     of folks when God forgets 'em?" And Shocky, seeing that the master had
    </p>
    <p>
     resumed his seat and was looking absently into the fire, moved slowly
    </p>
    <p>
     out the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Shocky!" called the master.
    </p>
    <p>
     The little poet came back and stood before him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Shocky, you mustn't think God has forgotten you. God brings things out
    </p>
    <p>
     right at last." But Ralph's own faith was weak, and his words sounded
    </p>
    <p>
     hollow and hypocritical to himself. Would God indeed bring things out
    </p>
    <p>
     right?
    </p>
    <p>
     He sat musing a good while, trying to convince himself of the truth of
    </p>
    <p>
     what he had just been saying to Shocky--that God would indeed bring
    </p>
    <p>
     things out right at last. Would it all come out right if Bud married
    </p>
    <p>
     Hannah? Would it all come out right if he were driven from Flat Creek
    </p>
    <p>
     with a dark suspicion upon his character? Did God concern himself with
    </p>
    <p>
     these things? Was there any God? It was the same old struggle between
    </p>
    <p>
     Doubt and Faith. And when Ralph looked up, Shocky had departed.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the next hour Ralph fought the old battle of Armageddon. I shall not
    </p>
    <p>
     describe it. You will fight it in your own way. No two alike. The
    </p>
    <p>
     important thing is the End. If you come out as he did, with the doubt
    </p>
    <p>
     gone and the trust in God victorious, it matters little just what shape
    </p>
    <p>
     the battle may take. Since Jacob became Israel there have never been two
    </p>
    <p>
     such struggles alike, save in that they all end either in victory or in
    </p>
    <p>
     defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was after twelve o'clock on that Christmas day when Ralph put his
    </p>
    <p>
     head out the door of the school-house and called out: "Bud, I'd like to
    </p>
    <p>
     see you."
    </p>
    <p>
     Bud did not care to see the master, for he had inly resolved to "thrash
    </p>
    <p>
     him" and have done with him. But he couldn't back out, certainly not in
    </p>
    <p>
     sight of the others who were passing along the road with him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't want the rest of you," said Ralph in a decided way, as he saw
    </p>
    <p>
     that Hank and one or two others were resolved to come also.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thought maybe you'd want somebody to see far play," said Hank as he
    </p>
    <p>
     went off sheepishly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If I did, you would be the last one I should ask," said Ralph. "There's
    </p>
    <p>
     no unfair play in Bud, and there is in you." And he shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now, looky here, Mr. Ralph Hartsook," said Bud. "You don't come no gum
    </p>
    <p>
     games over me with your saft sodder and all that. I've made up my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     You've got to promise to leave these 'ere digging, or I've got to thrash
    </p>
    <p>
     you."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You'll have to thrash me, then," said Ralph, turning a little pale, but
    </p>
    <p>
     remembering the bulldog. "But you'll tell me what It's all about, won't
    </p>
    <p>
     you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You know well enough. Folks says you know more 'bout the robbery at the
    </p>
    <p>
     Dutchman's than you orter. But I don't believe them. Fer them as says it
    </p>
    <p>
     is liars and thieves theirselves. 'Ta'n't fer none of that. And I shan't
    </p>
    <p>
     tell you what it _is_ fer. So now, if you won't travel, why, take off
    </p>
    <p>
     your coat and git ready fer a thrashing."
    </p>
    <p>
     The master took off his coat and showed his slender arms. Bud laid his
    </p>
    <p>
     off, and showed the physique of a prize-fighter.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You a'n't a-goin to fight _me_?" said Bud.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not unless you make me."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why I could chaw you all up."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know that."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, you're the grittiest feller I ever did see, and ef you'd jest kep
    </p>
    <p>
     off of my ground I wouldn't a touched you. But I a'n't a-goin' to be cut
    </p>
    <p>
     out by no feller a livin' 'thout thrashin' him in an inch of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
     You see I wanted to git out of this Flat Crick way. We're a low-lived
    </p>
    <p>
     set here in Flat Crick. And I says to myself, I'll try to be somethin'
    </p>
    <p>
     more nor Pete Jones, and dad, and these other triflin', good-fer-nothin'
    </p>
    <p>
     ones 'bout here. And when you come I says, There's one as'll help me.
    </p>
    <p>
     And what do you do with yor book-larnin' and town manners but start
    </p>
    <p>
     right out to git away the gal that I'd picked out, when I'd picked her
    </p>
    <p>
     out kase I thought, not bein' Flat Crick born herself, she might help a
    </p>
    <p>
     feller to do better! Now I won't let nobody cut me out without givin'
    </p>
    <p>
     'em the best thrashin' it's in these 'ere arms to give."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But I haven't tried to cut you out."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You can't fool _me_."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bud, listen to me, and then thrash me if you will. I went with that
    </p>
    <p>
     girl once. When I found you had some claims, I gave her up. Not because
    </p>
    <p>
     I was afraid of you, for I would rather have taken the worst thrashing
    </p>
    <p>
     you can give me than give her up. But I haven't spoken to her since the
    </p>
    <p>
     night of the first spelling-school."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You lie!" said Bud, doubling his fists.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph grew red.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You was a-waitin' on her last Sunday right afore my eyes, and a-tryin'
    </p>
    <p>
     to ketch my attention too. So when you're ready say so."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bud, there is some misunderstanding." Hartsook spoke slowly and felt
    </p>
    <p>
     bewildered. "I tell you that I did not speak to Hannah last Sunday, and
    </p>
    <p>
     you know I didn't."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hanner!" Bud's eyes grew large. "Hanner!" Here he gasped for breath,
    </p>
    <p>
     and looked around, "Hanner!" He couldn't get any further than the name
    </p>
    <p>
     at first. "Why, plague take it, who said Hanner?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mirandy said you were courting Hannah," said Ralph, feeling round in a
    </p>
    <p>
     vague way to get his ideas together.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mirandy! Thunder! You believed Mirandy! Well! Now, looky here, Mr.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hartsook, ef you was to say that my sister lied, I'd lick you till yer
    </p>
    <p>
     hide wouldn't hold shucks. But _I_ say, a-twix you and me and the
    </p>
    <p>
     gate-post, don't you never believe nothing that Mirandy Means says. Her
    </p>
    <p>
     and marm has set theirselves like fools to git you. Hanner! Well, she's
    </p>
    <p>
     a mighty nice gal, but you're welcome to _her_. I never tuck no shine
    </p>
    <p>
     that air way. But I was out of school last Thursday and Friday
    </p>
    <p>
     a-shucking corn to take to mill a-Saturday. And when I come past the
    </p>
    <p>
     Squire's and seed you talking to a gal as is a gal, you know"--here Bud
    </p>
    <p>
     hesitated and looked foolish--"I felt hoppin' mad."
    </p>
    <p>
     Bud put on his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph put on his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then they shook hands and Bud went out. Ralph sat looking into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was no conscientious difficulty now in the way of his claiming
    </p>
    <p>
     Hannah. The dry forestick lying on the rude stone andirons burst into a
    </p>
    <p>
     blaze. The smoldering hope In the heart of Ralph Hartsook did the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     He could have Hannah If he could win her. But there came slowly back the
    </p>
    <p>
     recollection of his lost standing in Flat Creek. There was
    </p>
    <p>
     circumstantial evidence against him. It was evident that Hannah believed
    </p>
    <p>
     something of this. What other stones Small might have put in circulation
    </p>
    <p>
     he did not know. Would Small try to win Hannah's love to throw it away
    </p>
    <p>
     again, as he had done with others? At least he would not spare any pains
    </p>
    <p>
     to turn the heart of the bound girl against Ralph.
    </p>
    <p>
     The bright flame on the forestick, which Ralph had been watching,
    </p>
    <p>
     flickered and burned low.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>
     CHAPTER XV.
    </head>
    <p>
     THE CHURCH OF THE BEST LICKS.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just as the flame on the forestick, which Ralph had watched so
    </p>
    <p>
     intensely, flickered and burned low, and just as Ralph with a heavy but
    </p>
    <p>
     not quite hopeless heart rose to leave, the latch lifted and Bud
    </p>
    <p>
     re-entered.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I wanted to say something," he stammered, "but you know it's hard to
    </p>
    <p>
     say it. I ha'n't no book-larnin to speak of, and some things is hard to
    </p>
    <p>
     say when a man ha'n't got book-words to say 'em with. And they's some
    </p>
    <p>
     things a man can't hardly ever say anyhow to anybody."
    </p>
    <p>
     Here Bud stopped. But Ralph spoke in such a matter-of-course way in
    </p>
    <p>
     reply that he felt encouraged to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You gin up Hanner kase you thought she belonged to me. That's more'n
    </p>
    <p>
     I'd a done by a long shot. Now, arter I left here jest now, I says to
    </p>
    <p>
     myself, a man what can gin up his gal on account of sech a feeling fer
    </p>
    <p>
     the rights of a Flat Cricker like me, why, dog-on it, says I, sech a man
    </p>
    <p>
     is the man as can help me do better. I don't know whether you're a
    </p>
    <p>
     Hardshell or a Saftshell, or a Methodist, or a Campbellite, or a New
    </p>
    <p>
     Light, or a United Brother, or a Millerite, or what-not. But I says, the
    </p>
    <p>
     man what can do the clean thing by a ugly feller like me, and stick to
    </p>
    <p>
     it, when I was jest ready to eat him up, is a kind of a man to tie to."
    </p>
    <p>
     Here Bud stopped in fright at his own volubility, for he had run his
    </p>
    <p>
     words off like a piece learned by heart, as though afraid that if he
    </p>
    <p>
     stopped he would not have courage to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph said that he did not belong to any church, and he was afraid he
    </p>
    <p>
     couldn't do Bud much good. But his tone was full of sympathy, and, what
    </p>
    <p>
     is better than sympathy, a yearning for sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You see," said Bud, "I wanted to git out of this low-lived, Flat Crick
    </p>
    <p>
     way of livin'. We're a hard set down here, Mr. Hartsook. And I'm gittin'
    </p>
    <p>
     to be one of the hardest of 'em. But I never could git no good out of
    </p>
    <p>
     Bosaw with his whisky and meanness. And I went to the Mount Tabor church
    </p>
    <p>
     concert. I heard a man discussin' baptism, and regeneration, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
     That didn't seem no cure for me, I went to a revival over at Clifty.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, 'twarn't no use. First night they was a man that spoke about Jesus
    </p>
    <p>
     Christ in sech a way that I wanted to foller him everywhere. But I
    </p>
    <p>
     didn't feel fit. Next night I come back with my mind made up that I'd
    </p>
    <p>
     try Jesus Christ, and see ef he'd have me. But laws! they was a big man
    </p>
    <p>
     that night that preached hell. Not that I don't believe they's a hell.
    </p>
    <p>
     They's plenty not a thousand miles away as deserves it, and I don't know
    </p>
    <p>
     as I'm too good for it myself. But he pitched it at us, and stuck it in
    </p>
    <p>
     our faces in sech a way that I got mad. And I says, Well, ef God sends
    </p>
    <p>
     me to hell he can't make me holler 'nough nohow. You see my dander was
    </p>
    <p>
     up. And when my dander's up, I wouldn't gin up fer the devil his-self.
    </p>
    <p>
     The preacher was so insultin' with his way of doin' it. He seemed to be
    </p>
    <p>
     kind of glad that we was to be damned, and he preached somethin' like
    </p>
    <p>
     some folks swears. It didn't sound a bit like the Christ the little man
    </p>
    <p>
     preached about the night afore. So what does me and a lot of fellers do
    </p>
    <p>
     but slip out and cut off the big preacher's stirrups, and hang 'em on to
    </p>
    <p>
     the rider of the fence, and then set his hoss loose! And from that day,
    </p>
    <p>
     sometimes I did, and sometimes I didn't, want to be better. And to-day
    </p>
    <p>
     it seemed to me that you must know somethin' as would help me."
    </p>
    <p>
     Nothing is worse than a religious experience kept ready to be exposed to
    </p>
    <p>
     the gaze of everybody, whether the time is appropriate or not. But never
    </p>
    <p>
     was a religious experience more appropriate than the account which
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph gave to Bud of his Struggle in the Dark. The confession of his
    </p>
    <p>
     weakness and wicked selfishness was a great comfort to Bud.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you think that Jesus Christ would--would--well, do you think he'd
    </p>
    <p>
     help a poor, unlarnt Flat Cricker like me?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I think he was a sort of a Flat Creeker himself," said Ralph, slowly
    </p>
    <p>
     and very earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You don't say?" said Bud, almost getting off his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, you see the town he lived in was a rough place. It was called
    </p>
    <p>
     Nazareth, which meant 'Bush-town.'"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You don't say?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "And he was called a Nazarene, which was about the same as
    </p>
    <p>
     'backwoodsman.'"
    </p>
    <p>
     And Ralph read the different passages which he had studied at
    </p>
    <p>
     Sunday-school, illustrating the condescension of Jesus, the stories of
    </p>
    <p>
     the publicans, the harlots, the poor, who came to him. And he read about
    </p>
    <p>
     Nathanael, who lived only six miles away, saying, 'Can any good thing
    </p>
    <p>
     come out of Nazareth?'"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Jus' what Clifty folks says about Flat Crick," broke in Bud.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you think I could begin without being baptized?" he added
    </p>
    <p>
     presently.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why not? Let's begin now to do the best we can, by his help."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You mean, then, that I'm to begin now to put in my best licks for Jesus
    </p>
    <p>
     Christ, and that he'll help me?"
    </p>
    <p>
     This shocked Ralph's veneration a little. But it was the sincere
    </p>
    <p>
     utterance of an earnest soul. It may not have been an orthodox start,
    </p>
    <p>
     but it was the one start for Bud. And there be those who have repeated
    </p>
    <p>
     with the finest Ã¦sthetic appreciation the old English liturgies who have
    </p>
    <p>
     never known religious aspiration so sincere as that of this ignorant
    </p>
    <p>
     young Hercules, whose best confession was that he meant hereafter "to
    </p>
    <p>
     put in his best licks for Jesus Christ." And there be those who can
    </p>
    <p>
     define repentance and faith to the turning of a hair who never made so
    </p>
    <p>
     genuine a start for the kingdom of Heaven as Bud Means did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph said yes, that he thought that was just it. At least, he guessed
    </p>
    <p>
     if there was something more, the man that was putting in his best licks
    </p>
    <p>
     would be sure to find it out.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you think he'd help a feller? Seems to me it would be number one to
    </p>
    <p>
     have God help you. Not to help you fight other folks, but to help you
    </p>
    <p>
     when it comes to fighting the devil inside. But you see I don't belong
    </p>
    <p>
     to no church"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, let's you and me have one right off. Two people that help one
    </p>
    <p>
     another to serve God make a church."
    </p>
    <p>
     I am afraid this ecclesiastical theory will not be considered orthodox.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was Ralph's, and I write it down at the risk of bringing him into
    </p>
    <p>
     condemnation.
    </p>
    <p>
     But other people before the days of Bud and Ralph have discussed church
    </p>
    <p>
     organization when they should have been doing Christian work. For both
    </p>
    <p>
     of them had forgotten the danger that hung over the old basket-maker,
    </p>
    <p>
     until Shocky burst into the school-house, weeping. Indeed, the poor,
    </p>
    <p>
     nervous little frame was ready to go into convulsions.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Miss Hawkins--"
    </p>
    <p>
     Bud started at mention of the name.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Miss Hawkins has just been over to say that a crowd is going to tar and
    </p>
    <p>
     feather Mr. Pearson to-night. And--" here Shocky wept again. "And he
    </p>
    <p>
     won't run, but he's took up the old flintlock, and he'll die in his
    </p>
    <p>
     tracks."

     CHAPTER XVI.
    </head>
    <p>
     THE CHURCH MILITANT.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bud was doubly enlisted on the side of John Pearson, the basket-maker.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the first place, he knew that this persecution of the unpopular old
    </p>
    <p>
     man was only a blind to save somebody else; that they were thieves who
    </p>
    <p>
     cried, "Stop thief!" And he felt consequently that this was a chance to
    </p>
    <p>
     put his newly-formed resolutions into practice. The Old Testament
    </p>
    <p>
     religious life, which consists in fighting the Lord's enemies, suited
    </p>
    <p>
     Bud's temper and education. It might lead to something better. It was
    </p>
    <p>
     the best possible to him, now. But I am afraid I shall have to
    </p>
    <p>
     acknowledge that there was a second motive that moved Bud to this
    </p>
    <p>
     championship. The good heart of Martha Hawkins having espoused the cause
    </p>
    <p>
     of the basket-maker, the heart of Bud Means could not help feeling
    </p>
    <p>
     warmly on the same side. Blessed is that man in whose life the driving
    </p>
    <p>
     of duty and the drawing of love impel the same way! But why speak of the
    </p>
    <p>
     driving of duty? For already Bud was learning the better lesson of
    </p>
    <p>
     serving God for the love of God.
    </p>
    <p>
     The old basket-maker was the most unpopular man in Flat Creek district.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had two great vices. He would go to Clifty and have a "spree" once in
    </p>
    <p>
     three months. And he would tell the truth in a most unscrupulous manner.
    </p>
    <p>
     A man given to plain speaking was quite as objectionable in Flat Creek
    </p>
    <p>
     as he would have been in France under the Empire, the Commune, or the
    </p>
    <p>
     Republic, and almost as objectionable as he would be in any refined
    </p>
    <p>
     community in America. People who live in glass houses have a horror of
    </p>
    <p>
     people who throw stones. And the old basket-maker, having no friends,
    </p>
    <p>
     was a good scape-goat. In driving him off, Pete Jones would get rid of a
    </p>
    <p>
     dangerous neighbor and divert attention from himself. The immediate
    </p>
    <p>
     crime of the basket-maker was that he had happened to see too much.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mr. Hartsook," said Bud, when they got out into the road, "you'd better
    </p>
    <p>
     go straight home to the Squire's. Bekase ef this lightnin' strikes a
    </p>
    <p>
     second time it'll strike awful closte to you. You hadn't better be seen
    </p>
    <p>
     with us. Which way did you come, Shocky?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, I tried to come down the holler, but I met Jones right by the big
    </p>
    <p>
     road, and he sweared at me and said he'd kill me ef I didn't go back and
    </p>
    <p>
     stay. And so I went back to the house and then slipped out through the
    </p>
    <p>
     graveyard. You see I was bound to come ef I got skinned. For Mr.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pearson's, stuck to me and I mean to stick to him, you see."
    </p>
    <p>
     Bud led Shocky through the graveyard. But when they reached the forest
    </p>
    <p>
     path from the graveyard he thought that perhaps it was not best to "show
    </p>
    <p>
     his hand," as he expressed it, too soon.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now, Shocky," he said, "do you run ahead and tell the ole man that I
    </p>
    <p>
     want to see him right off down by the Spring-in-rock. I'll keep closte
    </p>
    <p>
     behind you, and ef anybody offers to trouble you, do you let off a yell
    </p>
    <p>
     and I'll be thar in no time."
    </p>
    <p>
     When Ralph left the school-house he felt mean. There were Bud and Shocky
    </p>
    <p>
     gone on an errand of mercy, and he, the truant member of the Church of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Best Licks, was not with them. The more he thought of it the more he
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to be a coward, and the more he despised himself; so, yielding as
    </p>
    <p>
     usual to the first brave impulse, he leaped nimbly over the fence and
    </p>
    <p>
     started briskly through the forest in a direction intersecting the path
    </p>
    <p>
     on which were Bud and Shocky. He came in sight just in time to see the
    </p>
    <p>
     first conflict of the Church in the Wilderness with her foes.
    </p>
    <p>
     For Shocky's little feet went more swiftly on their eager errand than
    </p>
    <p>
     Bud had anticipated. He got farther out of Bud's reach than the latter
    </p>
    <p>
     intended he should, and he did not discover Pete Jones until Pete, with
    </p>
    <p>
     his hog-drover's whip, was right upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shocky tried to halloo for Bud, but he was like one in a nightmare. The
    </p>
    <p>
     yell died into a whisper which could not have been heard ten feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     I shall not repeat Mr. Jones's words. They were frightfully profane. But
    </p>
    <p>
     he did not stop at words. He swept his whip round and gave little Shocky
    </p>
    <p>
     one terrible cut. Then the voice was released, and the piercing cry of
    </p>
    <p>
     pain brought Bud down the path flying.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You good-for-nothing scoundrel," growled Bud, "you're a coward and a
    </p>
    <p>
     thief to be a-beatin' a little creetur like him!" and with that Bud
    </p>
    <p>
     walked up on Jones, who prudently changed position in such a way as to
    </p>
    <p>
     get the upper side of the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, I'll gin you the upper side, but come on," cried Bud, "ef you
    </p>
    <p>
     a'n't afeared to fight somebody besides a poor little sickly baby or a
    </p>
    <p>
     crippled soldier. Come on!"
    </p>
    <p>
     [Illustration: Bud Means comes to the rescue of Shocky.]
    </p>
    <p>
     Pete was no insignificant antagonist. He had been a great fighter, and
    </p>
    <p>
     his well-seasoned arms were like iron. He had not the splendid set of
    </p>
    <p>
     Bud, but he had more skill and experience in the rude tournament of
    </p>
    <p>
     fists to which the backwoods is so much given. Now, being out of sight
    </p>
    <p>
     of witnesses and sure that he could lie about the fight afterward, he
    </p>
    <p>
     did not scruple to take advantages which would have disgraced him
    </p>
    <p>
     forever if he had taken them in a public fight on election day or at a
    </p>
    <p>
     muster. He took the uphill side, and he clubbed his whip-stalk, striking
    </p>
    <p>
     Bud with all his force with the heavy end, which, coward-like, he had
    </p>
    <p>
     loaded with lead. Bud threw up his strong left arm and parried the blow,
    </p>
    <p>
     which, however, was so fierce that it fractured one of the bones of the
    </p>
    <p>
     arm. Throwing away his whip Pete rushed upon Bud furiously, intending to
    </p>
    <p>
     overpower him, but Bud slipped quickly to one side and let Jones pass
    </p>
    <p>
     down the hill, and as Jones came up again Means dealt him one crushing
    </p>
    <p>
     blow that sent him full length upon the ground. Nothing but the leaves
    </p>
    <p>
     saved him from a most terrible fall. Jones sprang to his feet more angry
    </p>
    <p>
     than ever at being whipped by one whom he regarded as a boy, and drew a
    </p>
    <p>
     long dirk-knife. But he was blind with rage, and Bud dodged the knife,
    </p>
    <p>
     and this time gave Pete a blow on the nose which marred the homeliness
    </p>
    <p>
     of that feature and doubled the fellow up against a tree ten feet away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph came in sight in time to see the beginning of the fight, and he
    </p>
    <p>
     arrived on the ground just as Pete Jones went down under the well-dealt
    </p>
    <p>
     blow from the only remaining fist of Bud Means.
    </p>
    <p>
     While Ralph examined Bud's disabled left arm Pete picked himself up
    </p>
    <p>
     slowly, and, muttering that he felt "consid'able shuck up like," crawled
    </p>
    <p>
     away like a whipped puppy. To every one whom he met, Pete, whose
    </p>
    <p>
     intellect seemed to have weakened in sympathy with his frame, remarked
    </p>
    <p>
     feebly that he was consid'able shuck up like, and vouchsafed no other
    </p>
    <p>
     explanation. Even to his wife he only said that he felt purty
    </p>
    <p>
     consid'able shuck up like, and that the boys would have to get on
    </p>
    <p>
     to-night without him. There are some scoundrels whose very malignity is
    </p>
    <p>
     shaken out of them for the time being by a thorough drubbing.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm afraid you're going to have trouble with your arm, Bud," said Ralph
    </p>
    <p>
     tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Never mind; I put in my best licks fer _Him_ that air time, Mr.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hartsook." Ralph shivered a little at thought of this, but if it was
    </p>
    <p>
     right to knock Jones down at all, why might not Bud do it "heartily as
    </p>
    <p>
     unto the Lord?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Gideon did not feel any more honest pleasure in chastising the
    </p>
    <p>
     Midianites than did Bud in sending Pete Jones away purty consid'able
    </p>
    <p>
     shuck up like.

    <p>
     A COUNCIL OF WAR.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shocky, whose feet had flown as soon as he saw the final fall of Pete
    </p>
    <p>
     Jones, told the whole story to the wondering and admiring ears of Miss
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins, who unhappily could not remember anything at the East just like
    </p>
    <p>
     it; to the frightened ears of the rheumatic old lady who felt sure her
    </p>
    <p>
     ole man's talk and stubbornness would be the ruin of him, and to the
    </p>
    <p>
     indignant ears of the old soldier who was hobbling up and down,
    </p>
    <p>
     sentinel-wise, in front of his cabin, standing guard over himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, I won't leave," he said to Ralph and Bud. "You see I jest won't.
    </p>
    <p>
     What would Gin'ral Winfield Scott say ef he knew that one of them as fit
    </p>
    <p>
     at Lundy's Lane backed out, retreated, run fer fear of a passel of
    </p>
    <p>
     thieves? No, sir; me and the old flintlock will live and die together.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll put a thunderin' charge of buckshot into the first one of them
    </p>
    <p>
     scoundrels as comes up the holler. It'll be another Lundy's Lane. And
    </p>
    <p>
     you, Mr. Hartsook, may send Scott word that ole Pearson, as fit at
    </p>
    <p>
     Lundy's Lane under him, died a-fightin' thieves on Rocky Branch, in
    </p>
    <p>
     Hoopole Kyounty, State of Injeanny."
    </p>
    <p>
     And the old man hobbled faster and faster, taxing his wooden leg to the
    </p>
    <p>
     very utmost, as if his victory depended on the vehemence with which he
    </p>
    <p>
     walked his beat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mrs. Pearson sat wringing her hands and looking appealingly at Martha
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins, who stood in the door, in despair, looking appealingly at Bud.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bud was stupefied by the old man's stubbornness and his own pain, and in
    </p>
    <p>
     his turn appealed mutely to the master, in whose resources he had
    </p>
    <p>
     boundless confidence. Ralph, seeing that all depended on him, was taxing
    </p>
    <p>
     his wits to think of some way to get round Pearson's stubbornness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shocky hung to the old man's coat and pulled away at him with many
    </p>
    <p>
     entreating words, but the venerable, bare-headed sentinel strode up and
    </p>
    <p>
     down furiously, with his flintlock on his shoulder and his basket-knife
    </p>
    <p>
     in his belt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just at this point somebody could be seen indistinctly through the
    </p>
    <p>
     bushes coming up the hollow.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Halt!" cried the old hero. "Who goes there?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's me, Mr. Pearson. Don't shoot me, please."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the voice of Hannah Thomson. Hearing that the whole neighborhood
    </p>
    <p>
     was rising against the benefactor of Shocky and of her family, she had
    </p>
    <p>
     slipped away from the eyes of her mistress, and run with breathless
    </p>
    <p>
     haste to give warning in the cabin on Rocky Branch. Seeing Ralph, she
    </p>
    <p>
     blushed, and went into the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well," said Ralph, "the enemy is not coming yet. Let us hold a council
    </p>
    <p>
     of war."
    </p>
    <p>
     This thought came to Ralph like an inspiration. It pleased the old man's
    </p>
    <p>
     whim, and he sat down on the door-step.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now, I suppose," said Ralph, "that General Winfield Scott always looked
    </p>
    <p>
     into things a little before he went into a fight. Didn't he?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "_To_ be sure," assented the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well," said Ralph. "What is the condition of the enemy? I suppose the
    </p>
    <p>
     whole neighborhood's against us."
    </p>
    <p>
     "_To_ be sure," said the old man. The rest were silent, but all felt the
    </p>
    <p>
     statement to be about true.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Next," said Ralph, "I suppose General Winfield Scott would always
    </p>
    <p>
     inquire into the condition of his own troops. Now let us see. Captain
    </p>
    <p>
     Pearson has Bud, who is the right wing, badly crippled by having his arm
    </p>
    <p>
     broken in the first battle." (Miss Hawkins looked pale.)
    </p>
    <p>
     "_To_ be sure," said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And I am the left wing, pretty good at giving advice, but very slender
    </p>
    <p>
     in a fight."
    </p>
    <p>
     "_To_ be sure," said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And Shocky and Miss Martha and Hannah good aids, but nothing in a
    </p>
    <p>
     battle."
    </p>
    <p>
     "_To_ be sure," said the basket-maker, a little doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now let's look at the arms and accouterments, I think you call them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, this old musket has been loaded--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "This ten year," said the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And the lock is so rusty that you could not cock it when you wanted to
    </p>
    <p>
     take aim at Hannah."
    </p>
    <p>
     The old man looked foolish, and muttered "_To_ be sure."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And there isn't another round of ammunition in the house."
    </p>
    <p>
     The old man was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now let us look at the incumbrances. Here's the old lady and Shocky. If
    </p>
    <p>
     you fight, the enemy will be pleased. It will give them a chance to kill
    </p>
    <p>
     you. And then the old lady will die and they will do with Shocky as they
    </p>
    <p>
     please."
    </p>
    <p>
     "_To_ be sure," said the old man reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now," said Ralph, "General Winfield Scott, under such circumstances,
    </p>
    <p>
     would retreat in good order. Then, when he could muster his forces
    </p>
    <p>
     rightly, he would drive the enemy from his ground."
    </p>
    <p>
     "To be sure," said the old man. "What ort I to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have you any friends?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, yes; ther's my brother over in Jackson Kyounty. I mout go there."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well," said Bud, "do you just go down to Spring-in-rock and stay there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Them folks won't be here tell midnight. I'll come fer you at nine with
    </p>
    <p>
     my roan colt, and I'll set you down over on the big road on Buckeye Run.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then you can git on the mail-wagon that passes there about five o'clock
    </p>
    <p>
     in the mornin', and go over to Jackson County and keep shady till we
    </p>
    <p>
     want you to face the enemy and to swear agin some folks. And then well
    </p>
    <p>
     send fer you."
    </p>
    <p>
     "To be sure," said the old man in a broken voice. "I reckon General
    </p>
    <p>
     Winfield Scott wouldn't disapprove of such a maneuver as that thar."
    </p>
    <p>
     Miss Martha beamed on Bud to his evident delight, for he carried his
    </p>
    <p>
     painful arm part of the way home with her. Ralph noticed that Hannah
    </p>
    <p>
     looked at _him_ with a look full of contending emotions. He read
    </p>
    <p>
     admiration, gratitude, and doubt in the expression of her face, as she
    </p>
    <p>
     turned toward home.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, good-by, ole woman," said Pearson, as he took up his little
    </p>
    <p>
     handkerchief full of things and started for his hiding-place; "good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
     I didn't never think I'd desart you, and ef the old flintlock hadn't a
    </p>
    <p>
     been rusty, I'd a staid and died right here by the ole cabin. But I
    </p>
    <p>
     reckon 'ta'n't best to be brash[22]." And Shocky looked after him, as he
    </p>
    <p>
     hobbled away over the stones, more than ever convinced that God had
    </p>
    <p>
     forgotten all about things on Flat Creek. He gravely expressed his
    </p>
    <p>
     opinion to the master the next day.

    <p>
     [Footnote 22: The elaborate etymological treatment of this word in its
    </p>
    <p>
     various forms in our best dictionary is a fine illustration of the fact
    </p>
    <p>
     that something more than scholarship is needed for penetrating the
    </p>
    <p>
     mysteries of current folk-speech. _Brash_--often _bresh_--in the sense
    </p>
    <p>
     of refuse boughs of trees, is only another form of _brush_; the two are
    </p>
    <p>
     used as one word by the people. _Brash_ in the sense of brittle has no
    </p>
    <p>
     conscious connection with the noun in popular usage, but it is accounted
    </p>
    <p>
     by the people the same word as _brash_ in the sense of rash or
    </p>
    <p>
     impetuous. The suggestion in the Century Dictionary that the words
    </p>
    <p>
     spelled _brash_ are of modern formation violates the soundest canon of
    </p>
    <p>
     antiquarian research, which is that a word phrase or custom widely
    </p>
    <p>
     diffused among plain or rustic people is of necessity of ancient origin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now _brash_, the adjective, exists in both senses in two or three of the
    </p>
    <p>
     most widely separated dialects of the United States, and hence must have
    </p>
    <p>
     come from England. Indeed, it appears in Wright's Dictionary of
    </p>
    <p>
     Provincial English in precisely the sense it has in the text.]

     ODDS AND ENDS.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Spring-in-rock, or, as it was sometimes, by a curious perversion,
    </p>
    <p>
     called, the "rock-in-spring," was a spring running out of a cave-like
    </p>
    <p>
     fissure in a high limestone cliff. Here the old man sheltered himself on
    </p>
    <p>
     that dreary Christmas evening, until Bud brought his roan colt to the
    </p>
    <p>
     top of the cliff above, and he and Ralph helped the old man up the cliff
    </p>
    <p>
     and into the saddle. Ralph went back to bed, but Bud, who was only too
    </p>
    <p>
     eager to put in his best licks, walked by the side of old John Pearson
    </p>
    <p>
     the six miles over to Buckeye Run, and at last, after eleven o'clock, he
    </p>
    <p>
     deposited him in a hollow sycamore by the road, there to wait the coming
    </p>
    <p>
     of the mail-wagon that would carry him into Jackson County.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good-by," said the basket-maker, as Bud mounted the colt to return. "Ef
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm wanted jest send me word, and I'll make a forrard movement any time.
    </p>
    <p>
     I don't like this 'ere thing of running off in the night-time. But I
    </p>
    <p>
     reckon General Winfield Scott would a ordered a retreat ef he'd a been
    </p>
    <p>
     in my shoes. I'm lots obleeged to you. Akordin' to my tell, we're all
    </p>
    <p>
     of us selfish in everything; but I'll be dog-on'd ef I don't believe you
    </p>
    <p>
     and one or two more is exceptions."
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether it was that the fact that Pete Jones had got consid'able shuck
    </p>
    <p>
     up demoralized his followers, or whether it was that the old man's
    </p>
    <p>
     flight was suspected, the mob did not turn out in very great force, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the tarring was postponed indefinitely, for by the time they came
    </p>
    <p>
     together it became known somehow that the man with a wooden leg had
    </p>
    <p>
     outrun them all. But the escape of one devoted victim did not mollify
    </p>
    <p>
     the feelings of the people toward the next one.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time Bud returned his arm was very painful, and the next day he
    </p>
    <p>
     went under Dr. Small's treatment to reduce the fracture. Whatever
    </p>
    <p>
     suspicions Bud might have of Pete Jones, he was not afflicted with
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph's dread of the silent young doctor. And if there was anything
    </p>
    <p>
     Small admired it was physical strength and courage. Small wanted Bud on
    </p>
    <p>
     his side, and least of all did he want him to be Ralph's champion. So
    </p>
    <p>
     that the silent, cool, and skillful doctor went to work to make an
    </p>
    <p>
     impression on Bud Means.
    </p>
    <p>
     Other influences were at work upon him also. Mrs. Means volleyed and
    </p>
    <p>
     thundered in her usual style about his "takin' up with a one-legged
    </p>
    <p>
     thief, and runnin' arter that master that was a mighty suspicious kind
    </p>
    <p>
     of a customer, akordin' to her tell. She'd allers said so. Ef she'd a
    </p>
    <p>
     been consulted he wouldn't a been hired. He warn't fit company fer
    </p>
    <p>
     nobody."
    </p>
    <p>
     And old Jack Means 'lowed Bud must want to have _their_ barns burnt like
    </p>
    <p>
     some other folkses had been. Fer his part, he had sense enough to know
    </p>
    <p>
     they was some people as it wouldn't do to set a body's self agin. And as
    </p>
    <p>
     fer him, he didn't butt his brains out agin a buckeye-tree. Not when he
    </p>
    <p>
     was sober. And so they managed, during Bud's confinement to the house,
    </p>
    <p>
     to keep him well supplied with all the ordinary discomforts of life.
    </p>
    <p>
     But one visit from Martha Hawkins, ten words of kindly inquiry from her,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the remark that his broken arm reminded her of something she had
    </p>
    <p>
     seen at the East and something somebody said the time she was to
    </p>
    <p>
     Bosting, were enough to repay the champion a thousand fold for all that
    </p>
    <p>
     he suffered. Indeed, that visit, and the recollection of Ralph's saying
    </p>
    <p>
     that Jesus Christ was a sort of a Flat Creeker himself, were manna in
    </p>
    <p>
     the wilderness to Bud.
    </p>
    <p>
     Poor Shocky was sick. The excitement had been too much for him, and
    </p>
    <p>
     though his fever was very slight it was enough to produce just a little
    </p>
    <p>
     delirium. Either Ralph or Miss Martha was generally at the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
     "They're coming," said Shocky to Ralph, "they're coming. Pete Jones is
    </p>
    <p>
     a-going to bind me out for a hundred years. I wish Hanner would hold me
    </p>
    <p>
     so's he couldn't. God's forgot all about us here in Flat Creek, and
    </p>
    <p>
     there's nobody to help it."
    </p>
    <p>
     And he shivered at every sudden sound. He was never free from this
    </p>
    <p>
     delirious fright except when the master held him tight in his arms. He
    </p>
    <p>
     staggered around the floor, the very shadow of Shocky, and was so
    </p>
    <p>
     terrified by the approach of darkness that Ralph staid in the cabin on
    </p>
    <p>
     Wednesday night and Miss Hawkins staid on Thursday night. On Friday, Bud
    </p>
    <p>
     sent a note to Ralph, askin him to come and see him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You see, Mr. Hartsook, I ha'n't forgot what was said about puttin' in
    </p>
    <p>
     our best licks for Jesus Christ. I've been a-trying to read some about
    </p>
    <p>
     him while I set here. And I read where he said somethin about doing fer
    </p>
    <p>
     the least of his brethren being as the same like as if it was done fer
    </p>
    <p>
     Jesus Christ his-self. Now there's Shocky. I reckon, p'r'aps, as anybody
    </p>
    <p>
     is a little brother of Jesus Christ, it is that Shocky. Pete Jones and
    </p>
    <p>
     his brother Bill is determined to have him back there to-morry. Bekase
    </p>
    <p>
     you see, Pete's one of the County Commissioners and to-morry's the day
    </p>
    <p>
     that they bind out. He wants to bind out that boy jes' to spite ole
    </p>
    <p>
     Pearson and you and me. You see, the ole woman's been helped by the
    </p>
    <p>
     neighbors, and he'll claim Shocky to be a pauper, and they a'n't no
    </p>
    <p>
     human soul here as dares to do a thing con_tra_ry to Pete. Couldn't you
    </p>
    <p>
     git him over to Lewisburg? I'll lend you my roan colt."
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph thought a minute. He dared not take Shocky to the uncle's where he
    </p>
    <p>
     found his only home. But there was Miss Nancy Sawyer, the old maid who
    </p>
    <p>
     was everybody's blessing. He could ask her to keep him. And, at any
    </p>
    <p>
     rate, he would save Shocky somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
     As he went out in the dusk, he met Hannah in the lane.
    </p>

     CHAPTER XIX.
    </head>
    <p>
     FACE TO FACE.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the lane, in the dark, under the shadow of the barn, Ralph met Hannah
    </p>
    <p>
     carrying her bucket of milk (they have no pails in Indiana)[23]. He
    </p>
    <p>
     could see only the white foam on the milk, and Hannah's white face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Perhaps it was well that he could not see how white Hannah's face was at
    </p>
    <p>
     that moment when a sudden trembling made her set down the heavy bucket.
    </p>
    <p>
     At first neither spoke. The recollection of all the joy of that walk
    </p>
    <p>
     together in the night came upon them both. And a great sense of loss
    </p>
    <p>
     made the night seem supernaturally dark to Ralph. Nor was it any lighter
    </p>
    <p>
     in the hopeless heart of the bound girl. The presence of Ralph did not
    </p>
    <p>
     now, as before, make the darkness of her life light.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hannah--" said Ralph presently, and stopped. For he could not finish
    </p>
    <p>
     the sentence. With a rush there came upon him a consciousness of the
    </p>
    <p>
     suspicions that filled Hannah's mind. And with it there came a feeling
    </p>
    <p>
     of guilt. He saw himself from her stand-point, and felt a remorse almost
    </p>
    <p>
     as keen as it could have been had he been a criminal. And this sudden
    </p>
    <p>
     and morbid sense of his guilt as it appeared to Hannah paralyzed him.
    </p>
    <p>
     But when Hannah lifted her bucket with her hand, and the world with her
    </p>
    <p>
     heavy heart, and essayed to pass him, Ralph rallied and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     "_You_ don't believe all these lies that are told about me."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't believe anything, Mr. Hartsook; that is, I don't want to
    </p>
    <p>
     believe anything against you. And I wouldn't mind anything they say if
    </p>
    <p>
     it wasn't for two things"--here she stammered and looked down.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If it wasn't for what?" said Ralph with a spice of indignant denial in
    </p>
    <p>
     his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hannah hesitated, but Ralph pressed the question with eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I saw you cross that blue-grass pasture the night--the night that you
    </p>
    <p>
     walked home with me." She would have said the night of the robbery, but
    </p>
    <p>
     her heart smote her, and she adopted the more kindly form of the
    </p>
    <p>
     sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph would have explained, but how?
    </p>
    <p>
     "I did cross the pasture," he began, "but--"
    </p>
    <p>
     Just here it occurred to Ralph that there was no reason for his night
    </p>
    <p>
     excursion across the pasture. Hannah again took up her bucket, but he
    </p>
    <p>
     said:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Tell me what else you have against me."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I haven't anything against you. Only I am poor and friendless, and you
    </p>
    <p>
     oughtn't to make my life any heavier. They say that you have paid
    </p>
    <p>
     attention to a great many girls. I don't know why you should want to
    </p>
    <p>
     trifle with me."
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph answered her this time. He spoke low. He spoke as though he were
    </p>
    <p>
     speaking to God. "If any man says that I ever trifled with any woman, he
    </p>
    <p>
     lies. I have never loved but one, and you know who that is. And God
    </p>
    <p>
     knows."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't know what to say, Mr. Hartsook." Hannah's voice was broken.
    </p>
    <p>
     These solemn words of love were like a river in the desert, and she was
    </p>
    <p>
     like a wanderer dying of thirst. "I don't know, Mr. Hartsook. If I was
    </p>
    <p>
     alone, it wouldn't matter. But I've got my blind mother and my poor
    </p>
    <p>
     Shocky to look after. And I don't want to make mistakes. And the world
    </p>
    <p>
     is so full of lies I don't know what to believe. Somehow I can't help
    </p>
    <p>
     believing what you say. You seem to speak so true. But--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "But what?" said Ralph.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But you know how I saw you just as kind to Martha Hawkins on Sunday
    </p>
    <p>
     as--as--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Han--ner!" It was the melodious voice of the angry Mrs. Means, and
    </p>
    <p>
     Hannah lifted her pail and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
     Standing in the shadow of his own despair, Ralph felt how dark a night
    </p>
    <p>
     could be when it had no promise of morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Dr. Small, who had been stabling his horse just inside the barn,
    </p>
    <p>
     came out and moved quietly into the house just as though he had not
    </p>
    <p>
     listened intently to every word of the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Ralph walked away he tried to comfort himself by calling to his aid
    </p>
    <p>
     the bulldog in his character. But somehow it did not do him any good.
    </p>
    <p>
     For what is a bulldog but a stoic philosopher? Stoicism has its value,
    </p>
    <p>
     but Ralph had come to a place where stoicism was of no account. The
    </p>
    <p>
     memory of the Helper, of his sorrow, his brave and victorious endurance,
    </p>
    <p>
     came when stoicism failed. Happiness might go out of life, but in the
    </p>
    <p>
     light of Christ's life happiness seemed but a small element anyhow. The
    </p>
    <p>
     love of woman might be denied him, but there still remained what was
    </p>
    <p>
     infinitely more precious and holy, the love of God. There still remained
    </p>
    <p>
     the possibility of heroic living. Working, suffering, and enduring still
    </p>
    <p>
     remained. And he who can work for God and endure for God, surely has
    </p>
    <p>
     yet the best of life left. And, like the knights who could find the Holy
    </p>
    <p>
     Grail only in losing themselves, Hartsook, in throwing his happiness out
    </p>
    <p>
     of the count, found the purest happiness, a sense of the victory of the
    </p>
    <p>
     soul over the tribulations of life. The man who knows this victory
    </p>
    <p>
     scarcely needs the encouragement of the hope of future happiness. There
    </p>
    <p>
     is a real heaven in bravely lifting the load of one's own sorrow and
    </p>
    <p>
     work.
    </p>
    <p>
     And it was a good thing for Ralph that the danger hanging over Shocky
    </p>
    <p>
     made immediate action necessary.

     CHAPTER XX.

    <p>
     GOD REMEMBERS SHOCKY.
    </p>
    <p>
     At four o'clock the next morning, in the midst of a driving snow, Ralph
    </p>
    <p>
     went timidly up the lane toward the homely castle of the Meanses. He
    </p>
    <p>
     went timidly, for he was afraid of Bull. But he found Bud waiting for
    </p>
    <p>
     him, with the roan colt bridled and saddled. The roan colt was really a
    </p>
    <p>
     large three-year-old, full of the finest sort of animal life, and
    </p>
    <p>
     having, as Bud declared, "a mighty sight of hoss sense fer his age." He
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to understand at once that there was something extraordinary on
    </p>
    <p>
     hand when he was brought out of his comfortable quarters at four in the
    </p>
    <p>
     morning in the midst of a snow-storm. Bud was sure that the roan colt
    </p>
    <p>
     felt his responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the days that followed, Ralph often had occasion to remember this
    </p>
    <p>
     interview with Bud, who had risked much in bringing his fractured arm
    </p>
    <p>
     out into the cold, damp air. Jonathan never clave to David more
    </p>
    <p>
     earnestly than did Bud this December morning to Ralph.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You see, Mr. Hartsook," said Bud, "I wish I was well myself. It's hard
    </p>
    <p>
     to set still. But it's a-doing me a heap of good. I'm like a boy at
    </p>
    <p>
     school. And I'm a-findin' out that doing one's best licks fer others
    </p>
    <p>
     ain't all they is of it, though it's a good part. I feel like as if I
    </p>
    <p>
     must git Him, you know, to do lots for me. They's always some sums too
    </p>
    <p>
     hard fer a feller, and he has to ax the master to do 'em, you know. But
    </p>
    <p>
     see, the roan's a-stomping round. He wants to be off. Do you know I
    </p>
    <p>
     think that hoss knows something's up? I think he puts in his best licks
    </p>
    <p>
     fer me a good deal better than I do fer Him."
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph pressed Bud's right hand. Bud rubbed his face against the colt's
    </p>
    <p>
     nose and said: "Put in your best licks, old fellow." And the colt
    </p>
    <p>
     whinnied. How a horse must want to speak! For Bud was right. Men are
    </p>
    <p>
     gods to horses, and they serve their deities with a faithfulness that
    </p>
    <p>
     shames us.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Ralph sprang into the saddle, and the roan, as if wishing to show
    </p>
    <p>
     Bud his willingness, broke into a swinging gallop, and was soon lost to
    </p>
    <p>
     the sight of his master in the darkness and the snow. When Bud could no
    </p>
    <p>
     more hear the sound of the roan's footsteps he returned to the house, to
    </p>
    <p>
     lie awake picturing to himself the journey of Ralph with Shocky and the
    </p>
    <p>
     roan colt. It was a great comfort to Bud that the roan, which was almost
    </p>
    <p>
     a part of himself, represented him in this ride. And he knew the roan
    </p>
    <p>
     well enough to feel sure that he would do credit to his master. "He'll
    </p>
    <p>
     put in his best licks," Bud whispered to himself many a time before
    </p>
    <p>
     daybreak.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ground was but little frozen, and the snow made the roads more
    </p>
    <p>
     slippery than ever. But the rough-shod roan handled his feet dexterously
    </p>
    <p>
     and with a playful and somewhat self-righteous air, as though he said:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Didn't I do it handsomely that time?" Down slippery hills, through deep
    </p>
    <p>
     mud-holes covered with a slender film of ice he trod with perfect
    </p>
    <p>
     assurance. And then up over the rough stones of Rocky Hollow, where
    </p>
    <p>
     there was no road at all, he picked his way through the darkness and
    </p>
    <p>
     snow. Ralph could not tell where he was at last, but gave the reins to
    </p>
    <p>
     the roan, who did his duty bravely, and not without a little flourish,
    </p>
    <p>
     to show that he had yet plenty of spare power.
    </p>
    <p>
     A feeble candle-ray, making the dense snow-fall visible, marked for
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph the site of the basket-maker's cabin. Miss Martha had been
    </p>
    <p>
     admitted to the secret, and had joined in the conspiracy heartily,
    </p>
    <p>
     without being able to recall anything of the kind having occurred at the
    </p>
    <p>
     East, and not remembering having seen or heard of anything of the sort
    </p>
    <p>
     the time she was to Bosting. She had Shocky all ready, having used some
    </p>
    <p>
     of her own capes and shawls to make him warm.
    </p>
    <p>
     Miss Martha came out to meet Ralph when she heard the feet of the roan
    </p>
    <p>
     before the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     "O Mr. Hartsook! is that you? What a storm. This is jest the way it
    </p>
    <p>
     snows at the East. Shocky's all ready. He didn't know a thing about it
    </p>
    <p>
     tell I waked him this morning. Ever since that he's been saying that God
    </p>
    <p>
     hasn't forgot, after all. It's made me cry more'n once." And Shocky
    </p>
    <p>
     kissed Mrs. Pearson, and told her that when he got away from Flat Creek
    </p>
    <p>
     he'd tell God all about it, and God would bring Mr. Pearson back again.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then Martha Hawkins lifted the frail little form, bundled in shawls,
    </p>
    <p>
     in her arms, and brought him out into the storm; and before she handed
    </p>
    <p>
     him up he embraced her, and said: "O Miss Hawkins! God ha'n't forgot me,
    </p>
    <p>
     after all. Tell Hanner that He ha'n't forgot. I'm going to ask him to
    </p>
    <p>
     git her away from Means's and mother out of the poor-house. I'll ask him
    </p>
    <p>
     just as soon as I get to Lewisburg."
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph lifted the trembling form into his arms, and the little fellow
    </p>
    <p>
     only looked up in the face of the master and said: "You see, Mr.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hartsook, I thought God had forgot. But he ha'n't."
    </p>
    <p>
     And the words of the little boy comforted the master also. God had not
    </p>
    <p>
     forgotten him, either!
    </p>
    <p>
     From the moment that Ralph took Shocky into his arms, the conduct of the
    </p>
    <p>
     roan colt underwent an entire revolution. Before that he had gone over a
    </p>
    <p>
     bad place with a rush, as though he were ambitious of distinguishing
    </p>
    <p>
     himself by his brilliant execution. Now he trod none the less surely,
    </p>
    <p>
     but he trod tenderly. The neck was no longer arched. He set himself to
    </p>
    <p>
     his work as steadily as though he were twenty years old. For miles he
    </p>
    <p>
     traveled on in a long, swinging walk, putting his feet down carefully
    </p>
    <p>
     and firmly. And Ralph found the spirit of the colt entering into
    </p>
    <p>
     himself. He cut the snow-storm with his face, and felt a sense of
    </p>
    <p>
     triumph over all his difficulties. The bulldog's jaws had been his
    </p>
    <p>
     teacher, and now the steady, strong, and conscientious legs of the roan
    </p>
    <p>
     inspired him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shocky had not spoken. He lay listening to the pattering music of the
    </p>
    <p>
     horse's feet, doubtless framing the footsteps of the roan colt into an
    </p>
    <p>
     anthem of praise to the God who had not forgot. But as the dawn came on,
    </p>
    <p>
     making the snow whiter, he raised himself and said half-aloud, as he
    </p>
    <p>
     watched the flakes chasing one another in whirling eddies, that the snow
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to be having a good time of it. Then he leaned down again on the
    </p>
    <p>
     master's bosom, full of a still joy, and only roused himself from his
    </p>
    <p>
     happy reverie to ask what that big, ugly-looking house was.
    </p>
    <p>
     "See, Mr. Hartsook, how big it is, and how little and ugly the windows
    </p>
    <p>
     is! And the boards is peeling off all over it, and the hogs is right in
    </p>
    <p>
     the front yard. It don't look just like a house. It looks dreadful. What
    </p>
    <p>
     is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph had dreaded this question. He did not answer it, but asked Shocky
    </p>
    <p>
     to change his position a little, and then he quickened the pace of the
    </p>
    <p>
     horse. But Shocky was a poet, and a poet understands silence more
    </p>
    <p>
     quickly than he does speech. The little fellow shivered as the truth
    </p>
    <p>
     came to him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is that the poor-house?" he said, catching his breath. "Is my mother in
    </p>
    <p>
     that place? _Won't_ you take me in there, so as I can just kiss her
    </p>
    <p>
     once? 'Cause she can't see much, you know. And one kiss from me will
    </p>
    <p>
     make her feel so good. And I'll tell her that God ha'n't forgot." He had
    </p>
    <p>
     raised up and caught hold of Ralph's coat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph had great difficulty in quieting him. He told him that if he went
    </p>
    <p>
     in there Bill Jones might claim that he was a runaway and belonged
    </p>
    <p>
     there. And poor Shocky only shivered and said he was cold. A minute
    </p>
    <p>
     later, Ralph found that he was shaking with a chill, and a horrible
    </p>
    <p>
     dread came over him. What if Shocky should die? It was only a minute's
    </p>
    <p>
     work to get down, take the warm horse-blanket from under the saddle, and
    </p>
    <p>
     wrap it about the boy, then to strip off his own overcoat and add that
    </p>
    <p>
     to it. It was now daylight, and finding, after he had mounted, that
    </p>
    <p>
     Shocky continued to shiver, he put the roan to his best speed for the
    </p>
    <p>
     rest of the way, trotting up and down the slippery hills, and galloping
    </p>
    <p>
     away on the level ground. How bravely the roan laid himself to his work,
    </p>
    <p>
     making the fence-corners fly past in a long procession! But poor little
    </p>
    <p>
     Shocky was too cold to notice them, and Ralph shuddered lest Shocky
    </p>
    <p>
     should never be warm again, and spoke to the roan, and the roan
    </p>
    <p>
     stretched out his head, and dropped one ear back to hear the first word
    </p>
    <p>
     of command, and stretched the other forward to listen for danger, and
    </p>
    <p>
     then flew with a splendid speed down the road, past the patches of
    </p>
    <p>
     blackberry briars, past the elderberry bushes, past the familiar red-haw
    </p>
    <p>
     tree in the fence-corner, over the bridge without regard to the threat
    </p>
    <p>
     of a five-dollar fine, and at last up the long lane into the village,
    </p>
    <p>
     where the smoke from the chimneys was caught and whirled round with the
    </p>
    <p>
     snow.

    <p>
     MISS NANCY SAWYER.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a little old cottage in Lewisburg, on one of the streets which was
    </p>
    <p>
     never traveled except by a solitary cow seeking pasture or a countryman
    </p>
    <p>
     bringing wood to some one of the half-dozen families living in it, and
    </p>
    <p>
     which in summer was decked with a profusion of the yellow and white
    </p>
    <p>
     blossoms of the dog-fennel--in this unfrequented street, so generously
    </p>
    <p>
     and unnecessarily broad, lived Miss Nancy Sawyer and her younger sister
    </p>
    <p>
     Semantha. Miss Nancy was a providence, one of those old maids that are
    </p>
    <p>
     benedictions to the whole town; one of those in whom the mother-love,
    </p>
    <p>
     wanting the natural objects on which to spend itself, overflows all
    </p>
    <p>
     bounds and lavishes itself on every needy thing, and grows richer and
    </p>
    <p>
     more abundant with the spending, a fountain of inexhaustible blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is no nobler life possible to any one than to an unmarried woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     The more shame that some choose a selfish one, and thus turn to gall all
    </p>
    <p>
     the affection with which they are endowed. Miss Nancy Sawyer had been
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph's Sunday-school teacher, and it was precious little, so far as
    </p>
    <p>
     information went, that he learned from her; for she never could conceive
    </p>
    <p>
     of Jerusalem as a place in any essential regard very different from
    </p>
    <p>
     Lewisburg, where she had spent her life. But Ralph learned from her what
    </p>
    <p>
     most Sunday-school teachers fail to teach, the great lesson of
    </p>
    <p>
     Christianity, by the side of which all antiquities and geographies and
    </p>
    <p>
     chronologies and exegetics and other niceties are as nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     And now he turned the head of the roan toward the cottage of Miss Nancy
    </p>
    <p>
     Sawyer as naturally as the roan would have gone to his own stall in the
    </p>
    <p>
     stable at home. The snow had gradually ceased to fall, and was eddying
    </p>
    <p>
     round the house, when Ralph dismounted from his foaming horse, and,
    </p>
    <p>
     carrying the still form of Shocky as reverently as though it had been
    </p>
    <p>
     something heavenly, knocked at Miss Nancy Sawyer's door.
    </p>
    <p>
     With natural feminine instinct that lady started back when she saw
    </p>
    <p>
     Hartsook, for she had just built a fire in the stove, and she now stood
    </p>
    <p>
     at the door with unwashed face and uncombed hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, Ralph Hartsook, where did you drop down from--and what have you
    </p>
    <p>
     got?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I came from Flat Creek this morning, and I brought you a little angel
    </p>
    <p>
     who has got out of heaven, and needs some of your motherly care."
    </p>
    <p>
     Shocky was brought in. The chill shook him now by fits only, for a fever
    </p>
    <p>
     had spotted his cheeks already.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Who are you?" said Miss Nancy, as she unwrapped him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm Shocky, a little boy as God forgot, and then thought of again."

     CHAPTER XXII.

    <p>
     PANCAKES.
    </p>
    <p>
     Half an hour later, Ralph, having seen Miss Nancy Sawyer's machinery of
    </p>
    <p>
     warm baths and simple remedies safely in operation, and having seen the
    </p>
    <p>
     roan colt comfortably stabled, and rewarded for his faithfulness by a
    </p>
    <p>
     bountiful supply of the best hay and the promise of oats when he was
    </p>
    <p>
     cool--half an hour later Ralph was doing the most ample, satisfactory,
    </p>
    <p>
     and amazing justice to his Aunt Matilda's hot buckwheat-cakes and warm
    </p>
    <p>
     coffee. And after his life in Flat Creek, Aunt Matilda's house did look
    </p>
    <p>
     like paradise. How white the table-cloth, how bright the coffee-pot, how
    </p>
    <p>
     clean the wood-work, how glistening the brass door-knobs, how spotless
    </p>
    <p>
     everything that came under the sovereign sway of Mrs. Matilda White! For
    </p>
    <p>
     in every Indiana village as large as Lewisburg, there are generally a
    </p>
    <p>
     half-dozen women who are admitted to be the best housekeepers. All
    </p>
    <p>
     others are only imitators. And the strife is between these for the
    </p>
    <p>
     pre-eminence. It is at least safe to say that no other in Lewisburg
    </p>
    <p>
     stood so high as an enemy to dirt, and as a "rat, roach, and mouse
    </p>
    <p>
     exterminator," as did Mrs. Matilda White, the wife of Ralph's maternal
    </p>
    <p>
     uncle, Robert White, Esq., a lawyer in successful practice. Of course no
    </p>
    <p>
     member of Mrs. White's family ever stayed at home longer than was
    </p>
    <p>
     necessary. Her husband found his office--which he kept in as bad a state
    </p>
    <p>
     as possible in order to maintain an equilibrium in his life--much more
    </p>
    <p>
     comfortable than the stiffly clean house at home. From the time that
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph had come to live as a chore-boy at his uncle's, he had ever
    </p>
    <p>
     crossed the threshold of Aunt Matilda's temple of cleanliness with a
    </p>
    <p>
     horrible sense of awe. And Walter Johnson, her son by a former marriage,
    </p>
    <p>
     had--poor, weak-willed fellow!--been driven into bad company and bad
    </p>
    <p>
     habits by the wretchedness of extreme civilization. And yet he showed
    </p>
    <p>
     the hereditary trait, for all the genius which Mrs. White consecrated to
    </p>
    <p>
     the glorious work of making her house too neat to be habitable, her son
    </p>
    <p>
     Walter gave to tying exquisite knots in his colored cravats and combing
    </p>
    <p>
     his oiled locks so as to look like a dandy barber. And she had no other
    </p>
    <p>
     children. The kind Providence that watches over the destiny of children
    </p>
    <p>
     takes care that very few of them are lodged in these terribly clean
    </p>
    <p>
     houses.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Walter was not at the table, and Ralph had so much anxiety lest his
    </p>
    <p>
     absence should be significant of evil, that he did not venture to
    </p>
    <p>
     inquire after him as he sat there between Mr. and Mrs. White disposing
    </p>
    <p>
     of Aunt Matilda's cakes with an appetite only justified by his long
    </p>
    <p>
     morning's ride and the excellence of the brown cakes, the golden honey,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the coffee, enriched, as Aunt Matilda's always was, with the most
    </p>
    <p>
     generous cream. Aunt Matilda was so absorbed in telling of the doings of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Dorcas Society that she entirely forgot to be surprised at the early
    </p>
    <p>
     hour of Ralph's arrival. When she had described the number of the
    </p>
    <p>
     garments finished to be sent to the Five Points Mission, or the Home for
    </p>
    <p>
     the Friendless, or the South Sea Islands, I forget which, Ralph thought
    </p>
    <p>
     he saw his chance, while Aunt Matilda was in a benevolent mood, to
    </p>
    <p>
     broach a plan he had been revolving for some time. But when he looked at
    </p>
    <p>
     Aunt Matilda's immaculate--horribly immaculate--housekeeping, his heart
    </p>
    <p>
     failed him, and he would have said nothing had she not inadvertently
    </p>
    <p>
     opened the door herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     "How did you get here so early, Ralph?" and Aunt Matilda's face was
    </p>
    <p>
     shadowed with a coming rebuke.
    </p>
    <p>
     "By early rising," said Ralph. But, seeing the gathering frown on his
    </p>
    <p>
     aunt's brow, he hastened to tell the story of Shocky as well as he
    </p>
    <p>
     could. Mrs. White did not give way to any impulse toward sympathy until
    </p>
    <p>
     she learned that Shocky was safely housed with Miss Nancy Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, Sister Sawyer has no family cares," she said by way of smoothing
    </p>
    <p>
     her slightly ruffled complacency, "she has no family cares, and she can
    </p>
    <p>
     do those things. Sometimes I think she lets people impose on her and
    </p>
    <p>
     keep her away from the means of grace, and I spoke to our new preacher
    </p>
    <p>
     about it the last time he was here, and asked him to speak to Sister
    </p>
    <p>
     Sawyer about staying away from the ordinances to wait on everybody, but
    </p>
    <p>
     he is a queer man, and he only said that he supposed Sister Sawyer
    </p>
    <p>
     neglected the inferior ordinances that she might attend to higher ones.
    </p>
    <p>
     But I don't see any sense in a minister of the gospel calling
    </p>
    <p>
     prayer-meeting a lower ordinance than feeding catnip-tea to Mrs. Brown's
    </p>
    <p>
     last baby. But hasn't this little boy--Shocking, or what do you call
    </p>
    <p>
     him?--got any mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," said Ralph, "and that was just what I was going to say." And he
    </p>
    <p>
     proceeded to tell how anxious Shocky was to see his half-blind mother,
    </p>
    <p>
     and actually ventured to wind up his remarks by suggesting that Shocky's
    </p>
    <p>
     mother be invited to stay over Sunday in Aunt Matilda's house.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bless my stars!" said that astounded saint, "fetch a pauper here? What
    </p>
    <p>
     crazy notions you have got! Fetch her here out of the poor-house? Why,
    </p>
    <p>
     she wouldn't be fit to sleep in my--" here Aunt Matilda choked. The bare
    </p>
    <p>
     thought of having a pauper in her billowy beds, whose snowy whiteness
    </p>
    <p>
     was frightful to any ordinary mortal, the bare thought of the contagion
    </p>
    <p>
     of the poor-house taking possession of one of her beds, smothered her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And then you know sore eyes are very catching."
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph boiled a little. "Aunt Matilda, do you think Dorcas was afraid of
    </p>
    <p>
     sore eyes?"
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a center shot, and the lawyer-uncle, lawyerlike, enjoyed a good
    </p>
    <p>
     hit. And he enjoyed a good hit at his wife best of all, for he never
    </p>
    <p>
     ventured on one himself. But Aunt Matilda felt that a direct reply was
    </p>
    <p>
     impossible. She was not a lawyer but a woman, and so dodged the question
    </p>
    <p>
     by making a counter-charge.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It seems to me, Ralph, that you have picked up some very low
    </p>
    <p>
     associates. And you go around at night, I am told. You get over here by
    </p>
    <p>
     daylight, and I hear that you have made common cause with a lame soldier
    </p>
    <p>
     who acts as a spy for thieves, and that your running about of night is
    </p>
    <p>
     likely to get you into trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph was hit this time. "I suppose," he said, "that you've been
    </p>
    <p>
     listening to some of Henry Small's lies."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, Ralph, how you talk! The worst sign of all is that you abuse such
    </p>
    <p>
     a young man as Dr. Small, the most exemplary Christian young man in the
    </p>
    <p>
     county. And he is a great friend of yours, for when he was here last
    </p>
    <p>
     week he did not say a word against you, but looked so sorry when your
    </p>
    <p>
     being in trouble was mentioned. Didn't he, Mr. White?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. White, as in duty bound, said yes, but he said yes in a cool,
    </p>
    <p>
     lawyerlike way, which showed that he did not take quite so much stock in
    </p>
    <p>
     Dr. Small as his wife did. This was a comfort to Ralph, who sat
    </p>
    <p>
     picturing to himself the silent flattery which Dr. Small's eyes paid to
    </p>
    <p>
     his Aunt Matilda, and the quiet expression of pain that would flit
    </p>
    <p>
     across his face when Ralph's name was mentioned. And never until that
    </p>
    <p>
     moment had Hartsook understood how masterful Small's artifices were. He
    </p>
    <p>
     had managed to elevate himself in Mrs. White's estimation and to destroy
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph at the same time, and had managed to do both by a contraction of
    </p>
    <p>
     the eyebrows!
    </p>
    <p>
     But the silence was growing painful and Ralph thought to break it and
    </p>
    <p>
     turn the current of talk from himself by asking after Mrs. White's son.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where is Walter?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh! Walter's doing well. He went down to Clifty three weeks ago to
    </p>
    <p>
     study medicine with Henry Small. He seems so fond of the doctor, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     doctor is such an excellent man, you know, and I have strong hopes that
    </p>
    <p>
     Wallie will be led to see the error of his ways by his association with
    </p>
    <p>
     Henry. I suppose he would have gone to see you but for the unfavorable
    </p>
    <p>
     reports that he heard. I hope, Ralph, you too will make the friendship
    </p>
    <p>
     of Dr. Small. And for the sake of your poor, dead mother"--here Aunt
    </p>
    <p>
     Matilda endeavored to show some emotion--"for the sake of your poor dead
    </p>
    <p>
     mother--"
    </p>
    <p>
     But Ralph heard no more. The buckwheat-cakes had lost their flavor. He
    </p>
    <p>
     remembered that the colt had not yet had his oats, and so, in the very
    </p>
    <p>
     midst of Aunt Matilda's affecting allusion to his mother, like a
    </p>
    <p>
     stiff-necked reprobate that he was, Ralph Hartsook rose abruptly from
    </p>
    <p>
     the table, put on his hat, and went out toward the stable.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I declare," said Mrs. White, descending suddenly from her high moral
    </p>
    <p>
     stand-point, "I declare that boy has stepped right on the threshold of
    </p>
    <p>
     the back-door," and she stuffed her white handkerchief into her pocket,
    </p>
    <p>
     and took down the floor-cloth to wipe off the imperceptible blemish left
    </p>
    <p>
     by Ralph's boot-heels. And Mr. White followed his nephew to the stable
    </p>
    <p>
     to request that he would be a little careful what he did about anybody
    </p>
    <p>
     in the poor-house, as any trouble with the Joneses might defeat Mr.
    </p>
    <p>
     White's nomination to the judgeship of the Court of Common Pleas.

     CHAPTER XXIII.
    </head>
    <p>
     A CHARITABLE INSTITUTION.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Ralph got back to Miss Nancy Sawyer's, Shocky was sitting up in bed
    </p>
    <p>
     talking to Miss Nancy and Miss Semantha. His cheeks were a little
    </p>
    <p>
     flushed with fever and the excitement of telling his story; theirs were
    </p>
    <p>
     wet with tears. "Ralph," whispered Miss Nancy, as she drew him into the
    </p>
    <p>
     kitchen, "I want you to get a buggy or a sleigh, and go right over to
    </p>
    <p>
     the poor-house and fetch that boy's mother over here. It'll do me more
    </p>
    <p>
     good than any sermon I ever heard to see that boy in his mother's arms
    </p>
    <p>
     to-morrow. We can keep the old lady over Sunday."
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph was delighted, so delighted that he came near kissing good Miss
    </p>
    <p>
     Nancy Sawyer, whose plain face was glorified by her generosity.
    </p>
    <p>
     But he did not go to the poor-house immediately. He waited until he saw
    </p>
    <p>
     Bill Jones, the Superintendent of the Poor-House, and Pete Jones, the
    </p>
    <p>
     County Commissioner, who was still somewhat shuck up, ride up to the
    </p>
    <p>
     court-house. Then he drove out of the village, and presently hitched his
    </p>
    <p>
     horse to the poor-house fence, and took a survey of the outside. Forty
    </p>
    <p>
     hogs, nearly ready for slaughter, wallowed in a pen in front of the
    </p>
    <p>
     forlorn and dilapidated house; for though the commissioners allowed a
    </p>
    <p>
     claim for repairs at every meeting, the repairs were never made, and it
    </p>
    <p>
     would not do to scrutinize Mr. Jones's bills too closely, unless you
    </p>
    <p>
     gave up all hope of renomination to office. One curious effect of
    </p>
    <p>
     political aspirations in Hoopole County, was to shut the eyes that they
    </p>
    <p>
     could not see, to close the ears that they could not hear, and to
    </p>
    <p>
     destroy the sense of smell. But Ralph, not being a politician, smelled
    </p>
    <p>
     the hog-pen without and the stench within, and saw everywhere the
    </p>
    <p>
     transparent fraud, and heard the echo of Jones's cruelty.
    </p>
    <p>
     A weak-eyed girl admitted him, and as he did not wish to make his
    </p>
    <p>
     business known at once, he affected a sort of idle interest in the
    </p>
    <p>
     place, and asked to be allowed to look round. The weak-eyed girl watched
    </p>
    <p>
     him. He found that all the women with children, twenty persons in all,
    </p>
    <p>
     were obliged to sleep in one room, which, owing to the hill-slope, was
    </p>
    <p>
     partly under ground, and which had but half a window for light, and no
    </p>
    <p>
     ventilation, except the chance draft from the door. Jones had declared
    </p>
    <p>
     that the women with children must stay there--"he warn't goin' to have
    </p>
    <p>
     brats a-runnin' over the whole house." Here were vicious women and good
    </p>
    <p>
     women, with their children, crowded like chickens in a coop for market.
    </p>
    <p>
     And there were, as usual in such places, helpless, idiotic women with
    </p>
    <p>
     illegitimate children. Of course this room was the scene of perpetual
    </p>
    <p>
     quarreling and occasional fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the quarters devoted to the insane, people slightly demented and
    </p>
    <p>
     raving maniacs were in the same rooms, while there were also those utter
    </p>
    <p>
     wrecks which sat in heaps on the floor, mumbling and muttering
    </p>
    <p>
     unintelligible words, the whole current of their thoughts hopelessly
    </p>
    <p>
     muddled, turning around upon itself in eddies never ending.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That air woman," said the weak-eyed girl, "used to holler a heap when
    </p>
    <p>
     she was brought in here. But Pap knows how to subjue 'em. He slapped her
    </p>
    <p>
     in the mouth every time she hollered. She don't make no furss now, but
    </p>
    <p>
     jist sets down that way all day, and keeps a-whisperin'."
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph understood it. When she came in she was the victim of mania; but
    </p>
    <p>
     she had been beaten into hopeless idiocy. Indeed this state of incurable
    </p>
    <p>
     imbecility seemed the end toward which all traveled. Shut in these bare
    </p>
    <p>
     rooms, with no treatment, no exercise, no variety, and meager food,
    </p>
    <p>
     cases of slight derangement soon grew into chronic lunacy.
    </p>
    <p>
     One young woman, called Phil, a sweet-faced person, apparently a
    </p>
    <p>
     farmer's wife, came up to Ralph and looked at him kindly, playing with
    </p>
    <p>
     the buttons on his coat in a childlike simplicity. Her blue-drilling
    </p>
    <p>
     dress was sewed all over with patches of white, representing ornamental
    </p>
    <p>
     buttons. The womanly instinct toward adornment had in her taken this
    </p>
    <p>
     childish turn.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't you think they ought to let me go home?" she said with a
    </p>
    <p>
     sweetness and a wistful, longing, home-sick look, that touched Ralph to
    </p>
    <p>
     the heart. He looked at her, and then at the muttering crones, and he
    </p>
    <p>
     could see no hope of any better fate for her. She followed him round the
    </p>
    <p>
     barn-like rooms, returning every now and then to her question. "Don't
    </p>
    <p>
     you think I might go home now?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The weak-eyed girl had been called away for a moment, and Ralph stood
    </p>
    <p>
     looking into a cell, where there was a man with a gay red plume in his
    </p>
    <p>
     hat and a strip of red flannel about his waist. He strutted up and down
    </p>
    <p>
     like a drill-sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I am General Andrew Jackson," he began. "People don't believe it, but I
    </p>
    <p>
     am. I had my head shot off at Bueny Visty, and the new one that growed
    </p>
    <p>
     on isn't nigh so good as the old one; it's tater on one side[24]. That's
    </p>
    <p>
     why they take advantage of me to shut me up. But I know some things. My
    </p>
    <p>
     head is tater on one side, but it's all right on t'other. And when I
    </p>
    <p>
     know a thing in the left side of my head, I know it. Lean down here. Let
    </p>
    <p>
     me tell you something out of the left side. Not out of the tater side,
    </p>
    <p>
     mind ye. I wouldn't a told you if he hadn't locked me up fer nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     _Bill Jones is a thief_! He sells the bodies of the dead paupers, and
    </p>
    <p>
     then sells the empty coffins back to the county agin. But that a'n't
    </p>
    <p>
     all--"
    </p>
    <p>
     Just then the weak-eyed girl came back, and, as Ralph moved away,
    </p>
    <p>
     General Jackson called out: "That a'n't all. I'll tell the rest another
    </p>
    <p>
     time. And that a'n't out of the tater side, you can depend on that.
    </p>
    <p>
     That's out of the left side. Sound as a nut on that side!"
    </p>
    <p>
     But Ralph began to wonder where he should find Hannah's mother.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't go in there," cried the weak-eyed girl, as Ralph was opening a
    </p>
    <p>
     door. "Ole Mowley's in there, and she'll cuss you."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh! well, if that's all, her curses won't hurt," said Hartsook,
    </p>
    <p>
     pushing open the door. But the volley of blasphemy and vile language
    </p>
    <p>
     that he received made him stagger. The old hag paced the floor, abusing
    </p>
    <p>
     everybody that came in her way. And by the window, in the same room,
    </p>
    <p>
     feeling the light that struggled through the dusty glass upon her face,
    </p>
    <p>
     sat a sorrowful, intelligent Englishwoman. Ralph noticed at once that
    </p>
    <p>
     she was English, and in a few moments he discovered that her sight was
    </p>
    <p>
     defective. Could it be that Hannah's mother was the room-mate of this
    </p>
    <p>
     loathsome creature, whose profanity and obscenity did not intermit for a
    </p>
    <p>
     moment?
    </p>
    <p>
     Happily the weak-eyed girl had not dared to brave the curses of Mowley.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph stepped forward to the woman by the window, and greeted her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is this Mrs. Thomson?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "That is my name, sir," she said, turning her face toward Ralph, who
    </p>
    <p>
     could not but remark the contrast between the thorough refinement of her
    </p>
    <p>
     manner and her coarse, scant, unshaped pauper-frock of blue drilling.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I saw your daughter yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Did you see my boy?"
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a tremulousness in her voice and an agitation in her manner
    </p>
    <p>
     which disclosed the emotion she strove in vain to conceal. For only the
    </p>
    <p>
     day before Bill Jones had informed her that Shocky would be bound out on
    </p>
    <p>
     Saturday, and that she would find that goin' agin him warn't a payin'
    </p>
    <p>
     business, so much as some others he mout mention.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph told her about Shocky's safety. _I_ shall not write down the
    </p>
    <p>
     conversation here. Critics would say that it was an overwrought scene.
    </p>
    <p>
     As if all the world were as cold as they! All I can tell is that this
    </p>
    <p>
     refined woman had all she could do to control herself in her eagerness
    </p>
    <p>
     to get out of her prison-house, away from the blasphemies of Mowley,
    </p>
    <p>
     away from the insults of Jones, away from the sights and sounds and
    </p>
    <p>
     smells of the place, and, above all, her eagerness to fly to the little
    </p>
    <p>
     shocky-head from whom she had been banished for two years. It seemed to
    </p>
    <p>
     her that she could gladly die now, if she could die with that flaxen
    </p>
    <p>
     head upon her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
     And so, in spite of the opposition of Bill Jones's son, who threatened
    </p>
    <p>
     her with every sort of evil if she left, Ralph wrapped Mrs. Thomson's
    </p>
    <p>
     blue drilling in Nancy Sawyer's shawl, and bore the feeble woman off to
    </p>
    <p>
     Lewisburg. And as they drove away, a sad, childlike voice cried from the
    </p>
    <p>
     gratings of the upper window, "Good-by! good-by!" Ralph turned and saw
    </p>
    <p>
     that it was Phil, poor Phil, for whom there was no deliverance[25]. And
    </p>
    <p>
     all the way back Ralph pronounced mental maledictions on the Dorcas
    </p>
    <p>
     Society, not for sending garments to the Five Points or the South Sea
    </p>
    <p>
     Islands, whichever it was, but for being so blind to the sorrow and
    </p>
    <p>
     poverty within its reach. He did not know, for he had not read the
    </p>
    <p>
     reports of the Boards of State Charities, that nearly all alms-houses
    </p>
    <p>
     are very much like this, and that the State of New York is not better in
    </p>
    <p>
     this regard than Indiana. And he did not know that it is true in almost
    </p>
    <p>
     all other counties, as it was in his own, that "Christian" people do not
    </p>
    <p>
     think enough of Christ to look for him in these lazar-houses.
    </p>
    <p>
     And while Ralph denounced the Dorcas Society, the eager, hungry heart of
    </p>
    <p>
     the mother ran, flew toward the little white-headed boy.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, I can not do it; I can not tell you about that meeting. I am sure
    </p>
    <p>
     that Miss Nancy Sawyer's tea tasted exceedingly good to the pauper, who
    </p>
    <p>
     had known nothing but cold water for years, and that the bread and
    </p>
    <p>
     butter were delicious to a palate that had eaten poor-house soup for
    </p>
    <p>
     dinner, and coarse poor-house bread and vile molasses for supper, and
    </p>
    <p>
     that without change for three years. But I can not tell you how it
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed that evening to Miss Nancy Sawyer, as the poor English lady sat
    </p>
    <p>
     in speechless ecstacy, rocking in the old splint-bottomed rocking-chair
    </p>
    <p>
     in the fire-light, while she pressed to her bosom with all the might of
    </p>
    <p>
     her enfeebled arms, the form of the little Shocky, who half-sobbed and
    </p>
    <p>
     half-sang, over and over again, "God ha'n't forgot us, mother; God
    </p>
    <p>
     ha'n't forgot us."
    </p>

     [Footnote 24: Some time after this book appeared Dr. Brown-SÃ©quard
    </p>
    <p>
     announced his theory of the dual brain. A writer in an English magazine
    </p>
    <p>
     called attention to the fact that the discovery had been anticipated by
    </p>
    <p>
     an imaginative writer, and cited the passage in the text as proving that

    <p>
     the author of "The Hoosier School-Master" had outrun Dr. Brown-SÃ©quard
    </p>
    <p>
     in perceiving the duality of the brain. It is a matter for surprise that
    </p>
    <p>
     an author, even an "imaginative" one, should have made so great a
    </p>

     CHAPTER XXIV.
    </head>
    <p>
     THE GOOD SAMARITAN.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Methodist church to which Mrs. Matilda White and Miss Nancy Sawyer
    </p>
    <p>
     belonged was the leading one in Lewisburg, as it was in most county-seat
    </p>
    <p>
     villages in Indiana. If I may be permitted to express my candid and
    </p>
    <p>
     charitable opinion of the difference between the two women, I shall have
    </p>
    <p>
     to use the old Quaker locution, and say that Miss Sawyer was a Methodist
    </p>
    <p>
     and likewise a Christian; Mrs. White was a Methodist, but I fear she was
    </p>
    <p>
     not likewise.
    </p>
    <p>
     As to the first part of this assertion, there was no room to doubt Miss
    </p>
    <p>
     Nancy's piety. She could get happy in class-meeting (for who had a
    </p>
    <p>
     better right?), and could witness a good experience in the quarterly
    </p>
    <p>
     love-feast. But it is not upon these grounds that I base my opinion of
    </p>
    <p>
     Miss Nancy. Do not even the Pharisees the same? She never dreamed that
    </p>
    <p>
     she had any right to speak of "Christian Perfection" (which, as Mrs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Partington said of total depravity, is an excellent doctrine if it is
    </p>
    <p>
     lived up to); but when a woman's heart is full of devout affections and
    </p>
    <p>
     good purposes, when her head devises liberal and Christlike things, when
    </p>
    <p>
     her hands are always open to the poor and always busy with acts of love
    </p>
    <p>
     and self-denial, and when her feet are ever eager to run upon errands of
    </p>
    <p>
     mercy, why, if there be anything worthy of being called Christian
    </p>
    <p>
     Perfection in this world of imperfection, I do not know why such an one
    </p>
    <p>
     does not possess it. What need of analyzing her experiences _in vacuo_
    </p>
    <p>
     to find out the state of her soul?
    </p>
    <p>
     How Miss Nancy managed to live on her slender income and be so generous
    </p>
    <p>
     was a perpetual source of perplexity to the gossips of Lewisburg. And
    </p>
    <p>
     now that she declared that Mrs. Thomson and Shocky should not return to
    </p>
    <p>
     the poor-house there was a general outcry from the whole Committee of
    </p>
    <p>
     Intermeddlers that she would bring herself to the poor-house before she
    </p>
    <p>
     died. But Nancy Sawyer was the richest woman in Lewisburg, though nobody
    </p>
    <p>
     knew it, and though she herself did not once suspect it.
    </p>
    <p>
     How Miss Nancy and the preacher conspired together, and how they managed
    </p>
    <p>
     to bring Mrs. Thomson's case up at the time of the "Sacramental Service"
    </p>
    <p>
     in the afternoon of that Sunday in Lewisburg, and how the preacher made
    </p>
    <p>
     a touching statement of it just before the regular "Collection for the
    </p>
    <p>
     Poor" was taken, and how the warm-hearted Methodists put in dollars
    </p>
    <p>
     instead of dimes while the Presiding Elder read those passages about
    </p>
    <p>
     Zaccheus and other liberal people, and how the congregation sang
    </p>
    <p>
     "He dies, the Friend of sinners dies"
    </p>
    <p>
     more lustily than ever, after having performed this Christian act--how
    </p>
    <p>
     all this happened I can not take up the reader's time to tell. But I can
    </p>
    <p>
     assure him that the nearly blind English woman did not room with
    </p>
    <p>
     blasphemous old Mowley any more, and that the blue-drilling pauper frock
    </p>
    <p>
     gave way to something better, and that grave little Shocky even danced
    </p>
    <p>
     with delight, and declared that God hadn't forgot, though he'd thought
    </p>
    <p>
     that He had. And Mrs. Matilda White remarked that it was a shame that
    </p>
    <p>
     the collection for the poor at a Methodist sacramental service should be
    </p>
    <p>
     given to a woman who was a member of the Church of England, and like as
    </p>
    <p>
     not never soundly converted!
    </p>
    <p>
     And Shocky slept in his mother's arms and prayed God not to forget
    </p>
    <p>
     Hannah, while Shocky's mother knit stockings for the store day and
    </p>
    <p>
     night, and day and night she prayed and hoped.

     CHAPTER XXV.
    </head>
    <p>
     BUD WOOING.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Sunday that Ralph spent in Lewisburg, the Sunday that Shocky spent
    </p>
    <p>
     in an earthly paradise, the Sunday that Mrs. Thomson spent with Shocky
    </p>
    <p>
     instead of old Mowley, the Sunday that Miss Nancy thought was "just like
    </p>
    <p>
     heaven," was also an eventful Sunday with Bud Means. He had long adored
    </p>
    <p>
     Miss Martha in his secret heart, but, like many other giants, while
    </p>
    <p>
     brave enough to face and fight dragons, he was a coward in the presence
    </p>
    <p>
     of the woman that he loved. Let us honor him for it. The man who loves a
    </p>
    <p>
     woman truly, reverences her profoundly and feels abashed in her
    </p>
    <p>
     presence. The man who is never abashed in the presence of womanhood, the
    </p>
    <p>
     man who tells his love without a tremor, is a shallow egotist. Bud's
    </p>
    <p>
     nature was not fine. But it was deep, true, and manly. To him Martha
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins was the chief of women. What was he that he should aspire to
    </p>
    <p>
     possess her? And yet on that Sunday, with his crippled arm carefully
    </p>
    <p>
     bound up, with his cleanest shirt, and with his heavy boots freshly
    </p>
    <p>
     oiled with the fat of the raccoon, he started hopefully through fields
    </p>
    <p>
     white with snow to the house of Squire Hawkins. When he started his
    </p>
    <p>
     spirits were high, but they descended exactly in proportion to his
    </p>
    <p>
     proximity to the object of his love. He thought himself not dressed well
    </p>
    <p>
     enough He wished his shoulders were not so square, and his arms not so
    </p>
    <p>
     stout. He wished that he had book-larnin' enough to court in nice, big
    </p>
    <p>
     words. And so, by recounting his own deficiencies, he succeeded in
    </p>
    <p>
     making himself feel weak, and awkward, and generally good-for-nothing,
    </p>
    <p>
     by the time he walked up between the rows of dead hollyhocks to the
    </p>
    <p>
     Squire's front door, to tap at which took all his remaining strength.
    </p>
    <p>
     Miss Martha received her perspiring lover most graciously, but this only
    </p>
    <p>
     convinced Bud more than ever that she was a superior being. If she had
    </p>
    <p>
     slighted him a bit, so as to awaken his combativeness, his bashfulness
    </p>
    <p>
     might have disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was in vain that Martha inquired about his arm and complimented his
    </p>
    <p>
     courage. Bud could only think of his big feet, his clumsy hands, and his
    </p>
    <p>
     slow tongue. He answered in monosyllables, using his red silk
    </p>
    <p>
     handkerchief diligently.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is your arm improving?" asked Miss Hawkins.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, I think it is," said Bud, hastily crossing his right leg over his
    </p>
    <p>
     left, and trying to get his fists out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have you heard from Mr. Pearson?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, I ha'n't," answered Bud, removing his right foot to the floor
    </p>
    <p>
     again, because it looked so big, and trying to push his left hand into
    </p>
    <p>
     his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Beautiful sunshine, isn't it?" said Martha.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, 'tis," answered Bud, sticking his right foot up on the rung of the
    </p>
    <p>
     chair and putting his right hand behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "This snow looks like the snow we have at the East," said Martha. "It
    </p>
    <p>
     snowed that way the time I was to Bosting."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Did it?" said Bud, not thinking of the snow at all nor of Boston, but
    </p>
    <p>
     thinking how much better he would have appeared had he left his arms and
    </p>
    <p>
     legs at home.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I suppose Mr. Hartsook rode your horse to Lewisburg?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, he did;" and Bud hung both hands at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You were very kind."
    </p>
    <p>
     This set Bud's heart a-going so that he could not say anything, but he
    </p>
    <p>
     looked eloquently at Miss Hawkins, drew both feet under the chair, and
    </p>
    <p>
     rammed his hands into his pockets. Then, suddenly remembering how
    </p>
    <p>
     awkward he must look, he immediately pulled his hands out again, and
    </p>
    <p>
     crossed his legs. There was a silence of a few minutes, during which Bud
    </p>
    <p>
     made up his mind to do the most desperate thing he could think of--to
    </p>
    <p>
     declare his love and take the consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You see, Miss Hawkins," he began, forgetting boots and fists in his
    </p>
    <p>
     agony, "I thought as how I'd come over here to-day, and"--but here his
    </p>
    <p>
     heart failed him utterly--"and--see--you."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm glad to see you, Mr. Means."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And I thought I'd tell you"--Martha was sure it was coming now, for Bud
    </p>
    <p>
     was in dead earnest--"and I thought I'd just like to tell you, ef I only
    </p>
    <p>
     know'd jest how to tell it right"--here Bud got frightened, and did not
    </p>
    <p>
     dare close the sentence as he had intended--"I thought as how you might
    </p>
    <p>
     like to know--or ruther I wanted to tell you--that--the--that I--that
    </p>
    <p>
     we--all of us--think--that--I--that we are going to have a
    </p>
    <p>
     spellin'-school a Chewsday night."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm real glad to hear it," said the bland but disappointed Martha. "We
    </p>
    <p>
     used to have spelling-schools at the East." But Miss Martha could not
    </p>
    <p>
     remember that they had them "to Bosting."
    </p>
    <p>
     Hard as it is for a bashful man to talk, it is still more difficult for
    </p>
    <p>
     him to close the conversation. Most men like to leave a favorable
    </p>
    <p>
     impression, and a bashful man is always waiting with the forlorn hope
    </p>
    <p>
     that some favorable turn in the talk may let him out without absolute
    </p>
    <p>
     discomfiture. And so Bud stayed a long time, and how he ever did get
    </p>
    <p>
     away he never could tell.

    <p>
     A LETTER AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.
    </p>
    <p>
     "SQUAR HAUKINS
    </p>
    <p>
     "this is too Lett u no that u beter be Keerful hoo yoo an yore familly
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
     so Tak kere. No mor ad pressnt."
    </p>
    <p>
     This letter accomplished its purpose. The Squire's spectacles slipped
    </p>
    <p>
     off several times while he read it. His wig had to be adjusted. If he
    </p>
    <p>
     had been threatened personally he would not have minded it so much. But
    </p>
    <p>
     the hay stacks were dearer to him than the apple of his glass eye. The
    </p>
    <p>
     barn was more precious than his wig. And those who hoped to touch Bud in
    </p>
    <p>
     a tender place through this letter knew the Squire's weakness far better
    </p>
    <p>
     than they knew the spelling-book. To see his new red barn with its large
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mormon" hay-press inside, and the mounted Indian on the vane,
    </p>
    <p>
     consumed, was too much for the Hawkins heart to stand. Evidently the
    </p>
    <p>
     danger was on the side of his niece. But how should he influence Martha
    </p>
    <p>
     to give up Bud? Martha did not value the hay-stacks half so highly as
    </p>
    <p>
     she did her lover. Martha did not think the new red barn, with the great
    </p>
    <p>
     Mormon press inside and the galloping Indian on the vane, worth half so
    </p>
    <p>
     much as a moral principle or a kind-hearted action. Martha, bless her!
    </p>
    <p>
     would have sacrificed anything rather than forsake the poor. But Squire
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins's lips shut tight over his false teeth in a way that suggested
    </p>
    <p>
     astringent purse-strings, and Squire Hawkins could not sleep at night if
    </p>
    <p>
     the new red barn, with the galloping Indian on the vane, were in danger.
    </p>
    <p>
     Martha must be reached somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, with many adjustings of that most adjustable wig? with many turnings
    </p>
    <p>
     of that reversible glass eye? the Squire managed to frighten Martha by
    </p>
    <p>
     the intimation that he had been threatened, and to make her understand,
    </p>
    <p>
     what it cost her much to understand, that she must turn the cold
    </p>
    <p>
     shoulder to chivalrous, awkward Bud, whom she loved most tenderly,
    </p>
    <p>
     partly, perhaps, because he did not remind her of anybody she had ever
    </p>
    <p>
     known at the East.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tuesday evening was the fatal time. Spelling-school was the fatal
    </p>
    <p>
     occasion. Bud was the victim. Pete Jones had his revenge. For Bud had
    </p>
    <p>
     been all the evening trying to muster courage enough to offer himself as
    </p>
    <p>
     Martha's escort. He was not encouraged by the fact that he had spelled
    </p>
    <p>
     even worse than usual, while Martha had distinguished herself by holding
    </p>
    <p>
     her ground against Jeems Phillips for half an hour. But he screwed his
    </p>
    <p>
     courage to the sticking place, not by quoting to himself the adage,
    </p>
    <p>
     "Faint heart never won fair lady," which, indeed, he had never heard,
    </p>
    <p>
     but by reminding himself that "ef you don't resk notin' you'll never git
    </p>
    <p>
     nothin'." So, when the spelling-school had adjourned, he sidled up to
    </p>
    <p>
     her, and, looking dreadfully solemn and a little foolish, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Kin I see you safe home?"
    </p>
    <p>
     And she, with a feeling that her uncle's life was in danger, and that
    </p>
    <p>
     his salvation depended upon her resolution--she, with a feeling that she
    </p>
    <p>
     was pronouncing sentence of death on her own great hope, answered
    </p>
    <p>
     huskily:
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, I thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
     If she had only known that it was the red barn with the Indian on top
    </p>
    <p>
     that was in danger, she would probably have let the galloping brave take
    </p>
    <p>
     care of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     It seemed to Bud, as he walked home mortified, disgraced, disappointed,
    </p>
    <p>
     hopeless, that all the world had gone down in a whirlpool of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Might a knowed it," he said to himself. "Of course, a smart gal like
    </p>
    <p>
     Martha a'n't agoin' to take a big, blunderin' fool that can't spell in
    </p>
    <p>
     two syllables. What's the use of tryin'? A Flat Cricker Is a Flat
    </p>
    <p>
     Cricker. You can't make nothin' else of him, no more nor you can make a
    </p>
    <p>
     Chiny hog into a Berkshire."

    <p>
     A LOSS AND A GAIN.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dr. Small, silent, attentive, assiduous Dr. Small, set himself to work
    </p>
    <p>
     to bind up the wounded heart of Bud Means, even as he had bound up his
    </p>
    <p>
     broken arm. The flattery of his fine eyes, which looked at Bud's muscles
    </p>
    <p>
     so admiringly, which gave attention to his lightest remark, was not lost
    </p>
    <p>
     on the young Flat Creek Hercules. Outwardly at least Pete Jones showed
    </p>
    <p>
     no inclination to revenge himself on Bud. Was it respect for muscle, or
    </p>
    <p>
     was it the influence of Small? At any rate, the concentrated extract of
    </p>
    <p>
     the resentment of Pete Jones and his clique was now ready to empty
    </p>
    <p>
     itself upon the head of Hartsook. And Ralph found himself in his dire
    </p>
    <p>
     extremity without even the support of Bud, whose good resolutions seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     to give way all at once. There have been many men of culture and more
    </p>
    <p>
     favorable surroundings who have thrown themselves away with less
    </p>
    <p>
     provocation. As it was, Bud quit school, avoided Ralph, and seemed more
    </p>
    <p>
     than ever under the influence of Dr. Small, besides becoming the
    </p>
    <p>
     intimate of Walter Johnson, Small's student and Mrs. Matilda White's
    </p>
    <p>
     son. They made a strange pair--Bud with his firm jaw and silent,
    </p>
    <p>
     cautious manner, and Walter Johnson with his weak chin, his nice
    </p>
    <p>
     neck-ties, and general dandy appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
     To be thus deserted in his darkest hour by his only friend was the
    </p>
    <p>
     bitterest ingredient in Ralph's cup. In vain he sought an interview. Bud
    </p>
    <p>
     always eluded him. While by all the faces about him Ralph learned that
    </p>
    <p>
     the storm was getting nearer and nearer to himself. It might delay. If
    </p>
    <p>
     it had been Pete Jones alone, it might blow over. But Ralph felt sure
    </p>
    <p>
     that the relentless hand of Dr. Small was present in all his troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
     And he had only to look into Small's eye to know how inextinguishable
    </p>
    <p>
     was a malignity that burned so steadily and so quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
     But there is no cup of unmixed bitterness. With an innocent man there is
    </p>
    <p>
     no night so dark that some star does not shine. Ralph had one strong
    </p>
    <p>
     sheet-anchor. On his return from Lewisburg on Monday Bud had handed him
    </p>
    <p>
     a note, written on common blue foolscap, in round, old-fashioned hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     It ran:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Dear Sir: Anybody who can do so good a thing as you did for our
    </p>
    <p>
     Shocky, can not be bad. I hope you will forgive me. All the
    </p>
    <p>
     appearances in the world, and all that anybody says, can not make
    </p>
    <p>
     me think you anything else but a good man. I hope God will reward
    </p>
    <p>
     you. You must not answer this, and you hadn't better see me again,
    </p>
    <p>
     or think any more of what you spoke about the other night. I shall
    </p>
    <p>
     be a slave for three years more, and then I must work for my mother
    </p>
    <p>
     and Shocky; but I felt so bad to think that I had spoken so hard to
    </p>
    <p>
     you, that I could not help writing this. Respectfully,
    </p>
    <p>
     "HANNAH THOMSON.
    </p>
    <p>
     "To MR. R. HARTSOOK, ESQ."
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph read it over and over. What else he did with it I shall not tell.
    </p>
    <p>
     You want to know whether he kissed it, and put it into his bosom. Many a
    </p>
    <p>
     man as intelligent and manly as Hartsook has done quite as foolish a
    </p>
    <p>
     thing as that. You have been a little silly perhaps--if it is silly--and
    </p>
    <p>
     you have acted in a sentimental sort of a way over such things. But it
    </p>
    <p>
     would never do for me to tell you what Ralph did. Whether he put the
    </p>
    <p>
     letter into his bosom or not, he put the words into his heart, and,
    </p>
    <p>
     metaphorically speaking, he shook that little blue billet, written on
    </p>
    <p>
     coarse foolscap paper--he shook that little letter full of confidence,
    </p>
    <p>
     in the face and eyes of all the calamities that haunted him. If Hannah
    </p>
    <p>
     believed in him, the whole world might distrust him. When Hannah was in
    </p>
    <p>
     one scale and the whole world in the other, of what account was the
    </p>
    <p>
     world? Justice may be blind, but all the pictures of blind cupids in the
    </p>
    <p>
     world can not make Love blind. And it was well that Ralph weighed things
    </p>
    <p>
     in this way. For the time was come in which he needed all the courage
    </p>
    <p>
     the blue billet could give him.

     CHAPTER XXVIII.

    <p>
     THE FLIGHT.
    </p>
    <p>
     About ten days after Ralph's return to Flat Creek things came to a
    </p>
    <p>
     crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
     The master was rather relieved at first to have the crisis come. He had
    </p>
    <p>
     been holding juvenile Flat Creek under his feet by sheer force of will.
    </p>
    <p>
     And such an exercise of "psychic power" is very exhausting. In racing on
    </p>
    <p>
     the Ohio the engineer sometimes sends the largest of the firemen to hold
    </p>
    <p>
     the safety valve down, and this he does by hanging himself to the lever
    </p>
    <p>
     by his hands. Ralph felt that he had been holding the safety-valve down,
    </p>
    <p>
     and that he was so weary of the operation that an explosion would be a
    </p>
    <p>
     real relief. He was a little tired of having everybody look on him as a
    </p>
    <p>
     thief. It was a little irksome to know that new bolts were put on the
    </p>
    <p>
     doors of the houses in which he had staid. And now that Shocky was gone,
    </p>
    <p>
     and Bud had turned against him, and Aunt Matilda suspected him, and even
    </p>
    <p>
     poor, weak, exquisite Walter Johnson would not associate with him, he
    </p>
    <p>
     felt himself an outlaw indeed. He would have gone away to Texas or the
    </p>
    <p>
     new gold fields in California had It not been for one thing. That
    </p>
    <p>
     letter on blue foolscap paper kept a little warmth in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     His course from school on the evening that something happened lay
    </p>
    <p>
     through the sugar-camp. Among the dark trunks of the maples, solemn and
    </p>
    <p>
     lofty pillars, he debated the case. To stay, or to flee? The worn nerves
    </p>
    <p>
     could not keep their present tension much longer.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was just by the brook, or, as they say in Indiana, the "branch[26],"
    </p>
    <p>
     that something happened which brought him to a sudden decision. Ralph
    </p>
    <p>
     never afterward could forget that brook. It was a swift-running little
    </p>
    <p>
     stream, that did not babble blatantly over the stones. It ran through a
    </p>
    <p>
     thicket of willows, through the sugar-camp, and out into Means's
    </p>
    <p>
     pasture. Ralph had just passed through the thicket, had just crossed the
    </p>
    <p>
     brook on the half-decayed log that spanned it, when, as he emerged from
    </p>
    <p>
     the water-willows on the other side, he started with a sudden shock. For
    </p>
    <p>
     there was Hannah, with a white, white face, holding out a little note
    </p>
    <p>
     folded like an old-fashioned thumb-paper.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Go quick!" she stammered as she slipped it Into Ralph's hand,
    </p>
    <p>
     inadvertently touching his fingers with her own--a touch that went
    </p>
    <p>
     tingling through the school-master's nerves. But she had hardly said the
    </p>
    <p>
     words until she was gone down the brookside path and over into the
    </p>
    <p>
     pasture. A few minutes afterward she drove the cows up into the lot and
    </p>
    <p>
     meekly took her scolding from Mrs. Means for being gone sech an awful
    </p>
    <p>
     long time, like a lazy, good-fer-nothin piece of goods that she was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph opened the thumb-paper note, written on a page torn from an old
    </p>
    <p>
     copy-book, in Bud's "hand-write" and running:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mr. Heartsook
    </p>
    <p>
     "deer Sur:
    </p>
    <p>
     "I Put in my best licks, taint no use. Run fer yore life. A plans on
    </p>
    <p>
     foot to tar an fether or wuss to-night. Go rite off. Things is awful
    </p>
    <p>
     juberous[27].
    </p>
    <p>
     "BUD."
    </p>
    <p>
     The first question with Ralph was whether he could depend on Bud. But he
    </p>
    <p>
     soon made up his mind that treachery of any sort was not one of his
    </p>
    <p>
     traits. He had mourned over the destruction of Bud's good resolutions by
    </p>
    <p>
     Martha Hawkins's refusal, and being a disinterested party he could have
    </p>
    <p>
     comforted Bud by explaining Martha's "mitten." But he felt sure that Bud
    </p>
    <p>
     was not treacherous. It was a relief, then, as he stood there to know
    </p>
    <p>
     that the false truce was over, and worst had come to worst.
    </p>
    <p>
     His first impulse was to stay and fight. But his nerves were not strong
    </p>
    <p>
     enough to execute so foolhardy a resolution. He seemed to see a man
    </p>
    <p>
     behind every maple-trunk. Darkness was fast coming on, and he knew that
    </p>
    <p>
     his absence from supper at his boarding-place could not fail to excite
    </p>
    <p>
     suspicion. There was no time to be lost. So he started.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once run from a danger, and panic is apt to ensue. The forest; the
    </p>
    <p>
     stalk-fields, the dark hollows through which he passed, seemed to be
    </p>
    <p>
     peopled with terrors. He knew Small and Jones well enough to know that
    </p>
    <p>
     every avenue of escape would be carefully picketed. So there was nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     to do but to take the shortest path to the old trysting place, the
    </p>
    <p>
     Spring-in-rock.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here he sat and shook with terror. Angry with himself, he inly denounced
    </p>
    <p>
     himself for a coward. But the effect was really a physical one. The
    </p>
    <p>
     chill and panic now were the reaction from the previous strain.
    </p>
    <p>
     For when the sound of his pursuers' voices broke upon his ears early in
    </p>
    <p>
     the evening, Ralph shook no more; the warm blood set back again toward
    </p>
    <p>
     the extremities, and his self-control returned when he needed it. He
    </p>
    <p>
     gathered some stones about him, as the only weapons of defense at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     The mob was on the cliff above. But he thought that he heard footsteps
    </p>
    <p>
     in the bed of the creek below. If this were so, there could be no doubt
    </p>
    <p>
     that his hiding-place was suspected.
    </p>
    <p>
     "O Hank!" shouted Bud from the top of the cliff to some one in the creek
    </p>
    <p>
     below, "be sure to look at the Spring-in-rock--I think he's there."
    </p>
    <p>
     This hint was not lost on Ralph, who speedily changed his quarters by
    </p>
    <p>
     climbing up to a secluded, shelf-like ledge above the spring. He was
    </p>
    <p>
     none too soon, for Pete Jones and Hank Banta were soon looking all
    </p>
    <p>
     around the spring for him, while he held a twenty-pound stone over
    </p>
    <p>
     their heads ready to drop upon them in case they should think of looking
    </p>
    <p>
     on the ledge above.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the crowd were gone Ralph knew that one road was open to him. He
    </p>
    <p>
     could follow down the creek to Clifty, and thence he might escape. But,
    </p>
    <p>
     traveling down to Clifty, he debated whether it was best to escape. To
    </p>
    <p>
     flee was to confess his guilt, to make himself an outlaw, to put an
    </p>
    <p>
     insurmountable barrier between himself and Hannah, whose terror-stricken
    </p>
    <p>
     and anxious face as she stood by the brook-willows haunted him now, and
    </p>
    <p>
     was an involuntary witness to her love.
    </p>
    <p>
     Long before he reached Clifty his mind was made up not to flee another
    </p>
    <p>
     mile. He knocked at the door of Squire Underwood. But Squire Underwood
    </p>
    <p>
     was also a doctor, and had been called away. He knocked at the door of
    </p>
    <p>
     Squire Doolittle. But Squire Doolittle had gone to Lewisburg. He was
    </p>
    <p>
     about to give up all hope of being able to surrender himself to the law
    </p>
    <p>
     when he met Squire Hawkins, who had come over to Clifty to avoid
    </p>
    <p>
     responsibility for the ill-deeds of his neighbors which he was powerless
    </p>
    <p>
     to prevent.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is that you, Mr. Hartsook?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, and I want you to arrest me and try me here in Clifty."
    </p>

     FOOTNOTES:
    </p>
    <p>
     [Footnote 26: I have already mentioned the absence of _pail_ and _pare_
    </p>
    <p>
     from the ancient Hoosier folk-speech. _Brook_ is likewise absent. The
    </p>
    <p>
     illiterate Indiana countryman before the Civil War, let us say, had no
    </p>
    <p>
     pails, pared no apples, husked no corn, crossed no brooks. The same is
    </p>
    <p>
     true, I believe, of the South generally. As the first settlers on the
    </p>
    <p>
     Southern coast entered the land by the rivers, each smaller stream was
    </p>
    <p>
     regarded as a branch of the larger one. A small stream was therefore
    </p>
    <p>
     called a _branch_. The word brook was probably lost in the first
    </p>
    <p>
     generation. But a small stream is often called a _run_ in the Middle and
    </p>
    <p>
     Southern belt. Halliwell gives _rundel_ as used with the same
    </p>
    <p>
     signification in England, and he gives _ryn_ in the same sense from an
    </p>
    <p>
     old manuscript.]
    </p>
    <p>
     [Footnote 27: _Juberous_ is in none of the vocabularies that I have
    </p>
    <p>
     seen. I once treated this word in print as an undoubted corruption of
    </p>
    <p>
     _dubious_, and when used subjectively it apparently feels the influence
    </p>
    <p>
     of dubious, as where one says: "I feel mighty juberous about it." But it
    </p>
    <p>
     is much oftener applied as in the text to the object of fear, as "The
    </p>
    <p>
     bridge looks kind o' juberous." Halliwell gives the verb _juberd_ and
    </p>
    <p>
     defines it as "to jeopard or endanger." It is clearly a dialect form of
    </p>
    <p>
     _jeopard_, and I make no doubt that _juberous_ is a dialect variation of
    </p>
    <p>
     _jeopardous_, occasionally used as a form of _dubious_.]

     THE TRIAL.
    </p>
    <p>
     The "prosecuting attorney" (for so the State's attorney is called in
    </p>
    <p>
     Indiana) had been sent for the night before. Ralph refused all legal
    </p>
    <p>
     help. It was not wise to reject counsel, but all his blood was up, and
    </p>
    <p>
     he declared that he would not be cleared by legal quibbles. If his
    </p>
    <p>
     innocence were not made evident to everybody, he would rather not be
    </p>
    <p>
     acquitted on a preliminary examination. He would go over to the circuit
    </p>
    <p>
     court and have the matter sifted to the bottom. But he would have been
    </p>
    <p>
     pleased had his uncle offered his counsel, though he would have declined
    </p>
    <p>
     it. He would have felt better to have had a letter from home somewhat
    </p>
    <p>
     different from the one he received from his Aunt Matilda by the hand of
    </p>
    <p>
     the prosecuting attorney. It was not very encouraging or very
    </p>
    <p>
     sympathetic, though it was very characteristic.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Dear Ralph:
    </p>
    <p>
     "This is what I have always been afraid of. I warned you faithfully the
    </p>
    <p>
     last time I saw you. My skirts are clear of your blood, I can not
    </p>
    <p>
     consent for your uncle to appear as your counsel or to go your bail. You
    </p>
    <p>
     know how much it would injure him in the county, and he has no right to
    </p>
    <p>
     suffer for your evil acts. O my dear nephew! for the sake of your poor,
    </p>
    <p>
     dead mother--"
    </p>
    <p>
     We never shall know what the rest of that letter was. Whenever Aunt
    </p>
    <p>
     Matilda got to Ralph's poor, dead mother in her conversation Ralph ran
    </p>
    <p>
     out of the house. And now that his poor, dead mother was again made to
    </p>
    <p>
     do service in his aunt's pious rhetoric, he landed the letter on the hot
    </p>
    <p>
     coals before him, and watched it vanish into smoke with a grim
    </p>
    <p>
     satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph was a little afraid of a mob. But Clifty was better than Flat
    </p>
    <p>
     Creek, and Squire Hawkins, with all his faults, loved justice, and had a
    </p>
    <p>
     profound respect for the majesty of the law, and a profound respect for
    </p>
    <p>
     his own majesty when sitting as a court representing the law. Whatever
    </p>
    <p>
     maneuvers he might resort to in business affairs in order to avoid a
    </p>
    <p>
     conflict with his lawless neighbors, he was courageous and inflexible on
    </p>
    <p>
     the bench. The Squire was the better part of him. With the co-operation
    </p>
    <p>
     of the constable, he had organized a _posse_ of men who could be
    </p>
    <p>
     depended on to enforce the law against a mob.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time the trial opened in the large school-house in Clifty at
    </p>
    <p>
     eleven o'clock, all the surrounding country had emptied its population
    </p>
    <p>
     into Clifty, and all Flat Creek was on hand ready to testify to
    </p>
    <p>
     something. Those who knew the least appeared to know the most, and were
    </p>
    <p>
     prodigal of their significant winks and nods. Mrs. Means had always
    </p>
    <p>
     suspected him. She seed some mighty suspicious things about him from the
    </p>
    <p>
     word go. She'd allers had her doubts whether he was jist the thing, and
    </p>
    <p>
     ef her ole man had axed her, liker-n not he never'd a been hired. She'd
    </p>
    <p>
     seed things with her own livin' eyes that beat all she ever seed in all
    </p>
    <p>
     her born days. And Pete Jones said he'd allers knowed ther warn't no
    </p>
    <p>
     good in sech a feller. Couldn't stay abed when he got there. And Granny
    </p>
    <p>
     Sanders said, Law's sakes! nobody'd ever a found him out ef it hadn't
    </p>
    <p>
     been fer her. Didn't she go all over the neighborhood a-warnin' people?
    </p>
    <p>
     Fer her part, she seed straight through that piece of goods. He was fond
    </p>
    <p>
     of the gals, too! Nothing was so great a crime in her eyes as to be fond
    </p>
    <p>
     of the gals.
    </p>
    <p>
     The constable paid unwitting tribute to William the Conquerer by crying
    </p>
    <p>
     Squire Hawkins's court open with an Oyez! or, as he said, "O yes!" and
    </p>
    <p>
     the Squire asked Squire Underwood, who came in at that minute, to sit
    </p>
    <p>
     with him. From the start, it was evident to Ralph that the prosecuting
    </p>
    <p>
     attorney had been thoroughly posted by Small, though, looking at that
    </p>
    <p>
     worthy's face, one would have thought him the most disinterested and
    </p>
    <p>
     philosophical spectator in the court-room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bronson, the prosecutor, was a young man, and this was his first case
    </p>
    <p>
     since his election. He was very ambitious to distinguish himself, very
    </p>
    <p>
     anxious to have Flat Creek influence on his side in politics; and,
    </p>
    <p>
     consequently, he was very determined to send Ralph Hartsook to State
    </p>
    <p>
     prison, justly or unjustly, by fair means or foul. To his professional
    </p>
    <p>
     eyes this was not a question of right and wrong, not a question of life
    </p>
    <p>
     or death to such a man as Ralph. It was George H. Bronson's opportunity
    </p>
    <p>
     to distinguish himself. And so, with many knowing and confident nods and
    </p>
    <p>
     hints, and with much deference to the two squires, he opened the case,
    </p>
    <p>
     affecting great indignation at Ralph's wickedness, and uttering Delphic
    </p>
    <p>
     hints about striped pants and shaven head, and the grating of
    </p>
    <p>
     prison-doors at Jeffersonville.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And, now, if the court please, I am about to call a witness whose
    </p>
    <p>
     testimony is very important indeed. Mrs. Sarah Jane Means will please
    </p>
    <p>
     step forward and be sworn."
    </p>
    <p>
     This Mrs. Means did with alacrity. She had met the prosecutor, and
    </p>
    <p>
     impressed him with her dark hints. She was sworn.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now, Mrs. Means, have the goodness to tell us what you know of the
    </p>
    <p>
     robbery at the house of Peter Schroeder, and the part defendant had in
    </p>
    <p>
     it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, you see, I allers suspected that air young man--"
    </p>
    <p>
     Here Squire Underwood stopped her, and told her that she must not tell
    </p>
    <p>
     her suspicions, but facts.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, it's facts I am a-going to tell," she sniffed indignantly. "It's
    </p>
    <p>
     facts that I mean to tell." Here her voice rose to a keen pitch, and she
    </p>
    <p>
     began to abuse the defendant. Again and again the court insisted that
    </p>
    <p>
     she must tell what there was suspicious about the school-master. At last
    </p>
    <p>
     she got it out.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, fer one thing, what kind of gals did he go with? Hey? Why, with
    </p>
    <p>
     my bound gal, Hanner, a-loafin' along through the blue-grass paster at
    </p>
    <p>
     ten o'clock, and keepin' that gal that's got no protector but me out
    </p>
    <p>
     that a-way, and destroyin' her character by his company, that a'n't fit
    </p>
    <p>
     fer nobody."
    </p>
    <p>
     Here Bronson saw that he had caught a tartar. He said he had no more
    </p>
    <p>
     questions to ask of Mrs. Means, and that, unless the defendant wished to
    </p>
    <p>
     cross-question her, she could stand aside. Ralph said he would like to
    </p>
    <p>
     ask her one question.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Did I ever go with your daughter Miranda?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, you didn't," answered the witness, with a tone and a toss of the
    </p>
    <p>
     head that let the cat out, and set the court-room in a giggle. Bronson
    </p>
    <p>
     saw that he was gaining nothing, and now resolved to follow the line
    </p>
    <p>
     which Small had indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pete Jones was called, and swore point-blank that he heard Ralph go out
    </p>
    <p>
     of the house soon after he went to bed, and that he heard him return at
    </p>
    <p>
     two in the morning. This testimony was given without hesitation, and
    </p>
    <p>
     made a great impression against Ralph in the minds of the justices. Mrs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jones, a poor, brow-beaten woman, came on the stand in a frightened way,
    </p>
    <p>
     and swore to the same lies as her husband. Ralph cross-questioned her,
    </p>
    <p>
     but her part had been well learned.
    </p>
    <p>
     There, seemed now little hope for Ralph. But just at this moment who
    </p>
    <p>
     should stride into the school-house but Pearson, the one-legged old
    </p>
    <p>
     soldier basket-maker? He had crept home the night before, "to see ef the
    </p>
    <p>
     ole woman didn't want somethin'," and hearing of Ralph's arrest, he
    </p>
    <p>
     concluded that the time for him to make "a forrard movement" had come,
    </p>
    <p>
     and so he determined to face the foe.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Looky here, Squar," he said, wiping the perspiration from his brow,
    </p>
    <p>
     "looky here. I jes want to say that I kin tell as much about this case
    </p>
    <p>
     as anybody."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Let us hear it, then," said Bronson, who thought he would nail Ralph
    </p>
    <p>
     now for certain.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, with many allusions to the time he fit at Lundy's Lane, and some
    </p>
    <p>
     indignant remarks about the pack of thieves that driv him off, and a
    </p>
    <p>
     passing tribute to Miss Martha Hawkins, and sundry other digressions, in
    </p>
    <p>
     which he had to be checked, the old man told how he'd drunk whisky at
    </p>
    <p>
     Welch's store that night, and how Welch's whisky was all-fired mean, and
    </p>
    <p>
     how it allers went straight to his head, and how he had got a leetle too
    </p>
    <p>
     much, and how he had felt kyinder gin aout by the time he got to the
    </p>
    <p>
     blacksmith's shop, and how he had laid down to rest, and how as he
    </p>
    <p>
     s'posed the boys had crated him, and how he thought it war all-fired
    </p>
    <p>
     mean to crate a old soldier what fit the Britishers, and lost his leg by
    </p>
    <p>
     one of the blamed critters a-punchin' his bagonet[28] through it; and
    </p>
    <p>
     how when he woke up it was all-fired cold, and how he rolled off the
    </p>
    <p>
     crate and went on to_wurds_ home, and how when he got up to the top of
    </p>
    <p>
     Means's hill he met Pete Jones and Bill Jones, and a slim sort of a
    </p>
    <p>
     young man, a-ridin'; and how he know'd the Joneses by ther hosses, and
    </p>
    <p>
     some more things of that kyind about 'em; but he didn't know the slim
    </p>
    <p>
     young man, tho' he tho't he might tell him ef he seed him agin kase he
    </p>
    <p>
     was dressed up so slick and town-like. But blamed ef he didn't think it
    </p>
    <p>
     hard that a passel o thieves sech as the Joneses should try to put ther
    </p>
    <p>
     mean things on to a man like the master, that was so kyind to him and to
    </p>
    <p>
     Shocky, tho', fer that matter, blamed ef he didn't think we was all
    </p>
    <p>
     selfish, akordin' to his tell. Had seed somebody that night a-crossin'
    </p>
    <p>
     over the blue-grass paster. Didn't know who in thunder 'twas, but it was
    </p>
    <p>
     somebody a-makin' straight fer Pete Jones's. Hadn't seed nobody else,
    </p>
    <p>
     'ceptin' Dr. Small, a short ways behind the Joneses.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hannah was now brought on the stand. She was greatly agitated, and
    </p>
    <p>
     answered with much reluctance. Lived at Mr. Means's. Was eighteen years
    </p>
    <p>
     of age in October. Had been bound to Mrs. Means three years ago. Had
    </p>
    <p>
     walked home with Mr. Hartsook that evening, and, happening to look out
    </p>
    <p>
     of the window toward morning, she saw some one cross the pasture. Did
    </p>
    <p>
     not know who it was. Thought it was Mr. Hartsook. Here Mr. Bronson
    </p>
    <p>
     (evidently prompted by a suggestion that came from what Small had
    </p>
    <p>
     overheard when he listened in the barn) asked her if Mr. Hartsook had
    </p>
    <p>
     ever said anything to her about the matter afterward. After some
    </p>
    <p>
     hesitation, Hannah said that he had said that he crossed the pasture. Of
    </p>
    <p>
     his own accord? No, she spoke of it first. Had Mr. Hartsook offered any
    </p>
    <p>
     explanations? No, he hadn't. Had he ever paid her any attention
    </p>
    <p>
     afterward? No. Ralph declined to cross-question Hannah. To him she never
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed so fair as when telling the truth so sublimely.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bronson now informed the court that this little trick of having the old
    </p>
    <p>
     soldier happen in, in the flick of time, wouldn't save the prisoner at
    </p>
    <p>
     the bar from the just punishment which an outraged law visited upon such
    </p>
    <p>
     crimes as his. He regretted that his duty as a public prosecutor caused
    </p>
    <p>
     it to fall to his lot to marshal the evidence that was to blight the
    </p>
    <p>
     prospects and blast the character, and annihilate for ever, so able and
    </p>
    <p>
     promising a young man, but that the law knew no difference between the
    </p>
    <p>
     educated and the uneducated, and that for his part he thought Hartsook a
    </p>
    <p>
     most dangerous foe to the peace of society. The evidence already given
    </p>
    <p>
     fastened suspicion upon him. The prisoner had not yet been able to break
    </p>
    <p>
     its force at all. The prisoner had not even dared to try to explain to
    </p>
    <p>
     a young lady the reason for his being out at night. He would now
    </p>
    <p>
     conclude by giving the last touch to the dark evidence that would sink
    </p>
    <p>
     the once fair name of Ralph Hartsook in a hundred fathoms of infamy. He
    </p>
    <p>
     would ask that Henry Banta be called.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hank came forward sheepishly, and was sworn. Lived about a hundred yards
    </p>
    <p>
     from the house that was robbed. He seen ole man Pearson and the master
    </p>
    <p>
     and one other feller that he didn't know come away from there together
    </p>
    <p>
     about one o'clock. He heerd the horses kickin', and went out to the
    </p>
    <p>
     stable to see about them. He seed two men come out of Schroeder's back
    </p>
    <p>
     door and meet one man standing at the gate. When they got closter he
    </p>
    <p>
     knowed Pearson by his wooden leg and the master by his hat. On
    </p>
    <p>
     cross-examination he was a little confused when asked why he hadn't told
    </p>
    <p>
     of it before, but said that he was afraid to say much, bekase the folks
    </p>
    <p>
     was a-talkin' about hanging the master, and he didn't want no lynchin'.
    </p>
    <p>
     The prosecution here rested, Bronson maintaining that there was enough
    </p>
    <p>
     evidence to justify Ralph's committal to await trial. But the court
    </p>
    <p>
     thought that as the defendant had no counsel and offered no rebutting
    </p>
    <p>
     testimony, it would be only fair to hear what the prisoner had to say
    </p>
    <p>
     in his own defense.
    </p>
    <p>
     All this while poor Ralph was looking about the room for Bud. Bud's
    </p>
    <p>
     actions had of late been strangely contradictory. But had he turned
    </p>
    <p>
     coward and deserted his friend? Why else did he avoid the session of the
    </p>
    <p>
     court? After asking himself such questions as these, Ralph would wonder
    </p>
    <p>
     at his own folly. What could Bud do if he were there? There was no human
    </p>
    <p>
     power that could prevent the victim of so vile a conspiracy as this,
    </p>
    <p>
     lodging in that worst of State prisons at Jeffersonville, a place too
    </p>
    <p>
     bad for criminals. But when there is no human power to help, how
    </p>
    <p>
     naturally does the human mind look for some divine intervention on the
    </p>
    <p>
     side of Right! And Ralph's faith in Providence looked in the direction
    </p>
    <p>
     of Bud. But since no Bud came, he shut down the valves and rose to his
    </p>
    <p>
     feet, proudly, defiantly, fiercely calm.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's of no use for me to say anything. Peter Jones has sworn to a
    </p>
    <p>
     deliberate falsehood, and he knows it. He has made his wife perjure her
    </p>
    <p>
     poor soul that she dare not call her own." Here Pete's fists clenched,
    </p>
    <p>
     but Ralph in his present humor did not care for mobs. The spirit of the
    </p>
    <p>
     bulldog had complete possession of him. "It is of no use for me to tell
    </p>
    <p>
     you that Henry Banta has sworn to a lie, partly to revenge himself on
    </p>
    <p>
     me for punishments I have given him, and partly, perhaps, for money. The
    </p>
    <p>
     real thieves are in this court-room. I could put my finger on them."
    </p>
    <p>
     "_To_ be sure," responded the old basket-maker. Ralph looked at Pete
    </p>
    <p>
     Jones, then at Small. The fiercely calm look attracted the attention of
    </p>
    <p>
     the people. He knew that this look would probably cost him his life
    </p>
    <p>
     before the next morning. But he did not care for life. "The testimony of
    </p>
    <p>
     Miss Hannah Thomson is every word true, I believe that of Mr. Pearson to
    </p>
    <p>
     be true. The rest is false. But I can not prove it. I know the men I
    </p>
    <p>
     have to deal with. I shall not escape with State prison. They will not
    </p>
    <p>
     spare my life. But the people of Clifty will one day find out who are
    </p>
    <p>
     the thieves." Ralph then proceeded to tell how he had left Pete Jones's,
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Jones's bed being uncomfortable; how he had walked through the
    </p>
    <p>
     pasture; how he had seen three men on horseback: how he had noticed the
    </p>
    <p>
     sorrel with the white left forefoot and white nose; how he had seen Dr.
    </p>
    <p>
     Small; how, after his return, he had heard some one enter the house, and
    </p>
    <p>
     how he had recognized the horse the next morning. "There," said Ralph
    </p>
    <p>
     desperately, leveling his finger at Pete, "there is a man who will yet
    </p>
    <p>
     see the inside of a penitentiary, I shall not live to see it, but the
    </p>
    <p>
     rest of you will." Pete quailed. Ralph's speech could not of course
    </p>
    <p>
     break the force of the testimony against him. But it had its effect, and
    </p>
    <p>
     it had effect enough to alarm Bronson, who rose and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     "I should like to ask the prisoner at the bar one question."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ask me a dozen," said Hartsook, looking more like a king than a
    </p>
    <p>
     criminal.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, then, Mr. Hartsook. You need not answer unless you choose; but
    </p>
    <p>
     what prompted you to take the direction you did in your walk on that
    </p>
    <p>
     evening?"
    </p>
    <p>
     This shot brought Ralph down. To answer this question truly would attach
    </p>
    <p>
     to friendless Hannah Thomson some of the disgrace that now belonged to
    </p>
    <p>
     him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I decline to answer," said Ralph.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of course, I do not want the prisoner to criminate himself," said
    </p>
    <p>
     Bronson significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
     During this last passage Bud had come in, but, to Ralph's disappointment
    </p>
    <p>
     he remained near the door, talking to Walter Johnson, who had come with
    </p>
    <p>
     him. The magistrates put their heads together to fix the amount of bail,
    </p>
    <p>
     and, as they differed, talked for some minutes. Small now for the first
    </p>
    <p>
     time thought best to make a move in his own proper person. He could
    </p>
    <p>
     hardly have been afraid of Ralph's acquittal. He may have been a little
    </p>
    <p>
     anxious at the manner in which he had been mentioned, and at the
    </p>
    <p>
     significant look of Ralph, and he probably meant to excite indignation
    </p>
    <p>
     enough against the school-master to break the force of his speech, and
    </p>
    <p>
     secure the lynching of the prisoner, chiefly by people outside his gang.
    </p>
    <p>
     He rose and asked the court in gentlest tones to hear him. He had no
    </p>
    <p>
     personal interest in this trial, except his interest in the welfare of
    </p>
    <p>
     his old schoolmate, Mr. Hartsook. He was grieved and disappointed to
    </p>
    <p>
     find the evidence against him so damaging and he would not for the world
    </p>
    <p>
     add a feather to it, if it were not that his own name had been twice
    </p>
    <p>
     alluded to by the defendant, and by his friend, and perhaps his
    </p>
    <p>
     confederate, John Pearson. He was prepared to swear that he was not over
    </p>
    <p>
     in Flat Creek the night of the robbery later than ten o'clock, and while
    </p>
    <p>
     the statements of the two persons alluded to, whether maliciously
    </p>
    <p>
     intended or not, could not implicate him at all, he thought perhaps this
    </p>
    <p>
     lack of veracity in their statements might be of weight in determining
    </p>
    <p>
     some other points. He therefore suggested--he could only suggest, as he
    </p>
    <p>
     was not a party to the case in any way--that his student, Mr. Walter
    </p>
    <p>
     Johnson, be called to testify as to his--Dr. Small's--exact whereabouts
    </p>
    <p>
     on the night in question. They were together in his office until two,
    </p>
    <p>
     when he went to the tavern and went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Squire Hawkins, having adjusted his teeth, his wig, and his glass eye,
    </p>
    <p>
     thanked Dr. Small for a suggestion so valuable, and thought best to put
    </p>
    <p>
     John Pearson under arrest before proceeding further. Mr. Pearson was
    </p>
    <p>
     therefore arrested, and was heard to mutter something about a "passel of
    </p>
    <p>
     thieves," when the court warned him to be quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Walter Johnson was then called. But before giving his testimony, I must
    </p>
    <p>
     crave the reader's patience while I go back to some things which
    </p>
    <p>
     happened nearly a week before and which will serve to make it
    </p>
    <p>
     intelligible.

     CHAPTER XXX.
    </head>
    <p>
     "BROTHER SODOM."
    </p>
    <p>
     In order to explain Walter Johnson's testimony and his state of mind, I
    </p>
    <p>
     must carry the reader back nearly a week. The scene was Dr. Small's
    </p>
    <p>
     office. Bud and Walter Johnson had been having some confidential
    </p>
    <p>
     conversation that evening, and Bud had got more out of his companion
    </p>
    <p>
     than that exquisite but weak young man had intended. He looked round in
    </p>
    <p>
     a frightened way.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You see," said Walter, "if Small knew I had told you that, I'd get a
    </p>
    <p>
     bullet some night from somebody. But when you're initiated it'll be all
    </p>
    <p>
     right. Sometimes I wish I was out of it. But, you know, Small's this
    </p>
    <p>
     kind of a man. He sees through you. He can look through a door"--and
    </p>
    <p>
     there he shivered, and his voice broke down into a whisper. But Bud was
    </p>
    <p>
     perfectly cool, and doubtless it was the strong coolness of Bud that
    </p>
    <p>
     made Walter, who shuddered at a shadow, come to him for sympathy and
    </p>
    <p>
     unbosom himself of one of his guilty secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Let's go and hear Brother Sodom preach to-night," said Bud.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, I don't like to."
    </p>
    <p>
     "He don't scare you?" There was just a touch of ridicule in Bud's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     He knew Walter, and he had not counted amiss when he used this little
    </p>
    <p>
     goad to prick a skin so sensitive. "Brother Sodom" was the nickname
    </p>
    <p>
     given by scoffers to the preacher--Mr. Soden--whose manner of preaching
    </p>
    <p>
     had so aroused Bud's combativeness, and whose saddle-stirrups Bud had
    </p>
    <p>
     helped to amputate. For reasons of his own, Bud thought best to subject
    </p>
    <p>
     young Johnson to the heat of Mr. Soden's furnace.
    </p>
    <p>
     Peter Cartwright boasts that, on a certain occasion, he "shook his
    </p>
    <p>
     brimstone wallet" over the people. Mr. Soden could never preach without
    </p>
    <p>
     his brimstone wallet. There are those of refinement so attenuated that
    </p>
    <p>
     they will not admit that fear can have any place in religion. But a
    </p>
    <p>
     religion without fear could never have evangelized or civilized the
    </p>
    <p>
     West, which at one time bade fair to become a perdition as bad as any
    </p>
    <p>
     that Brother Sodom ever depicted. And against these on the one side, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the Brother Sodoms on the other, I shall interrupt my story to put this
    </p>
    <p>
     chapter under shelter of that wise remark of the great Dr. Adam Clark,
    </p>
    <p>
     who says "The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom, the terror of God
    </p>
    <p>
     confounds the soul;" and that other saying of his: "With the _fear_ of
    </p>
    <p>
     God the love of God is ever consistent; but where the _terror_ of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Lord reigns, there can neither be _fear, faith_, nor _love_; nay, nor
    </p>
    <p>
     _hope_ either." And yet I am not sure that even the Brother Sodoms were
    </p>
    <p>
     made in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
     On this evening Mr. Soden was as terrible as usual. Bud heard him
    </p>
    <p>
     without flinching. Small, who sat farther forward, listened with pious
    </p>
    <p>
     approval. Mr. Soden, out of distorted figures pieced together from
    </p>
    <p>
     different passages of Scripture, built a hell, not quite, Miltonic, nor
    </p>
    <p>
     yet Dantean, but as Miltonic and Dantean as his unrefined imagination
    </p>
    <p>
     could make it. As he rose toward his climax of hideous description,
    </p>
    <p>
     Walter Johnson trembled from head to foot and sat close to Bud. Then, as
    </p>
    <p>
     burly Mr. Soden, with great gusto, depicted materialistic tortures that
    </p>
    <p>
     startled the nerves of everybody except Bud, Walter wanted to leave, but
    </p>
    <p>
     Bud would not let him. For some reason he wished to keep his companion
    </p>
    <p>
     in the crucible as long as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Young man!" cried Mr. Soden, and the explosive voice seemed to come
    </p>
    <p>
     from the hell that he had created--"young man! you who have followed the
    </p>
    <p>
     counsel of evil companions"--here he paused and looked about, as if
    </p>
    <p>
     trying to find the man he wanted, while Walter crept up close to Bud
    </p>
    <p>
     and shaded his face--"I mean you who have chosen evil pursuits and who
    </p>
    <p>
     can not get free from bad habits and associations that are dragging you
    </p>
    <p>
     down to hell! You are standing on the very crumbling brink of hell
    </p>
    <p>
     to-night. The smell of the brimstone is on your garments; the hot breath
    </p>
    <p>
     of hell is in your face! The devils are waiting for you! Delay and you
    </p>
    <p>
     are damned! You may die before daylight! You may never get out that
    </p>
    <p>
     door! The awful angel of death is just ready to strike you down!" Here
    </p>
    <p>
     some shrieked with terror, others sobbed, and Brother Sodom looked with
    </p>
    <p>
     approval on the storm he had awakened. The very harshness of his tone,
    </p>
    <p>
     his lofty egotism of manner, that which had roused all Bud's
    </p>
    <p>
     combativeness, shook poor Walter as a wind would shake a reed. In the
    </p>
    <p>
     midst of the general excitement he seized his hat and hastened out the
    </p>
    <p>
     door. Bud followed, while Soden shot his lightnings after them,
    </p>
    <p>
     declaring that "young men who ran away from the truth would dwell in
    </p>
    <p>
     torments forever."
    </p>
    <p>
     Bud had not counted amiss when he thought that Mr. Soden's preaching
    </p>
    <p>
     would be likely to arouse so mean-spirited a fellow as Walter. So vivid
    </p>
    <p>
     was the impression that Johnson begged Bud to return to the office with
    </p>
    <p>
     him. He felt sick, and was afraid that he should die before morning. He
    </p>
    <p>
     insisted that Bud should stay with him all night. To this Means readily
    </p>
    <p>
     consented, and by morning he had heard all that the frightened Walter
    </p>
    <p>
     had to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
     And now let us return to the trial, where Ralph sits waiting the
    </p>
    <p>
     testimony of Walter Johnson, which is to prove his statement false.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">

     CHAPTER XXXI.
    </head>
    <p>
     THE TRIAL CONCLUDED.
    </p>
    <p>
     I do not know how much interest the "gentle reader" may feel in Bud. But
    </p>
    <p>
     I venture to hope that there are some Buddhists among my readers who
    </p>
    <p>
     will wish the contradictoriness of his actions explained. The first dash
    </p>
    <p>
     of disappointment had well-nigh upset him. And when a man concludes to
    </p>
    <p>
     throw overboard his good resolutions, he always seeks to avoid the
    </p>
    <p>
     witness of those resolutions. Hence Bud, after that distressful Tuesday
    </p>
    <p>
     evening on which Miss Martha had given him "the sack," wished to see
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph less than any one else. And yet when he came to suspect Small's
    </p>
    <p>
     villainy, his whole nature revolted at it. But having broken with Ralph,
    </p>
    <p>
     he thought it best to maintain an attitude of apparent hostility, that
    </p>
    <p>
     he might act as a detective, and, perhaps, save his friend from the
    </p>
    <p>
     mischief that threatened him. As soon as he heard of Ralph's arrest he
    </p>
    <p>
     determined to make Walter Johnson tell his own secret in court, because
    </p>
    <p>
     he knew that it would be best for Ralph that Walter should tell it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bud's telling at second-hand would not be conclusive. And he sincerely
    </p>
    <p>
     desired to save Walter from prison. For Walter Johnson was the victim of
    </p>
    <p>
     Dr. Small, or of Dr. Small and such novels as "The Pirate's Bride,"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Claude Duval," "The Wild Rover of the West Indies," and the cheap
    </p>
    <p>
     biographies of such men as Murrell. Small found him with his imagination
    </p>
    <p>
     inflamed by the history of such heroes, and opened to him the path to
    </p>
    <p>
     glory for which he longed.
    </p>
    <p>
     The whole morning after Ralph's arrest Bud was working on Walter's
    </p>
    <p>
     conscience and his fears. The poor fellow, unable to act for himself,
    </p>
    <p>
     was torn asunder between the old ascendency of Small and the new
    </p>
    <p>
     ascendency of Bud Means. Bud finally frightened him, by the fear of the
    </p>
    <p>
     penitentiary, into going to the place of trial. But once inside the
    </p>
    <p>
     door, and once in sight of Small, who was more to him than God, or,
    </p>
    <p>
     rather, more to him than the devil--for the devil was Walter's God, or,
    </p>
    <p>
     perhaps, I should say, Walter's God was a devil--once in sight of Small,
    </p>
    <p>
     he refused to move an inch farther. And Bud, after all his perseverance,
    </p>
    <p>
     was about to give up in sheer despair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fortunately, just at that moment Small's desire to relieve himself from
    </p>
    <p>
     the taint of suspicion and to crush Ralph as completely as possible,
    </p>
    <p>
     made him overshoot the mark by asking that Walter be called to the
    </p>
    <p>
     stand, as we have before recounted. He knew that he had no tool so
    </p>
    <p>
     supple as the cowardly Walter. In the very language of the request, he
    </p>
    <p>
     had given Walter an intimation of what he wanted him to swear to. Walter
    </p>
    <p>
     listened to Small's words as to his doom. He felt that he should die of
    </p>
    <p>
     indecision. The perdition of a man of his stamp is to have to make up
    </p>
    <p>
     his mind. Such men generally fall back on some one more positive, and
    </p>
    <p>
     take all their resolutions ready-made. But here Walter must decide for
    </p>
    <p>
     himself. For the constable was already calling his name; the court, the
    </p>
    <p>
     spectators, and, most of all, Dr. Small, were waiting for him. He moved
    </p>
    <p>
     forward mechanically through the dense crowd, Bud following part of the
    </p>
    <p>
     way to whisper, "Tell the truth or go to penitentiary." Walter shook and
    </p>
    <p>
     shivered at this. The witness with difficulty held up his hand long
    </p>
    <p>
     enough to be sworn.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Please tell the court," said Bronson, "whether you know anything of the
    </p>
    <p>
     whereabouts of Dr. Small on the night of the robbery at Peter
    </p>
    <p>
     Schroeder's."
    </p>
    <p>
     Small had detected Walter's agitation, and, taking alarm, had edged his
    </p>
    <p>
     way around so as to stand full in Walter's sight, and there, with keen,
    </p>
    <p>
     magnetic eye on the weak orbs of the young man, he was able to assume
    </p>
    <p>
     his old position, and sway the fellow absolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
     "On the night of the robbery"--Walter's voice was weak, but he seemed to
    </p>
    <p>
     be reading his answer out of Small's eyes--"on the night of the robbery
    </p>
    <p>
     Dr. Small came home before--" here the witness stopped and shook and
    </p>
    <p>
     shivered again. For Bud, detecting the effect of Small's gaze, had
    </p>
    <p>
     pushed his great hulk in front of Small, and had fastened his eyes on
    </p>
    <p>
     Walter with a look that said, "Tell the truth or go to penitentiary."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I can't, I can't. O God! What shall I do?" the witness exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
     answering the look of Bud. For it seemed to him that Bud had spoken. To
    </p>
    <p>
     the people and the court this agitation was inexplicable. Squire
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins's wig got awry, his glass eye turned in toward his nose, and he
    </p>
    <p>
     had great difficulty in keeping his teeth from falling out. The
    </p>
    <p>
     excitement became painfully intense. Ralph was on his feet, looking at
    </p>
    <p>
     the witness, and feeling that somehow Bud and Dr. Small--his good angel
    </p>
    <p>
     and his demon--were playing an awful game, or which he was the stake.
    </p>
    <p>
     The crowd swayed to and fro, but remained utterly silent, waiting to
    </p>
    <p>
     hear the least whisper from the witness, who stood trembling a moment
    </p>
    <p>
     with his hands over his face, and then fainted.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fainting of a person in a crowd is a signal for everybody else to
    </p>
    <p>
     make fools of themselves. There was a rush toward the fainting man,
    </p>
    <p>
     there was a cry for water. Everybody asked everybody else to open the
    </p>
    <p>
     window, and everybody wished everybody else to stand back and give him
    </p>
    <p>
     air. But nobody opened the window, and nobody stood back. The only
    </p>
    <p>
     perfectly cool man in the room was Small. With a quiet air of
    </p>
    <p>
     professional authority he pushed forward and felt the patient's pulse,
    </p>
    <p>
     remarking to the court that he thought it was a sudden attack of fever
    </p>
    <p>
     with delirium. When Walter revived, Dr. Small would have removed him,
    </p>
    <p>
     but Ralph insisted that his testimony should be heard. Under pretense of
    </p>
    <p>
     watching his patient, Small kept close to him. And Walter began the same
    </p>
    <p>
     old story about Dr. Small's having arrived at the office before eleven
    </p>
    <p>
     o'clock, when Bud came up behind the doctor and fastened his eyes on the
    </p>
    <p>
     witness with the same significant look, and Walter, with visions of the
    </p>
    <p>
     penitentiary before him halted, stammered, and seemed about to faint
    </p>
    <p>
     again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If the court please," said Bronson, "this witness is evidently
    </p>
    <p>
     intimidated by that stout young man," pointing to Bud. "I have seen him
    </p>
    <p>
     twice interrupt witness's testimony by casting threatening looks at
    </p>
    <p>
     him, I trust the court will have him removed from the court-room."
    </p>
    <p>
     After a few moments' consultation, during which Squire Hawkins held his
    </p>
    <p>
     wig in place with one hand and alternately adjusted his eye and his
    </p>
    <p>
     spectacles with the other, the magistrates, who were utterly bewildered
    </p>
    <p>
     by the turn things were taking, decided that It could do no harm, and
    </p>
    <p>
     that it was best to try the experiment of removing Bud. Perhaps Johnson
    </p>
    <p>
     would then be able to get through with his testimony. The constable
    </p>
    <p>
     therefore asked Bud if he would please leave the room. Bud cast one last
    </p>
    <p>
     look at the witness and walked out like a captive bear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph stood watching the receding form of Bud. The emergency had made
    </p>
    <p>
     him as cool as Small ever was. Bud stopped at the door, where he was
    </p>
    <p>
     completely out of sight of the witness, concealed by the excited
    </p>
    <p>
     spectators, who stood on the benches to see what was going on in front.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The witness will please proceed," said Bronson.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If the court please"--it was Ralph who spoke--"I believe I have as much
    </p>
    <p>
     at stake in this trial as any one. That witness is evidently
    </p>
    <p>
     intimidated. But not by Mr. Means. I ask that Dr. Small be removed out
    </p>
    <p>
     of sight of the witness."
    </p>
    <p>
     "A most extraordinary request, truly." This was what Small's bland
    </p>
    <p>
     countenance said; he did not open his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's no more than fair," said Squire Hawkins, adjusting his wig, "that
    </p>
    <p>
     the witness be relieved of everything that anybody might think affects
    </p>
    <p>
     his veracity in this matter."
    </p>
    <p>
     Dr. Small, giving Walter one friendly, appealing look, moved back by the
    </p>
    <p>
     door, and stood alongside Bud, as meek, quiet, and disinterested as any
    </p>
    <p>
     man in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The witness will now proceed with his testimony." This time it was
    </p>
    <p>
     Squire Hawkins who spoke. Bronson had been attacked with a suspicion
    </p>
    <p>
     that this witness was not just what he wanted, and had relapsed into
    </p>
    <p>
     silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Walter's struggle was by no means ended by the disappearance of Small
    </p>
    <p>
     and Bud. There came the recollection of his mother's stern face--a face
    </p>
    <p>
     which had never been a motive toward the right, but only a goad to
    </p>
    <p>
     deception. What would she say if he should confess? Just as he had
    </p>
    <p>
     recovered himself, and was about to repeat the old lie which had twice
    </p>
    <p>
     died upon his lips at the sight of Bud's look, he caught sight of
    </p>
    <p>
     another face, which made him tremble again. It was the lofty and
    </p>
    <p>
     terrible countenance of Mr. Soden. One might have thought, from the
    </p>
    <p>
     expression it wore, that the seven last vials were in his hands, the
    </p>
    <p>
     seven apocalyptic trumpets waiting for his lips, and the seven thunders
    </p>
    <p>
     sitting upon his eyebrows. The moment that Walter saw him he smelled the
    </p>
    <p>
     brimstone on his own garments, he felt himself upon the crumbling brink
    </p>
    <p>
     of the precipice, with perdition below him. Now I am sure that "Brother
    </p>
    <p>
     Sodoms" were not made wholly in vain. There are plenty of mean-spirited
    </p>
    <p>
     men like Walter Johnson, whose feeble consciences need all the support
    </p>
    <p>
     they can get from the fear of perdition, and who are incapable of any
    </p>
    <p>
     other conception of it than a coarse and materialistic ones Let us set
    </p>
    <p>
     it down to the credit of Brother Sodom, with his stiff stock, his
    </p>
    <p>
     thunderous face, and his awful walk, that his influence over Walter was
    </p>
    <p>
     on the side of truth.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Please proceed," said Squire Hawkins to Walter. The Squire's wig lay on
    </p>
    <p>
     one side, he had forgotten to adjust his eye, and he leaned forward,
    </p>
    <p>
     tremulous with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, then," said Walter, looking not at the court nor at Bronson nor
    </p>
    <p>
     at the prisoner, but furtively at Mr. Soden--"well, then, if I
    </p>
    <p>
     must"--and Mr. Soden's awful face seemed to answer that he surely
    </p>
    <p>
     must--"well, then, I hope you won't send me to prison"--this to Squire
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins, whose face reassured him--"but, oh! I don't see how I can!"
    </p>
    <p>
     But one look at Mr. Soden assured him that he could and that he must,
    </p>
    <p>
     and so, with an agony painful to the spectators, he told the story in
    </p>
    <p>
     driblets. How, while yet in Lewisburg, he had been made a member of a
    </p>
    <p>
     gang of which Small was chief; how they concealed from him the names of
    </p>
    <p>
     all the band except six, of whom the Joneses and Small were three.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here there was a scuffle at the door. The court demanded silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Dr. Small's trying to git out, plague take him," said Bud, who stood
    </p>
    <p>
     with his back planted against the door. "I'd like the court to send and
    </p>
    <p>
     git his trunk afore he has a chance to burn up all the papers that's in
    </p>
    <p>
     it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Constable, you will arrest Dr. Small, Peter Jones, and William Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
     Send two deputies to bring Small's trunk into court," said Squire
    </p>
    <p>
     Underwood.
    </p>
    <p>
     The prosecuting attorney was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
     Walter then told of the robbery at Schroeder's, told where he and Small
    </p>
    <p>
     had whittled the fence while the Joneses entered the house, and
    </p>
    <p>
     confirmed Ralph's story by telling how they had seen Ralph in a
    </p>
    <p>
     fence-corner, and how they had met the basket-maker on the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
     "_To_ be sure," said the old man, who had not ventured to hold up his
    </p>
    <p>
     head, after he was arrested, until Walter began his testimony.
    </p>
    <p>
     Walter felt inclined to stop, but he could not do it, for there stood
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Soden, looking to him like a messenger from the skies, or the
    </p>
    <p>
     bottomless pit, sent to extort the last word from his guilty soul He
    </p>
    <p>
     felt that he was making a clean breast of it--at the risk of perdition,
    </p>
    <p>
     with the penitentiary thrown in, if he faltered. And so he told the
    </p>
    <p>
     whole thing as though it had been the day of doom, and by the time he
    </p>
    <p>
     was through, Small's trunk was in court.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here a new hubbub took place at the door. It was none other than the
    </p>
    <p>
     crazy pauper, Tom Bifield, who personated General Andrew Jackson in the
    </p>
    <p>
     poor-house. He had caught some inkling of the trial, and had escaped in
    </p>
    <p>
     Bill Jones's absence. His red plume was flying, and in his tattered and
    </p>
    <p>
     filthy garb he was indeed a picturesque figure.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Squar," said he, elbowing his way through the crowd, "I kin tell you
    </p>
    <p>
     sornethin'. I'm Gineral Andrew Jackson. Lost my head at Bueny Visty.
    </p>
    <p>
     This head growed on. It a'n't good fer much. One side's tater. But
    </p>
    <p>
     t'other's sound as a nut. Now, I kind give you information."
    </p>
    <p>
     Bronson, with the quick perceptions of a politician, had begun to see
    </p>
    <p>
     which way future winds would probably blow. "If the court please," he
    </p>
    <p>
     said, "this man is not wholly sane, but we might get valuable
    </p>
    <p>
     information out of him. I suggest that his testimony be taken for what
    </p>
    <p>
     it is worth."
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, you don't swar me," broke in the lunatic. "Not if I knows myself.
    </p>
    <p>
     You see, when a feller's got one side of his head tater, he's mighty
    </p>
    <p>
     onsartain like. You don't swar me, fer I can't tell what minute the
    </p>
    <p>
     tater side'll begin to talk. I'm talkin' out of the lef' side now, and
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm all right. But you don't swar me. But ef you'll send some of your
    </p>
    <p>
     constables out to the barn at the pore-house and look under the hay-mow
    </p>
    <p>
     in the north-east corner, you'll find some things maybe as has been
    </p>
    <p>
     a-missin' fer some time. And that a'n't out of the tater side, nuther."
    </p>
    <p>
     Meantime Bud did not rest. Hearing the nature of the testimony given by
    </p>
    <p>
     Hank Banta before he entered, he attacked Hank and vowed he'd send him
    </p>
    <p>
     to prison if he didn't make a clean breast. Hank was a thorough coward,
    </p>
    <p>
     and, now that his friends were prisoners, was ready enough to tell the
    </p>
    <p>
     truth if he could be protected from prosecution. Seeing the disposition
    </p>
    <p>
     of the prosecuting attorney, Bud got from him a promise that he would do
    </p>
    <p>
     what he could to protect Hank. That worthy then took the stand,
    </p>
    <p>
     confessed his lie, and even told the inducement which Mr. Pete Jones
    </p>
    <p>
     had offered him to perjure himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     "_To_ be sure," said Pearson.
    </p>
    <p>
     Squire Hawkins, turning his right eye upon him, while the left looked at
    </p>
    <p>
     the ceiling, said: "Be careful, Mr. Pearson, or I shall have to punish
    </p>
    <p>
     you for contempt."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, Squar, I didn't know 'twas any sin to hev a healthy contemp' fer
    </p>
    <p>
     sech a thief as Jones!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The Squire looked at Mr. Pearson severely, and the latter, feeling that
    </p>
    <p>
     he had committed some offense without knowing it, subsided into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bronson now had a keen sense of the direction of the gale.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If the court please," said he, "I have tried to do my duty in this
    </p>
    <p>
     case. It was my duty to prosecute Mr. Hartsook, however much I might
    </p>
    <p>
     feel assured that he was innocent, and that he would be able to prove
    </p>
    <p>
     his innocence. I now enter a _nolle_ in his case and that of John
    </p>
    <p>
     Pearson, and I ask that this court adjourn until to-morrow, in order to
    </p>
    <p>
     give me time to examine the evidence in the case of the other parties
    </p>
    <p>
     under arrest. I am proud to think that my efforts have been the means of
    </p>
    <p>
     sifting the matter to the bottom, of freeing Mr. Hartsook from
    </p>
    <p>
     suspicion, and of detecting the real criminals."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ugh!" said Mr. Pearson, who conceived a great dislike to Bronson.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The court," said Squire Hawkins, "congratulates Mr. Hartsook on his
    </p>
    <p>
     triumphant acquittal. He is discharged from the bar of this court, and
    </p>
    <p>
     from the bar of public sentiment, without a suspicion of guilt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Constable, discharge Ralph Hartsook and John Pearson."
    </p>
    <p>
     Old Jack Means, who had always had a warm side for the master, now
    </p>
    <p>
     proposed three cheers for Mr. Hartsook, and they were given with a will
    </p>
    <p>
     by the people who would have hanged him an hour before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mrs. Means gave it as her opinion that "Jack Means allers wuz a fool!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "This court," said Dr. Underwood, "has one other duty to perform before
    </p>
    <p>
     adjourning for the day. Recall Hannah Thomson."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I jist started her on ahead to git supper and milk the cows," said Mrs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Means. "A'n't a-goin' to have her loafin' here all day."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Constable, recall her. This court can not adjourn until she returns!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Hannah had gone but a little way, and was soon in the presence of the
    </p>
    <p>
     court, trembling for fear of some new calamity.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hannah Thomson"--it was Squire Underwood who spoke--"Hannah Thomson,
    </p>
    <p>
     this court wishes to ask you one or two questions."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, sir," but her voice died to a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
     "How old did you say you were?
    </p>
    <p>
     "Eighteen, sir, last October."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can you prove your age?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, sir--by my mother."
    </p>
    <p>
     "For how long are you bound to Mr. Means?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Till I'm twenty-one."
    </p>
    <p>
     "This court feels in duty bound to inform you that, according to the
    </p>
    <p>
     laws of Indiana, a woman is of age at eighteen, and as no indenture
    </p>
    <p>
     could be made binding after you had reached your majority, you are the
    </p>
    <p>
     victim of a deception. You are free, and if it can be proven that you
    </p>
    <p>
     have been defrauded by a willful deception, a suit for damages will
    </p>
    <p>
     lie."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ugh!" said Mrs. Means. "You're a purty court, a'n't you, Dr.
    </p>
    <p>
     Underwood?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Be careful, Mrs. Means, or I shall have to fine you for contempt of
    </p>
    <p>
     court."
    </p>
    <p>
     But the people, who were in the cheering humor, cheered Hannah and the
    </p>
    <p>
     justices, and then cheered Ralph again. Granny Sanders shook hands with
    </p>
    <p>
     him, and allers knowed he'd come out right. It allers 'peared like as if
    </p>
    <p>
     Dr. Small warn't jist the sort to tie to, you know. And old John Pearson
    </p>
    <p>
     went home, after drinking two or three glasses of Welch's whisky,
    </p>
    <p>
     keeping time to an imaginary triumphal march, and feeling prouder than
    </p>
    <p>
     he had ever felt since he fit the Britishers under Scott at Lundy's
    </p>
    <p>
     Lane. He told his wife that the master had jist knocked the hind-sights
    </p>
    <p>
     offen that air young lawyer from Lewisburg.
    </p>
    <p>
     Walter was held to bail that he might appear as a witness, and Ralph
    </p>
    <p>
     might have sent his aunt a Roland for an Oliver. But he only sent a note
    </p>
    <p>
     to his uncle, asking him to go Walter's bail. If he had been resentful,
    </p>
    <p>
     he could not have wished for a more complete revenge than the day had
    </p>
    <p>
     brought.

    <p>
     AFTER THE BATTLE.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nothing can be more demoralizing in the long run than lynch law. And yet
    </p>
    <p>
     lynch law often originates in a burst of generous indignation which is
    </p>
    <p>
     not willing to suffer a bold oppressor to escape by means of corrupt and
    </p>
    <p>
     cowardly courts. It is oftener born of fear. Both motives powerfully
    </p>
    <p>
     agitated the people of the region round about Clifty as night drew on
    </p>
    <p>
     after Ralph's acquittal. They were justly indignant that Ralph had been
    </p>
    <p>
     made the victim of such a conspiracy, and they were frightened at the
    </p>
    <p>
     unseen danger to the community from such a band as that of Small's. It
    </p>
    <p>
     was certain that they did not know the full extent of the danger as yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     And what Small might do with a jury, or what Pete Jones might do with a
    </p>
    <p>
     sheriff, was a question. I must not detain the reader to tell how the
    </p>
    <p>
     mob rose. Nobody knows how such things come about. Their origin is as
    </p>
    <p>
     inexplicable as that of an earthquake. But, at any rate, a rope was
    </p>
    <p>
     twice put round Small's neck during that night, and both times Small
    </p>
    <p>
     was saved only by the nerve and address of Ralph, who had learned how
    </p>
    <p>
     unjust mob law may be. As for Small, he neither trembled when they were
    </p>
    <p>
     ready to hang him, nor looked relieved when he was saved, nor showed the
    </p>
    <p>
     slightest flush of penitence or gratitude. He bore himself in a quiet,
    </p>
    <p>
     gentlemanly way throughout, like the admirable villain that he was.
    </p>
    <p>
     He waived a preliminary examination the next day; his father went his
    </p>
    <p>
     bail, and he forfeited bail and disappeared from the county and from the
    </p>
    <p>
     horizon of my story. Two reports concerning Small have been in
    </p>
    <p>
     circulation--one that he was running a faro-bank in San Francisco, the
    </p>
    <p>
     other that he was curing consumption in New York by some quack process.
    </p>
    <p>
     If this latter were true, it would leave it an open question whether
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph did well to save him from the gallows. Pete Jones and Bill, as
    </p>
    <p>
     usually happens to the rougher villains, went to prison, and when their
    </p>
    <p>
     terms had expired moved to Pike County, Missouri.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it is about Hannah that you wish to hear, and that I wish to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
     She went straight from the court room to Flat Creek, climbed to her
    </p>
    <p>
     chamber, packed in a handkerchief all her earthly goods, consisting
    </p>
    <p>
     chiefly of a few family relics, and turned her back on the house of
    </p>
    <p>
     Means forever. At the gate she met the old woman, who shook her fist in
    </p>
    <p>
     the girl's face and gave her a parting benediction in the words: "You
    </p>
    <p>
     mis'able, ongrateful critter you, go 'long. I'm glad to be shed of you!"
    </p>
    <p>
     At the barn she met Bud, and he told her good-by with a little huskiness
    </p>
    <p>
     in his voice, while a tear glistened in her eyes. Bud had been a friend
    </p>
    <p>
     in need, and such a friend one does not leave without a pang.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where are you going? Can I--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, no!" And with that she hastened on, afraid that Bud would offer to
    </p>
    <p>
     hitch up the roan colt. And she did not want to add to his domestic
    </p>
    <p>
     unhappiness by compromising him in that way.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was dusk and was raining when she left. The hours were long, the road
    </p>
    <p>
     was lonely, and after the revelations of that day it did not seem wholly
    </p>
    <p>
     safe. But from the moment that she found herself free, her heart had
    </p>
    <p>
     been ready to break with an impatient homesickness. What though there
    </p>
    <p>
     might be robbers in the woods? What though there were ten rough miles to
    </p>
    <p>
     travel? What though the rain was in her face? What though she had not
    </p>
    <p>
     tasted food since the morning of that exciting day? Flat Creek and
    </p>
    <p>
     bondage were behind; freedom, mother, Shocky, and home were before her,
    </p>
    <p>
     and her feet grew lighter with the thought. And if she needed any other
    </p>
    <p>
     joy, it was to know that the master was clear. And he would come? And
    </p>
    <p>
     so she traversed the weary distance, and so she inquired and found the
    </p>
    <p>
     house, the beautiful, homely old house of beautiful, homely old Nancy
    </p>
    <p>
     Sawyer, and knocked, and was admitted, and fell down, faint and weary,
    </p>
    <p>
     at her blind mother's feet, and laid her tired head in her mother's lap
    </p>
    <p>
     and wept and wept like a child, and said, "O mother! I'm free! I'm
    </p>
    <p>
     free!" while the mother's tears baptized her face, and the mother's
    </p>
    <p>
     trembling fingers combed out her tresses. And Shocky stood by her and
    </p>
    <p>
     cried: "I knowed God wouldn't forget you, Hanner!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Hannah was ready now to do anything by which she could support her
    </p>
    <p>
     mother and Shocky. She was strong, and inured to toil. She was willing
    </p>
    <p>
     and cheerful, and she would gladly have gone to service if by that means
    </p>
    <p>
     she could have supported the family. And, for that matter her mother was
    </p>
    <p>
     already able nearly to support herself by her knitting. But Hannah had
    </p>
    <p>
     been carefully educated when young, and at that moment the old public
    </p>
    <p>
     schools were being organized into a graded school, and the good
    </p>
    <p>
     minister, who shall be nameless, because he is, perhaps, still
    </p>
    <p>
     living in Indiana, and who in Methodist parlance was called "the
    </p>
    <p>
     preacher-in-charge of Lewisburg Station"--this good minister and Miss
    </p>
    <p>
     Nancy Sawyer got Hannah a place as teacher in the primary department.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then a little house with four rooms was rented, and a little, a very
    </p>
    <p>
     little furniture was put into it, and the old sweet home was established
    </p>
    <p>
     again. The father was gone, never to come back again. But the rest were
    </p>
    <p>
     here. And somehow Hannah kept waiting for somebody else to come.

     CHAPTER XXXIII.
    </head>
    <p>
     INTO THE LIGHT.
    </p>
    <p>
     For two weeks longer Ralph taught at the Flat Creek school-house. He was
    </p>
    <p>
     everybody's hero. And he was Bud's idol. He did what he could to get Bud
    </p>
    <p>
     and Martha together, and though Bud always "saw her safe home" after
    </p>
    <p>
     this, and called on her every Sunday evening, yet, to save his life, he
    </p>
    <p>
     could not forget his big fists and his big feet long enough to say what
    </p>
    <p>
     he most wanted to say, and what Martha most wanted him to say.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the end of two weeks Ralph found himself exceedingly weary of Flat
    </p>
    <p>
     Creek, and exceedingly glad to hear from Mr. Means that the school-money
    </p>
    <p>
     had "gin out." It gave him a good excuse to return to Lewisburg, where
    </p>
    <p>
     his heart and his treasure were. A certain sense of delicacy had kept
    </p>
    <p>
     him from writing to Hannah just yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     When he got to Lewisburg he had good news. His uncle, ashamed of his
    </p>
    <p>
     previous neglect, and perhaps with an eye to his nephew's growing
    </p>
    <p>
     popularity, had got him the charge of the grammar department in the new
    </p>
    <p>
     graded school in the village. So he quietly arranged to board at a
    </p>
    <p>
     boarding-house. His aunt could not have him about, of which fact he was
    </p>
    <p>
     very glad. She could not but feel, she said, that he might have taken
    </p>
    <p>
     better care of Walter than he did, when they were only four miles apart.
    </p>
    <p>
     He did not hasten to call on Hannah. Why should he? He sent her a
    </p>
    <p>
     message, of no consequence in itself, by Nancy Sawyer. Then he took
    </p>
    <p>
     possession of his school; and then, on the evening of the first day of
    </p>
    <p>
     school, he went, as he had appointed to himself, to see Hannah Thomson.
    </p>
    <p>
     And she, with some sweet presentiment, had got things ready by fixing up
    </p>
    <p>
     the scantily-furnished room as well as she could. And Miss Nancy Sawyer,
    </p>
    <p>
     who had seen Ralph that afternoon, had guessed that he was going to see
    </p>
    <p>
     Hannah. It's wonderful how much enjoyment a generous heart can get out
    </p>
    <p>
     of the happiness of others. Is not that what He meant when he said of
    </p>
    <p>
     such as Miss Sawyer that they should have a hundred-fold in this life
    </p>
    <p>
     for all their sacrifices? Did not Miss Nancy enjoy a hundred weddings
    </p>
    <p>
     and have the love of five hundred children? And so Miss Nancy just
    </p>
    <p>
     happened over at Mrs. Thomson's humble home, and, just in the most
    </p>
    <p>
     matter-of-course way, asked that lady and Shocky to come over to her
    </p>
    <p>
     house. Shocky wanted Hannah to come too. But Hannah blushed a little,
    </p>
    <p>
     and said that she would rather not.
    </p>
    <p>
     And when she was left alone, Hannah fixed her hair two or three times,
    </p>
    <p>
     and swept the hearth, and moved the chairs first one way and then
    </p>
    <p>
     another, and did a good many other needless things. Needless: for a
    </p>
    <p>
     lover, if he be a lover, does not see furniture or dress.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then she sat down by the fire, and tried to sew, and tried to look
    </p>
    <p>
     unconcerned, and tried to feel unconcerned, and tried not to expect
    </p>
    <p>
     anybody, and tried to make her heart keep still. And tried in vain. For
    </p>
    <p>
     a gentle rap at the door sent her pulse up twenty beats a minute and
    </p>
    <p>
     made her face burn. And Hartsook was for the first time, abashed in the
    </p>
    <p>
     presence of Hannah. For the oppressed girl had, in two weeks, blossomed
    </p>
    <p>
     out into the full-blown woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Ralph sat down by the fire, and talked of his school and her school,
    </p>
    <p>
     and everything else but what he wanted to talk about. And then the
    </p>
    <p>
     conversation drifted back to Flat Creek, and to the walk through the
    </p>
    <p>
     pasture, and to the box-elder tree, and to the painful talk in the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Hannah begged to be forgiven, and Ralph laughed at the idea that she
    </p>
    <p>
     had done anything wrong. And she praised his goodness to Shocky, and he
    </p>
    <p>
     drew her little note out of--But I agreed not tell you where he kept it.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then she blushed, and he told how the note had sustained him, and
    </p>
    <p>
     how her white face kept up his courage in his flight down the bed of
    </p>
    <p>
     Clifty Creek. And he sat a little nearer, to show her the note that he
    </p>
    <p>
     had carried in his bosom--I have told it! And--but I must not proceed. A
    </p>
    <p>
     love-scene, ever so beautiful in itself, will not bear telling. And so I
    </p>
    <p>
     shall leave a little gap just here, which you may fill up as you please.
    </p>
    <p>
     . . . Somehow, they never knew how, they got to talking about the future
    </p>
    <p>
     instead of the past, after that, and to planning their two lives as one
    </p>
    <p>
     life. And . . . And when Miss Nancy and Mrs. Thomson returned later in
    </p>
    <p>
     the evening, Ralph was standing by the mantel-piece, but Shocky noticed
    </p>
    <p>
     that his chair was close to Hannah's. And good Miss Nancy Sawyer looked
    </p>
    <p>
     in Hannah's face and was happy.

     CHAPTER XXXIV.

    <p>
     "HOW IT CAME OUT"
    </p>
    <p>
     We are all children in reading stories. We want more than all else to
    </p>
    <p>
     know how it all came out at the end, and, if our taste is not perverted,
    </p>
    <p>
     we like it to come out well. For my part, ever since I began to write
    </p>
    <p>
     this story, I have been anxious to know how it was going to come out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, there were very few invited. It took place at ten in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     The "preacher-in-charge" came, of course. Miss Nancy Sawyer was there.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Ralph's uncle was away, and Aunt Matilda had a sore throat and
    </p>
    <p>
     couldn't come. Perhaps the memory of the fact that she had refused Mrs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thomson, the pauper, a bed for two nights, affected her throat. But Miss
    </p>
    <p>
     Nancy and her sister were there, and the preacher. And that was all,
    </p>
    <p>
     besides the family, and Bud and Martha. Of course Bud and Martha came.
    </p>
    <p>
     And driving Martha to a wedding in a "jumper" was the one opportunity
    </p>
    <p>
     Bud needed. His hands were busy, his big boots were out of sight, and it
    </p>
    <p>
     was so easy to slip from Ralph's love affair to his own, that Bud
    </p>
    <p>
     somehow, in pulling Martha Hawkins's shawl about her, stammered out half
    </p>
    <p>
     a proposal, which Martha, generous soul, took for the whole ceremony,
    </p>
    <p>
     and accepted. And Bud was so happy that Ralph guessed from his face and
    </p>
    <p>
     voice that the agony was over, and Bud was betrothed at last to the
    </p>
    <p>
     "gal as was a gal."
    </p>
    <p>
     And after Ralph and Hannah were married--there was no trip, Ralph only
    </p>
    <p>
     changed his boarding-place and became head of the house at Mrs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thomson's thereafter--after it was all over, Bud came to Mr. Hartsook,
    </p>
    <p>
     and, snickering just a little, said as how as him and Martha had fixed
    </p>
    <p>
     it all up, and now they wanted to ax his advice; and Martha proud but
    </p>
    <p>
     blushing, came up and nodded assent. Bud said as how as he hadn't got no
    </p>
    <p>
     book-larnin' nor nothin', and as how as he wanted to be somethin', and
    </p>
    <p>
     put in his best licks fer Him, you know'. And that Marthy, she was of
    </p>
    <p>
     the same way of thinkin', and that was a blessin'. And the Squire was
    </p>
    <p>
     a-goin' to marry agin', and Marthy would ruther vacate. And his mother
    </p>
    <p>
     and Mirandy was sech as he wouldn't take no wife to. And he thought as
    </p>
    <p>
     how Mr. Hartsook might think of some way or some place where he and
    </p>
    <p>
     Marthy mout make a livin' fer the present, and put in their best licks
    </p>
    <p>
     fer Him, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph thought a moment. He was about to make an allusion to Hercules and
    </p>
    <p>
     the Augean stables, but he remembered that Bud would not understand it,
    </p>
    <p>
     though it might remind Martha of something she had seen at the East, the
    </p>
    <p>
     time she was to Bosting.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bud, my dear friend," said Ralph, "it looks a little hard to ask you to
    </p>
    <p>
     take a new wife"--here Bud looked admiringly at Martha--"to the
    </p>
    <p>
     poor-house. But I don't know anywhere where you can do so much good for
    </p>
    <p>
     Christ as by taking charge of that place, and I can get the appointment
    </p>
    <p>
     for you. The new commissioners want just such a man."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What d'ye say, Marthy?" said Bud.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, somebody ought to do for the poor, and I should like to do it."
    </p>
    <p>
     And so Hercules cleaned the Augean stables.
    </p>
    <p>
     And so my humble, homely Hoosier story of twenty years ago[29] draws to
    </p>
    <p>
     a close, and not without regret I take leave of Ralph and Hannah; and
    </p>
    <p>
     Shocky, and Bud, and Martha, and Miss Nancy, and of my readers.
    </p>
