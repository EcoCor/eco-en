     A PRIVATE LESSON FROM A BULLDOG.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_80">
     "Want to be a school-master, do you? You? Well, what would _you_ do in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_90">
     Flat Crick deestrick, _I'd_ like to know? Why, the boys have driv off
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_100">
     the last two, and licked the one afore them like blazes. You might teach
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_110">
     a summer school, when nothin' but children come. But I 'low it takes a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_120">
     right smart _man_ to be school-master in Flat Crick in the winter.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_130">
     They'd pitch you out of doors, sonny, neck and heels, afore Christmas."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_150">
     The young man, who had walked ten miles to get the school in this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_160">
     district, and who had been mentally reviewing his learning at every step
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_170">
     he took, trembling lest the committee should find that he did not know
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_180">
     enough, was not a little taken aback at this greeting from "old Jack
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_190">
     Means," who was the first trustee that he lighted on. The impression
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_200">
     made by these ominous remarks was emphasized by the glances which he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_210">
     received from Jack Means's two sons. The older one eyed him from the top
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_220">
     of his brawny shoulders with that amiable look which a big dog turns on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_230">
     a little one before shaking him. Ralph Hartsook had never thought of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_240">
     being measured by the standard of muscle. This notion of beating
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_250">
     education into young savages in spite of themselves dashed his ardor.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_270">
     He had walked right to where Jack Means was at work shaving shingles in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_280">
     his own front yard. While Mr. Means was making the speech which we have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_290">
     set down above, and punctuating it with expectorations, a large brindle
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_300">
     bulldog had been sniffing at Ralph's heels, and a girl in a new
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_310">
     linsey-woolsey dress, standing by the door, had nearly giggled her head
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_320">
     off at the delightful prospect of seeing a new school-teacher eaten up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_330">
     by the ferocious brute.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_350">
     The disheartening words of the old man, the immense muscles of the young
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_360">
     man who was to be his rebellious pupil, the jaws of the ugly bulldog,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_370">
     and the heartless giggle of the girl, gave Ralph a delightful sense of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_380">
     having precipitated himself into a den of wild beasts. Faint with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_390">
     weariness and discouragement, and shivering with fear, he sat down on a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_400">
     wheelbarrow.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_420">
     "You, Bull!" said the old man to the dog, which was showing more and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_430">
     more a disposition to make a meal of the incipient pedagogue, "you,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_440">
     Bull! git aout[2], you pup!" The dog walked sullenly off, but not until
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_450">
     he had given Ralph a look full of promise of what he meant to do when he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_460">
     got a good chance. Ralph wished himself back in the village of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_470">
     Lewisburg, whence he had come.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_490">
     "You see," continued Mr. Means, spitting in a meditative sort of a way,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_500">
     "you see, we a'n't none of your saft sort in these diggings. It takes a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_510">
     _man_ to boss this deestrick. Howsumdever, ef you think you kin trust
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_520">
     your hide in Flat Crick school-house I ha'n't got no 'bjection. But ef
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_530">
     you git licked, don't come on us. Flat Crick don't pay no 'nsurance, you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_540">
     bet! Any other trustees? Wal, yes. But as I pay the most taxes, t'others
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_550">
     jist let me run the thing. You can begin right off a Monday. They a'n't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_560">
     been no other applications. You see, it takes grit to apply for this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_570">
     school. The last master had a black eye for a month. But, as I wuz
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_580">
     sayin', you can jist roll up and wade in. I 'low you've got spunk,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_590">
     maybe, and that goes for a heap sight more'n sinnoo with boys. Walk in,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_600">
     and stay over Sunday with me. You'll hev' to board roun', and I guess
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_610">
     you better begin here."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_630">
     Ralph did not go in, but sat out on the wheelbarrow, watching the old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_640">
     man shave shingles, while the boys split the blocks and chopped wood.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_650">
     Bull smelled of the new-comer again in an ugly way, and got a good kick
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_660">
     from the older son for his pains. But out of one of his red eyes the dog
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_670">
     warned the young school-master that _he_ should yet suffer for all kicks
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_680">
     received on his account.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_700">
     "Ef Bull once takes a holt, heaven and yarth can't make him let go,"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_710">
     said the older son to Ralph, by way of comfort.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_730">
     It was well for Ralph that he began to "board roun'" by stopping at Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_740">
     Means's. Ralph felt that Flat Creek was what he needed. He had lived a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_750">
     bookish life; but here was his lesson in the art of managing people, for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_760">
     he who can manage the untamed and strapping youths of a winter school in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_770">
     Hoopole County has gone far toward learning one of the hardest of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_780">
     lessons. And in Ralph's time, things were worse than they are now. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_790">
     older son of Mr. Means was called Bud Means. What his real name was,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_800">
     Ralph could not find out, for in many of these families the nickname of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_810">
     "Bud" given to the oldest boy, and that of "Sis," which is the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_820">
     birth-right of the oldest girl, completely bury the proper Christian
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_830">
     name. Ralph saw his first strategic point, which was to capture Bud
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_840">
     Means.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_860">
     After supper, the boys began to get ready for something. Bull stuck up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_870">
     his ears in a dignified way, and the three or four yellow curs who were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_880">
     Bull's satellites yelped delightedly and discordantly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_900">
     "Bill," said Bud Means to his brother, "ax the master ef he'd like to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_910">
     hunt coons. I'd like to take the starch out uv the stuck-up feller."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_930">
     "'Nough said[3]," was Bill's reply.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_950">
     "You durn't[4] do it," said Bud.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_970">
     "I don't take no sech a dare[5]," returned Bill, and walked down to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_980">
     gate, by which Ralph stood watching the stars come out, and half wishing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_990">
     he had never seen Flat Creek.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1010">
     "I say, mister," began Bill, "mister, they's a coon what's been a eatin'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1020">
     our chickens lately, and we're goin' to try to ketch[6] the varmint.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1030">
     You wouldn't like to take a coon hunt nor nothin', would you?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1050">
     "Why, yes," said Ralph, "there's nothing I should like better, if I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1060">
     could only be sure Bull wouldn't mistake me for the coon."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1080">
     And so, as a matter of policy, Ralph dragged his tired legs eight or ten
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1090">
     miles, on hill and in hollow, after Bud, and Bill, and Bull, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1100">
     coon. But the raccoon[7] climbed a tree. The boys got into a quarrel
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1110">
     about whose business it was to have brought the axe, and who was to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1120">
     blame that the tree could not be felled. Now, if there was anything
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1130">
     Ralph's muscles were good for, it was climbing. So, asking Bud to give
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1140">
     him a start, he soon reached the limb above the one on which the raccoon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1150">
     was. Ralph did not know how ugly a customer a raccoon can be, and so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1160">
     got credit for more courage than he had. With much peril to his legs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1170">
     from the raccoon's teeth, he succeeded in shaking the poor creature off
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1180">
     among the yelping brutes and yelling boys. Ralph could not help
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1190">
     sympathizing with the hunted animal, which sold its life as dearly as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1200">
     possible, giving the dogs many a scratch and bite. It seemed to him that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1210">
     he was like the raccoon, precipitated into the midst of a party of dogs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1220">
     who would rejoice in worrying _his_ life out, as Bull and his crowd were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1230">
     destroying the poor raccoon. When Bull at last seized the raccoon and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1240">
     put an end to it, Ralph could not but admire the decided way in which he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1250">
     did it, calling to mind Bud's comment, "Ef Bull once takes a holt,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1260">
     heaven and yarth[8] can't make him let go."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1280">
     But as they walked home, Bud carrying the raccoon by the tail, Ralph
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1290">
     felt that his hunt had not been in vain. He fancied that even red-eyed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1300">
     Bull, walking uncomfortably close to his heels, respected him more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1310">
     since he had climbed that tree.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1330">
     "Purty peart kind of a master," remarked the old man to Bud, after Ralph
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1340">
     had gone to bed. "Guess you better be a little easy on him. Hey?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1360">
     But Bud deigned no reply. Perhaps because he knew that Ralph heard the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1370">
     conversation through the thin partition.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1390">
     Ralph woke delighted to find it raining. He did not want to hunt or fish
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1400">
     on Sunday, and this steady rain would enable him to make friends with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1410">
     Bud. I do not know how he got started, but after breakfast he began to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1420">
     tell stories. Out of all the books he had ever read he told story after
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1430">
     story. And "old man Means," and "old _Miss_ Means," and Bud Means, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1440">
     Bill Means, and Sis Means listened with great eyes while he told of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1450">
     Sinbad's adventures, of the Old Man of the Sea, of Robinson Crusoe, of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1460">
     Captain Gulliver's experiences in Liliput, and of Baron Munchausen's
    </p>

     exploits.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1490">
     Ralph had caught his fish. The hungry minds of these backwoods people
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1500">
     were refreshed with the new life that came to their imaginations in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1510">
     these stories. For there was but one book in the Means library, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1520">
     that, a well-thumbed copy of "Captain Riley's Narrative," had long since

     lost all freshness.

     "I'll be dog-on'd[9]," said Bill, emphatically, "ef I hadn't 'ruther

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1590">
     What Ralph wanted was to make a friend of Bud. It's a nice thing to

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1600">
     have the seventy-four-gun ship on your own side, and the more Hartsook

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1610">
     admired the knotted muscles of Bud Means the more he desired to attach
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1620">
     him to himself. So, whenever he struck out a peculiarly brilliant
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1630">
     passage, he anxiously watched Bud's eye. But the young Philistine kept
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1640">
     his own counsel. He listened, but said nothing, and the eyes under his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1650">
     shaggy brows gave no sign. Ralph could not tell whether those eyes were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1660">
     deep and inscrutable or only stolid. Perhaps a little of both. When
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1670">
     Monday morning came, Ralph was nervous. He walked to school with Bud.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1690">
     "I guess you're a little skeered by what the old man said, a'n't you?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1710">
     Ralph was about to deny it, but on reflection concluded that it was best
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1720">
     to speak the truth. He said that Mr. Means's description of the school
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1730">
     had made him feel a little down-hearted.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1750">
     "What will you do with the tough boys? You a'n't no match for 'em." And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1760">
     Ralph felt Bud's eyes not only measuring his muscles, but scrutinizing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1770">
     his countenance. He only answered:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1790">
     "I don't know."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1810">
     "What would you do with me, for instance?" and Bud stretched himself up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1820">
     as if to shake out the reserve power coiled up in his great muscles.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1840">
     "I sha'n't have any trouble with you."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1860">
     "Why, I'm the wust chap of all. I thrashed the last master, myself."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1880">
     And again the eyes of Bud Means looked out sharply from his shadowing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1890">
     brows to see the effect of this speech on the slender young man.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1910">
     "You won't thrash me, though," said Ralph.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1930">
     "Pshaw! I 'low I could whip you in an inch of your life with my left
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1940">
     hand, and never half try," said young Means, with a threatening sneer.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1960">
     "I know that as well as you do."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1980">
     "Well, a'n't you afraid of me, then?" and again he looked sidewise at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_1990">
     Ralph.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2010">
     "Not a bit," said Ralph, wondering at his own courage.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2030">
     They walked on in silence a minute. Bud was turning the matter over.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2050">
     "Why a'n't you afraid of me?" he said presently.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2070">
     "Because you and I are going to be friends."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2090">
     "And what about t'others?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2110">
     "I am not afraid of all the other boys put together."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2130">
     "You a'n't! The mischief! How's that?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2150">
     "Well, I'm not afraid of them because you and I are going to be friends,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2160">
     and you can whip all of them together. You'll do the fighting and I'll
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2170">
     do the teaching."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2190">
     The diplomatic Bud only chuckled a little at this; whether he assented
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2200">
     to the alliance or not Ralph could not tell.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2220">
     When Ralph looked round on the faces of the scholars--the little faces
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2230">
     full of mischief and curiosity, the big faces full of an expression
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2240">
     which was not further removed than second-cousin from contempt--when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2250">
     when young Hartsook looked into these faces, his heart palpitated with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2260">
     stage-fright. There is no audience so hard to face as one of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2270">
     school-children, as many a man has found to his cost. Perhaps it is that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2280">
     no conventional restraint can keep down their laughter when you do or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2290">
     say anything ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2310">
     Hartsook's first day was hurried and unsatisfactory. He was not of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2320">
     himself, and consequently not master of anybody else. When evening came,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2330">
     there were symptoms of insubordination through the whole school. Poor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2340">
     Ralph was sick at heart. He felt that if there had ever been the shadow
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2350">
     of an alliance between himself and Bud, it was all "off" now. It seemed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2360">
     to Hartsook that even Bull had lost his respect for the teacher. Half
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2370">
     that night the young man lay awake. At last comfort came to him. A
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2380">
     reminiscence of the death of the raccoon flashed on him like a vision.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2390">
     He remembered that quiet and annihilating bite which Bull gave. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2400">
     remembered Bud's certificate, that "Ef Bull once takes a holt, heaven
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2410">
     and yarth can't make him let go." He thought that what Flat Creek needed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2420">
     was a bulldog. He would be a bulldog, quiet, but invincible. He would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2430">
     take hold in such a way that nothing should make him let go. And then he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2440">
     went to sleep.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2460">
     In the morning Ralph got out of bed slowly. He put his clothes on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2470">
     slowly. He pulled on his boots in a bulldog mood. He tried to move as he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2480">
     thought Bull would move if he were a man. He ate with deliberation, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2490">
     looked everybody in the eyes with a manner that made Bud watch him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2500">
     curiously. He found himself continually comparing himself with Bull. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2510">
     found Bull possessing a strange fascination for him. He walked to school
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2520">
     alone, the rest having gone on before. He entered the school-room
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2530">
     preserving a cool and dogged manner. He saw in the eyes of the boys that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2540">
     there was mischief brewing. He did not dare sit down in his chair for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2550">
     fear of a pin. Everybody looked solemn. Ralph lifted the lid of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2560">
     desk. "Bow-wow! wow-wow!" It was the voice of an imprisoned puppy, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2570">
     the school giggled and then roared. Then everything was quiet.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2590">
     The scholars expected an outburst of wrath from the teacher. For they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2600">
     had come to regard the whole world as divided into two classes, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2610">
     teacher on the one side representing lawful authority, and the pupils on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2620">
     the other in a state of chronic rebellion. To play a trick on the master
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2630">
     was an evidence of spirit; to "lick" the master was to be the crowned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2640">
     hero of Flat Creek district. Such a hero was Bud Means; and Bill, who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2650">
     had less muscle, saw a chance to distinguish himself on a teacher of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2660">
     slender frame. Hence the puppy in the desk.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2680">
     Ralph Hartsook grew red in the face when he saw the puppy. But the cool,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2690">
     repressed, bulldog mood in which he had kept himself saved him. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2700">
     lifted the dog into his arms and stroked him until the laughter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2710">
     subsided. Then, in a solemn and set way, he began:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2730">
     "I am sorry," and he looked round the room with a steady, hard
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2740">
     eye--everybody felt that there was a conflict coming--"I am sorry that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2750">
     any scholar in this school could be so mean"--the word was uttered with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2760">
     a sharp emphasis, and all the big boys felt sure that there would be a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2770">
     fight with Bill Means, and perhaps with Bud--"could be so _mean_--as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2780">
     to--shut up his _brother_ in such a place as that!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2800">
     There was a long, derisive laugh. The wit was indifferent, but by one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2810">
     stroke Ralph had carried the whole school to his side. By the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2820">
     significant glances of the boys, Hartsook detected the perpetrator of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2830">
     the joke, and with the hard and dogged look in his eyes, with just such
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2840">
     a look as Bull would give a puppy, but with the utmost suavity in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2850">
     voice, he said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_2870">
     "William Means, will you be so good as to put this dog out of doors?"

     with her desperate passion for him, that she told him about it. Not in

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_5460">
     changed the whole tone of her voice. She whined ordinarily. Now she

     frightful intelligence that he was loved by the richest, the ugliest,

     Ralph sat by the fire the next morning trying to read a few minutes

     She was generally as silent as Bud, but now she seemed for some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_5590">
     unaccountable reason disposed to talk. She had sat down on the broad
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_5600">
     hearth to have her usual morning smoke; the poplar table, adorned by no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_5610">
     cloth, stood in the middle of the floor; the unwashed blue teacups sat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_5620">
     in the unwashed blue saucers; the unwashed blue plates kept company with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_5630">
     the begrimed blue pitcher. The dirty skillets by the fire were kept in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_5640">
     countenance by the dirtier pots, and the ashes were drifted and strewn
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_5650">
     over the hearth-stones in a most picturesque way.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_5670">
     "You see," said the old woman, knocking the residuum from her cob pipe,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_5680">
     and chafing some dry leaf between her withered hands preparatory to
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_5720">
     Ralph wondered why she should mention it to him. "You see, we moved in

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_5790">
     to the _hole_--of her cob pipe. When she got the smoke a-going, she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_5800">
     proceeded:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_5820">
     "You see, this yere bottom land was all Congress land[12] in them there

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_5970">
     laughed, or grinned horribly, at Ralph, showing her few straggling,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_5980">
     discolored teeth.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6000">
     Then she got up and knocked the ashes out of her pipe, and laid the pipe
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6010">
     away and walked round In front of Ralph. After adjusting the chunks[13]
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6020">
     so that the fire would burn, she turned her yellow face toward Ralph,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6030">
     and scanning him closely came out with the climax of her speech in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6040">
     remark: "You see as how, Mr. Hartsook, the man what gits my Mirandy'll

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6050">
     do well. Flat Crick land's wuth nigt upon a hundred a' acre."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6070">
     This gentle hint came near knocking Ralph down. Had Flat Creek land been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6080">
     worth a hundred times a hundred dollars an acre, and had he owned five
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6090">
     hundred times Means's five hundred acres, he would have given it all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6100">
     just at that moment to have annihilated the whole tribe of Meanses.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6110">
     Except Bud. Bud was a giant, but a good-natured one. He thought he would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6120">
     except Bud from the general destruction. As for the rest, he mentally
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6130">
     pictured to himself the pleasure of attending their funerals. There was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6140">
     one thought, however, between him and despair. He felt confident that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6150">
     the cordiality, the intensity, and the persistency of his dislike of Sis
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6160">
     Means were such that he should never inherit a foot of the Flat Creek

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6170">
     bottoms.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6190">
     But what about Bud? What if he joined the conspiracy to marry him to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6200">
     this weak-eyed, weak-headed wood-nymph, or backwoods nymph?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6220">
     If Ralph felt it a misfortune to be loved by Mirandy Means, he found
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6230">
     himself almost equally unfortunate in having incurred the hatred of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6240">
     meanest boy in school. "Hank" Banta, low-browed, smirky, and crafty, was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6250">
     the first sufferer by Ralph's determination to use corporal punishment,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6260">
     and so Henry Banta, who was a compound of deceit and resentment, never
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6270">
     lost an opportunity to annoy the young school-master, who was obliged to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6280">
     live perpetually on his guard against his tricks.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6300">
     One morning, as Ralph walked toward the school-house, he met little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6310">
     Shocky. What the boy's first name or last name was the teacher did not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6320">
     know. He had given his name as Shocky, and all the teacher knew was that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6330">
     he was commonly called Shocky, that he was an orphan, that he lived with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6340">
     a family named Pearson over in Rocky Hollow, and that he was the most
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6350">
     faithful and affectionate child in the school. On this morning that I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6360">
     speak of, Ralph had walked toward the school early to avoid the company
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6370">
     of Mirandy. But not caring to sustain his dignity longer than was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6380">
     necessary, he loitered along the road, admiring the trunks of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6390">
     maples, and picking up a beech-nut now and then. Just as he was about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6400">
     to go on toward the school, he caught sight of little Shocky running
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6410">
     swiftly toward him, but looking from side to side, as if afraid of being
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6420">
     seen.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6460">
     "Well, Shocky, what is it?" and Ralph put his hand kindly on the great
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6470">
     bushy head of white hair from which came Shocky's nickname. Shocky had

     to pant a minute.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6500">
     "Why, Mr. Hartsook," he gasped, scratching his head, "they's a pond down
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6510">
     under the school-house," and here Shocky's breath gave out entirely for

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6520">
     a minute.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6540">
     "Yes, Shocky, I know that. What about it? The trustees haven't come to

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6570">
     "Oh! no, sir; but Hank Banta, you know--" and Shocky took another

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6580">
     breathing spell, standing as dose to Ralph as he could, for poor Shocky
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6590">
     got all his sunshine from the master's presence.

     "Has Henry fallen in and got a ducking, Shocky?"
    </p>

     "Oh! no, sir; he wants to git you in, you see."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6650">
     "Well, I won't go in, though, Shocky."

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6720">
     "And so you came to tell me." There was a huskiness in Ralph's voice.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6730">
     He had, then, one friend in Flat Creek district--poor little Shocky. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6740">
     put his arm around Shocky just a moment, and then told him to hasten
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6750">
     across to the other road, so as to come back to the school-house in a

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6770">
     not needed. Shocky had taken care to leave in that way, and was
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6810">
     back once or twice, just to catch one more smile from Ralph. And then he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6820">
     hied away through the tall trees, a very happy boy, kicking and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6830">
     ploughing the brown leaves before him in his perfect delight, saying
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6840">
     over and over again: "How he looked at me! how he did look!" And when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6850">
     Ralph came up to the school-house door, there was Shocky sauntering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6860">
     along from the other direction, throwing bits of limestone at fence
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6870">
     rails, and smiling still clear down to his shoes at thought of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6880">
     master's kind words.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6900">
     "What a quare boy Shocky is!" remarked Betsey Short, with a giggle. "He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6910">
     just likes to wander round alone. I see him a-comin' out of the sugar
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6920">
     camp just now. He's been in there half an hour." And Betsey giggled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6930">
     again; for Betsey Short could giggle on slighter provocation than any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6940">
     other girl on Flat Creek.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6960">
     When Ralph Hartsook, with the quiet, dogged tread that he was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6970">
     cultivating, walked into the school-room, he took great care not to seem
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6980">
     to see the trap set for him; but he carelessly stepped over the board
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_6990">
     that had been so nicely adjusted. The boys who were Hank's confidants in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7000">
     the plot were very busy over their slates, and took pains not to show
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7010">
     their disappointment.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7030">
     The morning session wore on without incident. Ralph several times caught
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7040">
     two people looking at him. One was Mirandy. Her weak and watery eyes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7050">
     stole loving glances over the top of her spelling-book, which she would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7060">
     not study. Her looks made Ralph's spirits sink to forty below zero, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7070">
     congeal.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7090">
     But on one of the backless little benches that sat in the middle of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7100">
     school-room was little Shocky, who also cast many love glances at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7110">
     young master; glances as grateful to his heart as Mirandy's ogling--he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7120">
     was tempted to call it ogring--was hateful.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7140">
     "Look at Shocky," giggled Betsey Short, behind her slate. "He looks as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7150">
     if he was a-goin' to eat the master up, body and soul."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7170">
     And so the forenoon wore on as usual, and those who laid the trap had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7180">
     forgotten it, themselves. The morning session was drawing to a close.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7190">
     The fire in the great old fire-place had burnt low. The flames, which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7200">
     seemed to Shocky to be angels, had disappeared, and now the bright
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7210">
     coals, which had played the part of men and women and houses in Shocky's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7220">
     fancy, had taken on a white and downy covering of ashes, and the great
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7230">
     half-burnt back-log lay there smouldering like a giant asleep in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7240">
     snow-drift. Shocky longed to wake him up.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7260">
     As for Henry Banta, he was too much bothered to get the answer to a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7270">
     "sum" he was doing, to remember anything about his trap. In fact, he had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7280">
     quite forgotten that half an hour ago in the all-absorbing employment of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7290">
     drawing ugly pictures on his slate and coaxing Betsey Short to giggle by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7300">
     showing them slyly across the school-room. Once or twice Ralph had been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7310">
     attracted to Betsey's extraordinary fits of giggling, and had come so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7320">
     near to catching Hank that the boy thought it best not to run any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7330">
     further risk of the beech switches, four or five feet long, laid up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7340">
     behind the master in sight of the school as a prophylactic. Hence his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7350">
     application just now to his "sum" in long division, and hence his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7360">
     puzzled look, for, idler that he was, his "sums" did not solve
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7370">
     themselves easily. As usual in such cases, he came up in front of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7380">
     master's desk to have the difficulty explained. He had to wait a minute
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7390">
     until Ralph got through with showing Betsey Short, who had been seized
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7400">
     with a studying fit, and who could hardly give any attention to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7410">
     teacher's explanations, she did want to giggle so much! Not at anything
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7420">
     in particular, but just at things in general.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7440">
     While Ralph was "doing" Betsey's "sum" for her, he was solving a much
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7450">
     more difficult question. A plan had flashed upon him, but the punishment
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7460">
     seemed a severe one. He gave it up once or twice, but he remembered how
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7470">
     turbulent the Flat Creek elements were; and had he not inly resolved to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7480">
     be as unrelenting as a bulldog? He fortified himself by recalling again
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7490">
     the oft-remembered remark of Bud, "Ef Bull wunst takes a holt, heaven
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7500">
     and yarth can't make him let go." And so he resolved to give Hank and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7510">
     the whole school one good lesson.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7530">
     "Just step round behind me, Henry, and you can see how I do this," said
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7540">
     Ralph.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7560">
     Hank was entirely off his guard, and, with his eyes fixed upon the slate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7570">
     on the teacher's desk, he sidled round upon the broad loose board
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7580">
     misplaced by his own hand, and in an instant the other end of the board
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7590">
     rose up in the middle of the school-room, almost striking Shocky in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7600">
     face, while Henry Banta went down into the ice-cold water beneath the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7610">
     school-house.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7630">
     "Why, Henry!" cried Ralph, jumping to his feet with well-feigned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7640">
     surprise. "How _did_ this happen?" him by the fire.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7660">
     Betsey Short giggled.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7680">
     Shocky was so tickled that he could hardly keep his seat.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7700">
     The boys who were in the plot looked very serious indeed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7720">
     Ralph made some remarks by way of improving the occasion. He spoke
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7730">
     strongly of the utter meanness of the one who could play so heartless a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7740">
     trick on a schoolmate. He said that it was as much thieving to get your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7750">
     fun at the expense of another as to steal his money. And while he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7760">
     talked, all eyes were turned on Hank--all except the eyes of Mirandy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7770">
     Means. They looked simperingly at Ralph. All the rest looked at Hank.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7780">
     The fire had made his face very red. Shocky noticed that. Betsey Short
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7790">
     noticed it, and giggled. The master wound up with an appropriate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7800">
     quotation from Scripture. He said that the person who displaced that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7810">
     board had better not be encouraged by the success--he said _success_
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7820">
     with a curious emphasis--of the present experiment to attempt another
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7830">
     trick of the kind. For it was set down in the Bible that if a man dug a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7840">
     pit for the feet of another he would be very likely to fall in it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7850">
     himself. Which made all the pupils look solemn, except Betsey Short, who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7860">
     giggled. And Shocky wanted to. And Mirandy cast an expiring look at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7870">
     Ralph. And if the teacher was not love-sick, he certainly was sick of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7880">
     Mirandy's love.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7920">
     When school was "let out," Ralph gave Hank every caution that he could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7930">
     about taking cold, and even lent him his overcoat, very much against
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7940">
     Hank's will. For Hank had obstinately refused to go home before the

     school was dismissed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7970">
     Then the master walked out in a quiet and subdued way to spend the noon

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7980">
     recess in the woods, while Shocky watched his retreating footsteps with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_7990">
     loving admiration. And the pupils not in the secret canvassed the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_8000">
     question of who moved the board. Bill Means said he'd bet Hank did it,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_8010">
     which set Betsey Short off in an uncontrollable giggle. And Shocky
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_8020">
     listened innocently.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_8040">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_8630">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_8640">
     shuddered. Nothing was so frightful to him as to be fawned on by this

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_8890">
     And here she looked at Ralph in triumph, her hard face splintering into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_8900">
     the hideous semblance of a smile. And Mirandy cast a blushing, gushing,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_8910">
     all-imploring, and all-confiding look on the young master.

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_8970">
     As for Ralph, he fell into a sort of terror. He had a guilty feeling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_8980">
     that this speech of the old lady's had somehow committed him beyond
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_8990">
     recall to Mirandy. He did not see visions of breach-of-promise suits.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9000">
     But he trembled at the thought of an avenging big brother.

     "Hanner, you kin come along, too, ef you're a mind, when you git the

     dishes washed," said Mrs. Means to the bound girl, as she shut and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9040">
     latched the back door. The Means family had built a new house in front
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9050">
     of the old one, as a sort of advertisement of bettered circumstances, an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9060">
     eruption of shoddy feeling; but when the new building was completed,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9070">
     they found themselves unable to occupy it for anything else than a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9080">
     lumber room, and so, except a parlor which Mirandy had made an effort to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9090">
     furnish a little (in hope of the blissful time when somebody should "set
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9100">
     up" with her of evenings), the new building was almost unoccupied, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9110">
     the family went in and out through the back door, which, indeed, was the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9120">
     front door also, for, according to a curious custom, the "front" of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9130">
     house was placed toward the south, though the "big road" (Hoosier for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9140">
     _highway_) ran along the north-west side, or, rather, past the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9150">
     north-west corner of it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9170">
     When the old woman had spoken thus to Hannah and had latched the door,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9180">
     she muttered, "That gal don't never show no gratitude fer favors;" to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9190">
     which Bud rejoined that he didn't think she had no great sight to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9200">
     pertickler thankful fer. To which Mrs. Means made no reply, thinking it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9210">
     best, perhaps, not to wake up her dutiful son on so interesting a theme
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9220">
     as her treatment of Hannah. Ralph felt glad that he was this evening to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9230">
     go to another boarding place. He should not hear the rest of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9240">
     controversy.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9260">
     Ralph walked to the school-house with Bill. They were friends again. For
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9270">
     when Hank Banta's ducking and his dogged obstinacy in sitting in his wet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9280">
     clothes had brought on a serious fever, Ralph had called together the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9290">
     big boys, and had said: "We must take care of one another, boys. Who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9300">
     will volunteer to take turns sitting up with Henry?" He put his own name
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9310">
     down, and all the rest followed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9330">
     "William Means and myself will sit up to-night," said Ralph. And poor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9340">
     Bill had been from that moment the teacher's friend. He was chosen to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9350">
     Ralph's companion. He was Puppy Means no longer! Hank could not be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9360">
     conquered by kindness, and the teacher was made to feel the bitterness
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9370">
     of his resentment long after. But Bill Means was for the time entirely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9380">
     placated, and he and Ralph went to spelling-school together.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9400">
     Every family furnished a candle. There were yellow dips and white dips,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9410">
     burning, smoking, and flaring. There was laughing, and talking, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9420">
     giggling, and simpering, and ogling, and flirting, and courting. What a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9430">
     full-dress party is to Fifth Avenue, a spelling-school is to Hoopole
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9440">
     County. It is an occasion which is metaphorically inscribed with this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9450">
     legend: "Choose your partners." Spelling is only a blind in Hoopole
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9460">
     County, as is dancing on Fifth Avenue. But as there are some in society
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9470">
     who love dancing for its own sake, so in Flat Creek district there were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9480">
     those who loved spelling for its own sake, and who, smelling the battle
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9490">
     from afar, had come to try their skill in this tournament, hoping to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9500">
     freshen the laurels they had won in their school-days.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9520">
     "I 'low," said Mr. Means, speaking as the principal school trustee, "I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9530">
     'low our friend the Square is jest the man to boss this 'ere consarn

     his donkey."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9580">
     There was a general giggle at this, and many of the young swains took
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9590">
     occasion to nudge the girls alongside them, ostensibly for the purpose
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9600">
     of making them see the joke, but really for the pure pleasure of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9610">
     nudging. The Greeks figured Cupid as naked, probably because he wears so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9620">
     many disguises that they could not select a costume for him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9640">
     The Squire came to the front. Ralph made an inventory of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9650">
     agglomeration which bore the name of Squire Hawkins, as follows:
    </p>

     1. A swallow-tail coat of indefinite age, worn only on state occasions^

     Squire had frequently to adjust it. As his hair had been red, the wig
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9760">
     did not accord with his face, and the hair ungrayed was doubly

     discordant with a countenance shrivelled by age.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9900">
     It is an old story that a boy wrote home to his father begging him to

     come West, because "mighty mean men get into office out here." But Ralph

     concluded that some Yankees had taught school in Hoopole County who

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9950">
     overlaid by a Western pronunciation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_9970">
     "Ladies and gentlemen," he began, shoving up his spectacles, and sucking

     his lips over his white teeth to keep them in place, "ladies and

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10010">
     head round half an inch. Then he adjusted his spectacles. Whether he was

     hand to hand to decide which should have the "first choice." One tossed

     the stick to the other, who held it fast just where he happened to catch
    </p>

    </p>

     were alternately changed to the top. The one who held the stick last

     without room for the other to take hold had gained the lot. This was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10380">
     tried three times. As Larkin held the stick twice out of three times, he
    </p>

     had the choice. He hesitated a moment. Everybody looked toward tall Jim

     Phillips. But Larkin was fond of a venture on unknown seas, and so he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10410">
     said, "I take the master," while a buzz of surprise ran round the room,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10420">
     and the captain of the other side, as if afraid his opponent would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10430">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10480">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10490">
     spelling-book and began to give out the words to the two captains, who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10500">
     stood up and spelled against each other. It was not long until Larkin
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10510">
     spelled "really" with one _l_, and had to sit down in confusion, while a

     murmur of satisfaction ran through the ranks of the opposing forces. His
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10530">
     own side bit their lips. The slender figure of the young teacher took
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10540">
     the place of the fallen leader, and the excitement made the house very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10550">
     quiet. Ralph dreaded the loss of prestige he would suffer if he should
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10560">
     be easily spelled down. And at the moment of rising he saw in the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10570">
     darkest corner the figure of a well-dressed young man sitting in the

     shadow. Why should his evil genius haunt him? But by a strong effort he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10590">
     turned his attention away from Dr. Small, and listened carefully to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10600">
     words which the Squire did not pronounce very distinctly, spelling them
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10610">
     with extreme deliberation. This gave him an air of hesitation which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10620">
     disappointed those on his own side. They wanted him to spell with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10630">
     dashing assurance. But he did not begin a word until he had mentally
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10640">
     felt his way through it. After ten minutes of spelling hard words Jeems
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10650">
     Buchanan, the captain on the other side, spelled "atrocious" with an _s_

     instead of a _c_, and subsided, his first choice, Jeems Phillips, coming
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10670">
     up against the teacher. This brought the excitement to fever-heat. For
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10680">
     though Ralph was chosen first, it was entirely on trust, and most of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10690">
     the company were disappointed. The champion who now stood up against the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10700">
     school-master was a famous speller.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10720">
     Jim Phillips was a tall, lank, stoop-shouldered fellow who had never
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10730">
     distinguished himself in any other pursuit than spelling. Except in this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10740">
     one art of spelling he was of no account. He could not catch well or bat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10750">
     well in ball. He could not throw well enough to make his mark in that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10760">
     famous West ern game of bull-pen. He did not succeed well in any study
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10770">
     but that of Webster's Elementary. But in that he was--to use the usual
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10780">
     Flat Creek locution--in that he was "a boss." This genius for spelling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10790">
     is in some people a sixth sense, a matter of intuition. Some spellers
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10800">
     are born, and not made, and their facility reminds one of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10810">
     mathematical prodigies that crop out every now and then to bewilder the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10820">
     world. Bud Means, foreseeing that Ralph would be pitted against Jim
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10830">
     Phillips, had warned his friend that Jim could "spell like thunder and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10840">
     lightning," and that it "took a powerful smart speller" to beat him, for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10850">
     he knew "a heap of spelling-book." To have "spelled down the master" is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10860">
     next thing to having whipped the biggest bully in Hoopole County, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10870">
     Jim had "spelled down" the last three masters. He divided the
    </p>

     hero-worship of the district with Bud Means.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10900">
     For half an hour the Squire gave out hard words. What a blessed thing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10910">
     our crooked orthography is! Without it there could be no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10920">
     spelling-schools. As Ralph discovered his opponent's mettle he became
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10930">
     more and more cautious. He was now satisfied that Jim would eventually
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10940">
     beat him. The fellow evidently knew more about the spelling-book than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10950">
     old Noah Webster himself. As he stood there, with his dull face and long
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10960">
     sharp nose, his hands behind his back, and his voice spelling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10970">
     infallibly, it seemed to Hartsook that his superiority must lie in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10980">
     nose. Ralph's cautiousness answered a double purpose; it enabled him to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_10990">
     tread surely, and it was mistaken by Jim for weakness. Phillips was now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11000">
     confident that he should carry off the scalp of the fourth school-master
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11010">
     before the evening was over. He spelled eagerly, confidently,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11020">
     brilliantly. Stoop-shouldered as he was, he began to straighten up. In
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11030">
     the minds of all the company the odds were in his favor. He saw this,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11040">
     and became ambitious to distinguish himself by spelling without giving
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11050">
     the matter any thought.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11070">
     Ralph always believed that he would have been speedily defeated by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11080">
     Phillips had it not been for two thoughts which braced him. The sinister
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11090">
     shadow of young Dr. Small sitting in the dark corner by the water-bucket
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11100">
     nerved him. A victory over Phillips was a defeat to one who wished only
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11110">
     ill to the young school-master. The other thought that kept his pluck
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11120">
     alive was the recollection of Bull. He approached a word as Bull
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11130">
     approached the raccoon. He did not take hold until he was sure of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11140">
     game. When he took hold, it was with a quiet assurance of success. As

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11150">
     Ralph spelled in this dogged way for half an hour the hardest words the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11160">
     Squire could find, the excitement steadily rose in all parts of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11170">
     house, and Ralph's friends even ventured to whisper that "maybe Jim had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11180">
     cotched his match, after all!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11200">
     But Phillips never doubted of his success.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11220">
     "Theodolite," said the Squire.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11240">
     "T-h-e, the o-d, od, theod, o, theodo, l-y-t-e, theodolite," spelled the

     champion.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11270">
     "Next," said the Squire, nearly losing his teeth In his excitement.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11280">
     Ralph spelled the word slowly and correctly, and the conquered champion
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11290">
     sat down In confusion. The excitement was so great for some minutes that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11300">
     the spelling was suspended. Everybody In the house had shown sympathy

     with one or the other of the combatants, except the silent shadow in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11320">
     corner. It had not moved during the contest, and did not show any

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11330">
     interest now in the result.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11350">
     "Gewhilliky crickets! Thunder and lightning! Licked him all to smash!"

     said Bud, rubbing his hands on his knees, "That beats my time all

     the defeated side.

     Shocky got up and danced with pleasure.

     But one suffocating look from the aqueous eyes of Mirandy destroyed the
    </p>

     "Yaas, but he don't lick enough. Not nigh," answered Pete Jones. "No

     It was now not so hard. The other spellers on the opposite side went

     Ralph Hartsook ran against a stump where he was least expecting it. It

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11780">
     mortal fear of "the mitten." Presently the Squire, thinking it time to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11790">
     close the contest, pulled his scalp forward, adjusted his glass eye,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11800">
     which had been examining his nose long enough, and turned over the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11810">
     leaves of the book to the great words at the place known to spellers as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11820">
     "incomprehensibility," and began to give out those "words of eight
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11830">
     syllables with the accent on the sixth." Listless scholars now turned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11840">
     round, and ceased to whisper, in order to be in at the master's final
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11850">
     triumph. But to their surprise "ole Miss Meanses' white nigger," as some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11860">
     of them called her in allusion to her slavish life, spelled these great

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11870">
     words with as perfect ease as the master. Still not doubting the result,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11880">
     the Squire turned from place to place and selected all the hard words he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11890">
     could find. The school became utterly quiet, the excitement was too
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11900">
     great for the ordinary buzz. Would "Meanses' Hanner" beat the master?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11910">
     beat the master that had laid out Jim Phillips? Everybody's sympathy was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11920">
     now turned to Hannah. Ralph noticed that even Shocky had deserted him,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11930">
     and that his face grew brilliant every time Hannah spelled a word. In
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11940">
     fact, Ralph deserted himself. As he saw the fine, timid face of the girl
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11950">
     so long oppressed flush and shine with interest; as he looked at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11960">
     rather low but broad and intelligent brow and the fresh, white
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11970">
     complexion and saw the rich, womanly nature coming to the surface under
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11980">
     the influence of applause and sympathy--he did not want to beat. If he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_11990">
     had not felt that a victory given would insult her, he would have missed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12000">
     intentionally. The bulldog, the stern, relentless setting of the will,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12010">
     had gone, he knew not whither. And there had come in its place, as he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12020">
     looked in that face, a something which he did not understand. You did
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12030">
     not, gentle reader, the first time it came to you.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12050">
     The Squire was puzzled. He had given out all the hard words in the book.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12060">
     He again pulled the top of his head forward. Then he wiped his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12070">
     spectacles and put them on. Then out of the depths of his pocket he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12080">
     fished up a list of words just coming into use in those days--words not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12090">
     in the spelling-book. He regarded the paper attentively with his blue
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12100">
     right eye. His black left eye meanwhile fixed itself in such a stare on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12110">
     Mirandy Means that she shuddered and hid her eyes in her red silk

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12120">
     handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12140">
     "Daguerreotype," sniffed the Squire. It was Ralph's turn.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12160">
     "D-a-u, dau--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12180">
     "Next."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12200">
     And Hannah spelled it right.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12220">
     Such a buzz followed that Betsey Short's giggle could not be heard, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12230">
     Shocky shouted: "Hanner beat! my Hanner spelled down the master!" And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12240">
     Ralph went over and congratulated her.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12260">
     And Dr. Small sat perfectly still in the corner.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12280">
     And then the Squire called them to order, and said: "As our friend
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12290">
     Hanner Thomson is the only one left on her side, she will have to spell
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12300">
     against nearly all on t'other side. I shall therefore take the liberty
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12310">
     of procrastinating the completion of this interesting and exacting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12320">
     contest until to-morrow evening. I hope our friend Hanner may again

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12330">
     carry off the cypress crown of glory. There is nothing better for us
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12340">
     than healthful and kindly simulation."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12360">
     Dr. Small, who knew the road to practice, escorted Mirandy, and Bud went
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12370">
     home with somebody else. The others of the Means family hurried on,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12380">
     while Hannah, the champion, stayed behind a minute to speak to Shocky.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12390">
     Perhaps it was because Ralph saw that Hannah must go alone that he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12400">
     suddenly remembered having left something which was of no consequence,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_12410">
     and resolved to go round by Mr. Means's and get it.

     how the silvery moonbeams came down in a shower--to use Whittier's
    </p>

     favorite metaphor--through the maple boughs, flecking the frozen ground
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13010">
     with light and shadow. You would have me tell of the evening star, not

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13030">
     such thing. For the moon was not shining, neither did the stars give
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13040">
     their light. The tall, black trunks of the maples swayed and shook in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13050">
     the wind, which moaned through their leafless boughs. Novelists always

     believe, all moonshine, it can at least make its own light. Moonlight is

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13110">
     the dark. He did not ask permission to walk with her. Love does not go

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13120">
     by words, and there are times when conventionality is impossible. There

     his words would say if reported. But below all these commonplaces there
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13270">
     vibrated something else. One can make love a great deal better when one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13280">
     doesn't speak of love. Words are so poor! Tones and modulations are
    </p>

     better. It is an old story that Whitefield could make an audience weep

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13300">
     by his way of pronouncing the word Mesopotamia. A lover can sound the
    </p>

     whole gamut of his affection in saying Good-morning. The solemnest

     They'll get trouble enough before morning. Let them enjoy the evening. I

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13440">
     For the first time in three years, for the first time since she had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13450">
     crossed the threshold of "Old Jack Means" and come under the domination
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13460">
     of Mrs. Old Jack Means, Hannah talked cheerfully, almost gayly. It was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13470">
     something to have a companion to talk to. It was something to be the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13480">
     victor even in a spelling-match, and to be applauded even by Flat Creek.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13490">
     And so, chatting earnestly about the most uninteresting themes, Ralph
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13500">
     courteously helped Hannah over the fence, and they took the usual
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13510">
     short-cut through the "blue-grass pasture." There came up a little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13520">
     shower, hardly more than a sprinkle, but then It was so nice to have a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13530">
     shower just as they reached the box-elder tree by the spring! It was so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13540">
     thoughtful in Ralph to suggest that the shade of a box-elder is dense,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13550">
     and that Hannah might take cold! And it was so easy for Hannah to yield
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13560">
     to the suggestion! Just as though she had not milked the cows in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13570">
     open lot in the worst storms of the last three years! And just as though
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13580">
     the house were not within a stone's-throw! Doubtless it was not prudent
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13590">
     to stop here. But let us deal gently with them. Who would not stay in an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13600">
     earthy paradise ten minutes longer, even though it did make purgatory
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13610">
     the hotter afterward? And so Hannah stayed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13630">
     "Tell me your circumstances," said Ralph, at last. "I am sure I can help
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13640">
     you in something."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13660">
     "No, no! you cannot," and Hannah's face was clouded. "No one can help
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13670">
     me. Only time and God. I must go, Mr. Hartsook." And they walked on to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13680">
     the front gate in silence and in some constraint. But still in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13690">
     happiness.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13710">
     As they came to the gate, Dr. Small pushed past them in his cool,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13720">
     deliberate way, and mounted his horse. Ralph bade Hannah good-night,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13730">
     having entirely forgotten the errand which had been his excuse to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13740">
     himself for coming out of his way. He hastened to his new home, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_13750">
     house of Mr. Pete Jones, the same who believed in the inseparableness of

     assault upon the sensitive girl, she could only gnash her teeth in

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14140">
     Stung by the insults to which she could not grow insensible, Hannah lay

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14160">
     soul like a benediction. The harsh voice of the scold died out, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14170">
     gentle and courteous voice of Hartsook filled her soul. She recalled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14180">
     piece by piece the whole conversation--all the commonplace remarks about
    </p>

     the weather; all the insignificant remarks about the crops; all the
    </p>

     unimportant words about the spelling-school. Not for the sake of the

     Not for the sake of the spelling-school. But for the sake of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14230">
     undertone. And then she traveled back over the three years of her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14240">
     bondage and forward over the three years to come, and fed her heart on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14250">
     the dim hope of rebuilding in some form the home that had been so happy.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14260">
     And she prayed, with more faith than ever before, for deliverance. For
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14270">
     love brings faith. Somewhere on in the sleepless night she stood at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14280">
     window. The moon was shining now, and there was the path through the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14290">
     pasture, and there was the fence, and there was the box-elder.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14310">
     She sat there a long time. Then she saw someone come over the fence and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14320">
     walk to the tree, and then on toward Pete Jones's. Who could it be? She
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14330">
     thought she recognized the figure. But she was chilled and shivering,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14340">
     and she crept back again into bed, and dreamed not of the uncertain days
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14350">
     to come, but of the blessed days that were past--of a father and a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14360">
     mother and a brother in a happy home. But somehow the school-master was

     A NIGHT AT PETE JONES'S.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14460">
     When Ralph got to Pete Jones's he found that sinister-looking individual
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14470">
     in the act of kicking one of his many dogs out of the house.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14490">
     "Come in, stranger, come in. You'll find this 'ere house full of brats,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14500">
     but I guess you kin kick your way around among 'em. Take a cheer. Here,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14510">
     git out! go to thunder with you!" And with these mild imperatives he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14520">
     boxed one of his boys over in one direction and one of his girls over in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14530">
     the other. "I believe in trainin' up children to mind when they're spoke
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14540">
     to," he said to Ralph apologetically. But it seemed to the teacher that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14550">
     he wanted them to mind just a little before they were spoken to.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14570">
     "P'raps you'd like a bed. Well, jest climb up the ladder on the outside
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14580">
     of the house. Takes up a thunderin' sight of room to have a stairs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14590">
     inside, and we ha'n't got no room to spare. You'll find a bed in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14600">
     furdest corner. My Pete's already got half of it, and you can take

     In this comfortless bed "in the furdest corner," Ralph found sleep out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14650">
     of the question. Pete took three-fourths of the bed, and Hannah took all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14660">
     of his thoughts. So he lay, and looked out through the cracks in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14670">
     "clapboards" (as they call rough shingles in the old West) at the stars.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14680">
     For the clouds had now broken away. And he lay thus recounting to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14690">
     himself, as a miser counts the pieces that compose his hoard, every step
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14700">
     of that road from the time he had overtaken Hannah in the hollow to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14710">
     fence. Then he imagined again the pleasure of helping her over, and then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14720">
     he retraced the ground to the box-elder tree at the spring, and repeated
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14730">
     to himself the conversation until he came to the part in which she said
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14740">
     that only time and God could help her. What did she mean? What was the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14750">
     hidden part of her life? What was the connection between her and Shocky?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14770">
     Hours wore on, and still the mind of Ralph Hartsook went back and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14780">
     traveled the same road, over the fence, past the box-elder, up to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14790">
     inexplicable part of the conversation, and stood bewildered with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14800">
     same puzzling questions about the bound girl's life.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14820">
     At last he got up, drew on his clothes, and sat down on the top of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14830">
     ladder, looking down over the blue-grass pasture which lay on the border
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14840">
     between the land of Jones and the land of Means. The earth was white
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14850">
     with moonlight. He could not sleep. Why not walk? It might enable him to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14860">
     sleep. And once determined on walking, he did not hesitate a moment as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14870">
     to the direction in which he should walk. The blue-grass pasture (was it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14880">
     not like unto the garden of Eden?) lay right before him. That box-elder
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14890">
     stood just in sight. To spring over the fence and take the path down the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14900">
     hill and over the brook was as quickly done as decided upon. To stand
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14910">
     again under the box-elder, to climb again over the farther fence, and to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14920">
     walk down the road toward the school-house was so easy and so delightful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14930">
     that it was done without thought. For Ralph was an eager man--when he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14940">
     saw no wrong in anything that proposed itself, he was wont to follow his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14950">
     impulse without deliberation. And this keeping company with the stars,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14960">
     and the memory of a delightful walk, were so much better than the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14970">
     commonplace Flat Creek life that he threw himself into his night
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_14980">
     excursion with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15000">
     At last he stood in the little hollow where he had joined Hannah. It was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15010">
     the very spot at which Shocky, too, had met him a few mornings before.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15020">
     He leaned against the fence and tried again to solve the puzzle of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15030">
     Hannah's troubles. For that she had troubles he did not doubt. Neither
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15040">
     did he doubt that he could help her if he could discover what they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15050">
     were. But he had no clue. In the midst of This meditations he heard the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15060">
     thud of horses' hoofs coming down the road. Until that moment he had not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15070">
     felt his own loneliness. He shrank back into the fence-corner. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15080">
     horsemen were galloping. There were three of them, and there was one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15090">
     figure that seemed familiar to Ralph. But he could not tell who it was.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15100">
     Neither could he remember having seen the horse, which was a sorrel with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15110">
     a white left forefoot and a white nose. The men noticed him and reined
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15120">
     up a little. Why he should have been startled by the presence of these
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15130">
     men he could not tell, but an indefinable dread seized him. They
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15140">
     galloped on, and he stood still shivering with a nervous fear. The cold
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15150">
     seemed to have got into his bones. He remembered that the region lying
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15160">
     on Flat Creek and Clifty Creek had the reputation of being infested with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15170">
     thieves, who practiced horse-stealing and house-breaking. For ever since
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15180">
     the day when Murrell's confederate bands were paralyzed by the death of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15190">
     their leader, there have still existed gangs of desperadoes in parts of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15200">
     Southern Indiana and Illinois, and in Iowa, Missouri, Kentucky, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15210">
     Southwest. It is out of these materials that border ruffianism has
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15220">
     grown, and the nine members of the Reno band who were hanged two or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15230">
     three years ago by lynch law[17], were remains of the bad blood that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15240">
     came into the West in the days of Daniel Boone. Shall I not say that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15250">
     these bands of desperadoes still found among the "poor whitey,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15260">
     dirt-eater" class are the outcroppings of the bad blood sent from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15270">
     England in convict-ships? Ought an old country to sow the fertile soil
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15280">
     of a colony with such noxious seed?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15300">
     Before Ralph was able to move, he heard the hoofs of another horse
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15310">
     striking upon the hard ground in an easy pace. The rider was Dr. Small.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15320">
     He checked his horse in a cool way, and stood still a few seconds while
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15330">
     he scrutinized Ralph. Then he rode on, keeping the same easy gait as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15340">
     before, Ralph had a superstitious horror of Henry Small. And, shuddering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15350">
     with cold, he crept like a thief over the fence, past the tree, through
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15360">
     the pasture, back to Pete Jones's, never once thinking of the eyes that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15370">
     looked out of the window at Means's. Climbing the ladder, he got into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15380">
     bed, and shook as with the ague. He tried to reason himself out of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15390">
     foolish terror that possessed him, but he could not.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15410">
     Half an hour later he heard a latch raised. Were the robbers breaking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15420">
     into the house below? He heard a soft tread upon the floor. Should he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15430">
     rise and give the alarm? Something restrained him. He reflected that a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15440">
     robber would be sure to stumble over some of the "brats." So he lay
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15450">
     still and finally slumbered, only awakening when the place in which he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15460">
     slept was full of the smoke of frying grease from the room below.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15480">
     At breakfast Pete Jones scowled. He was evidently angry about something.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15490">
     He treated Ralph with a rudeness not to be overlooked, as if he intended
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15500">
     to bring on a quarrel. Hartsook kept cool, and wished he could drive
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15510">
     from his mind all memory of the past night. Why should men on horseback
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15520">
     have any significance to him? He was trying to regard things in this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15530">
     way, and from a general desire to keep on good terms with his host he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15540">
     went to the stable to offer his services in helping to feed the stock.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15560">
     "Don't want no saft-handed help!" was all he got in return for his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15570">
     well-meant offer. But just as he turned to leave the stable he saw what
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15580">
     made him tremble again. There was the same sorrel horse with a white
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15590">
     left forefoot and a white nose.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15610">
     To shake off his nervousness, Ralph started to school before the time.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15620">
     But, plague upon plagues! Mirandy Means, who had seen him leave Pete
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15630">
     Jones's, started just in time to join him where he came into the big
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15640">
     road. Ralph was not in a good humor after his wakeful night, and to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15650">
     thus dogged by Mirandy did not help the matter. So he found himself
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15660">
     speaking crabbedly to the daughter of the leading trustee, in spite of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15670">
     himself.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15690">
     "Hanner's got a bad cold this mornin' from bein' out last night, and she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15700">
     can't come to spellin'-school to-night," began Mirandy, in her most
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15710">
     simpering voice.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15730">
     Ralph had forgotten that there was to be another spelling-school. It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15740">
     seemed to him an age since the orthographical conflict of the past
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15750">
     night. This remark of Mirandy's fell upon his ear like an echo from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15760">
     distant past. He had lived a lifetime since, and was not sure that he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15770">
     was the same man who was spelling for dear life against Jim Phillips
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15780">
     twelve hours before. But he was sorry to hear that Hannah had a cold. It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15790">
     seemed to him, in his depressed state, that he was to blame for it. In
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15800">
     fact, it seemed to him that he was to blame for a good many things. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15810">
     seemed to have been committing sins in spite of himself. Broken nerves
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15820">
     and sleepless nights often result in a morbid conscience. And what
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15830">
     business had he to wander over this very road at two o'clock in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15840">
     morning, and to see three galloping horsemen, one of them on a horse
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15850">
     with a white left forefoot and a white nose? What business had he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15860">
     watching Dr. Small as he went home from the bedside of a dying patient
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15870">
     near daylight in the morning? And because he felt guilty he felt cross
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15880">
     with Mirandy, and to her remark about Hannah he only replied that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15890">
     "Hannah was a smart girl."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15910">
     "Yes," said Mirandy, "Bud thinks so."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15930">
     "Does he?" said Ralph.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15950">
     "I should say so. What's him and her been a-courtin' fer for a year ef
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15960">
     he didn't think she was smart? Marm don't like it; but ef Bud and her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15970">
     does, and they seem to, I don't see as it's marm's lookout."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_15990">
     When one is wretched, there is a pleasure in being entirely wretched.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16000">
     Ralph felt that he must have committed some unknown crime, and that some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16010">
     Nemesis was following him. Was Hannah deceitful? At least, if she were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16020">
     not, he felt sure that he could supplant Bud. But what right had he to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16030">
     supplant Bud?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16050">
     "Did you hear the news?" cried Shocky, running out to meet him. "The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16060">
     Dutchman's house was robbed last night."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16080">
     Ralph thought of the three men on horseback, and to save his life he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16090">
     could not help associating Dr. Small with them. And then he remembered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16100">
     the sorrel horse with the left forefoot and muzzle white, and he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16110">
     recalled the sound he had heard as of the lifting of a latch. And it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16120">
     really seemed to him that in knowing what he did he was in some sense

     guilty of the robbery.

     OMINOUS REMARKS OF MR. JONES.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16260">
     The school-master's mind was like ancient Gaul--divided into three
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16270">
     parts. With one part he mechanically performed his school duties. With
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16280">
     another he asked himself, What shall I do about the robbery? And with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16290">
     the third he debated about Bud and Hannah. For Bud was not present, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16300">
     it was clear that he was angry, and there was a storm brewing. In fact,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16310">
     it seemed to Ralph that there was a storm brewing all round the sky. For
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16320">
     Pete Jones was evidently angry at the thought of having been watched,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16330">
     and it was fair to suppose that Dr. Small was not in any better humor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16340">
     than usual. And so, between Bud's jealousy and revenge and the suspicion
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16350">
     and resentment of the men engaged in the robbery at "the Dutchman's" (as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16360">
     the only German in the whole region was called), Ralph's excited nerves
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16370">
     had cause for tremor. At one moment he would resolve to have Hannah at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16380">
     all costs. In the next his conscience would question the rightfulness of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16390">
     the conclusion. Then he would make up his mind to tell all he knew
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16400">
     about the robbery. But if he told his suspicions about Small, nobody
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16410">
     would believe him. And if he told about Pete Jones, he really could tell
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16420">
     only enough to bring vengeance upon himself. And how could he explain
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16430">
     his own walk through the pasture and down the road? What business had he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16440">
     being out of bed at two o'clock in the morning? The circumstantial
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16450">
     evidence was quite as strong against him as against the man on the horse
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16460">
     with the white left forefoot and the white nose. Suspicion might fasten
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16470">
     on himself. And then what would be the effect on his prospects? On the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16480">
     people at Lewisburg? On Hannah? It is astonishing how much instruction
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16490">
     and comfort there is in a bulldog. This slender school-master, who had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16500">
     been all his life repressing the animal and developing the finer nature,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16510">
     now found a need of just what the bulldog had. And so, with the thought
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16520">
     of how his friend the dog would fight in a desperate strait, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16530">
     determined to take hold of his difficulties as Bull took hold of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16540">
     raccoon. Moral questions he postponed for careful decision. But for the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16550">
     present he set his teeth together in a desperate, bulldog fashion, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16560">
     he set his feet down slowly, positively, bulldoggedly. After a wretched
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16570">
     supper at Pete Jones's he found himself at the spelling-school, which,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16580">
     owing to the absence of Hannah, and the excitement about the burglary,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16590">
     was a dull affair. Half the evening was spent in talking in little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16600">
     knots. Pete Jones had taken the afflicted "Dutchman" under his own
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16610">
     particular supervision.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16630">
     "I s'pose," said Pete, "that them air fellers what robbed your house

     THE STRUGGLE IN THE DARK
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16980">
     It was a long, lonesome, fearful night that the school-master passed,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_16990">
     lying with nerves on edge and eyes wide open in that comfortless bed in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17000">
     the "furdest corner" of the loft of Pete Jones's house, shivering with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17010">
     cold, while the light snow that was falling sifted in upon the ragged
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17020">
     patch-work quilt that covered him. Nerves broken by sleeplessness
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17030">
     imagine many things, and for the first hour Ralph felt sure that Pete
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17040">
     would cut his throat before morning.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17060">
     And you, friend Callow, who have blunted your palate by swallowing the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17070">
     Cayenne pepper of the penny-dreadfuls, you wish me to make this night
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17080">
     exciting by a hand-to-hand contest between Ralph and a robber. You would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17090">
     like it better if there were a trap-door. There's nothing so convenient
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17100">
     as a trap-door, unless it be a subterranean passage. And you'd like
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17110">
     something of that sort just here. It's so pleasant to have one's hair
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17120">
     stand on end, you know, when one is safe from danger to one's self. But
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17130">
     if you want each individual hair to bristle with such a "Struggle in

     the Dark," you can buy trap-doors and subterranean passages dirt cheap
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17150">
     at the next news-stand. But it was, indeed, a real and terrible
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17160">
     "Struggle in the Dark" that Ralph fought out at Pete Jones's.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17180">
     When he had vanquished his fears of personal violence by reminding
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17190">
     himself that it would be folly for Jones to commit murder in his own
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17200">
     house, the question of Bud and Hannah took the uppermost place in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17210">
     thoughts. And as the image of Hannah spelling against the master came up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17220">
     to him, as the memory of the walk, the talk, the box-elder tree, and all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17230">
     the rest took possession of him, it seemed to Ralph that his very life
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17240">
     depended upon his securing her love. He would shut his teeth like the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17250">
     jaws of a bulldog, and all Bud's muscles should not prevail over his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17260">
     resolution and his stratagems.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17280">
     It was easy to persuade himself that this was right. Hannah ought not to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17290">
     throw herself away on Bud Means. Men of some culture always play their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17300">
     conceit off against their consciences. To a man of literary habits it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17310">
     usually seems to be a great boon that he confers on a woman when he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17320">
     gives her his love. Reasoning thus, Ralph had fixed his resolution, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17330">
     if the night had been shorter, or sleep possible, the color of his life
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17340">
     might have been changed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17360">
     But some time along in the tedious hours came the memory of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17370">
     childhood, the words of his mother, the old Bible stories, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17380">
     aspiration after nobility of spirit, the solemn resolutions to be true
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17390">
     to his conscience. These angels of the memory came flocking back before
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17400">
     the animal, the bull-doggedness, had "set," as workers in plaster say.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17410">
     He remembered the story of David and Nathan, and it seemed to him that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17420">
     he, with all his abilities and ambitions and prospects, was about to rob
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17430">
     Bud of the one ewe-lamb, the only thing he had to rejoice in in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17440">
     life. In getting Hannah, he would make himself unworthy of Hannah. And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17450">
     then there came to him a vision of the supreme value of a true
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17460">
     character; how it was better than success, better than to be loved,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17470">
     better than heaven. And how near he had been to missing it! And how
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17480">
     certain he was, when these thoughts should fade, to miss it! He was as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17490">
     one fighting for a great prize who feels his strength failing and is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17500">
     sure of defeat.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17520">
     This was the real, awful "Struggle in the Dark." A human soul fighting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17530">
     with heaven in sight, but certain of slipping inevitably into hell! It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17540">
     was the same old battle. The Image of God fought with the Image of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17550">
     Devil. It was the same fight that Paul described so dramatically when he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17560">
     represented the Spirit as contending with the Flesh. Paul also called
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17570">
     this dreadful something the Old Adam, and I suppose Darwin would call it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17580">
     the remains of the Wild Beast. But call it what you will, it is the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17590">
     battle that every well-endowed soul must fight at some point. And to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17600">
     Ralph it seemed that the final victory of the Evil, the Old Adam, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17610">
     Flesh, the Wild Beast, the Devil, was certain. For, was not the pure,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17620">
     unconscious face of Hannah on the Devil's side? And so the battle had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17630">
     just as well be given up at once, for it must be lost in the end.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17650">
     But to Ralph, lying there in the still darkness, with his conscience as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17660">
     wide awake as if it were the Day of Doom, there seemed something so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17670">
     terrible in this overflow of the better nature which he knew to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17680">
     inevitable as soon as the voice of conscience became blunted, that he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17690">
     looked about for help. He did not at first think of God; but there came
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17700">
     into his thoughts the memory of a travel-worn Galilean peasant, hungry,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17710">
     sleepy, weary, tempted, tried, like other men, but having a strange,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17720">
     divine Victory in him by which everything evil was vanquished at his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17730">
     coming. He remembered how He had reached out a Hand to every helpless
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17740">
     one, how He was the Helper of every weak one. And out of the depths of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17750">
     his soul he cried to the Helper, and found comfort. Not victory, but,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17760">
     what is better, strength. And so, without a thought of the niceties of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17770">
     theological distinctions, without dreaming that it was the beginning of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17780">
     a religious experience, he found what he needed, help. And the Helper
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_17790">
     gave His beloved sleep.

     Ralph took advantage of the opportunity to talk with him. The master

     "Poor old tree!" said Shocky, pointing to a crooked and gnarled elm

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_18070">
     standing by itself in the middle of a field. For when the elm, naturally

     "Why do you say 'poor old tree'?" asked Ralph.

     sublime in the quiet voice with which he would say, "Cold water, if you

     smothered the old hag with flattery. "Many's the case I've cured with

     "There you showed yer science, doctor! They's no power in a pullet. The

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_19570">
     And here the old woman got down a bottle of grease. "That's ile from a

    </p>

     allude to the robbery. And once on the robbery the doctor's course was

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20600">
     recently from Massachusetts. How many people there are in the most
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20610">
     cultivated communities whose education is partial!
    </p>

     "It's very common for school-master to dig in the elements at the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20650">
     celestial empires (of which there are three--China, Virginia,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20660">
     Massachusetts), Miss Martha was not averse to reminding outside
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20670">
     barbarians of her good fortune in this regard. It did her good to speak
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20680">
     of the East.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20700">
     Now Ralph was amused with Miss Martha. She really had a good deal of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20710">
     intelligence despite her affectation, and conversation with her was both
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20720">
     interesting and diverting. It helped him to forget Hannah, and Bud, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20730">
     the robbery, and all the rest, and she was so delighted to find somebody
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20740">
     to make an impression on that she had come out to talk while Ralph was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20750">
     at work. But just at this moment the school-master was not so much
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20760">
     interested in her interesting remarks, nor so much amused by her amusing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20770">
     remarks, as he should have been. He saw a man coming down the road
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20780">
     riding one horse and leading another, and he recognized the horses at a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20790">
     distance. It must be Bud who was riding Means's bay mare and leading
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20800">
     Bud's roan colt. Bud had been to mill, and as the man who owned the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20810">
     horse-mill kept but one old blind horse himself, it was necessary that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20820">
     Bud should take two. It required three horses to run the mill; the old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20830">
     blind one could have ground the grist, but the two others had to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20840">
     overcome the friction of the clumsy machine. But it was not about the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20850">
     horse-mill that Ralph was thinking nor about the two horses. Since that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20860">
     Wednesday evening on which he escorted Hannah home from the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20870">
     spelling-school he had not seen Bud Means. If he had any lingering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20880">
     doubts of the truth of what Mirandy had said, they had been dissipated
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20890">
     by the absence of Bud from school.

     "When I was to Bosting--" Miss Martha was _to_ Boston only once in her

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20930">
     occurrence of her life, she did not hesitate to air her reminiscences of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20940">
     it frequently. "When I was to Bosting," she was just saying, when,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20950">
     following the indication of Ralph's eyes, she saw Bud coming up the hill
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20960">
     near Squire Hawkins's house. Bud looked red and sulky, and to Ralph's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20970">
     and Miss Martha Hawkins's polite recognitions he returned only a surly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20980">
     nod. They both saw that he was angry. Ralph was able to guess the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_20990">
     meaning of his wrath.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21010">
     Toward evening Ralph strolled through the Squire's cornfield toward the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21020">
     woods. The memory of the walk with Hannah was heavy upon the heart of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21030">
     the young master, and there was comfort in the very miserableness of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21040">
     cornstalks with their disheveled blades hanging like tattered banners
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21050">
     and rattling discordantly in the rising wind. Wandering without purpose,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21060">
     Ralph followed the rows of stalks first one way and then the other in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21070">
     zigzag line, turning a right angle every minute or two. At last he came
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21080">
     out in a woods mostly of beech, and he pleased his melancholy fancy by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21090">
     kicking the dry and silky leaves before him in billows, while the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21100">
     soughing of the wind through the long, vibrant boughs and slender twigs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21110">
     of the beech forest seemed to put the world into the wailing minor key
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21120">
     of his own despair.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21140">
     What a fascination there is in a path come upon suddenly without a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21150">
     knowledge of its termination! Here was one running in easy, irregular
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21160">
     curves through the wood, now turning gently to the right in order to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21170">
     avoid a stump, now swaying suddenly to the left to gain an easier
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21180">
     descent at a steep place, and now turning wantonly to the one side or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21190">
     the other, as if from very caprice in the man who by idle steps
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21200">
     unconsciously marked the line of the foot-path at first. Ralph could not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21210">
     resist the impulse--who could?--to follow the path and find out its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21220">
     destination, and following it he came presently into a lonesome hollow,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21230">
     where a brook gurgled among the heaps of bare limestone rocks that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21240">
     filled its bed. Following the path still, he came upon a queer little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21250">
     cabin built of round logs, in the midst of a small garden-patch inclosed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21260">
     by a brush fence. The stick chimney, daubed with clay and topped with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21270">
     a barrel open at both ends, made this a typical cabin.

     [Illustration: CAPTAIN PEARSON]
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21310">
     It flashed upon Ralph that this place must be Rocky Hollow, and that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21320">
     this was the house of old John Pearson, the one-legged basket-maker, and
    </p>

     his rheumatic wife--the house that hospitably sheltered Shocky.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21340">
     Following his impulse, he knocked and was admitted, and was not a little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21350">
     surprised to find Miss Martha Hawkins there before him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21370">
     "You here, Miss Hawkins?" he said when he had returned Shocky's greeting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21380">
     and shaken hands with the old couple.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21400">
     "Bless you, yes," said the old lady. "That blessed gyirl"--the old lady
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21410">
     called her a girl by a sort of figure of speech perhaps--"that blessed

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21450">
     Miss Martha blushed, and said "she came because Rocky Hollow looked so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21460">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21470">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21500">
     Here the old basket-maker lifted his head from his work, and said:

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_21590">
     "Yes, I was, too!" This in a tone that made Ralph tremble. "Your father

     Sunday-school, the superintendent of which was solemnly arraigned and

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22670">
     holding a Sunday-school. Of course the Hardshells are prodigiously
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22680">
     illiterate, and often vicious. Some of their preachers are notorious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22690">
     drunkards. They sing their sermons out sometimes for three hours at a

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22720">
     Ralph found that he was to ride the "clay-bank mare," the only one of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22730">
     the horses that would "carry double," and that consequently he would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22740">
     have to take Miss Hawkins behind him. If it had been Hannah instead,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22750">
     Ralph might not have objected to this "young Lochinvar" mode of riding
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22760">
     with a lady on "the croup," but Martha Hawkins was another affair. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22770">
     had only this consolation; his keeping the company of Miss Hawkins might
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22780">
     serve to disarm the resentment of Bud. At all events, he had no choice.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22790">
     What designs the Squire had in this arrangement he could not tell; but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22800">
     the clay-bank mare carried him to meeting on that December morning,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22810">
     with Martha Hawkins behind. And as Miss Hawkins was not used to this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22820">
     mode of locomotion, she was in a state of delightful fright every time
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22830">
     the horse sank to the knees in the soft, yellow Flat Creek clay.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22850">
     "We don't go to church so at the East," she said. "The mud isn't so deep
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22860">
     at the East. When I was to Bosting--" but Ralph never heard what
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22870">
     happened when she was to Bosting, for just as she said Bosting the mare
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22880">
     put her foot into a deep hole molded by the foot of the Squire's horse,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22890">
     and already full of muddy water.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22910">
     As the mare's foot went twelve inches down into this track, the muddy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22920">
     water spurted higher than Miss Hawkins's head, and mottled her dress
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22930">
     with golden spots of clay. She gave a little shriek, and declared that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22940">
     she had never "seen it so at the East."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22960">
     The journey seemed a little long to Ralph, who found that the subjects
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22970">
     upon which he and Miss Hawkins could converse were few; but Miss Martha
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22980">
     was determined to keep things going, and once, when the conversation had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_22990">
     died out entirely, she made a desperate effort to renew it by remarking,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23000">
     as they met a man on horseback, "That horse switches his tail just as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23010">
     they do at the East. When I was to Bosting I saw horses switch their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23020">
     tails just that way."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23040">
     What surprised Ralph was to see that Flat Creek went to meeting.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23050">
     Everybody was there--the Meanses, the Joneses, the Bantas, and all the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23060">
     rest. Everybody on Flat Creek seemed to be there, except the old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23070">
     wooden-legged basket-maker. His family was represented by Shocky, who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23080">
     had come, doubtless, to get a glimpse of Hannah, not to hear Mr. Bosaw
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23090">
     preach. In fact, few were thinking of the religious service. They went
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23100">
     to church as a common resort to hear the news, and to find out what was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23110">
     the current sensation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23130">
     On this particular morning there seemed to be some unusual excitement.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23140">
     Ralph perceived it as he rode up. An excited crowd, even though it be at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23150">
     a church-door on Sunday morning, can not conceal its agitation. Ralph
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23160">
     deposited Miss Hawkins on the stile, and then got down himself, and paid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23170">
     her the closest attention to the door. This attention was for Bud's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23180">
     benefit. But Bud only stood with his hands in his pockets, scowling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23190">
     worse than ever. Ralph did not go in at the door. It was not the Flat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23200">
     Creek custom. The men gossiped outside, while the women chatted within.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23210">
     Whatever may have been the cause of the excitement, Ralph could not get
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23220">
     at it. When he entered a little knot of people they became embarrassed,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23230">
     the group dissolved, and its component parts joined other companies.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23240">
     What had the current of conversation to do with him? He overheard Pete
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23250">
     Jones saying that the blamed old wooden leg was in it anyhow. He'd been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23260">
     seen goin' home at two in the mornin'. And he could name somebody else
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23270">
     ef he choosed. But it was best to clean out one at a time. And just then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23280">
     there was a murmur: "Meetin's took up." And the masculine element filled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23290">
     the empty half of the "hewed-log" church.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23310">
     When Ralph saw Hannah looking utterly dejected, his heart smote him, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23320">
     the great struggle set in again. Had it not been for the thought of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23330">
     other battle, and the comforting presence of the Helper, I fear Bud's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23340">
     interests would have fared badly. But Ralph, with the spirit of a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23350">
     martyr, resolved to wait until he knew what the result of Bud's suit
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23360">
     should be, and whether, indeed, the young Goliath had prior claims, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23370">
     he evidently thought he had. He turned hopefully to the sermon,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23380">
     determined to pick up any crumbs of comfort that might fall from Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23390">
     Bosaw's meager table.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23410">
     In reporting a single specimen passage of Mr. Bosaw's sermon, I shall
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23420">
     not take the liberty which Thucydides and other ancient historians did,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23430">
     of making the sermon and putting it into the hero's mouth, but shall
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23440">
     give that which can be vouched for.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23460">
     "You see, my respective hearers," he began--but alas! I can never
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23470">
     picture to you the rich red nose, the see sawing gestures, the nasal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23480">
     resonance, the sniffle, the melancholy minor key, and all that. "My

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23530">
     reflecting that there was a mighty sight of resemblance between some men
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23540">
     and asses. But the preacher did not see this analogy. It lay too close

     to him], "bekase-ah, you see, men-ah is mighty like oxen-ah. Fer they's

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23890">
     hours, he forgot the preacher in noticing a bright green lizard which,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23900">
     having taken up its winter quarters behind the tin candlestick that hung
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23910">
     just back of the preacher's head, had been deceived by the genial warmth
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23920">
     coming from the great box-stove, and now ran out two or three feet from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23930">
     his shelter, looking down upon the red-nosed preacher in a most
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23940">
     confidential and amusing manner. Sometimes he would retreat behind the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23950">
     candlestick, which was not twelve inches from the preacher's head, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23960">
     then rush out again. At each reappearance Betsey Short would stuff her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23970">
     handkerchief into her mouth and shake in a most distressing way. Shocky
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23980">
     wondered what the lizard was winking at the preacher about. And Miss

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_23990">
     Martha thought that it reminded her of a lizard that she see at the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24020">
     Mr. Bosaw would attack his denomination with some fury. In fact, the old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24030">
     preacher outdid himself in his violent indignation at "these people that

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24090">
     As they came out the door Ralph rallied enough to remark: "He did attack
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24100">
     your people, Squire."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24120">
     "Oh, yes," said the Squire. "Didn't you see the Sarpent inspirin' him?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24140">
     But the long, long hours were ended and Ralph got on the clay-bank mare
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24150">
     and rode up alongside the stile whence Miss Martha mounted. And as he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24160">
     went away with a heavy heart, he overheard Pete Jones call out to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24170">
     somebody:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24190">
     "We'll tend to his case &amp; Christmas." Christmas was two days off.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24210">
     And Miss Martha remarked with much trepidation that poor Pearson would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24220">
     have to leave. She'd always been afraid that would be the end of it. It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24230">
     reminded her of something she heard at the East, the time she was down

     A STRUGGLE FOR THE MASTERY
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24580">
     The school had closed on Monday evening as usual. The boys had been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24590">
     talking in knots all day. Nothing but the bulldog in the slender,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24600">
     resolute young master had kept down the rising storm. A teacher who has
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24610">
     lost moral support at home, can not long govern a school. Ralph had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24620">
     effectually lost his popularity in the district, and the worst of it was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24630">
     that he could not divine from just what quarter the ill wind came,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24640">
     except that he felt sure of Small's agency in it somewhere. Even Hannah
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24650">
     had slighted him, when he called at Means's on Monday morning to draw
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24660">
     the pittance of pay that was due him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24680">
     He had expected a petition for a holiday on Christmas day. Such holidays
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24690">
     are deducted from the teacher's time, and it is customary for the boys
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24700">
     to "turn out" the teacher who refuses to grant them, by barring him out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24710">
     of the school-house on Christmas and New Year's morning. Ralph had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24720">
     intended to grant a holiday if it should be asked, but it was not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24730">
     asked. Hank Banta was the ringleader in the disaffection, and he had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24740">
     managed to draw the surly Bud, who was present this morning, into it. It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24750">
     is but fair to say that Bud was in favor of making a request before
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24760">
     resorting to extreme measures, but he was overruled. He gave it as his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24770">
     solemn opinion that the master was mighty peart, and they would be beat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24780">
     anyhow some way, but he would lick the master fer two cents ef he warn't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24790">
     so slim that he'd feel like he was fighting a baby.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24810">
     And all that day things looked black. Ralph's countenance was cold and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24820">
     hard as stone, and Shocky trembled where he sat. Betsey Short tittered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24830">
     rather more than usual. A riot or a murder would have seemed amusing to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24840">
     her.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24860">
     School was dismissed, and Ralph, instead of returning to the Squire's,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24870">
     set out for the village of Clifty, a few miles away. No one knew what he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24880">
     went for, and some suggested that he had "sloped."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24900">
     But Bud said "he warn't that air kind. He was one of them air sort as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24910">
     died in their tracks, was Mr. Hartsook. They'd find him on the ground
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24920">
     nex' morning, and he lowed the master war made of that air sort of stuff
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24930">
     as would burn the dog-on'd ole school-house to ashes, or blow it into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24940">
     splinters, but what he'd beat. Howsumdever he'd said he was a-goin' to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24950">
     help, and help he would; but all the sinno in Golier wouldn't be no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24960">
     account again the cute they was in the head of the master."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24980">
     But Bud, discouraged as he was with the fear of Ralph's "cute," went
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_24990">
     like a martyr to the stake and took his place with the rest in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25000">
     school-house at nine o'clock at night. It may have been Ralph's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25010">
     intention to preoccupy the school-house, for at ten o'clock Hank Banta
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25020">
     was set shaking from head to foot at seeing a face that looked like the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25030">
     master's at the window. He waked up Bud and told him about it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25050">
     "Well, what are you a-tremblin' about, you coward?" growled Bud. "He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25060">
     won't shoot you; but he'll beat you at this game, I'll bet a hoss, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25070">
     me, too, and make us both as 'shamed of ourselves as dogs with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25080">
     tin-kittles to their tails. You don't know the master, though he did
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25090">
     duck you. But he'll larn you a good lesson this time, and me too, like
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25100">
     as not." And Bud soon snored again, but Hank shook with fear every time
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25110">
     he looked at the blackness outside the windows. He was sure he heard
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25120">
     foot-falls. He would have given anything to have been at home.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25140">
     When morning came, the pupils began to gather early. A few boys who were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25150">
     likely to prove of service in the coming siege were admitted through the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25160">
     window, and then everything was made fast, and a "snack" was eaten.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25180">
     "How do you 'low he'll get in?" said Hank, trying to hide his fear.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25200">
     "How do I 'low?" said Bud. "I don't 'low nothin' about it. You might as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25210">
     well ax me where I 'low the nex' shootin' star is a-goin' to drap. Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25220">
     Hartsook's mighty onsartin. But he'll git in, though, and tan your hide
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25230">
     fer you, you see ef he don't. _Ef_ he don't blow up the school-house
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25240">
     with gunpowder!" This last was thrown in by way of alleviating the fears
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25250">
     of the cowardly Hank, for whom Bud had a great contempt.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25270">
     The time for school had almost come. The boys inside were demoralized by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25280">
     waiting. They began to hope that the master had "sloped." They dreaded

     to see him coming.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25310">
     "I don't believe he'll come," said Hank, with a cold shiver. "It's past
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25320">
     school-time."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25340">
     "Yes, he will come, too," said Bud. "And he 'lows to come in here mighty
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25350">
     quick. I don't know how. But he'll be a-standin' at that air desk when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25360">
     it's nine o'clock. I'll bet a thousand dollars on that. _Ef_ he don't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25370">
     take it into his head to blow us up!" Hank was now white.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25390">
     Some of the parents came along, accidentally of course, and stopped to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25400">
     see the fun, sure that Bud would thrash the master if he tried to break
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25410">
     in. Small, on the way to see a patient perhaps, reined up in front of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25420">
     the door. Still no Ralph. It was just five minutes before nine. A rumor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25430">
     now gained currency that he had been seen going to Clifty the evening
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25440">
     before, and that he had not come back, though in fact Ralph had come
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25450">
     back, and had slept at Squire Hawkins's.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25470">
     "There's the master," cried Betsey Short, who stood out in the road
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25480">
     shivering and giggling alternately. For Ralph at that moment emerged
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25490">
     from the sugar-camp by the school-house, carrying a board.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25510">
     "Ho! ho!" laughed Hank, "he thinks he'll smoke us out. I guess he'll
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25520">
     find us ready." The boys had let the fire burn down, and there was now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25530">
     nothing but hot hickory coals on the hearth.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25550">
     "I tell you he'll come in. He didn't go to Clifty fer nothing" said Bud,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25560">
     who sat still on one of the benches which leaned against the door. "I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25570">
     don't know how, but they's lots of ways of killing a cat besides chokin'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25580">
     her with butter. He'll come in--_ef_ he don't blow us all sky-high!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25600">
     Ralph's voice was now heard, demanding that the door be opened.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25620">
     "Let's open her," said Hank, turning livid with fear at the firm,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25630">
     confident tone of the master.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25650">
     Bud straightened himself up. "Hank, you're a coward. I've got a mind to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25660">
     kick you. You got me into this blamed mess, and now you want to

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25680">
     out flat of your back afore you can say Jack Robinson."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25700">
     The teacher was climbing to the roof with the board in hand.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25720">
     "That air won't win," laughed Pete Jones outside. He saw that there was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25730">
     no smoke. Even Bud began to hope that Ralph would fail for once. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25740">
     master was now on the ridge-pole of the school-house. He took a paper
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25750">
     from his pocket, and deliberately poured the contents down the chimney.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25770">
     Mr. Pete Jones shouted "Gunpowder!" and set off down the road to be out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25780">
     of the way of the explosion. Dr. Small remembered, probably, that his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25790">
     patient might die while he sat here, and started on.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25810">
     But Ralph emptied the paper, and laid the board over the chimney. What a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25820">
     row there was inside! The benches that were braced against the door were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25830">
     thrown down, and Hank Banta rushed out, rubbing his eyes, coughing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25840">
     frantically, and sure that he had been blown up. All the rest followed,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25850">
     Bud bringing up the rear sulkily, but coughing and sneezing for dear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25860">
     life. Such a smell of sulphur as came from that school-house!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25880">
     Betsey had to lean against the fence to giggle.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25900">
     [Illustration: FIRE AND BRIMSTONE]
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25920">
     As soon as all were out, Ralph threw the board off the chimney, leaped
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25930">
     to the ground, entered the school-house, and opened the windows. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25940">
     school soon followed him, and all was still.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25960">
     "Would he thrash?" This was the important question in Hank Banta's mind.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25970">
     And the rest looked for a battle with Bud.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_25990">
     "It is just nine o'clock," said Ralph, consulting his watch, "and I'm
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26000">
     glad to see you all here promptly. I should have given you a holiday if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26010">
     you had asked me like gentlemen yesterday. On the whole, I think I shall
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26020">
     give you a holiday, anyhow. The school is dismissed."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26040">
     And Hank felt foolish.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26060">
     And Bud secretly resolved to thrash Hank or the master, he didn't care
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26070">
     which.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26090">
     And Mirandy looked the love she could not utter.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26110">
     And Betsey giggled.

     A CRISIS WITH BUD.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26200">
     Ralph sat still at his desk. The school had gone. All at once he became
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26210">
     conscious that Shocky sat yet in his accustomed place upon the hard,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26220">
     backless bench.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26240">
     "Why, Shocky, haven't you gone yet?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26260">
     "No--sir--I was waitin' to see if you warn't a-goin', too--I--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26280">
     "Well?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26300">
     "I thought it would make me feel as if God warn't quite so fur away to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26310">
     talk to you. It did the other day."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26330">
     The master rose and put his hand on Shocky's head. Was it the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26340">
     brotherhood in affliction that made Shocky's words choke him so? Or, was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26350">
     it the weird thoughts that he expressed? Or, was it the recollection
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26360">
     that Shocky was Hannah's brother? Hannah so far, far away from him now!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26370">
     At any rate, Shocky, looking up for the smile on which he fed, saw the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26380">
     relaxing of the master's face, that had been as hard as stone, and felt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26390">
     just one hot tear on his hand.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26410">
     "P'r'aps God's forgot you, too," said Shocky in a sort of half
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26420">
     soliloquy. "Better get away from Flat Creek. You see God forgets
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26430">
     everybody down here. 'Cause 'most everybody forgets God, 'cept Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26440">
     Bosaw, and I 'low God don't no ways keer to be remembered by sich as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26450">
     him. Leastways I wouldn't if I was God, you know. I wonder what becomes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26460">
     of folks when God forgets 'em?" And Shocky, seeing that the master had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26470">
     resumed his seat and was looking absently into the fire, moved slowly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26480">
     out the door.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26500">
     "Shocky!" called the master.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26520">
     The little poet came back and stood before him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26540">
     "Shocky, you mustn't think God has forgotten you. God brings things out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26550">
     right at last." But Ralph's own faith was weak, and his words sounded
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26560">
     hollow and hypocritical to himself. Would God indeed bring things out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26570">
     right?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26590">
     He sat musing a good while, trying to convince himself of the truth of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26600">
     what he had just been saying to Shocky--that God would indeed bring
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26610">
     things out right at last. Would it all come out right if Bud married
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26620">
     Hannah? Would it all come out right if he were driven from Flat Creek
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26630">
     with a dark suspicion upon his character? Did God concern himself with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26640">
     these things? Was there any God? It was the same old struggle between
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26650">
     Doubt and Faith. And when Ralph looked up, Shocky had departed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26670">
     In the next hour Ralph fought the old battle of Armageddon. I shall not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26680">
     describe it. You will fight it in your own way. No two alike. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26690">
     important thing is the End. If you come out as he did, with the doubt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26700">
     gone and the trust in God victorious, it matters little just what shape
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26710">
     the battle may take. Since Jacob became Israel there have never been two
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26720">
     such struggles alike, save in that they all end either in victory or in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26730">
     defeat.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26750">
     It was after twelve o'clock on that Christmas day when Ralph put his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26760">
     head out the door of the school-house and called out: "Bud, I'd like to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26770">
     see you."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26790">
     Bud did not care to see the master, for he had inly resolved to "thrash
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26800">
     him" and have done with him. But he couldn't back out, certainly not in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26810">
     sight of the others who were passing along the road with him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26830">
     "I don't want the rest of you," said Ralph in a decided way, as he saw
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26840">
     that Hank and one or two others were resolved to come also.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26860">
     "Thought maybe you'd want somebody to see far play," said Hank as he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26870">
     went off sheepishly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26890">
     "If I did, you would be the last one I should ask," said Ralph. "There's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26900">
     no unfair play in Bud, and there is in you." And he shut the door.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26920">
     "Now, looky here, Mr. Ralph Hartsook," said Bud. "You don't come no gum
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26930">
     games over me with your saft sodder and all that. I've made up my mind.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26940">
     You've got to promise to leave these 'ere digging, or I've got to thrash
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26950">
     you."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26970">
     "You'll have to thrash me, then," said Ralph, turning a little pale, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26980">
     remembering the bulldog. "But you'll tell me what It's all about, won't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_26990">
     you?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_27010">
     "You know well enough. Folks says you know more 'bout the robbery at the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_27020">
     Dutchman's than you orter. But I don't believe them. Fer them as says it

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_27040">
     tell you what it _is_ fer. So now, if you won't travel, why, take off
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_27050">
     your coat and git ready fer a thrashing."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_27070">
     The master took off his coat and showed his slender arms. Bud laid his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_27080">
     off, and showed the physique of a prize-fighter.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_27100">
     "You a'n't a-goin to fight _me_?" said Bud.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_27120">
     "Not unless you make me."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_27140">
     "Why I could chaw you all up."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_27160">
     "I know that."

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_27180">
     "Well, you're the grittiest feller I ever did see, and ef you'd jest kep

     There was no conscientious difficulty now in the way of his claiming

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_27780">
     He could have Hannah If he could win her. But there came slowly back the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_27790">
     recollection of his lost standing in Flat Creek. There was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_27800">
     circumstantial evidence against him. It was evident that Hannah believed

     something of this. What other stones Small might have put in circulation
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_27820">
     he did not know. Would Small try to win Hannah's love to throw it away
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_27830">
     again, as he had done with others? At least he would not spare any pains

     stopped he would not have courage to go on.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28230">
     Ralph said that he did not belong to any church, and he was afraid he

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28250">
     is better than sympathy, a yearning for sympathy.
    </p>

     "You see," said Bud, "I wanted to git out of this low-lived, Flat Crick

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28320">
     That didn't seem no cure for me, I went to a revival over at Clifty.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28330">
     Well, 'twarn't no use. First night they was a man that spoke about Jesus

     Christ in sech a way that I wanted to foller him everywhere. But I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28350">
     didn't feel fit. Next night I come back with my mind made up that I'd
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28360">
     try Jesus Christ, and see ef he'd have me. But laws! they was a big man
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28370">
     that night that preached hell. Not that I don't believe they's a hell.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28380">
     They's plenty not a thousand miles away as deserves it, and I don't know

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28400">
     our faces in sech a way that I got mad. And I says, Well, ef God sends

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28410">
     me to hell he can't make me holler 'nough nohow. You see my dander was

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28420">
     up. And when my dander's up, I wouldn't gin up fer the devil his-self.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28430">
     The preacher was so insultin' with his way of doin' it. He seemed to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28440">
     kind of glad that we was to be damned, and he preached somethin' like
    </p>

     some folks swears. It didn't sound a bit like the Christ the little man
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28460">
     preached about the night afore. So what does me and a lot of fellers do
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28470">
     but slip out and cut off the big preacher's stirrups, and hang 'em on to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28480">
     the rider of the fence, and then set his hoss loose! And from that day,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28490">
     sometimes I did, and sometimes I didn't, want to be better. And to-day

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28500">
     it seemed to me that you must know somethin' as would help me."

     Ralph gave to Bud of his Struggle in the Dark. The confession of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28560">
     weakness and wicked selfishness was a great comfort to Bud.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28580">
     "Do you think that Jesus Christ would--would--well, do you think he'd

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28610">
     "I think he was a sort of a Flat Creeker himself," said Ralph, slowly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28620">
     and very earnestly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28640">
     "You don't say?" said Bud, almost getting off his seat.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28660">
     "Why, you see the town he lived in was a rough place. It was called
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28670">
     Nazareth, which meant 'Bush-town.'"

     'backwoodsman.'"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28740">
     And Ralph read the different passages which he had studied at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28750">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28760">
     the publicans, the harlots, the poor, who came to him. And he read about

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28770">
     Nathanael, who lived only six miles away, saying, 'Can any good thing

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28800">
     "Jus' what Clifty folks says about Flat Crick," broke in Bud.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28820">
     "Do you think I could begin without being baptized?" he added
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28900">
     This shocked Ralph's veneration a little. But it was the sincere

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28910">
     utterance of an earnest soul. It may not have been an orthodox start,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_28920">

     THE CHURCH MILITANT.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29380">
     Bud was doubly enlisted on the side of John Pearson, the basket-maker.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29390">
     In the first place, he knew that this persecution of the unpopular old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29400">
     man was only a blind to save somebody else; that they were thieves who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29410">
     cried, "Stop thief!" And he felt consequently that this was a chance to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29420">
     put his newly-formed resolutions into practice. The Old Testament
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29430">
     religious life, which consists in fighting the Lord's enemies, suited
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29440">
     Bud's temper and education. It might lead to something better. It was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29450">
     the best possible to him, now. But I am afraid I shall have to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29460">
     acknowledge that there was a second motive that moved Bud to this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29470">
     championship. The good heart of Martha Hawkins having espoused the cause
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29480">
     of the basket-maker, the heart of Bud Means could not help feeling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29490">
     warmly on the same side. Blessed is that man in whose life the driving
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29500">
     of duty and the drawing of love impel the same way! But why speak of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29510">
     driving of duty? For already Bud was learning the better lesson of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29520">
     serving God for the love of God.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29540">
     The old basket-maker was the most unpopular man in Flat Creek district.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29550">
     He had two great vices. He would go to Clifty and have a "spree" once in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29560">
     three months. And he would tell the truth in a most unscrupulous manner.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29570">
     A man given to plain speaking was quite as objectionable in Flat Creek
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29580">
     as he would have been in France under the Empire, the Commune, or the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29590">
     Republic, and almost as objectionable as he would be in any refined
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29600">
     community in America. People who live in glass houses have a horror of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29610">
     people who throw stones. And the old basket-maker, having no friends,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29620">
     was a good scape-goat. In driving him off, Pete Jones would get rid of a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29630">
     dangerous neighbor and divert attention from himself. The immediate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29640">
     crime of the basket-maker was that he had happened to see too much.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29660">
     "Mr. Hartsook," said Bud, when they got out into the road, "you'd better
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29670">
     go straight home to the Squire's. Bekase ef this lightnin' strikes a

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29690">
     with us. Which way did you come, Shocky?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29710">
     "Why, I tried to come down the holler, but I met Jones right by the big
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29720">
     road, and he sweared at me and said he'd kill me ef I didn't go back and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29730">
     stay. And so I went back to the house and then slipped out through the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29740">
     graveyard. You see I was bound to come ef I got skinned. For Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29750">
     Pearson's, stuck to me and I mean to stick to him, you see."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29770">
     Bud led Shocky through the graveyard. But when they reached the forest
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29780">
     path from the graveyard he thought that perhaps it was not best to "show
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29790">
     his hand," as he expressed it, too soon.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29810">
     "Now, Shocky," he said, "do you run ahead and tell the ole man that I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29820">
     want to see him right off down by the Spring-in-rock. I'll keep closte
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29830">
     behind you, and ef anybody offers to trouble you, do you let off a yell
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29840">
     and I'll be thar in no time."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29860">
     When Ralph left the school-house he felt mean. There were Bud and Shocky
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29870">
     gone on an errand of mercy, and he, the truant member of the Church of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29880">
     the Best Licks, was not with them. The more he thought of it the more he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29890">
     seemed to be a coward, and the more he despised himself; so, yielding as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29900">
     usual to the first brave impulse, he leaped nimbly over the fence and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29910">
     started briskly through the forest in a direction intersecting the path
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29920">
     on which were Bud and Shocky. He came in sight just in time to see the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29930">
     first conflict of the Church in the Wilderness with her foes.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29950">
     For Shocky's little feet went more swiftly on their eager errand than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29960">
     Bud had anticipated. He got farther out of Bud's reach than the latter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29970">
     intended he should, and he did not discover Pete Jones until Pete, with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_29980">
     his hog-drover's whip, was right upon him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30000">
     Shocky tried to halloo for Bud, but he was like one in a nightmare. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30010">
     yell died into a whisper which could not have been heard ten feet.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30030">
     I shall not repeat Mr. Jones's words. They were frightfully profane. But
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30040">
     he did not stop at words. He swept his whip round and gave little Shocky
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30050">
     one terrible cut. Then the voice was released, and the piercing cry of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30060">
     pain brought Bud down the path flying.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30080">
     "You good-for-nothing scoundrel," growled Bud, "you're a coward and a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30090">
     thief to be a-beatin' a little creetur like him!" and with that Bud
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30100">
     walked up on Jones, who prudently changed position in such a way as to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30110">
     get the upper side of the hill.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30130">
     "Well, I'll gin you the upper side, but come on," cried Bud, "ef you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30140">
     a'n't afeared to fight somebody besides a poor little sickly baby or a

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30150">
     crippled soldier. Come on!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30170">
     [Illustration: Bud Means comes to the rescue of Shocky.]
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30190">
     Pete was no insignificant antagonist. He had been a great fighter, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30200">
     his well-seasoned arms were like iron. He had not the splendid set of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30210">
     Bud, but he had more skill and experience in the rude tournament of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30220">
     fists to which the backwoods is so much given. Now, being out of sight
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30230">
     of witnesses and sure that he could lie about the fight afterward, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30240">
     did not scruple to take advantages which would have disgraced him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30250">
     forever if he had taken them in a public fight on election day or at a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30260">
     muster. He took the uphill side, and he clubbed his whip-stalk, striking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30270">
     Bud with all his force with the heavy end, which, coward-like, he had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30280">
     loaded with lead. Bud threw up his strong left arm and parried the blow,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30290">
     which, however, was so fierce that it fractured one of the bones of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30300">
     arm. Throwing away his whip Pete rushed upon Bud furiously, intending to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30310">
     overpower him, but Bud slipped quickly to one side and let Jones pass
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30320">
     down the hill, and as Jones came up again Means dealt him one crushing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30330">
     blow that sent him full length upon the ground. Nothing but the leaves
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30340">
     saved him from a most terrible fall. Jones sprang to his feet more angry
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30350">
     than ever at being whipped by one whom he regarded as a boy, and drew a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30360">
     long dirk-knife. But he was blind with rage, and Bud dodged the knife,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30370">
     and this time gave Pete a blow on the nose which marred the homeliness
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30380">
     of that feature and doubled the fellow up against a tree ten feet away.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30400">
     Ralph came in sight in time to see the beginning of the fight, and he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30410">
     arrived on the ground just as Pete Jones went down under the well-dealt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30420">
     blow from the only remaining fist of Bud Means.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30440">
     While Ralph examined Bud's disabled left arm Pete picked himself up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30450">
     slowly, and, muttering that he felt "consid'able shuck up like," crawled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30460">
     away like a whipped puppy. To every one whom he met, Pete, whose
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30470">
     intellect seemed to have weakened in sympathy with his frame, remarked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30480">
     feebly that he was consid'able shuck up like, and vouchsafed no other
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30490">
     explanation. Even to his wife he only said that he felt purty
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_30500">
     consid'able shuck up like, and that the boys would have to get on

     "I'm afraid you're going to have trouble with your arm, Bud," said Ralph

     right to knock Jones down at all, why might not Bud do it "heartily as

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31130">
     It was the voice of Hannah Thomson. Hearing that the whole neighborhood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31140">
     was rising against the benefactor of Shocky and of her family, she had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31150">
     slipped away from the eyes of her mistress, and run with breathless
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31160">
     haste to give warning in the cabin on Rocky Branch. Seeing Ralph, she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31170">
     blushed, and went into the cabin.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31190">
     "Well," said Ralph, "the enemy is not coming yet. Let us hold a council

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31220">
     This thought came to Ralph like an inspiration. It pleased the old man's

     whim, and he sat down on the door-step.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31250">
     "Now, I suppose," said Ralph, "that General Winfield Scott always looked
    </p>

     into things a little before he went into a fight. Didn't he?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31280">
     "_To_ be sure," assented the old man.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31300">
     "Well," said Ralph. "What is the condition of the enemy? I suppose the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31330">
     "_To_ be sure," said the old man. The rest were silent, but all felt the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31340">
     statement to be about true.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31360">
     "Next," said Ralph, "I suppose General Winfield Scott would always
    </p>

     inquire into the condition of his own troops. Now let us see. Captain

     Pearson has Bud, who is the right wing, badly crippled by having his arm

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31410">
     "_To_ be sure," said the old man.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31430">
     "And I am the left wing, pretty good at giving advice, but very slender
    </p>

     in a fight."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31460">
     "_To_ be sure," said the old man.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31480">
     "And Shocky and Miss Martha and Hannah good aids, but nothing in a

     battle."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31510">
     "_To_ be sure," said the basket-maker, a little doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31530">
     "Now let's look at the arms and accouterments, I think you call them.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31540">
     Well, this old musket has been loaded--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31560">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31610">
     The old man looked foolish, and muttered "_To_ be sure."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31630">
     "And there isn't another round of ammunition in the house."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31650">
     The old man was silent.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31670">
     "Now let us look at the incumbrances. Here's the old lady and Shocky. If
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31680">
     you fight, the enemy will be pleased. It will give them a chance to kill
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31690">
     you. And then the old lady will die and they will do with Shocky as they

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31720">
     "_To_ be sure," said the old man reflectively.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31740">
     "Now," said Ralph, "General Winfield Scott, under such circumstances,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31750">
     would retreat in good order. Then, when he could muster his forces
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31760">
     rightly, he would drive the enemy from his ground."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31780">
     "To be sure," said the old man. "What ort I to do?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31800">
     "Have you any friends?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31820">
     "Well, yes; ther's my brother over in Jackson Kyounty. I mout go there."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31840">
     "Well," said Bud, "do you just go down to Spring-in-rock and stay there.

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31920">
     "To be sure," said the old man in a broken voice. "I reckon General

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31930">
     Winfield Scott wouldn't disapprove of such a maneuver as that thar."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31950">
     Miss Martha beamed on Bud to his evident delight, for he carried his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31960">
     painful arm part of the way home with her. Ralph noticed that Hannah
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31970">
     looked at _him_ with a look full of contending emotions. He read
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31980">
     admiration, gratitude, and doubt in the expression of her face, as she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_31990">
     turned toward home.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_32010">
     "Well, good-by, ole woman," said Pearson, as he took up his little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_32020">
     handkerchief full of things and started for his hiding-place; "good-by.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_32060">
     hobbled away over the stones, more than ever convinced that God had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_32070">
     forgotten all about things on Flat Creek. He gravely expressed his

     But one visit from Martha Hawkins, ten words of kindly inquiry from her,

     and the remark that his broken arm reminded her of something she had

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_32910">
     that Jesus Christ was a sort of a Flat Creeker himself, were manna in

     the wilderness to Bud.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_32940">
     Poor Shocky was sick. The excitement had been too much for him, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_32950">
     though his fever was very slight it was enough to produce just a little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_32960">
     delirium. Either Ralph or Miss Martha was generally at the cabin.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_32980">
     "They're coming," said Shocky to Ralph, "they're coming. Pete Jones is

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33030">
     And he shivered at every sudden sound. He was never free from this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33040">
     delirious fright except when the master held him tight in his arms. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33050">
     staggered around the floor, the very shadow of Shocky, and was so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33060">
     terrified by the approach of darkness that Ralph staid in the cabin on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33070">
     Wednesday night and Miss Hawkins staid on Thursday night. On Friday, Bud
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33080">
     sent a note to Ralph, askin him to come and see him.

     "You see, Mr. Hartsook, I ha'n't forgot what was said about puttin' in

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33240">
     Ralph thought a minute. He dared not take Shocky to the uncle's where he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33250">
     found his only home. But there was Miss Nancy Sawyer, the old maid who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33260">
     was everybody's blessing. He could ask her to keep him. And, at any

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33270">
     rate, he would save Shocky somehow.

     As he went out in the dusk, he met Hannah in the lane.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33350">
     FACE TO FACE.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33380">
     In the lane, in the dark, under the shadow of the barn, Ralph met Hannah
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33390">
     carrying her bucket of milk (they have no pails in Indiana)[23]. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33400">
     could see only the white foam on the milk, and Hannah's white face.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33410">
     Perhaps it was well that he could not see how white Hannah's face was at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33420">
     that moment when a sudden trembling made her set down the heavy bucket.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33430">
     At first neither spoke. The recollection of all the joy of that walk
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33440">
     together in the night came upon them both. And a great sense of loss
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33450">
     made the night seem supernaturally dark to Ralph. Nor was it any lighter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33460">
     in the hopeless heart of the bound girl. The presence of Ralph did not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33470">
     now, as before, make the darkness of her life light.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33490">
     "Hannah--" said Ralph presently, and stopped. For he could not finish
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33500">
     the sentence. With a rush there came upon him a consciousness of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33510">
     suspicions that filled Hannah's mind. And with it there came a feeling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33520">
     of guilt. He saw himself from her stand-point, and felt a remorse almost
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33530">
     as keen as it could have been had he been a criminal. And this sudden
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33540">
     and morbid sense of his guilt as it appeared to Hannah paralyzed him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33550">
     But when Hannah lifted her bucket with her hand, and the world with her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33560">
     heavy heart, and essayed to pass him, Ralph rallied and said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33580">
     "_You_ don't believe all these lies that are told about me."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33600">
     "I don't believe anything, Mr. Hartsook; that is, I don't want to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33610">
     believe anything against you. And I wouldn't mind anything they say if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33620">
     it wasn't for two things"--here she stammered and looked down.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33640">
     "If it wasn't for what?" said Ralph with a spice of indignant denial in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33650">
     his voice.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33670">
     Hannah hesitated, but Ralph pressed the question with eagerness.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33690">
     "I saw you cross that blue-grass pasture the night--the night that you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33700">
     walked home with me." She would have said the night of the robbery, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33710">
     her heart smote her, and she adopted the more kindly form of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33720">
     sentence.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33740">
     Ralph would have explained, but how?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33760">
     "I did cross the pasture," he began, "but--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33780">
     Just here it occurred to Ralph that there was no reason for his night
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33790">
     excursion across the pasture. Hannah again took up her bucket, but he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33800">
     said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33820">
     "Tell me what else you have against me."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33840">
     "I haven't anything against you. Only I am poor and friendless, and you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33850">
     oughtn't to make my life any heavier. They say that you have paid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33860">
     attention to a great many girls. I don't know why you should want to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33870">
     trifle with me."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33890">
     Ralph answered her this time. He spoke low. He spoke as though he were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33900">
     speaking to God. "If any man says that I ever trifled with any woman, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33910">
     lies. I have never loved but one, and you know who that is. And God
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33920">
     knows."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33940">
     "I don't know what to say, Mr. Hartsook." Hannah's voice was broken.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33950">
     These solemn words of love were like a river in the desert, and she was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33960">
     like a wanderer dying of thirst. "I don't know, Mr. Hartsook. If I was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33970">
     alone, it wouldn't matter. But I've got my blind mother and my poor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33980">
     Shocky to look after. And I don't want to make mistakes. And the world
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_33990">
     is so full of lies I don't know what to believe. Somehow I can't help
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34000">
     believing what you say. You seem to speak so true. But--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34020">
     "But what?" said Ralph.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34040">
     "But you know how I saw you just as kind to Martha Hawkins on Sunday
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34050">
     as--as--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34070">
     "Han--ner!" It was the melodious voice of the angry Mrs. Means, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34080">
     Hannah lifted her pail and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34100">
     Standing in the shadow of his own despair, Ralph felt how dark a night
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34110">
     could be when it had no promise of morning.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34130">
     And Dr. Small, who had been stabling his horse just inside the barn,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34140">
     came out and moved quietly into the house just as though he had not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34150">
     listened intently to every word of the conversation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34170">
     As Ralph walked away he tried to comfort himself by calling to his aid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34180">
     the bulldog in his character. But somehow it did not do him any good.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34190">
     For what is a bulldog but a stoic philosopher? Stoicism has its value,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34200">
     but Ralph had come to a place where stoicism was of no account. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34210">
     memory of the Helper, of his sorrow, his brave and victorious endurance,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34220">
     came when stoicism failed. Happiness might go out of life, but in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34230">
     light of Christ's life happiness seemed but a small element anyhow. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34240">
     love of woman might be denied him, but there still remained what was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34250">
     infinitely more precious and holy, the love of God. There still remained
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34260">
     the possibility of heroic living. Working, suffering, and enduring still
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34270">
     remained. And he who can work for God and endure for God, surely has
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34280">
     yet the best of life left. And, like the knights who could find the Holy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34290">
     Grail only in losing themselves, Hartsook, in throwing his happiness out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34300">
     of the count, found the purest happiness, a sense of the victory of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34310">
     soul over the tribulations of life. The man who knows this victory
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34320">
     scarcely needs the encouragement of the hope of future happiness. There
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34330">
     is a real heaven in bravely lifting the load of one's own sorrow and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34340">
     work.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34360">
     And it was a good thing for Ralph that the danger hanging over Shocky
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34370">
     made immediate action necessary.

     At four o'clock the next morning, in the midst of a driving snow, Ralph
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34580">
     went timidly up the lane toward the homely castle of the Meanses. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34590">
     went timidly, for he was afraid of Bull. But he found Bud waiting for

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34600">
     him, with the roan colt bridled and saddled. The roan colt was really a

     large three-year-old, full of the finest sort of animal life, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34620">
     having, as Bud declared, "a mighty sight of hoss sense fer his age." He

     seemed to understand at once that there was something extraordinary on

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34640">
     hand when he was brought out of his comfortable quarters at four in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34650">
     morning in the midst of a snow-storm. Bud was sure that the roan colt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34660">
     felt his responsibility.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34680">
     In the days that followed, Ralph often had occasion to remember this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34690">
     interview with Bud, who had risked much in bringing his fractured arm
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34700">
     out into the cold, damp air. Jonathan never clave to David more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34710">
     earnestly than did Bud this December morning to Ralph.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34730">
     "You see, Mr. Hartsook," said Bud, "I wish I was well myself. It's hard
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34740">
     to set still. But it's a-doing me a heap of good. I'm like a boy at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34750">
     school. And I'm a-findin' out that doing one's best licks fer others
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34760">
     ain't all they is of it, though it's a good part. I feel like as if I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34770">
     must git Him, you know, to do lots for me. They's always some sums too
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34780">
     hard fer a feller, and he has to ax the master to do 'em, you know. But
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34790">
     see, the roan's a-stomping round. He wants to be off. Do you know I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34800">
     think that hoss knows something's up? I think he puts in his best licks
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34810">
     fer me a good deal better than I do fer Him."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34830">
     Ralph pressed Bud's right hand. Bud rubbed his face against the colt's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34840">
     nose and said: "Put in your best licks, old fellow." And the colt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34850">
     whinnied. How a horse must want to speak! For Bud was right. Men are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34860">
     gods to horses, and they serve their deities with a faithfulness that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34870">
     shames us.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34890">
     Then Ralph sprang into the saddle, and the roan, as if wishing to show
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34900">
     Bud his willingness, broke into a swinging gallop, and was soon lost to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34910">
     the sight of his master in the darkness and the snow. When Bud could no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34920">
     more hear the sound of the roan's footsteps he returned to the house, to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34930">
     lie awake picturing to himself the journey of Ralph with Shocky and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34940">
     roan colt. It was a great comfort to Bud that the roan, which was almost
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34950">
     a part of himself, represented him in this ride. And he knew the roan
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34960">
     well enough to feel sure that he would do credit to his master. "He'll
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34970">
     put in his best licks," Bud whispered to himself many a time before
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_34980">
     daybreak.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35000">
     The ground was but little frozen, and the snow made the roads more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35010">
     slippery than ever. But the rough-shod roan handled his feet dexterously
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35020">
     and with a playful and somewhat self-righteous air, as though he said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35030">
     "Didn't I do it handsomely that time?" Down slippery hills, through deep
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35040">
     mud-holes covered with a slender film of ice he trod with perfect
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35050">
     assurance. And then up over the rough stones of Rocky Hollow, where
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35060">
     there was no road at all, he picked his way through the darkness and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35070">
     snow. Ralph could not tell where he was at last, but gave the reins to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35080">
     the roan, who did his duty bravely, and not without a little flourish,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35090">
     to show that he had yet plenty of spare power.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35110">
     A feeble candle-ray, making the dense snow-fall visible, marked for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35120">
     Ralph the site of the basket-maker's cabin. Miss Martha had been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35130">
     admitted to the secret, and had joined in the conspiracy heartily,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35140">
     without being able to recall anything of the kind having occurred at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35150">
     East, and not remembering having seen or heard of anything of the sort
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35160">
     the time she was to Bosting. She had Shocky all ready, having used some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35170">
     of her own capes and shawls to make him warm.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35190">
     Miss Martha came out to meet Ralph when she heard the feet of the roan
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35200">
     before the door.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35220">
     "O Mr. Hartsook! is that you? What a storm. This is jest the way it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35230">
     snows at the East. Shocky's all ready. He didn't know a thing about it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35240">
     tell I waked him this morning. Ever since that he's been saying that God
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35250">
     hasn't forgot, after all. It's made me cry more'n once." And Shocky
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35260">
     kissed Mrs. Pearson, and told her that when he got away from Flat Creek
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35270">
     he'd tell God all about it, and God would bring Mr. Pearson back again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35280">
     And then Martha Hawkins lifted the frail little form, bundled in shawls,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35290">
     in her arms, and brought him out into the storm; and before she handed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35300">
     him up he embraced her, and said: "O Miss Hawkins! God ha'n't forgot me,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35310">
     after all. Tell Hanner that He ha'n't forgot. I'm going to ask him to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35320">
     git her away from Means's and mother out of the poor-house. I'll ask him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35330">
     just as soon as I get to Lewisburg."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35350">
     Ralph lifted the trembling form into his arms, and the little fellow
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35360">
     only looked up in the face of the master and said: "You see, Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35370">
     Hartsook, I thought God had forgot. But he ha'n't."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35390">
     And the words of the little boy comforted the master also. God had not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35400">
     forgotten him, either!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35420">
     From the moment that Ralph took Shocky into his arms, the conduct of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35430">
     roan colt underwent an entire revolution. Before that he had gone over a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35440">
     bad place with a rush, as though he were ambitious of distinguishing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35450">
     himself by his brilliant execution. Now he trod none the less surely,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35460">
     but he trod tenderly. The neck was no longer arched. He set himself to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35470">
     his work as steadily as though he were twenty years old. For miles he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35480">
     traveled on in a long, swinging walk, putting his feet down carefully
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35490">
     and firmly. And Ralph found the spirit of the colt entering into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35500">
     himself. He cut the snow-storm with his face, and felt a sense of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35510">
     triumph over all his difficulties. The bulldog's jaws had been his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35520">
     teacher, and now the steady, strong, and conscientious legs of the roan
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35530">
     inspired him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35550">
     Shocky had not spoken. He lay listening to the pattering music of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35560">
     horse's feet, doubtless framing the footsteps of the roan colt into an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35570">
     anthem of praise to the God who had not forgot. But as the dawn came on,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35580">
     making the snow whiter, he raised himself and said half-aloud, as he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35590">
     watched the flakes chasing one another in whirling eddies, that the snow
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35600">
     seemed to be having a good time of it. Then he leaned down again on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35610">
     master's bosom, full of a still joy, and only roused himself from his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35620">
     happy reverie to ask what that big, ugly-looking house was.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35640">
     "See, Mr. Hartsook, how big it is, and how little and ugly the windows
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35650">
     is! And the boards is peeling off all over it, and the hogs is right in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35660">
     the front yard. It don't look just like a house. It looks dreadful. What
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35670">
     is it?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35690">
     Ralph had dreaded this question. He did not answer it, but asked Shocky
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35700">
     to change his position a little, and then he quickened the pace of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35710">
     horse. But Shocky was a poet, and a poet understands silence more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35720">
     quickly than he does speech. The little fellow shivered as the truth
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35730">
     came to him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35750">
     "Is that the poor-house?" he said, catching his breath. "Is my mother in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35760">
     that place? _Won't_ you take me in there, so as I can just kiss her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35770">
     once? 'Cause she can't see much, you know. And one kiss from me will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35780">
     make her feel so good. And I'll tell her that God ha'n't forgot." He had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35790">
     raised up and caught hold of Ralph's coat.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35810">
     Ralph had great difficulty in quieting him. He told him that if he went
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35820">
     in there Bill Jones might claim that he was a runaway and belonged
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35830">
     there. And poor Shocky only shivered and said he was cold. A minute
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35840">
     later, Ralph found that he was shaking with a chill, and a horrible
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35850">
     dread came over him. What if Shocky should die? It was only a minute's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35860">
     work to get down, take the warm horse-blanket from under the saddle, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35870">
     wrap it about the boy, then to strip off his own overcoat and add that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35880">
     to it. It was now daylight, and finding, after he had mounted, that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35890">
     Shocky continued to shiver, he put the roan to his best speed for the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35900">
     rest of the way, trotting up and down the slippery hills, and galloping
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35910">
     away on the level ground. How bravely the roan laid himself to his work,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35920">
     making the fence-corners fly past in a long procession! But poor little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35930">
     Shocky was too cold to notice them, and Ralph shuddered lest Shocky
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35940">
     should never be warm again, and spoke to the roan, and the roan
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35950">
     stretched out his head, and dropped one ear back to hear the first word
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35960">
     of command, and stretched the other forward to listen for danger, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35970">
     then flew with a splendid speed down the road, past the patches of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35980">
     blackberry briars, past the elderberry bushes, past the familiar red-haw
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_35990">
     tree in the fence-corner, over the bridge without regard to the threat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_36000">
     of a five-dollar fine, and at last up the long lane into the village,

     where the smoke from the chimneys was caught and whirled round with the

     Semantha. Miss Nancy was a providence, one of those old maids that are

     benedictions to the whole town; one of those in whom the mother-love,

     wanting the natural objects on which to spend itself, overflows all

     most Sunday-school teachers fail to teach, the great lesson of
    </p>

     Christianity, by the side of which all antiquities and geographies and

     carrying the still form of Shocky as reverently as though it had been

     something heavenly, knocked at Miss Nancy Sawyer's door.

     With natural feminine instinct that lady started back when she saw

     Hartsook, for she had just built a fire in the stove, and she now stood
    </p>

     at the door with unwashed face and uncombed hair.

     and amazing justice to his Aunt Matilda's hot buckwheat-cakes and warm
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_36700">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_36710">
     like paradise. How white the table-cloth, how bright the coffee-pot, how
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_36720">
     clean the wood-work, how glistening the brass door-knobs, how spotless
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_36730">
     everything that came under the sovereign sway of Mrs. Matilda White! For
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_36740">
     in every Indiana village as large as Lewisburg, there are generally a
    </p>

     half-dozen women who are admitted to be the best housekeepers. All
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_36760">

    </p>

     pre-eminence. It is at least safe to say that no other in Lewisburg
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_36780">
     stood so high as an enemy to dirt, and as a "rat, roach, and mouse

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_36800">
     uncle, Robert White, Esq., a lawyer in successful practice. Of course no

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_36810">
     member of Mrs. White's family ever stayed at home longer than was
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_36830">
     as possible in order to maintain an equilibrium in his life--much more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_36840">
     comfortable than the stiffly clean house at home. From the time that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_36850">
     Ralph had come to live as a chore-boy at his uncle's, he had ever
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_36860">
     crossed the threshold of Aunt Matilda's temple of cleanliness with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_36870">
     horrible sense of awe. And Walter Johnson, her son by a former marriage,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_36880">
     had--poor, weak-willed fellow!--been driven into bad company and bad
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_36890">
     habits by the wretchedness of extreme civilization. And yet he showed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_36900">
     the hereditary trait, for all the genius which Mrs. White consecrated to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_36910">
     the glorious work of making her house too neat to be habitable, her son
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_36920">
     Walter gave to tying exquisite knots in his colored cravats and combing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_36930">
     his oiled locks so as to look like a dandy barber. And she had no other
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_36940">
     children. The kind Providence that watches over the destiny of children
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_36950">
     takes care that very few of them are lodged in these terribly clean
    </p>

     houses.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_36980">
     But Walter was not at the table, and Ralph had so much anxiety lest his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_36990">
     absence should be significant of evil, that he did not venture to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37000">
     inquire after him as he sat there between Mr. and Mrs. White disposing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37010">
     of Aunt Matilda's cakes with an appetite only justified by his long
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37020">
     morning's ride and the excellence of the brown cakes, the golden honey,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37030">
     and the coffee, enriched, as Aunt Matilda's always was, with the most
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37040">
     generous cream. Aunt Matilda was so absorbed in telling of the doings of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37050">
     the Dorcas Society that she entirely forgot to be surprised at the early
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37060">
     hour of Ralph's arrival. When she had described the number of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37070">
     garments finished to be sent to the Five Points Mission, or the Home for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37080">
     the Friendless, or the South Sea Islands, I forget which, Ralph thought
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37090">
     he saw his chance, while Aunt Matilda was in a benevolent mood, to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37100">
     broach a plan he had been revolving for some time. But when he looked at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37110">
     Aunt Matilda's immaculate--horribly immaculate--housekeeping, his heart
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37120">
     failed him, and he would have said nothing had she not inadvertently
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37130">
     opened the door herself.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37150">
     "How did you get here so early, Ralph?" and Aunt Matilda's face was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37160">
     shadowed with a coming rebuke.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37180">
     "By early rising," said Ralph. But, seeing the gathering frown on his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37190">
     aunt's brow, he hastened to tell the story of Shocky as well as he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37200">
     could. Mrs. White did not give way to any impulse toward sympathy until
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37210">
     she learned that Shocky was safely housed with Miss Nancy Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37230">
     "Yes, Sister Sawyer has no family cares," she said by way of smoothing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37240">
     her slightly ruffled complacency, "she has no family cares, and she can
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37250">
     do those things. Sometimes I think she lets people impose on her and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37260">
     keep her away from the means of grace, and I spoke to our new preacher
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37270">
     about it the last time he was here, and asked him to speak to Sister
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37280">
     Sawyer about staying away from the ordinances to wait on everybody, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37290">
     he is a queer man, and he only said that he supposed Sister Sawyer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37300">
     neglected the inferior ordinances that she might attend to higher ones.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37310">
     But I don't see any sense in a minister of the gospel calling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37320">
     prayer-meeting a lower ordinance than feeding catnip-tea to Mrs. Brown's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37330">
     last baby. But hasn't this little boy--Shocking, or what do you call
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37340">
     him?--got any mother?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37360">
     "Yes," said Ralph, "and that was just what I was going to say." And he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37370">
     proceeded to tell how anxious Shocky was to see his half-blind mother,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37380">
     and actually ventured to wind up his remarks by suggesting that Shocky's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37390">
     mother be invited to stay over Sunday in Aunt Matilda's house.

     "Bless my stars!" said that astounded saint, "fetch a pauper here? What

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37430">
     she wouldn't be fit to sleep in my--" here Aunt Matilda choked. The bare
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37440">
     thought of having a pauper in her billowy beds, whose snowy whiteness
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37450">
     was frightful to any ordinary mortal, the bare thought of the contagion
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37460">
     of the poor-house taking possession of one of her beds, smothered her.
    </p>

     "And then you know sore eyes are very catching."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37490">
     Ralph boiled a little. "Aunt Matilda, do you think Dorcas was afraid of
    </p>

     sore eyes?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37520">
     It was a center shot, and the lawyer-uncle, lawyerlike, enjoyed a good
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37530">
     hit. And he enjoyed a good hit at his wife best of all, for he never
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37540">
     ventured on one himself. But Aunt Matilda felt that a direct reply was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37550">
     impossible. She was not a lawyer but a woman, and so dodged the question
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37560">
     by making a counter-charge.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37580">
     "It seems to me, Ralph, that you have picked up some very low
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37590">
     associates. And you go around at night, I am told. You get over here by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37600">
     daylight, and I hear that you have made common cause with a lame soldier
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37610">
     who acts as a spy for thieves, and that your running about of night is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37620">
     likely to get you into trouble."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37640">
     Ralph was hit this time. "I suppose," he said, "that you've been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37650">
     listening to some of Henry Small's lies."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37670">
     "Why, Ralph, how you talk! The worst sign of all is that you abuse such
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37680">
     a young man as Dr. Small, the most exemplary Christian young man in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37690">
     county. And he is a great friend of yours, for when he was here last
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37700">
     week he did not say a word against you, but looked so sorry when your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37710">
     being in trouble was mentioned. Didn't he, Mr. White?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37730">
     Mr. White, as in duty bound, said yes, but he said yes in a cool,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37740">
     lawyerlike way, which showed that he did not take quite so much stock in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37750">
     Dr. Small as his wife did. This was a comfort to Ralph, who sat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37760">
     picturing to himself the silent flattery which Dr. Small's eyes paid to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37770">
     his Aunt Matilda, and the quiet expression of pain that would flit
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37780">
     across his face when Ralph's name was mentioned. And never until that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37790">
     moment had Hartsook understood how masterful Small's artifices were. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37800">
     had managed to elevate himself in Mrs. White's estimation and to destroy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37810">
     Ralph at the same time, and had managed to do both by a contraction of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37820">
     the eyebrows!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37840">
     But the silence was growing painful and Ralph thought to break it and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37850">
     turn the current of talk from himself by asking after Mrs. White's son.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37870">
     "Where is Walter?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37890">
     "Oh! Walter's doing well. He went down to Clifty three weeks ago to

     Wallie will be led to see the error of his ways by his association with

     Henry. I suppose he would have gone to see you but for the unfavorable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_37940">
     reports that he heard. I hope, Ralph, you too will make the friendship

     A CHARITABLE INSTITUTION.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38210">
     When Ralph got back to Miss Nancy Sawyer's, Shocky was sitting up in bed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38220">
     talking to Miss Nancy and Miss Semantha. His cheeks were a little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38230">
     flushed with fever and the excitement of telling his story; theirs were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38240">
     wet with tears. "Ralph," whispered Miss Nancy, as she drew him into the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38250">
     kitchen, "I want you to get a buggy or a sleigh, and go right over to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38260">
     the poor-house and fetch that boy's mother over here. It'll do me more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38270">
     good than any sermon I ever heard to see that boy in his mother's arms
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38280">
     to-morrow. We can keep the old lady over Sunday."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38300">
     Ralph was delighted, so delighted that he came near kissing good Miss
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38310">
     Nancy Sawyer, whose plain face was glorified by her generosity.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38330">
     But he did not go to the poor-house immediately. He waited until he saw
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38340">
     Bill Jones, the Superintendent of the Poor-House, and Pete Jones, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38350">
     County Commissioner, who was still somewhat shuck up, ride up to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38360">
     court-house. Then he drove out of the village, and presently hitched his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38370">
     horse to the poor-house fence, and took a survey of the outside. Forty
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38380">
     hogs, nearly ready for slaughter, wallowed in a pen in front of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38390">
     forlorn and dilapidated house; for though the commissioners allowed a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38400">
     claim for repairs at every meeting, the repairs were never made, and it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38410">
     would not do to scrutinize Mr. Jones's bills too closely, unless you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38420">
     gave up all hope of renomination to office. One curious effect of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38430">
     political aspirations in Hoopole County, was to shut the eyes that they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38440">
     could not see, to close the ears that they could not hear, and to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38450">
     destroy the sense of smell. But Ralph, not being a politician, smelled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38460">
     the hog-pen without and the stench within, and saw everywhere the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38470">
     transparent fraud, and heard the echo of Jones's cruelty.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38490">
     A weak-eyed girl admitted him, and as he did not wish to make his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38500">
     business known at once, he affected a sort of idle interest in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38510">
     place, and asked to be allowed to look round. The weak-eyed girl watched
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38520">
     him. He found that all the women with children, twenty persons in all,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38530">
     were obliged to sleep in one room, which, owing to the hill-slope, was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38540">
     partly under ground, and which had but half a window for light, and no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38550">
     ventilation, except the chance draft from the door. Jones had declared
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38560">
     that the women with children must stay there--"he warn't goin' to have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38570">
     brats a-runnin' over the whole house." Here were vicious women and good
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38580">
     women, with their children, crowded like chickens in a coop for market.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38590">
     And there were, as usual in such places, helpless, idiotic women with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38600">
     illegitimate children. Of course this room was the scene of perpetual
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38610">
     quarreling and occasional fighting.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38630">
     In the quarters devoted to the insane, people slightly demented and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38640">
     raving maniacs were in the same rooms, while there were also those utter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38650">
     wrecks which sat in heaps on the floor, mumbling and muttering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38660">
     unintelligible words, the whole current of their thoughts hopelessly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38670">
     muddled, turning around upon itself in eddies never ending.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38690">
     "That air woman," said the weak-eyed girl, "used to holler a heap when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38700">
     she was brought in here. But Pap knows how to subjue 'em. He slapped her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38710">
     in the mouth every time she hollered. She don't make no furss now, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38720">
     jist sets down that way all day, and keeps a-whisperin'."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38740">
     Ralph understood it. When she came in she was the victim of mania; but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38750">
     she had been beaten into hopeless idiocy. Indeed this state of incurable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38760">
     imbecility seemed the end toward which all traveled. Shut in these bare
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38770">
     rooms, with no treatment, no exercise, no variety, and meager food,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38780">
     cases of slight derangement soon grew into chronic lunacy.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38800">
     One young woman, called Phil, a sweet-faced person, apparently a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38810">
     farmer's wife, came up to Ralph and looked at him kindly, playing with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38820">
     the buttons on his coat in a childlike simplicity. Her blue-drilling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38830">
     dress was sewed all over with patches of white, representing ornamental
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38840">
     buttons. The womanly instinct toward adornment had in her taken this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38850">
     childish turn.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38870">
     "Don't you think they ought to let me go home?" she said with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38880">
     sweetness and a wistful, longing, home-sick look, that touched Ralph to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38890">
     the heart. He looked at her, and then at the muttering crones, and he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38900">
     could see no hope of any better fate for her. She followed him round the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38910">
     barn-like rooms, returning every now and then to her question. "Don't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38920">
     you think I might go home now?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38940">
     The weak-eyed girl had been called away for a moment, and Ralph stood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38950">
     looking into a cell, where there was a man with a gay red plume in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38960">
     hat and a strip of red flannel about his waist. He strutted up and down
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38970">
     like a drill-sergeant.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_38990">
     "I am General Andrew Jackson," he began. "People don't believe it, but I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39000">
     am. I had my head shot off at Bueny Visty, and the new one that growed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39010">
     on isn't nigh so good as the old one; it's tater on one side[24]. That's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39020">
     why they take advantage of me to shut me up. But I know some things. My
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39030">
     head is tater on one side, but it's all right on t'other. And when I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39040">
     know a thing in the left side of my head, I know it. Lean down here. Let
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39050">
     me tell you something out of the left side. Not out of the tater side,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39060">
     mind ye. I wouldn't a told you if he hadn't locked me up fer nothing.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39070">
     _Bill Jones is a thief_! He sells the bodies of the dead paupers, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39080">
     then sells the empty coffins back to the county agin. But that a'n't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39090">
     all--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39110">
     Just then the weak-eyed girl came back, and, as Ralph moved away,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39120">
     General Jackson called out: "That a'n't all. I'll tell the rest another
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39130">
     time. And that a'n't out of the tater side, you can depend on that.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39140">
     That's out of the left side. Sound as a nut on that side!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39160">
     But Ralph began to wonder where he should find Hannah's mother.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39180">
     "Don't go in there," cried the weak-eyed girl, as Ralph was opening a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39190">
     door. "Ole Mowley's in there, and she'll cuss you."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39210">
     "Oh! well, if that's all, her curses won't hurt," said Hartsook,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39220">
     pushing open the door. But the volley of blasphemy and vile language
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39230">
     that he received made him stagger. The old hag paced the floor, abusing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39240">
     everybody that came in her way. And by the window, in the same room,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39250">
     feeling the light that struggled through the dusty glass upon her face,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39260">
     sat a sorrowful, intelligent Englishwoman. Ralph noticed at once that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39270">
     she was English, and in a few moments he discovered that her sight was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39280">
     defective. Could it be that Hannah's mother was the room-mate of this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39290">
     loathsome creature, whose profanity and obscenity did not intermit for a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39300">
     moment?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39320">
     Happily the weak-eyed girl had not dared to brave the curses of Mowley.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39330">
     Ralph stepped forward to the woman by the window, and greeted her.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39350">
     "Is this Mrs. Thomson?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39370">
     "That is my name, sir," she said, turning her face toward Ralph, who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39380">
     could not but remark the contrast between the thorough refinement of her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39390">
     manner and her coarse, scant, unshaped pauper-frock of blue drilling.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39410">
     "I saw your daughter yesterday."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39430">
     "Did you see my boy?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39450">
     There was a tremulousness in her voice and an agitation in her manner
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39460">
     which disclosed the emotion she strove in vain to conceal. For only the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39470">
     day before Bill Jones had informed her that Shocky would be bound out on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39480">
     Saturday, and that she would find that goin' agin him warn't a payin'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39490">
     business, so much as some others he mout mention.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39510">
     Ralph told her about Shocky's safety. _I_ shall not write down the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39520">
     conversation here. Critics would say that it was an overwrought scene.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39530">
     As if all the world were as cold as they! All I can tell is that this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39540">
     refined woman had all she could do to control herself in her eagerness
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39550">
     to get out of her prison-house, away from the blasphemies of Mowley,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39560">
     away from the insults of Jones, away from the sights and sounds and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39570">
     smells of the place, and, above all, her eagerness to fly to the little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39580">
     shocky-head from whom she had been banished for two years. It seemed to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39590">
     her that she could gladly die now, if she could die with that flaxen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39600">
     head upon her bosom.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39620">
     And so, in spite of the opposition of Bill Jones's son, who threatened
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39630">
     her with every sort of evil if she left, Ralph wrapped Mrs. Thomson's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39640">
     blue drilling in Nancy Sawyer's shawl, and bore the feeble woman off to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39650">
     Lewisburg. And as they drove away, a sad, childlike voice cried from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39660">
     gratings of the upper window, "Good-by! good-by!" Ralph turned and saw
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39670">
     that it was Phil, poor Phil, for whom there was no deliverance[25]. And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39680">
     all the way back Ralph pronounced mental maledictions on the Dorcas
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39690">
     Society, not for sending garments to the Five Points or the South Sea
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39700">
     Islands, whichever it was, but for being so blind to the sorrow and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_39710">
     poverty within its reach. He did not know, for he had not read the

     THE GOOD SAMARITAN.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40200">
     The Methodist church to which Mrs. Matilda White and Miss Nancy Sawyer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40210">
     belonged was the leading one in Lewisburg, as it was in most county-seat

     villages in Indiana. If I may be permitted to express my candid and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40230">
     charitable opinion of the difference between the two women, I shall have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40240">
     to use the old Quaker locution, and say that Miss Sawyer was a Methodist
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40250">
     and likewise a Christian; Mrs. White was a Methodist, but I fear she was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40260">
     not likewise.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40280">
     As to the first part of this assertion, there was no room to doubt Miss
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40290">
     Nancy's piety. She could get happy in class-meeting (for who had a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40300">
     better right?), and could witness a good experience in the quarterly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40310">
     love-feast. But it is not upon these grounds that I base my opinion of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40320">
     Miss Nancy. Do not even the Pharisees the same? She never dreamed that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40330">
     she had any right to speak of "Christian Perfection" (which, as Mrs.

     her hands are always open to the poor and always busy with acts of love
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40380">
     and self-denial, and when her feet are ever eager to run upon errands of

     Perfection in this world of imperfection, I do not know why such an one

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40410">
     does not possess it. What need of analyzing her experiences _in vacuo_
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40420">
     to find out the state of her soul?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40440">
     How Miss Nancy managed to live on her slender income and be so generous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40450">
     was a perpetual source of perplexity to the gossips of Lewisburg. And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40460">
     now that she declared that Mrs. Thomson and Shocky should not return to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40470">
     the poor-house there was a general outcry from the whole Committee of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40480">
     Intermeddlers that she would bring herself to the poor-house before she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40490">
     died. But Nancy Sawyer was the richest woman in Lewisburg, though nobody
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40500">
     knew it, and though she herself did not once suspect it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40520">
     How Miss Nancy and the preacher conspired together, and how they managed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40530">
     to bring Mrs. Thomson's case up at the time of the "Sacramental Service"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40540">
     in the afternoon of that Sunday in Lewisburg, and how the preacher made

     a touching statement of it just before the regular "Collection for the
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40570">
     instead of dimes while the Presiding Elder read those passages about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40580">
     Zaccheus and other liberal people, and how the congregation sang

     "He dies, the Friend of sinners dies"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40620">
     more lustily than ever, after having performed this Christian act--how

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40630">
     all this happened I can not take up the reader's time to tell. But I can

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40640">
     assure him that the nearly blind English woman did not room with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40650">
     blasphemous old Mowley any more, and that the blue-drilling pauper frock
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40660">
     gave way to something better, and that grave little Shocky even danced
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40670">
     with delight, and declared that God hadn't forgot, though he'd thought
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40680">
     that He had. And Mrs. Matilda White remarked that it was a shame that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40690">
     the collection for the poor at a Methodist sacramental service should be
    </p>

     given to a woman who was a member of the Church of England, and like as
    </p>

     not never soundly converted!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40730">
     And Shocky slept in his mother's arms and prayed God not to forget

     Hannah, while Shocky's mother knit stockings for the store day and

     Miss Martha in his secret heart, but, like many other giants, while
    </p>

     of the woman that he loved. Let us honor him for it. The man who loves a

     woman truly, reverences her profoundly and feels abashed in her

     nature was not fine. But it was deep, true, and manly. To him Martha
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_40950">
     Hawkins was the chief of women. What was he that he should aspire to

     bound up, with his cleanest shirt, and with his heavy boots freshly

     white with snow to the house of Squire Hawkins. When he started his
    </p>

     spirits were high, but they descended exactly in proportion to his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_41010">
     proximity to the object of his love. He thought himself not dressed well
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_41020">
     enough He wished his shoulders were not so square, and his arms not so

     words. And so, by recounting his own deficiencies, he succeeded in

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_41050">
     making himself feel weak, and awkward, and generally good-for-nothing,

     It was in vain that Martha inquired about his arm and complimented his

     courage. Bud could only think of his big feet, his clumsy hands, and his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_41160">
     slow tongue. He answered in monosyllables, using his red silk

     handkerchief diligently.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_41190">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_41210">
     "Yes, I think it is," said Bud, hastily crossing his right leg over his

     left, and trying to get his fists out of sight.

     "No, I ha'n't," answered Bud, removing his right foot to the floor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_41270">
     again, because it looked so big, and trying to push his left hand into

     his pocket.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_41300">
     "Beautiful sunshine, isn't it?" said Martha.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_41320">
     "Yes, 'tis," answered Bud, sticking his right foot up on the rung of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_41330">
     chair and putting his right hand behind him.
    </p>

     "This snow looks like the snow we have at the East," said Martha. "It

     snowed that way the time I was to Bosting."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_41380">
     "Did it?" said Bud, not thinking of the snow at all nor of Boston, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_41390">
     thinking how much better he would have appeared had he left his arms and

     legs at home.
    </p>

     "You were very kind."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_41480">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_41490">
     looked eloquently at Miss Hawkins, drew both feet under the chair, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_41500">
     rammed his hands into his pockets. Then, suddenly remembering how
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_41510">
     awkward he must look, he immediately pulled his hands out again, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_41520">
     crossed his legs. There was a silence of a few minutes, during which Bud
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_41530">
     made up his mind to do the most desperate thing he could think of--to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_41540">
     declare his love and take the consequences.

     This letter accomplished its purpose. The Squire's spectacles slipped
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_41970">
     off several times while he read it. His wig had to be adjusted. If he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_41980">
     had been threatened personally he would not have minded it so much. But
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_41990">
     the hay stacks were dearer to him than the apple of his glass eye. The

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42010">
     a tender place through this letter knew the Squire's weakness far better
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42020">
     than they knew the spelling-book. To see his new red barn with its large

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42030">
     "Mormon" hay-press inside, and the mounted Indian on the vane,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42040">
     consumed, was too much for the Hawkins heart to stand. Evidently the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42050">
     danger was on the side of his niece. But how should he influence Martha
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42060">
     to give up Bud? Martha did not value the hay-stacks half so highly as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42070">
     she did her lover. Martha did not think the new red barn, with the great
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42080">
     Mormon press inside and the galloping Indian on the vane, worth half so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42090">
     much as a moral principle or a kind-hearted action. Martha, bless her!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42100">
     would have sacrificed anything rather than forsake the poor. But Squire
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42110">
     Hawkins's lips shut tight over his false teeth in a way that suggested
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42120">
     astringent purse-strings, and Squire Hawkins could not sleep at night if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42130">
     the new red barn, with the galloping Indian on the vane, were in danger.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42140">
     Martha must be reached somehow.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42160">
     So, with many adjustings of that most adjustable wig? with many turnings
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42170">
     of that reversible glass eye? the Squire managed to frighten Martha by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42180">
     the intimation that he had been threatened, and to make her understand,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42190">
     what it cost her much to understand, that she must turn the cold
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42200">
     shoulder to chivalrous, awkward Bud, whom she loved most tenderly,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42210">
     partly, perhaps, because he did not remind her of anybody she had ever
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42220">
     known at the East.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42240">
     Tuesday evening was the fatal time. Spelling-school was the fatal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42250">
     occasion. Bud was the victim. Pete Jones had his revenge. For Bud had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42260">
     been all the evening trying to muster courage enough to offer himself as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42270">
     Martha's escort. He was not encouraged by the fact that he had spelled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42280">
     even worse than usual, while Martha had distinguished herself by holding
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42290">
     her ground against Jeems Phillips for half an hour. But he screwed his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42300">
     courage to the sticking place, not by quoting to himself the adage,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42310">
     "Faint heart never won fair lady," which, indeed, he had never heard,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42320">
     but by reminding himself that "ef you don't resk notin' you'll never git
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42330">
     nothin'." So, when the spelling-school had adjourned, he sidled up to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42340">
     her, and, looking dreadfully solemn and a little foolish, he said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42360">
     "Kin I see you safe home?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42380">
     And she, with a feeling that her uncle's life was in danger, and that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42390">
     his salvation depended upon her resolution--she, with a feeling that she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42400">
     was pronouncing sentence of death on her own great hope, answered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42410">
     huskily:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42430">
     "No, I thank you."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42450">
     If she had only known that it was the red barn with the Indian on top
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42460">
     that was in danger, she would probably have let the galloping brave take
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42470">
     care of himself.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42490">
     It seemed to Bud, as he walked home mortified, disgraced, disappointed,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42500">
     hopeless, that all the world had gone down in a whirlpool of despair.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42520">
     "Might a knowed it," he said to himself. "Of course, a smart gal like

     A LOSS AND A GAIN.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42650">
     Dr. Small, silent, attentive, assiduous Dr. Small, set himself to work
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42660">
     to bind up the wounded heart of Bud Means, even as he had bound up his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42670">
     broken arm. The flattery of his fine eyes, which looked at Bud's muscles
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42680">
     so admiringly, which gave attention to his lightest remark, was not lost
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42690">
     on the young Flat Creek Hercules. Outwardly at least Pete Jones showed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42700">
     no inclination to revenge himself on Bud. Was it respect for muscle, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42710">
     was it the influence of Small? At any rate, the concentrated extract of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42720">
     the resentment of Pete Jones and his clique was now ready to empty
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42730">
     itself upon the head of Hartsook. And Ralph found himself in his dire
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42740">
     extremity without even the support of Bud, whose good resolutions seemed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42750">
     to give way all at once. There have been many men of culture and more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42760">
     favorable surroundings who have thrown themselves away with less
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42770">
     provocation. As it was, Bud quit school, avoided Ralph, and seemed more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42780">
     than ever under the influence of Dr. Small, besides becoming the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42790">
     intimate of Walter Johnson, Small's student and Mrs. Matilda White's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42800">
     son. They made a strange pair--Bud with his firm jaw and silent,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42810">
     cautious manner, and Walter Johnson with his weak chin, his nice
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42820">
     neck-ties, and general dandy appearance.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42840">
     To be thus deserted in his darkest hour by his only friend was the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42850">
     bitterest ingredient in Ralph's cup. In vain he sought an interview. Bud
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42860">
     always eluded him. While by all the faces about him Ralph learned that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42870">
     the storm was getting nearer and nearer to himself. It might delay. If
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42880">
     it had been Pete Jones alone, it might blow over. But Ralph felt sure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42890">
     that the relentless hand of Dr. Small was present in all his troubles.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42900">
     And he had only to look into Small's eye to know how inextinguishable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42910">
     was a malignity that burned so steadily and so quietly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42930">
     But there is no cup of unmixed bitterness. With an innocent man there is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42940">
     no night so dark that some star does not shine. Ralph had one strong

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42950">
     sheet-anchor. On his return from Lewisburg on Monday Bud had handed him

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_42960">
     a note, written on common blue foolscap, in round, old-fashioned hand.
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43200">
     metaphorically speaking, he shook that little blue billet, written on

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43400">
     The master was rather relieved at first to have the crisis come. He had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43410">
     been holding juvenile Flat Creek under his feet by sheer force of will.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43420">
     And such an exercise of "psychic power" is very exhausting. In racing on

     the Ohio the engineer sometimes sends the largest of the firemen to hold

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43450">
     by his hands. Ralph felt that he had been holding the safety-valve down,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43460">
     and that he was so weary of the operation that an explosion would be a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43470">
     real relief. He was a little tired of having everybody look on him as a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43480">
     thief. It was a little irksome to know that new bolts were put on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43490">
     doors of the houses in which he had staid. And now that Shocky was gone,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43500">
     and Bud had turned against him, and Aunt Matilda suspected him, and even

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43560">
     His course from school on the evening that something happened lay
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43570">
     through the sugar-camp. Among the dark trunks of the maples, solemn and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43580">
     lofty pillars, he debated the case. To stay, or to flee? The worn nerves
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43590">
     could not keep their present tension much longer.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43610">
     It was just by the brook, or, as they say in Indiana, the "branch[26],"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43620">
     that something happened which brought him to a sudden decision. Ralph
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43630">
     never afterward could forget that brook. It was a swift-running little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43640">
     stream, that did not babble blatantly over the stones. It ran through a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43650">
     thicket of willows, through the sugar-camp, and out into Means's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43660">
     pasture. Ralph had just passed through the thicket, had just crossed the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43670">
     brook on the half-decayed log that spanned it, when, as he emerged from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43680">
     the water-willows on the other side, he started with a sudden shock. For
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43690">
     there was Hannah, with a white, white face, holding out a little note
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43700">
     folded like an old-fashioned thumb-paper.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43720">
     "Go quick!" she stammered as she slipped it Into Ralph's hand,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43730">
     inadvertently touching his fingers with her own--a touch that went
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43740">
     tingling through the school-master's nerves. But she had hardly said the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43750">
     words until she was gone down the brookside path and over into the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43760">
     pasture. A few minutes afterward she drove the cows up into the lot and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43770">
     meekly took her scolding from Mrs. Means for being gone sech an awful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43780">
     long time, like a lazy, good-fer-nothin piece of goods that she was.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43800">
     Ralph opened the thumb-paper note, written on a page torn from an old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43810">
     copy-book, in Bud's "hand-write" and running:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43830">
     "Mr. Heartsook
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43850">
     "deer Sur:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43870">
     "I Put in my best licks, taint no use. Run fer yore life. A plans on

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43890">
     juberous[27].
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43910">
     "BUD."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43930">
     The first question with Ralph was whether he could depend on Bud. But he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43940">
     soon made up his mind that treachery of any sort was not one of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43950">
     traits. He had mourned over the destruction of Bud's good resolutions by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43960">
     Martha Hawkins's refusal, and being a disinterested party he could have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43970">
     comforted Bud by explaining Martha's "mitten." But he felt sure that Bud
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43980">
     was not treacherous. It was a relief, then, as he stood there to know
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_43990">
     that the false truce was over, and worst had come to worst.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44010">
     His first impulse was to stay and fight. But his nerves were not strong
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44020">
     enough to execute so foolhardy a resolution. He seemed to see a man
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44030">
     behind every maple-trunk. Darkness was fast coming on, and he knew that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44040">
     his absence from supper at his boarding-place could not fail to excite
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44050">
     suspicion. There was no time to be lost. So he started.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44070">
     Once run from a danger, and panic is apt to ensue. The forest; the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44080">
     stalk-fields, the dark hollows through which he passed, seemed to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44090">
     peopled with terrors. He knew Small and Jones well enough to know that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44100">
     every avenue of escape would be carefully picketed. So there was nothing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44110">
     to do but to take the shortest path to the old trysting place, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44120">
     Spring-in-rock.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44140">
     Here he sat and shook with terror. Angry with himself, he inly denounced
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44150">
     himself for a coward. But the effect was really a physical one. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44160">
     chill and panic now were the reaction from the previous strain.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44180">
     For when the sound of his pursuers' voices broke upon his ears early in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44190">
     the evening, Ralph shook no more; the warm blood set back again toward
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44200">
     the extremities, and his self-control returned when he needed it. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44210">
     gathered some stones about him, as the only weapons of defense at hand.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44220">
     The mob was on the cliff above. But he thought that he heard footsteps
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44230">
     in the bed of the creek below. If this were so, there could be no doubt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44240">
     that his hiding-place was suspected.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44260">
     "O Hank!" shouted Bud from the top of the cliff to some one in the creek
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44270">
     below, "be sure to look at the Spring-in-rock--I think he's there."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44290">
     This hint was not lost on Ralph, who speedily changed his quarters by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44300">
     climbing up to a secluded, shelf-like ledge above the spring. He was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44310">
     none too soon, for Pete Jones and Hank Banta were soon looking all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44320">
     around the spring for him, while he held a twenty-pound stone over
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44330">
     their heads ready to drop upon them in case they should think of looking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44340">
     on the ledge above.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44360">
     When the crowd were gone Ralph knew that one road was open to him. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44370">
     could follow down the creek to Clifty, and thence he might escape. But,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44380">
     traveling down to Clifty, he debated whether it was best to escape. To
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44390">
     flee was to confess his guilt, to make himself an outlaw, to put an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44400">
     insurmountable barrier between himself and Hannah, whose terror-stricken
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44410">
     and anxious face as she stood by the brook-willows haunted him now, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44420">
     was an involuntary witness to her love.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44440">
     Long before he reached Clifty his mind was made up not to flee another
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44450">
     mile. He knocked at the door of Squire Underwood. But Squire Underwood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44460">
     was also a doctor, and had been called away. He knocked at the door of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44470">
     Squire Doolittle. But Squire Doolittle had gone to Lewisburg. He was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44480">
     about to give up all hope of being able to surrender himself to the law
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44490">
     when he met Squire Hawkins, who had come over to Clifty to avoid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44500">
     responsibility for the ill-deeds of his neighbors which he was powerless
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44510">
     to prevent.

     The "prosecuting attorney" (for so the State's attorney is called in

     help. It was not wise to reject counsel, but all his blood was up, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44920">
     he declared that he would not be cleared by legal quibbles. If his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_44930">

     acquitted on a preliminary examination. He would go over to the circuit

     court and have the matter sifted to the bottom. But he would have been

     pleased had his uncle offered his counsel, though he would have declined

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_45330">
     prodigal of their significant winks and nods. Mrs. Means had always

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_45540">
     Bronson, the prosecutor, was a young man, and this was his first case

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_45560">
     anxious to have Flat Creek influence on his side in politics; and,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_45570">

     or death to such a man as Ralph. It was George H. Bronson's opportunity
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_45610">
     to distinguish himself. And so, with many knowing and confident nods and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_45620">
     hints, and with much deference to the two squires, he opened the case,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_45630">
     affecting great indignation at Ralph's wickedness, and uttering Delphic
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_45640">
     hints about striped pants and shaven head, and the grating of

    </p>

     This Mrs. Means did with alacrity. She had met the prosecutor, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_45720">
     impressed him with her dark hints. She was sworn.

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_45830">
     "Well, it's facts I am a-going to tell," she sniffed indignantly. "It's

     facts that I mean to tell." Here her voice rose to a keen pitch, and she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_45850">
     began to abuse the defendant. Again and again the court insisted that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_45860">
     she must tell what there was suspicious about the school-master. At last
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_45870">
     she got it out.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_45890">
     "Well, fer one thing, what kind of gals did he go with? Hey? Why, with

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_45950">
     Here Bronson saw that he had caught a tartar. He said he had no more
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_45970">
     cross-question her, she could stand aside. Ralph said he would like to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_45980">
     ask her one question.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46000">
     "Did I ever go with your daughter Miranda?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46020">
     "No, you didn't," answered the witness, with a tone and a toss of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46030">
     head that let the cat out, and set the court-room in a giggle. Bronson
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46040">
     saw that he was gaining nothing, and now resolved to follow the line
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46050">
     which Small had indicated.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46070">
     Pete Jones was called, and swore point-blank that he heard Ralph go out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46080">
     of the house soon after he went to bed, and that he heard him return at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46090">
     two in the morning. This testimony was given without hesitation, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46100">
     made a great impression against Ralph in the minds of the justices. Mrs.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46110">
     Jones, a poor, brow-beaten woman, came on the stand in a frightened way,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46120">
     and swore to the same lies as her husband. Ralph cross-questioned her,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46130">
     but her part had been well learned.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46150">
     There, seemed now little hope for Ralph. But just at this moment who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46160">
     should stride into the school-house but Pearson, the one-legged old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46170">
     soldier basket-maker? He had crept home the night before, "to see ef the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46180">
     ole woman didn't want somethin'," and hearing of Ralph's arrest, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46190">
     concluded that the time for him to make "a forrard movement" had come,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46200">
     and so he determined to face the foe.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46220">
     "Looky here, Squar," he said, wiping the perspiration from his brow,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46230">
     "looky here. I jes want to say that I kin tell as much about this case
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46260">
     "Let us hear it, then," said Bronson, who thought he would nail Ralph

     now for certain.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46290">
     So, with many allusions to the time he fit at Lundy's Lane, and some

     Hannah was now brought on the stand. She was greatly agitated, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46560">
     answered with much reluctance. Lived at Mr. Means's. Was eighteen years
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46570">
     of age in October. Had been bound to Mrs. Means three years ago. Had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46580">
     walked home with Mr. Hartsook that evening, and, happening to look out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46590">
     of the window toward morning, she saw some one cross the pasture. Did
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46600">
     not know who it was. Thought it was Mr. Hartsook. Here Mr. Bronson
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46610">
     (evidently prompted by a suggestion that came from what Small had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46620">
     overheard when he listened in the barn) asked her if Mr. Hartsook had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46630">
     ever said anything to her about the matter afterward. After some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46640">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46650">
     his own accord? No, she spoke of it first. Had Mr. Hartsook offered any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46660">
     explanations? No, he hadn't. Had he ever paid her any attention

     Bronson now informed the court that this little trick of having the old

     the bar from the just punishment which an outraged law visited upon such
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46730">
     crimes as his. He regretted that his duty as a public prosecutor caused
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46740">
     it to fall to his lot to marshal the evidence that was to blight the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46780">
     most dangerous foe to the peace of society. The evidence already given
    </p>

     The prosecution here rested, Bronson maintaining that there was enough

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46980">
     evidence to justify Ralph's committal to await trial. But the court
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_46990">
     thought that as the defendant had no counsel and offered no rebutting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47000">
     testimony, it would be only fair to hear what the prisoner had to say
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47010">
     in his own defense.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47030">
     All this while poor Ralph was looking about the room for Bud. Bud's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47040">
     actions had of late been strangely contradictory. But had he turned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47050">
     coward and deserted his friend? Why else did he avoid the session of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47060">
     court? After asking himself such questions as these, Ralph would wonder
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47070">
     at his own folly. What could Bud do if he were there? There was no human
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47080">
     power that could prevent the victim of so vile a conspiracy as this,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47090">
     lodging in that worst of State prisons at Jeffersonville, a place too
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47100">
     bad for criminals. But when there is no human power to help, how
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47110">
     naturally does the human mind look for some divine intervention on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47120">
     side of Right! And Ralph's faith in Providence looked in the direction
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47130">
     of Bud. But since no Bud came, he shut down the valves and rose to his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47140">
     feet, proudly, defiantly, fiercely calm.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47160">
     "It's of no use for me to say anything. Peter Jones has sworn to a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47170">
     deliberate falsehood, and he knows it. He has made his wife perjure her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47180">
     poor soul that she dare not call her own." Here Pete's fists clenched,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47190">
     but Ralph in his present humor did not care for mobs. The spirit of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47200">
     bulldog had complete possession of him. "It is of no use for me to tell
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47210">
     you that Henry Banta has sworn to a lie, partly to revenge himself on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47220">
     me for punishments I have given him, and partly, perhaps, for money. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47230">
     real thieves are in this court-room. I could put my finger on them."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47250">
     "_To_ be sure," responded the old basket-maker. Ralph looked at Pete
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47260">
     Jones, then at Small. The fiercely calm look attracted the attention of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47270">
     the people. He knew that this look would probably cost him his life
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47280">
     before the next morning. But he did not care for life. "The testimony of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47290">
     Miss Hannah Thomson is every word true, I believe that of Mr. Pearson to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47300">
     be true. The rest is false. But I can not prove it. I know the men I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47310">
     have to deal with. I shall not escape with State prison. They will not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47320">
     spare my life. But the people of Clifty will one day find out who are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47330">
     the thieves." Ralph then proceeded to tell how he had left Pete Jones's,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47340">
     Mr. Jones's bed being uncomfortable; how he had walked through the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47350">
     pasture; how he had seen three men on horseback: how he had noticed the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47360">
     sorrel with the white left forefoot and white nose; how he had seen Dr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47370">
     Small; how, after his return, he had heard some one enter the house, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47380">
     how he had recognized the horse the next morning. "There," said Ralph
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47390">
     desperately, leveling his finger at Pete, "there is a man who will yet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47400">
     see the inside of a penitentiary, I shall not live to see it, but the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47410">
     rest of you will." Pete quailed. Ralph's speech could not of course
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47420">
     break the force of the testimony against him. But it had its effect, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47430">
     it had effect enough to alarm Bronson, who rose and said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47450">
     "I should like to ask the prisoner at the bar one question."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47470">
     "Ask me a dozen," said Hartsook, looking more like a king than a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47480">
     criminal.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47500">
     "Well, then, Mr. Hartsook. You need not answer unless you choose; but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47510">
     what prompted you to take the direction you did in your walk on that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47520">
     evening?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47540">
     This shot brought Ralph down. To answer this question truly would attach
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47550">
     to friendless Hannah Thomson some of the disgrace that now belonged to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47560">
     him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47580">
     "I decline to answer," said Ralph.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47600">
     "Of course, I do not want the prisoner to criminate himself," said
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47610">
     Bronson significantly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47630">
     During this last passage Bud had come in, but, to Ralph's disappointment
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47640">
     he remained near the door, talking to Walter Johnson, who had come with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47650">
     him. The magistrates put their heads together to fix the amount of bail,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47660">
     and, as they differed, talked for some minutes. Small now for the first
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47670">
     time thought best to make a move in his own proper person. He could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47680">
     hardly have been afraid of Ralph's acquittal. He may have been a little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47690">
     anxious at the manner in which he had been mentioned, and at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47700">
     significant look of Ralph, and he probably meant to excite indignation
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47710">
     enough against the school-master to break the force of his speech, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47720">
     secure the lynching of the prisoner, chiefly by people outside his gang.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47730">
     He rose and asked the court in gentlest tones to hear him. He had no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47740">
     personal interest in this trial, except his interest in the welfare of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47750">
     his old schoolmate, Mr. Hartsook. He was grieved and disappointed to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47760">
     find the evidence against him so damaging and he would not for the world
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47770">
     add a feather to it, if it were not that his own name had been twice
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47780">
     alluded to by the defendant, and by his friend, and perhaps his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47790">
     confederate, John Pearson. He was prepared to swear that he was not over
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47800">
     in Flat Creek the night of the robbery later than ten o'clock, and while

     the statements of the two persons alluded to, whether maliciously
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47820">
     intended or not, could not implicate him at all, he thought perhaps this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47830">
     lack of veracity in their statements might be of weight in determining
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47840">
     some other points. He therefore suggested--he could only suggest, as he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47850">
     was not a party to the case in any way--that his student, Mr. Walter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47860">
     Johnson, be called to testify as to his--Dr. Small's--exact whereabouts
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47870">
     on the night in question. They were together in his office until two,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47880">
     when he went to the tavern and went to bed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47900">
     Squire Hawkins, having adjusted his teeth, his wig, and his glass eye,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47910">
     thanked Dr. Small for a suggestion so valuable, and thought best to put
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47920">
     John Pearson under arrest before proceeding further. Mr. Pearson was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47930">
     therefore arrested, and was heard to mutter something about a "passel of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47940">
     thieves," when the court warned him to be quiet.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_47960">
     Walter Johnson was then called. But before giving his testimony, I must

     office. Bud and Walter Johnson had been having some confidential
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48220">
     conversation that evening, and Bud had got more out of his companion
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48230">
     than that exquisite but weak young man had intended. He looked round in

     a frightened way.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48260">
     "You see," said Walter, "if Small knew I had told you that, I'd get a

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48300">
     there he shivered, and his voice broke down into a whisper. But Bud was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48310">
     perfectly cool, and doubtless it was the strong coolness of Bud that
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48510">
     religion without fear could never have evangelized or civilized the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48520">
     West, which at one time bade fair to become a perdition as bad as any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48530">
     that Brother Sodom ever depicted. And against these on the one side, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48540">
     the Brother Sodoms on the other, I shall interrupt my story to put this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48550">
     chapter under shelter of that wise remark of the great Dr. Adam Clark,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48560">
     who says "The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom, the terror of God
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48570">
     confounds the soul;" and that other saying of his: "With the _fear_ of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48580">
     God the love of God is ever consistent; but where the _terror_ of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48590">
     Lord reigns, there can neither be _fear, faith_, nor _love_; nay, nor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48600">
     _hope_ either." And yet I am not sure that even the Brother Sodoms were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48610">
     made in vain.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48630">
     On this evening Mr. Soden was as terrible as usual. Bud heard him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48640">
     without flinching. Small, who sat farther forward, listened with pious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48650">
     approval. Mr. Soden, out of distorted figures pieced together from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48660">
     different passages of Scripture, built a hell, not quite, Miltonic, nor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48670">
     yet Dantean, but as Miltonic and Dantean as his unrefined imagination
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48680">
     could make it. As he rose toward his climax of hideous description,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48690">
     Walter Johnson trembled from head to foot and sat close to Bud. Then, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48700">
     burly Mr. Soden, with great gusto, depicted materialistic tortures that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48710">
     startled the nerves of everybody except Bud, Walter wanted to leave, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48720">
     Bud would not let him. For some reason he wished to keep his companion
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48730">
     in the crucible as long as possible.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48750">
     "Young man!" cried Mr. Soden, and the explosive voice seemed to come
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48760">
     from the hell that he had created--"young man! you who have followed the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48770">
     counsel of evil companions"--here he paused and looked about, as if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48780">
     trying to find the man he wanted, while Walter crept up close to Bud
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48790">
     and shaded his face--"I mean you who have chosen evil pursuits and who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48800">
     can not get free from bad habits and associations that are dragging you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48810">
     down to hell! You are standing on the very crumbling brink of hell
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48820">
     to-night. The smell of the brimstone is on your garments; the hot breath
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48830">
     of hell is in your face! The devils are waiting for you! Delay and you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48840">
     are damned! You may die before daylight! You may never get out that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48850">
     door! The awful angel of death is just ready to strike you down!" Here
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48860">
     some shrieked with terror, others sobbed, and Brother Sodom looked with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48870">
     approval on the storm he had awakened. The very harshness of his tone,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48880">
     his lofty egotism of manner, that which had roused all Bud's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48890">
     combativeness, shook poor Walter as a wind would shake a reed. In the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48900">
     midst of the general excitement he seized his hat and hastened out the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48910">
     door. Bud followed, while Soden shot his lightnings after them,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48920">
     declaring that "young men who ran away from the truth would dwell in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48930">
     torments forever."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48950">
     Bud had not counted amiss when he thought that Mr. Soden's preaching
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48960">
     would be likely to arouse so mean-spirited a fellow as Walter. So vivid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48970">
     was the impression that Johnson begged Bud to return to the office with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48980">
     him. He felt sick, and was afraid that he should die before morning. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_48990">
     insisted that Bud should stay with him all night. To this Means readily
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49000">
     consented, and by morning he had heard all that the frightened Walter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49010">
     had to tell.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49030">
     And now let us return to the trial, where Ralph sits waiting the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49040">
     testimony of Walter Johnson, which is to prove his statement false.

     THE TRIAL CONCLUDED.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49130">
     I do not know how much interest the "gentle reader" may feel in Bud. But
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49140">
     I venture to hope that there are some Buddhists among my readers who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49150">
     will wish the contradictoriness of his actions explained. The first dash
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49160">
     of disappointment had well-nigh upset him. And when a man concludes to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49170">
     throw overboard his good resolutions, he always seeks to avoid the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49180">
     witness of those resolutions. Hence Bud, after that distressful Tuesday
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49190">
     evening on which Miss Martha had given him "the sack," wished to see
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49200">
     Ralph less than any one else. And yet when he came to suspect Small's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49210">
     villainy, his whole nature revolted at it. But having broken with Ralph,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49220">
     he thought it best to maintain an attitude of apparent hostility, that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49230">
     he might act as a detective, and, perhaps, save his friend from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49240">
     mischief that threatened him. As soon as he heard of Ralph's arrest he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49250">
     determined to make Walter Johnson tell his own secret in court, because
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49260">
     he knew that it would be best for Ralph that Walter should tell it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49270">
     Bud's telling at second-hand would not be conclusive. And he sincerely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49280">
     desired to save Walter from prison. For Walter Johnson was the victim of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49290">
     Dr. Small, or of Dr. Small and such novels as "The Pirate's Bride,"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49300">
     "Claude Duval," "The Wild Rover of the West Indies," and the cheap
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49310">
     biographies of such men as Murrell. Small found him with his imagination
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49320">
     inflamed by the history of such heroes, and opened to him the path to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49330">
     glory for which he longed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49350">
     The whole morning after Ralph's arrest Bud was working on Walter's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49360">
     conscience and his fears. The poor fellow, unable to act for himself,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49370">
     was torn asunder between the old ascendency of Small and the new
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49380">
     ascendency of Bud Means. Bud finally frightened him, by the fear of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49390">
     penitentiary, into going to the place of trial. But once inside the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49400">
     door, and once in sight of Small, who was more to him than God, or,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49410">
     rather, more to him than the devil--for the devil was Walter's God, or,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49420">
     perhaps, I should say, Walter's God was a devil--once in sight of Small,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49430">
     he refused to move an inch farther. And Bud, after all his perseverance,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49440">
     was about to give up in sheer despair.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49460">
     Fortunately, just at that moment Small's desire to relieve himself from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49470">
     the taint of suspicion and to crush Ralph as completely as possible,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49480">
     made him overshoot the mark by asking that Walter be called to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49490">
     stand, as we have before recounted. He knew that he had no tool so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49500">
     supple as the cowardly Walter. In the very language of the request, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49510">
     had given Walter an intimation of what he wanted him to swear to. Walter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49520">
     listened to Small's words as to his doom. He felt that he should die of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49530">
     indecision. The perdition of a man of his stamp is to have to make up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49540">
     his mind. Such men generally fall back on some one more positive, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49550">
     take all their resolutions ready-made. But here Walter must decide for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49560">
     himself. For the constable was already calling his name; the court, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49570">
     spectators, and, most of all, Dr. Small, were waiting for him. He moved
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49580">
     forward mechanically through the dense crowd, Bud following part of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49590">
     way to whisper, "Tell the truth or go to penitentiary." Walter shook and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49600">
     shivered at this. The witness with difficulty held up his hand long
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49610">
     enough to be sworn.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49630">
     "Please tell the court," said Bronson, "whether you know anything of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49640">
     whereabouts of Dr. Small on the night of the robbery at Peter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49650">
     Schroeder's."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49670">
     Small had detected Walter's agitation, and, taking alarm, had edged his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49680">
     way around so as to stand full in Walter's sight, and there, with keen,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49690">
     magnetic eye on the weak orbs of the young man, he was able to assume
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49700">
     his old position, and sway the fellow absolutely.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49720">
     "On the night of the robbery"--Walter's voice was weak, but he seemed to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49730">
     be reading his answer out of Small's eyes--"on the night of the robbery
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49740">
     Dr. Small came home before--" here the witness stopped and shook and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49750">
     shivered again. For Bud, detecting the effect of Small's gaze, had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49760">
     pushed his great hulk in front of Small, and had fastened his eyes on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49770">
     Walter with a look that said, "Tell the truth or go to penitentiary."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49790">
     "I can't, I can't. O God! What shall I do?" the witness exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49800">
     answering the look of Bud. For it seemed to him that Bud had spoken. To
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49810">
     the people and the court this agitation was inexplicable. Squire
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49820">
     Hawkins's wig got awry, his glass eye turned in toward his nose, and he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49830">
     had great difficulty in keeping his teeth from falling out. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49840">
     excitement became painfully intense. Ralph was on his feet, looking at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49850">
     the witness, and feeling that somehow Bud and Dr. Small--his good angel
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49860">
     and his demon--were playing an awful game, or which he was the stake.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49870">
     The crowd swayed to and fro, but remained utterly silent, waiting to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49880">
     hear the least whisper from the witness, who stood trembling a moment
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49890">
     with his hands over his face, and then fainted.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49910">
     The fainting of a person in a crowd is a signal for everybody else to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49920">
     make fools of themselves. There was a rush toward the fainting man,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49930">
     there was a cry for water. Everybody asked everybody else to open the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49940">
     window, and everybody wished everybody else to stand back and give him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49950">
     air. But nobody opened the window, and nobody stood back. The only
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49960">
     perfectly cool man in the room was Small. With a quiet air of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49970">
     professional authority he pushed forward and felt the patient's pulse,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49980">
     remarking to the court that he thought it was a sudden attack of fever
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_49990">
     with delirium. When Walter revived, Dr. Small would have removed him,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50000">
     but Ralph insisted that his testimony should be heard. Under pretense of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50010">
     watching his patient, Small kept close to him. And Walter began the same
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50020">
     old story about Dr. Small's having arrived at the office before eleven
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50030">
     o'clock, when Bud came up behind the doctor and fastened his eyes on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50040">
     witness with the same significant look, and Walter, with visions of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50050">
     penitentiary before him halted, stammered, and seemed about to faint
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50060">
     again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50080">
     "If the court please," said Bronson, "this witness is evidently
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50090">
     intimidated by that stout young man," pointing to Bud. "I have seen him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50100">
     twice interrupt witness's testimony by casting threatening looks at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50110">
     him, I trust the court will have him removed from the court-room."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50130">
     After a few moments' consultation, during which Squire Hawkins held his

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50160">
     by the turn things were taking, decided that It could do no harm, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50170">
     that it was best to try the experiment of removing Bud. Perhaps Johnson
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50180">
     would then be able to get through with his testimony. The constable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50190">
     therefore asked Bud if he would please leave the room. Bud cast one last

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50220">
     Ralph stood watching the receding form of Bud. The emergency had made
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50230">
     him as cool as Small ever was. Bud stopped at the door, where he was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50240">
     completely out of sight of the witness, concealed by the excited
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50250">
     spectators, who stood on the benches to see what was going on in front.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50270">
     "The witness will please proceed," said Bronson.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50290">
     "If the court please"--it was Ralph who spoke--"I believe I have as much
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50300">
     at stake in this trial as any one. That witness is evidently
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50310">
     intimidated. But not by Mr. Means. I ask that Dr. Small be removed out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50320">
     of sight of the witness."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50340">
     "A most extraordinary request, truly." This was what Small's bland
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50350">
     countenance said; he did not open his lips.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50370">
     "It's no more than fair," said Squire Hawkins, adjusting his wig, "that

     the witness be relieved of everything that anybody might think affects
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50410">
     Dr. Small, giving Walter one friendly, appealing look, moved back by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50420">
     door, and stood alongside Bud, as meek, quiet, and disinterested as any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50430">
     man in the house.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50450">
     "The witness will now proceed with his testimony." This time it was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50460">
     Squire Hawkins who spoke. Bronson had been attacked with a suspicion
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50470">
     that this witness was not just what he wanted, and had relapsed into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50480">
     silence.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50500">
     Walter's struggle was by no means ended by the disappearance of Small
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50510">
     and Bud. There came the recollection of his mother's stern face--a face
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50520">
     which had never been a motive toward the right, but only a goad to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50530">
     deception. What would she say if he should confess? Just as he had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50540">
     recovered himself, and was about to repeat the old lie which had twice
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50550">
     died upon his lips at the sight of Bud's look, he caught sight of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50560">
     another face, which made him tremble again. It was the lofty and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50570">
     terrible countenance of Mr. Soden. One might have thought, from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50580">
     expression it wore, that the seven last vials were in his hands, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50590">
     seven apocalyptic trumpets waiting for his lips, and the seven thunders
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50600">
     sitting upon his eyebrows. The moment that Walter saw him he smelled the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50610">
     brimstone on his own garments, he felt himself upon the crumbling brink
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50620">
     of the precipice, with perdition below him. Now I am sure that "Brother
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50630">
     Sodoms" were not made wholly in vain. There are plenty of mean-spirited
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50640">
     men like Walter Johnson, whose feeble consciences need all the support
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50650">
     they can get from the fear of perdition, and who are incapable of any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50660">
     other conception of it than a coarse and materialistic ones Let us set
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50670">
     it down to the credit of Brother Sodom, with his stiff stock, his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50680">
     thunderous face, and his awful walk, that his influence over Walter was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50690">
     on the side of truth.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50710">
     "Please proceed," said Squire Hawkins to Walter. The Squire's wig lay on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50720">
     one side, he had forgotten to adjust his eye, and he leaned forward,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50730">
     tremulous with interest.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50750">
     "Well, then," said Walter, looking not at the court nor at Bronson nor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50760">
     at the prisoner, but furtively at Mr. Soden--"well, then, if I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50770">
     must"--and Mr. Soden's awful face seemed to answer that he surely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50780">
     must--"well, then, I hope you won't send me to prison"--this to Squire
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50790">
     Hawkins, whose face reassured him--"but, oh! I don't see how I can!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50800">
     But one look at Mr. Soden assured him that he could and that he must,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50810">
     and so, with an agony painful to the spectators, he told the story in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50820">
     driblets. How, while yet in Lewisburg, he had been made a member of a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50830">
     gang of which Small was chief; how they concealed from him the names of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50840">
     all the band except six, of whom the Joneses and Small were three.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50860">
     Here there was a scuffle at the door. The court demanded silence.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50880">
     "Dr. Small's trying to git out, plague take him," said Bud, who stood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50890">
     with his back planted against the door. "I'd like the court to send and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50900">
     git his trunk afore he has a chance to burn up all the papers that's in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50910">
     it."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50930">
     "Constable, you will arrest Dr. Small, Peter Jones, and William Jones.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50940">
     Send two deputies to bring Small's trunk into court," said Squire
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50950">
     Underwood.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50970">
     The prosecuting attorney was silent.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_50990">
     Walter then told of the robbery at Schroeder's, told where he and Small
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51000">
     had whittled the fence while the Joneses entered the house, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51010">
     confirmed Ralph's story by telling how they had seen Ralph in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51020">
     fence-corner, and how they had met the basket-maker on the hill.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51040">
     "_To_ be sure," said the old man, who had not ventured to hold up his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51050">
     head, after he was arrested, until Walter began his testimony.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51070">
     Walter felt inclined to stop, but he could not do it, for there stood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51080">
     Mr. Soden, looking to him like a messenger from the skies, or the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51090">
     bottomless pit, sent to extort the last word from his guilty soul He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51100">
     felt that he was making a clean breast of it--at the risk of perdition,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51110">
     with the penitentiary thrown in, if he faltered. And so he told the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51120">
     whole thing as though it had been the day of doom, and by the time he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51130">
     was through, Small's trunk was in court.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51150">
     Here a new hubbub took place at the door. It was none other than the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51160">
     crazy pauper, Tom Bifield, who personated General Andrew Jackson in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51170">
     poor-house. He had caught some inkling of the trial, and had escaped in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51180">
     Bill Jones's absence. His red plume was flying, and in his tattered and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51190">
     filthy garb he was indeed a picturesque figure.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51210">
     "Squar," said he, elbowing his way through the crowd, "I kin tell you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51220">
     sornethin'. I'm Gineral Andrew Jackson. Lost my head at Bueny Visty.

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51260">
     Bronson, with the quick perceptions of a politician, had begun to see
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51270">
     which way future winds would probably blow. "If the court please," he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51280">
     said, "this man is not wholly sane, but we might get valuable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51290">
     information out of him. I suggest that his testimony be taken for what
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51300">
     it is worth."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51320">
     "No, you don't swar me," broke in the lunatic. "Not if I knows myself.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51330">
     You see, when a feller's got one side of his head tater, he's mighty

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51410">
     Meantime Bud did not rest. Hearing the nature of the testimony given by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51420">
     Hank Banta before he entered, he attacked Hank and vowed he'd send him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51430">
     to prison if he didn't make a clean breast. Hank was a thorough coward,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51440">
     and, now that his friends were prisoners, was ready enough to tell the
    </p>

     truth if he could be protected from prosecution. Seeing the disposition
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51460">
     of the prosecuting attorney, Bud got from him a promise that he would do
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51470">
     what he could to protect Hank. That worthy then took the stand,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51480">
     confessed his lie, and even told the inducement which Mr. Pete Jones
    </p>

     had offered him to perjure himself.
    </p>

     "_To_ be sure," said Pearson.

     Squire Hawkins, turning his right eye upon him, while the left looked at

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51540">
     the ceiling, said: "Be careful, Mr. Pearson, or I shall have to punish

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51600">
     The Squire looked at Mr. Pearson severely, and the latter, feeling that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51610">
     he had committed some offense without knowing it, subsided into silence.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_51630">
     Bronson now had a keen sense of the direction of the gale.

     AFTER THE BATTLE.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52520">
     Nothing can be more demoralizing in the long run than lynch law. And yet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52530">
     lynch law often originates in a burst of generous indignation which is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52540">
     not willing to suffer a bold oppressor to escape by means of corrupt and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52550">
     cowardly courts. It is oftener born of fear. Both motives powerfully
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52560">
     agitated the people of the region round about Clifty as night drew on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52570">
     after Ralph's acquittal. They were justly indignant that Ralph had been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52580">
     made the victim of such a conspiracy, and they were frightened at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52590">
     unseen danger to the community from such a band as that of Small's. It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52600">
     was certain that they did not know the full extent of the danger as yet.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52610">
     And what Small might do with a jury, or what Pete Jones might do with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52620">
     sheriff, was a question. I must not detain the reader to tell how the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52630">
     mob rose. Nobody knows how such things come about. Their origin is as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52640">
     inexplicable as that of an earthquake. But, at any rate, a rope was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52650">
     twice put round Small's neck during that night, and both times Small
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52660">
     was saved only by the nerve and address of Ralph, who had learned how
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52670">
     unjust mob law may be. As for Small, he neither trembled when they were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52680">
     ready to hang him, nor looked relieved when he was saved, nor showed the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52690">
     slightest flush of penitence or gratitude. He bore himself in a quiet,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52700">
     gentlemanly way throughout, like the admirable villain that he was.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52720">
     He waived a preliminary examination the next day; his father went his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52730">
     bail, and he forfeited bail and disappeared from the county and from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52740">
     horizon of my story. Two reports concerning Small have been in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52750">
     circulation--one that he was running a faro-bank in San Francisco, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52760">
     other that he was curing consumption in New York by some quack process.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52770">
     If this latter were true, it would leave it an open question whether
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52780">
     Ralph did well to save him from the gallows. Pete Jones and Bill, as
    </p>

     usually happens to the rougher villains, went to prison, and when their

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52800">
     terms had expired moved to Pike County, Missouri.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52820">
     But it is about Hannah that you wish to hear, and that I wish to tell.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52830">
     She went straight from the court room to Flat Creek, climbed to her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52840">
     chamber, packed in a handkerchief all her earthly goods, consisting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52850">
     chiefly of a few family relics, and turned her back on the house of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52860">
     Means forever. At the gate she met the old woman, who shook her fist in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52870">
     the girl's face and gave her a parting benediction in the words: "You
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52880">
     mis'able, ongrateful critter you, go 'long. I'm glad to be shed of you!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52890">
     At the barn she met Bud, and he told her good-by with a little huskiness
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52900">
     in his voice, while a tear glistened in her eyes. Bud had been a friend
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52910">
     in need, and such a friend one does not leave without a pang.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52930">
     "Where are you going? Can I--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52950">
     "No, no!" And with that she hastened on, afraid that Bud would offer to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52960">
     hitch up the roan colt. And she did not want to add to his domestic
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52970">
     unhappiness by compromising him in that way.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_52990">
     It was dusk and was raining when she left. The hours were long, the road
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53000">
     was lonely, and after the revelations of that day it did not seem wholly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53010">
     safe. But from the moment that she found herself free, her heart had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53020">
     been ready to break with an impatient homesickness. What though there
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53030">
     might be robbers in the woods? What though there were ten rough miles to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53040">
     travel? What though the rain was in her face? What though she had not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53050">
     tasted food since the morning of that exciting day? Flat Creek and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53060">
     bondage were behind; freedom, mother, Shocky, and home were before her,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53070">
     and her feet grew lighter with the thought. And if she needed any other
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53080">
     joy, it was to know that the master was clear. And he would come? And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53090">
     so she traversed the weary distance, and so she inquired and found the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53100">
     house, the beautiful, homely old house of beautiful, homely old Nancy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53110">
     Sawyer, and knocked, and was admitted, and fell down, faint and weary,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53120">
     at her blind mother's feet, and laid her tired head in her mother's lap
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53130">
     and wept and wept like a child, and said, "O mother! I'm free! I'm
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53140">
     free!" while the mother's tears baptized her face, and the mother's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53150">
     trembling fingers combed out her tresses. And Shocky stood by her and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53160">
     cried: "I knowed God wouldn't forget you, Hanner!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53180">
     Hannah was ready now to do anything by which she could support her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53190">
     mother and Shocky. She was strong, and inured to toil. She was willing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53200">
     and cheerful, and she would gladly have gone to service if by that means
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53210">
     she could have supported the family. And, for that matter her mother was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53220">
     already able nearly to support herself by her knitting. But Hannah had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53230">
     been carefully educated when young, and at that moment the old public
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53240">
     schools were being organized into a graded school, and the good
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53250">
     minister, who shall be nameless, because he is, perhaps, still

     living in Indiana, and who in Methodist parlance was called "the

     Nancy Sawyer got Hannah a place as teacher in the primary department.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53290">
     And then a little house with four rooms was rented, and a little, a very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53300">
     little furniture was put into it, and the old sweet home was established
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53310">
     again. The father was gone, never to come back again. But the rest were

     INTO THE LIGHT.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53410">
     For two weeks longer Ralph taught at the Flat Creek school-house. He was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53420">
     everybody's hero. And he was Bud's idol. He did what he could to get Bud
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53430">
     and Martha together, and though Bud always "saw her safe home" after
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53440">
     this, and called on her every Sunday evening, yet, to save his life, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53450">
     could not forget his big fists and his big feet long enough to say what
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53460">
     he most wanted to say, and what Martha most wanted him to say.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53480">
     At the end of two weeks Ralph found himself exceedingly weary of Flat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53490">
     Creek, and exceedingly glad to hear from Mr. Means that the school-money
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53500">
     had "gin out." It gave him a good excuse to return to Lewisburg, where
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53510">
     his heart and his treasure were. A certain sense of delicacy had kept
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53520">
     him from writing to Hannah just yet.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53540">
     When he got to Lewisburg he had good news. His uncle, ashamed of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53550">
     previous neglect, and perhaps with an eye to his nephew's growing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53560">
     popularity, had got him the charge of the grammar department in the new
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53570">
     graded school in the village. So he quietly arranged to board at a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53580">
     boarding-house. His aunt could not have him about, of which fact he was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53590">
     very glad. She could not but feel, she said, that he might have taken
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53600">
     better care of Walter than he did, when they were only four miles apart.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53620">
     He did not hasten to call on Hannah. Why should he? He sent her a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53630">
     message, of no consequence in itself, by Nancy Sawyer. Then he took
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53640">
     possession of his school; and then, on the evening of the first day of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53650">
     school, he went, as he had appointed to himself, to see Hannah Thomson.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53670">
     And she, with some sweet presentiment, had got things ready by fixing up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53680">
     the scantily-furnished room as well as she could. And Miss Nancy Sawyer,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53690">
     who had seen Ralph that afternoon, had guessed that he was going to see
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53700">
     Hannah. It's wonderful how much enjoyment a generous heart can get out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53710">
     of the happiness of others. Is not that what He meant when he said of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53720">
     such as Miss Sawyer that they should have a hundred-fold in this life

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53730">
     for all their sacrifices? Did not Miss Nancy enjoy a hundred weddings
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53740">
     and have the love of five hundred children? And so Miss Nancy just
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53750">
     happened over at Mrs. Thomson's humble home, and, just in the most
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53760">
     matter-of-course way, asked that lady and Shocky to come over to her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53770">
     house. Shocky wanted Hannah to come too. But Hannah blushed a little,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53780">
     and said that she would rather not.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53800">
     And when she was left alone, Hannah fixed her hair two or three times,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53810">
     and swept the hearth, and moved the chairs first one way and then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53820">
     another, and did a good many other needless things. Needless: for a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53830">
     lover, if he be a lover, does not see furniture or dress.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53850">
     And then she sat down by the fire, and tried to sew, and tried to look
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53860">
     unconcerned, and tried to feel unconcerned, and tried not to expect
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53870">
     anybody, and tried to make her heart keep still. And tried in vain. For
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53880">
     a gentle rap at the door sent her pulse up twenty beats a minute and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53890">
     made her face burn. And Hartsook was for the first time, abashed in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53900">
     presence of Hannah. For the oppressed girl had, in two weeks, blossomed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53910">
     out into the full-blown woman.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53930">
     And Ralph sat down by the fire, and talked of his school and her school,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53940">
     and everything else but what he wanted to talk about. And then the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53950">
     conversation drifted back to Flat Creek, and to the walk through the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53960">
     pasture, and to the box-elder tree, and to the painful talk in the lane.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53970">
     And Hannah begged to be forgiven, and Ralph laughed at the idea that she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53980">
     had done anything wrong. And she praised his goodness to Shocky, and he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_53990">
     drew her little note out of--But I agreed not tell you where he kept it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54000">
     And then she blushed, and he told how the note had sustained him, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54010">
     how her white face kept up his courage in his flight down the bed of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54020">
     Clifty Creek. And he sat a little nearer, to show her the note that he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54030">
     had carried in his bosom--I have told it! And--but I must not proceed. A
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54040">
     love-scene, ever so beautiful in itself, will not bear telling. And so I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54050">
     shall leave a little gap just here, which you may fill up as you please.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54060">
     . . . Somehow, they never knew how, they got to talking about the future
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54070">
     instead of the past, after that, and to planning their two lives as one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54080">
     life. And . . . And when Miss Nancy and Mrs. Thomson returned later in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54090">
     the evening, Ralph was standing by the mantel-piece, but Shocky noticed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54100">
     that his chair was close to Hannah's. And good Miss Nancy Sawyer looked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54110">
     in Hannah's face and was happy.

     "HOW IT CAME OUT"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54200">
     We are all children in reading stories. We want more than all else to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54210">
     know how it all came out at the end, and, if our taste is not perverted,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54220">
     we like it to come out well. For my part, ever since I began to write
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54230">
     this story, I have been anxious to know how it was going to come out.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54250">
     Well, there were very few invited. It took place at ten in the morning.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54260">
     The "preacher-in-charge" came, of course. Miss Nancy Sawyer was there.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54270">
     But Ralph's uncle was away, and Aunt Matilda had a sore throat and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54280">
     couldn't come. Perhaps the memory of the fact that she had refused Mrs.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54290">
     Thomson, the pauper, a bed for two nights, affected her throat. But Miss
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54300">
     Nancy and her sister were there, and the preacher. And that was all,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54310">
     besides the family, and Bud and Martha. Of course Bud and Martha came.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54320">
     And driving Martha to a wedding in a "jumper" was the one opportunity
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54330">
     Bud needed. His hands were busy, his big boots were out of sight, and it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54340">
     was so easy to slip from Ralph's love affair to his own, that Bud
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54350">
     somehow, in pulling Martha Hawkins's shawl about her, stammered out half
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54360">
     a proposal, which Martha, generous soul, took for the whole ceremony,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54370">
     and accepted. And Bud was so happy that Ralph guessed from his face and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54380">
     voice that the agony was over, and Bud was betrothed at last to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54390">
     "gal as was a gal."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54410">
     And after Ralph and Hannah were married--there was no trip, Ralph only
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54420">
     changed his boarding-place and became head of the house at Mrs.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54430">
     Thomson's thereafter--after it was all over, Bud came to Mr. Hartsook,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54440">
     and, snickering just a little, said as how as him and Martha had fixed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54450">
     it all up, and now they wanted to ax his advice; and Martha proud but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54460">
     blushing, came up and nodded assent. Bud said as how as he hadn't got no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54470">
     book-larnin' nor nothin', and as how as he wanted to be somethin', and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54480">
     put in his best licks fer Him, you know'. And that Marthy, she was of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54490">
     the same way of thinkin', and that was a blessin'. And the Squire was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54500">
     a-goin' to marry agin', and Marthy would ruther vacate. And his mother
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54510">
     and Mirandy was sech as he wouldn't take no wife to. And he thought as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54520">
     how Mr. Hartsook might think of some way or some place where he and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54530">
     Marthy mout make a livin' fer the present, and put in their best licks
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54540">
     fer Him, you know.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54560">
     Ralph thought a moment. He was about to make an allusion to Hercules and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54570">
     the Augean stables, but he remembered that Bud would not understand it,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54580">
     though it might remind Martha of something she had seen at the East, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54590">
     time she was to Bosting.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54610">
     "Bud, my dear friend," said Ralph, "it looks a little hard to ask you to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54620">
     take a new wife"--here Bud looked admiringly at Martha--"to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54630">
     poor-house. But I don't know anywhere where you can do so much good for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54640">
     Christ as by taking charge of that place, and I can get the appointment
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54650">
     for you. The new commissioners want just such a man."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54670">
     "What d'ye say, Marthy?" said Bud.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54690">
     "Why, somebody ought to do for the poor, and I should like to do it."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54710">
     And so Hercules cleaned the Augean stables.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54730">
     And so my humble, homely Hoosier story of twenty years ago[29] draws to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54740">
     a close, and not without regret I take leave of Ralph and Hannah; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000028_54750">
     Shocky, and Bud, and Martha, and Miss Nancy, and of my readers.
