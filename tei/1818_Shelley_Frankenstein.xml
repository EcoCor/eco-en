    Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus
   </p>
   <p>
    Letter 1
   </p>
   <p>
    _To Mrs. Saville, England._
   </p>
   <p>
    St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—.
   </p>
   <p>
    You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the
   </p>
   <p>
    commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil
   </p>
   <p>
    forebodings.  I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure
   </p>
   <p>
    my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success
   </p>
   <p>
    of my undertaking.
   </p>
   <p>
    I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of
   </p>
   <p>
    Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which
   </p>
   <p>
    braces my nerves and fills me with delight.  Do you understand this
   </p>
   <p>
    feeling?  This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards
   </p>
   <p>
    which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent
   </p>
   <p>
    and vivid.  I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of
   </p>
   <p>
    frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the
   </p>
   <p>
    region of beauty and delight.  There, Margaret, the sun is for ever
   </p>
   <p>
    visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a
   </p>
   <p>
    perpetual splendour.  There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put
   </p>
   <p>
    some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished;
   </p>
   <p>
    and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in
   </p>
   <p>
    wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable
   </p>
   <p>
    globe.  Its productions and features may be without example, as the
   </p>
   <p>
    phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered
   </p>
   <p>
    solitudes.  What may not be expected in a country of eternal light?  I
   </p>
   <p>
    may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may
   </p>
   <p>
    regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this
   </p>
   <p>
    voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world
   </p>
   <p>
    never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by
   </p>
   <p>
    the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to
   </p>
   <p>
    conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this
   </p>
   <p>
    laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little
   </p>
   <p>
    boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his
   </p>
   <p>
    native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you
   </p>
   <p>
    cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all
   </p>
   <p>
    mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole
   </p>
   <p>
    to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are
   </p>
   <p>
    requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at
   </p>
   <p>
    all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.
   </p>
   <p>
    These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my
   </p>
   <p>
    letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me
   </p>
   <p>
    to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as
   </p>
   <p>
    a steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual
   </p>
   <p>
    eye.  This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I
   </p>
   <p>
    have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have
   </p>
   <p>
    been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean
   </p>
   <p>
    through the seas which surround the pole.  You may remember that a
   </p>
   <p>
    history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the
   </p>
   <p>
    whole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library.  My education was neglected,
   </p>
   <p>
    yet I was passionately fond of reading.  These volumes were my study
   </p>
   <p>
    day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which
   </p>
   <p>
    I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction
   </p>
   <p>
    had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.
   </p>
   <p>
    These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets
   </p>
   <p>
    whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven.  I also
   </p>
   <p>
    became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;
   </p>
   <p>
    I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the
   </p>
   <p>
    names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated.  You are well
   </p>
   <p>
    acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.
   </p>
   <p>
    But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my
   </p>
   <p>
    thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.
   </p>
   <p>
    Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    can, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this
   </p>
   <p>
    great enterprise.  I commenced by inuring my body to hardship.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea;
   </p>
   <p>
    I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often
   </p>
   <p>
    worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my
   </p>
   <p>
    nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those
   </p>
   <p>
    branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive
   </p>
   <p>
    the greatest practical advantage.  Twice I actually hired myself as an
   </p>
   <p>
    under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I
   </p>
   <p>
    must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second
   </p>
   <p>
    dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest
   </p>
   <p>
    earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.
   </p>
   <p>
    And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?
   </p>
   <p>
    My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to
   </p>
   <p>
    every enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging
   </p>
   <p>
    voice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is
   </p>
   <p>
    firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am
   </p>
   <p>
    about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which
   </p>
   <p>
    will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits
   </p>
   <p>
    of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.
   </p>
   <p>
    This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia.  They fly
   </p>
   <p>
    quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in
   </p>
   <p>
    my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach.  The
   </p>
   <p>
    cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which I have
   </p>
   <p>
    already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the
   </p>
   <p>
    deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise
   </p>
   <p>
    prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins.  I have no
   </p>
   <p>
    ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and
   </p>
   <p>
    Archangel.
   </p>
   <p>
    I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my
   </p>
   <p>
    intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the
   </p>
   <p>
    insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary
   </p>
   <p>
    among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to
   </p>
   <p>
    sail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how
   </p>
   <p>
    can I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years,
   </p>
   <p>
    will pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon,
   </p>
   <p>
    or never.
   </p>
   <p>
    Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you,
   </p>
   <p>
    and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your
   </p>
   <p>
    love and kindness.
   </p>
   <p>
    Your affectionate brother,
   </p>
   <p>
    R. Walton
   </p>
   <p>
    Letter 2
   </p>
   <p>
    _To Mrs. Saville, England._
   </p>
   <p>
    Archangel, 28th March, 17—.
   </p>
   <p>
    How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise.  I have hired a
   </p>
   <p>
    vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have
   </p>
   <p>
    already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly
   </p>
   <p>
    possessed of dauntless courage.
   </p>
   <p>
    But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no
   </p>
   <p>
    friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there
   </p>
   <p>
    will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no
   </p>
   <p>
    one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts
   </p>
   <p>
    to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of
   </p>
   <p>
    feeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I
   </p>
   <p>
    bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet
   </p>
   <p>
    courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose
   </p>
   <p>
    tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a
   </p>
   <p>
    friend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution
   </p>
   <p>
    and too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me
   </p>
   <p>
    that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild
   </p>
   <p>
    on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas’ books of voyages.
   </p>
   <p>
    At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own
   </p>
   <p>
    country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its
   </p>
   <p>
    most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the
   </p>
   <p>
    necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native
   </p>
   <p>
    country. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many
   </p>
   <p>
    schoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my
   </p>
   <p>
    daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters
   </p>
   <p>
    call it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense
   </p>
   <p>
    enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to
   </p>
   <p>
    endeavour to regulate my mind.
   </p>
   <p>
    Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the
   </p>
   <p>
    wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet
   </p>
   <p>
    some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these
   </p>
   <p>
    rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage
   </p>
   <p>
    and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase
   </p>
   <p>
    more characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an
   </p>
   <p>
    Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,
   </p>
   <p>
    unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of
   </p>
   <p>
    humanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;
   </p>
   <p>
    finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist
   </p>
   <p>
    in my enterprise.
   </p>
   <p>
    The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the
   </p>
   <p>
    ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This
   </p>
   <p>
    circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made
   </p>
   <p>
    me very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years
   </p>
   <p>
    spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the
   </p>
   <p>
    groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to
   </p>
   <p>
    the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be
   </p>
   <p>
    necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness
   </p>
   <p>
    of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt
   </p>
   <p>
    myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard
   </p>
   <p>
    of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the
   </p>
   <p>
    happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved
   </p>
   <p>
    a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable
   </p>
   <p>
    sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw
   </p>
   <p>
    his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in
   </p>
   <p>
    tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,
   </p>
   <p>
    confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor,
   </p>
   <p>
    and that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend
   </p>
   <p>
    reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover,
   </p>
   <p>
    instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his
   </p>
   <p>
    money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he
   </p>
   <p>
    bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his
   </p>
   <p>
    prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young
   </p>
   <p>
    woman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old
   </p>
   <p>
    man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who,
   </p>
   <p>
    when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned
   </p>
   <p>
    until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her
   </p>
   <p>
    inclinations. “What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. He is
   </p>
   <p>
    so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind
   </p>
   <p>
    of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct
   </p>
   <p>
    the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which
   </p>
   <p>
    otherwise he would command.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can
   </p>
   <p>
    conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am
   </p>
   <p>
    wavering in my resolutions.  Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage
   </p>
   <p>
    is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation.  The
   </p>
   <p>
    winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it
   </p>
   <p>
    is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail
   </p>
   <p>
    sooner than I expected.  I shall do nothing rashly:  you know me
   </p>
   <p>
    sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the
   </p>
   <p>
    safety of others is committed to my care.
   </p>
   <p>
    I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my
   </p>
   <p>
    undertaking.  It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of
   </p>
   <p>
    the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which
   </p>
   <p>
    I am preparing to depart.  I am going to unexplored regions, to “the
   </p>
   <p>
    land of mist and snow,” but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not
   </p>
   <p>
    be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and
   </p>
   <p>
    woeful as the “Ancient Mariner.”  You will smile at my allusion, but I
   </p>
   <p>
    will disclose a secret.  I have often attributed my attachment to, my
   </p>
   <p>
    passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that
   </p>
   <p>
    production of the most imaginative of modern poets.  There is something
   </p>
   <p>
    at work in my soul which I do not understand.  I am practically
   </p>
   <p>
    industrious—painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and
   </p>
   <p>
    labour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief
   </p>
   <p>
    in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out
   </p>
   <p>
    of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited
   </p>
   <p>
    regions I am about to explore.
   </p>
   <p>
    But to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after
   </p>
   <p>
    having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of
   </p>
   <p>
    Africa or America?  I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to
   </p>
   <p>
    look on the reverse of the picture.  Continue for the present to write to
   </p>
   <p>
    me by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when
   </p>
   <p>
    I need them most to support my spirits.  I love you very tenderly.
   </p>
   <p>
    Remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.
   </p>
   <p>
    Your affectionate brother,
   </p>
   <p>

    July 7th, 17—.
   </p>
   <p>
    My dear Sister,
   </p>
   <p>
    I write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe—and well advanced
   </p>
   <p>
    on my voyage.  This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on
   </p>
   <p>
    its homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not
   </p>
   <p>
    see my native land, perhaps, for many years.  I am, however, in good
   </p>
   <p>
    spirits:  my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the
   </p>
   <p>
    floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers
   </p>
   <p>
    of the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We
   </p>
   <p>
    have already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of
   </p>
   <p>
    summer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales,
   </p>
   <p>
    which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire
   </p>
   <p>
    to attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not
   </p>
   <p>
    expected.
   </p>
   <p>
    No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a
   </p>
   <p>
    letter.  One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are
   </p>
   <p>
    accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and
   </p>
   <p>
    I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.
   </p>
   <p>
    Adieu, my dear Margaret.  Be assured that for my own sake, as well as
   </p>
   <p>
    yours, I will not rashly encounter danger.  I will be cool,
   </p>
   <p>
    persevering, and prudent.
   </p>
   <p>
    But success _shall_ crown my endeavours.  Wherefore not?  Thus far I
   </p>
   <p>
    have gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph.  Why not
   </p>
   <p>
    still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element?  What can stop the
   </p>
   <p>
    determined heart and resolved will of man?
   </p>
   <p>
    My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus.  But I must
   </p>
   <p>
    finish.  Heaven bless my beloved sister!
   </p>
   <p>

    Letter 4
   </p>
   <p>
    _To Mrs. Saville, England._
   </p>
   <p>
    August 5th, 17—.
   </p>
   <p>
    So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear
   </p>
   <p>
    recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before
   </p>
   <p>
    these papers can come into your possession.
   </p>
   <p>
    Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed
   </p>
   <p>
    in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which
   </p>
   <p>
    she floated.  Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we
   </p>
   <p>
    were compassed round by a very thick fog.  We accordingly lay to,
   </p>
   <p>
    hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.
   </p>
   <p>
    About two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out
   </p>
   <p>
    in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to
   </p>
   <p>
    have no end.  Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to
   </p>
   <p>
    grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly
   </p>
   <p>
    attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own
   </p>
   <p>
    situation.  We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by
   </p>
   <p>
    dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a
   </p>
   <p>
    being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,
   </p>
   <p>
    sat in the sledge and guided the dogs.  We watched the rapid progress
   </p>
   <p>
    of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the
   </p>
   <p>
    distant inequalities of the ice.
   </p>
   <p>
    This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed,
   </p>
   <p>
    many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that
   </p>
   <p>
    it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by
   </p>
   <p>
    ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the
   </p>
   <p>
    greatest attention.
   </p>
   <p>
    About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before
   </p>
   <p>
    night the ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the
   </p>
   <p>
    morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which
   </p>
   <p>
    float about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to
   </p>
   <p>
    rest for a few hours.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and
   </p>
   <p>
    found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently
   </p>
   <p>
    talking to someone in the sea.  It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we
   </p>
   <p>
    had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large
   </p>
   <p>
    fragment of ice.  Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human
   </p>
   <p>
    being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.
   </p>
   <p>
    He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of
   </p>
   <p>
    some undiscovered island, but a European.  When I appeared on deck the
   </p>
   <p>
    master said, “Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish
   </p>
   <p>
    on the open sea.”
   </p>
   <p>
    On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a
   </p>
   <p>
    foreign accent.  “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he,
   </p>
   <p>
    “will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?”
   </p>
   <p>
    You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed
   </p>
   <p>
    to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have
   </p>
   <p>
    supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not
   </p>
   <p>
    have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the
   </p>
   <p>
    northern pole.
   </p>
   <p>
    Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.
   </p>
   <p>
    Good God!  Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for
   </p>
   <p>
    his safety, your surprise would have been boundless.  His limbs were
   </p>
   <p>
    nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and
   </p>
   <p>
    suffering.  I never saw a man in so wretched a condition.  We attempted
   </p>
   <p>
    to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh
   </p>
   <p>
    air he fainted.  We accordingly brought him back to the deck and
   </p>
   <p>
    restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to
   </p>
   <p>
    swallow a small quantity.  As soon as he showed signs of life we
   </p>
   <p>
    wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the
   </p>
   <p>
    kitchen stove.  By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,
   </p>
   <p>
    which restored him wonderfully.
   </p>
   <p>
    Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often
   </p>
   <p>
    feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding.  When he
   </p>
   <p>
    had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and
   </p>
   <p>
    attended on him as much as my duty would permit.  I never saw a more
   </p>
   <p>
    interesting creature:  his eyes have generally an expression of
   </p>
   <p>
    wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone
   </p>
   <p>
    performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most
   </p>
   <p>
    trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with
   </p>
   <p>
    a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled.  But he
   </p>
   <p>
    is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his
   </p>
   <p>
    teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.
   </p>
   <p>
    When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off
   </p>
   <p>
    the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not
   </p>
   <p>
    allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body
   </p>
   <p>
    and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.
   </p>
   <p>
    Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice
   </p>
   <p>
    in so strange a vehicle.
   </p>
   <p>
    His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and
   </p>
   <p>
    he replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we
   </p>
   <p>
    saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”
   </p>
   <p>
    This aroused the stranger’s attention, and he asked a multitude of
   </p>
   <p>
    questions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had
   </p>
   <p>
    pursued.  Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, “I have,
   </p>
   <p>
    doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good
   </p>
   <p>
    people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to
   </p>
   <p>
    trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have
   </p>
   <p>
    benevolently restored me to life.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the
   </p>
   <p>
    ice had destroyed the other sledge.  I replied that I could not answer
   </p>
   <p>
    with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near
   </p>
   <p>
    midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety
   </p>
   <p>
    before that time; but of this I could not judge.
   </p>
   <p>
    From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the
   </p>
   <p>
    stranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for
   </p>
   <p>
    the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in
   </p>
   <p>
    the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant
   </p>
   <p>
    notice if any new object should appear in sight.
   </p>
   <p>
    Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the
   </p>
   <p>
    present day.  The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very
   </p>
   <p>
    silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all
   </p>
   <p>
    interested in him, although they have had very little communication
   </p>
   <p>
    with him.  For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his
   </p>
   <p>
    constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion.  He must
   </p>
   <p>
    have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck
   </p>
   <p>
    so attractive and amiable.
   </p>
   <p>
    I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend
   </p>
   <p>
    on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been
   </p>
   <p>
    broken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother
   </p>
   <p>
    of my heart.
   </p>
   <p>
    I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals,
   </p>
   <p>
    should I have any fresh incidents to record.
   </p>
   <p>
    August 13th, 17—.
   </p>
   <p>
    My affection for my guest increases every day.  He excites at once my
   </p>
   <p>
    admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree.  How can I see so
   </p>
   <p>
    noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant
   </p>
   <p>
    grief?  He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and
   </p>
   <p>
    when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art,
   </p>
   <p>
    yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.
   </p>
   <p>
    He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck,
   </p>
   <p>
    apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although
   </p>
   <p>
    unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he
   </p>
   <p>
    interests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently
   </p>
   <p>
    conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without
   </p>
   <p>
    disguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my
   </p>
   <p>
    eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken
   </p>
   <p>
    to secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the
   </p>
   <p>
    language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul
   </p>
   <p>
    and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would
   </p>
   <p>
    sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my
   </p>
   <p>
    enterprise. One man’s life or death were but a small price to pay for
   </p>
   <p>
    the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should
   </p>
   <p>
    acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a
   </p>
   <p>
    dark gloom spread over my listener’s countenance. At first I
   </p>
   <p>
    perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before
   </p>
   <p>
    his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle
   </p>
   <p>
    fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I
   </p>
   <p>
    paused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: “Unhappy man! Do you
   </p>
   <p>
    share my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me;
   </p>
   <p>
    let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the
   </p>
   <p>
    paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened
   </p>
   <p>
    powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were
   </p>
   <p>
    necessary to restore his composure.
   </p>
   <p>
    Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise
   </p>
   <p>
    himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of
   </p>
   <p>
    despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He asked
   </p>
   <p>
    me the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it
   </p>
   <p>
    awakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a
   </p>
   <p>
    friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than
   </p>
   <p>
    had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could
   </p>
   <p>
    boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I agree with you,” replied the stranger; “we are
   </p>
   <p>
    unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than
   </p>
   <p>
    ourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid to
   </p>
   <p>
    perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most
   </p>
   <p>
    noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting
   </p>
   <p>
    friendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for
   </p>
   <p>
    despair. But I—I have lost everything and cannot begin life
   </p>
   <p>
    anew.”
   </p>
   <p>
    As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled
   </p>
   <p>
    grief that touched me to the heart.  But he was silent and presently
   </p>
   <p>
    retired to his cabin.
   </p>
   <p>
    Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he
   </p>
   <p>
    does the beauties of nature.  The starry sky, the sea, and every sight
   </p>
   <p>
    afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of
   </p>
   <p>
    elevating his soul from earth.  Such a man has a double existence:  he
   </p>
   <p>
    may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he
   </p>
   <p>
    has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a
   </p>
   <p>
    halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.
   </p>
   <p>
    Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine
   </p>
   <p>
    wanderer?  You would not if you saw him.  You have been tutored and
   </p>
   <p>
    refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore
   </p>
   <p>
    somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to
   </p>
   <p>
    appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man.  Sometimes I
   </p>
   <p>
    have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that
   </p>
   <p>
    elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    believe it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing
   </p>
   <p>
    power of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled
   </p>
   <p>
    for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a
   </p>
   <p>
    voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.
   </p>
   <p>
    August 19th, 17—.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yesterday the stranger said to me, “You may easily perceive, Captain
   </p>
   <p>
    Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes.  I had
   </p>
   <p>
    determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with
   </p>
   <p>
    me, but you have won me to alter my determination.  You seek for
   </p>
   <p>
    knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the
   </p>
   <p>
    gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine
   </p>
   <p>
    has been.  I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be
   </p>
   <p>
    useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same
   </p>
   <p>
    course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me
   </p>
   <p>
    what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one
   </p>
   <p>
    that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you
   </p>
   <p>
    in case of failure.  Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually
   </p>
   <p>
    deemed marvellous.  Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might
   </p>
   <p>
    fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things
   </p>
   <p>
    will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would
   </p>
   <p>
    provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers
   </p>
   <p>
    of nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series
   </p>
   <p>
    internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.”
   </p>
   <p>
    You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered
   </p>
   <p>
    communication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by
   </p>
   <p>
    a recital of his misfortunes.  I felt the greatest eagerness to hear
   </p>
   <p>
    the promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong
   </p>
   <p>
    desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power.  I expressed
   </p>
   <p>
    these feelings in my answer.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but it is
   </p>
   <p>
    useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled.  I wait but for one event, and then I
   </p>
   <p>
    shall repose in peace.  I understand your feeling,” continued he,
   </p>
   <p>
    perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; “but you are mistaken, my
   </p>
   <p>
    friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my
   </p>
   <p>
    destiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is
   </p>
   <p>
    determined.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I
   </p>
   <p>
    should be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have
   </p>
   <p>
    resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to
   </p>
   <p>
    record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during
   </p>
   <p>
    the day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. This
   </p>
   <p>
    manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who
   </p>
   <p>
    know him, and who hear it from his own lips—with what interest and
   </p>
   <p>
    sympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I commence my
   </p>
   <p>
    task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me
   </p>
   <p>
    with all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in
   </p>
   <p>
    animation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul
   </p>
   <p>
    within. Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which
   </p>
   <p>
    embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it—thus!
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 1
   </p>
   <p>
    I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most
   </p>
   <p>
    distinguished of that republic.  My ancestors had been for many years
   </p>
   <p>
    counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public
   </p>
   <p>
    situations with honour and reputation.  He was respected by all who
   </p>
   <p>
    knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public
   </p>
   <p>
    business.  He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the
   </p>
   <p>
    affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his
   </p>
   <p>
    marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a
   </p>
   <p>
    husband and the father of a family.
   </p>
   <p>
    As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot
   </p>
   <p>
    refrain from relating them.  One of his most intimate friends was a
   </p>
   <p>
    merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous
   </p>
   <p>
    mischances, into poverty.  This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a
   </p>
   <p>
    proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty
   </p>
   <p>
    and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been
   </p>
   <p>
    distinguished for his rank and magnificence.  Having paid his debts,
   </p>
   <p>
    therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his
   </p>
   <p>
    daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in
   </p>
   <p>
    wretchedness.  My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and
   </p>
   <p>
    was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.
   </p>
   <p>
    He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct
   </p>
   <p>
    so little worthy of the affection that united them.  He lost no time in
   </p>
   <p>
    endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin
   </p>
   <p>
    the world again through his credit and assistance.
   </p>
   <p>
    Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten
   </p>
   <p>
    months before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery,
   </p>
   <p>
    he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the
   </p>
   <p>
    Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort
   </p>
   <p>
    had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but
   </p>
   <p>
    it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in
   </p>
   <p>
    the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a
   </p>
   <p>
    merchant’s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction;
   </p>
   <p>
    his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for
   </p>
   <p>
    reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end
   </p>
   <p>
    of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.
   </p>
   <p>
    His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw
   </p>
   <p>
    with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that
   </p>
   <p>
    there was no other prospect of support.  But Caroline Beaufort
   </p>
   <p>
    possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support
   </p>
   <p>
    her in her adversity.  She procured plain work; she plaited straw and
   </p>
   <p>
    by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to
   </p>
   <p>
    support life.
   </p>
   <p>
    Several months passed in this manner.  Her father grew worse; her time
   </p>
   <p>
    was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence
   </p>
   <p>
    decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving
   </p>
   <p>
    her an orphan and a beggar.  This last blow overcame her, and she knelt
   </p>
   <p>
    by Beaufort’s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the
   </p>
   <p>
    chamber.  He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who
   </p>
   <p>
    committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he
   </p>
   <p>
    conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a
   </p>
   <p>
    relation.  Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.
   </p>
   <p>
    There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but
   </p>
   <p>
    this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted
   </p>
   <p>
    affection.  There was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mind
   </p>
   <p>
    which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love
   </p>
   <p>
    strongly.  Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the
   </p>
   <p>
    late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set
   </p>
   <p>
    a greater value on tried worth.  There was a show of gratitude and
   </p>
   <p>
    worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the
   </p>
   <p>
    doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her
   </p>
   <p>
    virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing
   </p>
   <p>
    her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace
   </p>
   <p>
    to his behaviour to her.  Everything was made to yield to her wishes
   </p>
   <p>
    and her convenience.  He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is
   </p>
   <p>
    sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her
   </p>
   <p>
    with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and
   </p>
   <p>
    benevolent mind.  Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto
   </p>
   <p>
    constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through.  During
   </p>
   <p>
    the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had
   </p>
   <p>
    gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after
   </p>
   <p>
    their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change
   </p>
   <p>
    of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,
   </p>
   <p>
    as a restorative for her weakened frame.
   </p>
   <p>
    From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born
   </p>
   <p>
    at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained
   </p>
   <p>
    for several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each
   </p>
   <p>
    other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very
   </p>
   <p>
    mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother’s tender caresses and
   </p>
   <p>
    my father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my
   </p>
   <p>
    first recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something
   </p>
   <p>
    better—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on
   </p>
   <p>
    them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in
   </p>
   <p>
    their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled
   </p>
   <p>
    their duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed
   </p>
   <p>
    towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit
   </p>
   <p>
    of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during
   </p>
   <p>
    every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity,
   </p>
   <p>
    and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but
   </p>
   <p>
    one train of enjoyment to me.
   </p>
   <p>
    For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to have a
   </p>
   <p>
    daughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five
   </p>
   <p>
    years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they
   </p>
   <p>
    passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent
   </p>
   <p>
    disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This, to my
   </p>
   <p>
    mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a
   </p>
   <p>
    passion—remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been
   </p>
   <p>
    relieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the
   </p>
   <p>
    afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale
   </p>
   <p>
    attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number
   </p>
   <p>
    of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst
   </p>
   <p>
    shape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother,
   </p>
   <p>
    accompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife,
   </p>
   <p>
    hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to
   </p>
   <p>
    five hungry babes. Among these there was one which attracted my mother far
   </p>
   <p>
    above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others were
   </p>
   <p>
    dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her
   </p>
   <p>
    hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her
   </p>
   <p>
    clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was
   </p>
   <p>
    clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of
   </p>
   <p>
    her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold
   </p>
   <p>
    her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent,
   </p>
   <p>
    and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.
   </p>
   <p>
    The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and
   </p>
   <p>
    admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was
   </p>
   <p>
    not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a
   </p>
   <p>
    German and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with
   </p>
   <p>
    these good people to nurse: they were better off then. They had not been
   </p>
   <p>
    long married, and their eldest child was but just born. The father of their
   </p>
   <p>
    charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory
   </p>
   <p>
    of Italy—one among the _schiavi ognor frementi,_ who exerted
   </p>
   <p>
    himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of its
   </p>
   <p>
    weakness. Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria
   </p>
   <p>
    was not known. His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and
   </p>
   <p>
    a beggar. She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude
   </p>
   <p>
    abode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.
   </p>
   <p>
    When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of
   </p>
   <p>
    our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed
   </p>
   <p>
    to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter
   </p>
   <p>
    than the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his
   </p>
   <p>
    permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their
   </p>
   <p>
    charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed
   </p>
   <p>
    a blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty
   </p>
   <p>
    and want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They
   </p>
   <p>
    consulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza
   </p>
   <p>
    became the inmate of my parents’ house—my more than
   </p>
   <p>
    sister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and
   </p>
   <p>
    my pleasures.
   </p>
   <p>
    Everyone loved Elizabeth.  The passionate and almost reverential
   </p>
   <p>
    attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my
   </p>
   <p>
    pride and my delight.  On the evening previous to her being brought to
   </p>
   <p>
    my home, my mother had said playfully, “I have a pretty present for my
   </p>
   <p>
    Victor—tomorrow he shall have it.”  And when, on the morrow, she
   </p>
   <p>
    presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish
   </p>
   <p>
    seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth
   </p>
   <p>
    as mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish.  All praises bestowed on
   </p>
   <p>
    her I received as made to a possession of my own.  We called each other
   </p>
   <p>
    familiarly by the name of cousin.  No word, no expression could body
   </p>
   <p>
    forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more than
   </p>
   <p>
    sister, since till death she was to be mine only.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 2
   </p>
   <p>
    We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in
   </p>
   <p>
    our ages.  I need not say that we were strangers to any species of
   </p>
   <p>
    disunion or dispute.  Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us
   </p>
   <p>
    nearer together.  Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated
   </p>
   <p>
    disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense
   </p>
   <p>
    application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.
   </p>
   <p>
    She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets;
   </p>
   <p>
    and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss
   </p>
   <p>
    home —the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons,
   </p>
   <p>
    tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of
   </p>
   <p>
    our Alpine summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight.
   </p>
   <p>
    While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the
   </p>
   <p>
    magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their
   </p>
   <p>
    causes.  The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.
   </p>
   <p>
    Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature,
   </p>
   <p>
    gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the
   </p>
   <p>
    earliest sensations I can remember.
   </p>
   <p>
    On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave
   </p>
   <p>
    up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native
   </p>
   <p>
    country. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a _campagne_ on Belrive,
   </p>
   <p>
    the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a
   </p>
   <p>
    league from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my
   </p>
   <p>
    temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was
   </p>
   <p>
    indifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united
   </p>
   <p>
    myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry
   </p>
   <p>
    Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular
   </p>
   <p>
    talent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for
   </p>
   <p>
    its own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance.  He
   </p>
   <p>
    composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and
   </p>
   <p>
    knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into
   </p>
   <p>
    masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of
   </p>
   <p>
    Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous
   </p>
   <p>
    train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands
   </p>
   <p>
    of the infidels.
   </p>
   <p>
    No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself.  My
   </p>
   <p>
    parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.
   </p>
   <p>
    We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to
   </p>
   <p>
    their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights
   </p>
   <p>
    which we enjoyed.  When I mingled with other families I distinctly
   </p>
   <p>
    discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted
   </p>
   <p>
    the development of filial love.
   </p>
   <p>
    My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some
   </p>
   <p>
    law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits
   </p>
   <p>
    but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things
   </p>
   <p>
    indiscriminately.  I confess that neither the structure of languages,
   </p>
   <p>
    nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states
   </p>
   <p>
    possessed attractions for me.  It was the secrets of heaven and earth
   </p>
   <p>
    that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of
   </p>
   <p>
    things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man
   </p>
   <p>
    that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical,
   </p>
   <p>
    or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.
   </p>
   <p>
    Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral
   </p>
   <p>
    relations of things.  The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was
   </p>
   <p>
    to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the
   </p>
   <p>
    gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species.  The saintly soul
   </p>
   <p>
    of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of
   </p>
   <p>
    her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us.  She was
   </p>
   <p>
    the living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become
   </p>
   <p>
    sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that
   </p>
   <p>
    she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness.  And
   </p>
   <p>
    Clerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?  Yet
   </p>
   <p>
    he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his
   </p>
   <p>
    generosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for
   </p>
   <p>
    adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of
   </p>
   <p>
    beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring
   </p>
   <p>
    ambition.
   </p>
   <p>
    I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood,
   </p>
   <p>
    before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of
   </p>
   <p>
    extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides,
   </p>
   <p>
    in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which
   </p>
   <p>
    led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would
   </p>
   <p>
    account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my
   </p>
   <p>
    destiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost
   </p>
   <p>
    forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent
   </p>
   <p>
    which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.
   </p>
   <p>
    Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire,
   </p>
   <p>
    therefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my
   </p>
   <p>
    predilection for that science. When I was thirteen years of age we all went
   </p>
   <p>
    on a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the
   </p>
   <p>
    weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I
   </p>
   <p>
    chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it
   </p>
   <p>
    with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful
   </p>
   <p>
    facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new
   </p>
   <p>
    light seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my
   </p>
   <p>
    discovery to my father. My father looked carelessly at the title page of my
   </p>
   <p>
    book and said, “Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste
   </p>
   <p>
    your time upon this; it is sad trash.”
   </p>
   <p>
    If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me
   </p>
   <p>
    that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern
   </p>
   <p>
    system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers
   </p>
   <p>
    than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while
   </p>
   <p>
    those of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I
   </p>
   <p>
    should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my
   </p>
   <p>
    imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my
   </p>
   <p>
    former studies. It is even possible that the train of my ideas would never
   </p>
   <p>
    have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin. But the cursory glance
   </p>
   <p>
    my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was
   </p>
   <p>
    acquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatest
   </p>
   <p>
    avidity.
   </p>
   <p>
    When I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this
   </p>
   <p>
    author, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and
   </p>
   <p>
    studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me
   </p>
   <p>
    treasures known to few besides myself. I have described myself as always
   </p>
   <p>
    having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of
   </p>
   <p>
    nature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern
   </p>
   <p>
    philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking
   </p>
   <p>
    up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his
   </p>
   <p>
    successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted
   </p>
   <p>
    appeared even to my boy’s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same
   </p>
   <p>
    pursuit.
   </p>
   <p>
    The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted
   </p>
   <p>
    with their practical uses.  The most learned philosopher knew little
   </p>
   <p>
    more.  He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal
   </p>
   <p>
    lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery.  He might dissect,
   </p>
   <p>
    anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes
   </p>
   <p>
    in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep
   </p>
   <p>
    human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and
   </p>
   <p>
    ignorantly I had repined.
   </p>
   <p>
    But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew
   </p>
   <p>
    more. I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their
   </p>
   <p>
    disciple. It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth
   </p>
   <p>
    century; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of
   </p>
   <p>
    Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite
   </p>
   <p>
    studies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a
   </p>
   <p>
    child’s blindness, added to a student’s thirst for knowledge.
   </p>
   <p>
    Under the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest
   </p>
   <p>
    diligence into the search of the philosopher’s stone and the elixir
   </p>
   <p>
    of life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention. Wealth was an
   </p>
   <p>
    inferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could
   </p>
   <p>
    banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but
   </p>
   <p>
    a violent death!
   </p>
   <p>
    Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a
   </p>
   <p>
    promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which
   </p>
   <p>
    I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I
   </p>
   <p>
    attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a
   </p>
   <p>
    want of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And thus for a time I was
   </p>
   <p>
    occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand
   </p>
   <p>
    contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of
   </p>
   <p>
    multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish
   </p>
   <p>
    reasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.
   </p>
   <p>
    When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near
   </p>
   <p>
    Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. It
   </p>
   <p>
    advanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once
   </p>
   <p>
    with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained,
   </p>
   <p>
    while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight.
   </p>
   <p>
    As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an
   </p>
   <p>
    old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so
   </p>
   <p>
    soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing
   </p>
   <p>
    remained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next morning, we found
   </p>
   <p>
    the tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the
   </p>
   <p>
    shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood. I never beheld
   </p>
   <p>
    anything so utterly destroyed.
   </p>
   <p>
    Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of
   </p>
   <p>
    electricity.  On this occasion a man of great research in natural
   </p>
   <p>
    philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on
   </p>
   <p>
    the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of
   </p>
   <p>
    electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.
   </p>
   <p>
    All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa,
   </p>
   <p>
    Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by
   </p>
   <p>
    some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my
   </p>
   <p>
    accustomed studies.  It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever
   </p>
   <p>
    be known.  All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew
   </p>
   <p>
    despicable.  By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps
   </p>
   <p>
    most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former
   </p>
   <p>
    occupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed
   </p>
   <p>
    and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a
   </p>
   <p>
    would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of
   </p>
   <p>
    real knowledge.  In this mood of mind I betook myself to the
   </p>
   <p>
    mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as
   </p>
   <p>
    being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments
   </p>
   <p>
    are we bound to prosperity or ruin.  When I look back, it seems to me
   </p>
   <p>
    as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the
   </p>
   <p>
    immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life—the last effort
   </p>
   <p>
    made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even
   </p>
   <p>
    then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me.  Her victory was
   </p>
   <p>
    announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which
   </p>
   <p>
    followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting
   </p>
   <p>
    studies.  It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with
   </p>
   <p>
    their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual.
   </p>
   <p>
    Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and
   </p>
   <p>
    terrible destruction.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 3
   </p>
   <p>
    When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I
   </p>
   <p>
    should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt.  I had
   </p>
   <p>
    hitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it
   </p>
   <p>
    necessary for the completion of my education that I should be made
   </p>
   <p>
    acquainted with other customs than those of my native country.  My
   </p>
   <p>
    departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day
   </p>
   <p>
    resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life
   </p>
   <p>
    occurred—an omen, as it were, of my future misery.
   </p>
   <p>
    Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was
   </p>
   <p>
    in the greatest danger. During her illness many arguments had been urged to
   </p>
   <p>
    persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had at first
   </p>
   <p>
    yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her
   </p>
   <p>
    favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She
   </p>
   <p>
    attended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity
   </p>
   <p>
    of the distemper—Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this
   </p>
   <p>
    imprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my mother
   </p>
   <p>
    sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her
   </p>
   <p>
    deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert
   </p>
   <p>
    her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. “My
   </p>
   <p>
    children,” she said, “my firmest hopes of future happiness were
   </p>
   <p>
    placed on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the
   </p>
   <p>
    consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to
   </p>
   <p>
    my younger children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy
   </p>
   <p>
    and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But these are
   </p>
   <p>
    not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to
   </p>
   <p>
    death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.
   </p>
   <p>
    I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent
   </p>
   <p>
    by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the
   </p>
   <p>
    soul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance.  It is so
   </p>
   <p>
    long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day
   </p>
   <p>
    and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed
   </p>
   <p>
    for ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been
   </p>
   <p>
    extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear
   </p>
   <p>
    can be hushed, never more to be heard.  These are the reflections of
   </p>
   <p>
    the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the
   </p>
   <p>
    evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences.  Yet from whom has
   </p>
   <p>
    not that rude hand rent away some dear connection?  And why should I
   </p>
   <p>
    describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel?  The time at
   </p>
   <p>
    length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and
   </p>
   <p>
    the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a
   </p>
   <p>
    sacrilege, is not banished.  My mother was dead, but we had still
   </p>
   <p>
    duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the
   </p>
   <p>
    rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the
   </p>
   <p>
    spoiler has not seized.
   </p>
   <p>
    My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events,
   </p>
   <p>
    was now again determined upon.  I obtained from my father a respite of
   </p>
   <p>
    some weeks.  It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose,
   </p>
   <p>
    akin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of
   </p>
   <p>
    life.  I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me.  I was
   </p>
   <p>
    unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above
   </p>
   <p>
    all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.
   </p>
   <p>
    She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.
   </p>
   <p>
    She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and
   </p>
   <p>
    zeal.  She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call
   </p>
   <p>
    her uncle and cousins.  Never was she so enchanting as at this time,
   </p>
   <p>
    when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.
   </p>
   <p>
    She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.
   </p>
   <p>
    The day of my departure at length arrived.  Clerval spent the last
   </p>
   <p>
    evening with us.  He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit
   </p>
   <p>
    him to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain.  His
   </p>
   <p>
    father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the
   </p>
   <p>
    aspirations and ambition of his son.  Henry deeply felt the misfortune
   </p>
   <p>
    of being debarred from a liberal education.  He said little, but when
   </p>
   <p>
    he spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a
   </p>
   <p>
    restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details
   </p>
   <p>
    of commerce.
   </p>
   <p>
    We sat late.  We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor
   </p>
   <p>
    persuade ourselves to say the word “Farewell!”  It was said, and we
   </p>
   <p>
    retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the
   </p>
   <p>
    other was deceived; but when at morning’s dawn I descended to the
   </p>
   <p>
    carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there—my father
   </p>
   <p>
    again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to
   </p>
   <p>
    renew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last
   </p>
   <p>
    feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.
   </p>
   <p>
    I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in
   </p>
   <p>
    the most melancholy reflections.  I, who had ever been surrounded by
   </p>
   <p>
    amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasure—I was now alone.  In the university whither I was going I
   </p>
   <p>
    must form my own friends and be my own protector.  My life had hitherto
   </p>
   <p>
    been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible
   </p>
   <p>
    repugnance to new countenances.  I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and
   </p>
   <p>
    Clerval; these were “old familiar faces,” but I believed myself
   </p>
   <p>
    totally unfitted for the company of strangers.  Such were my reflections as
   </p>
   <p>
    I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge.  I had often, when at home,
   </p>
   <p>
    thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had
   </p>
   <p>
    longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to
   </p>
   <p>
    repent.
   </p>
   <p>
    I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my
   </p>
   <p>
    journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing.  At length the
   </p>
   <p>
    high white steeple of the town met my eyes.  I alighted and was
   </p>
   <p>
    conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.
   </p>
   <p>
    The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to
   </p>
   <p>
    some of the principal professors.  Chance—or rather the evil
   </p>
   <p>
    influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me
   </p>
   <p>
    from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father’s
   </p>
   <p>
    door—led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy.  He
   </p>
   <p>
    was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He
   </p>
   <p>
    asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches
   </p>
   <p>
    of science appertaining to natural philosophy.  I replied carelessly, and
   </p>
   <p>
    partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal
   </p>
   <p>
    authors I had studied.  The professor stared.  “Have you,” he
   </p>
   <p>
    said, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?”
   </p>
   <p>
    I replied in the affirmative.  “Every minute,” continued M. Krempe with
   </p>
   <p>
    warmth, “every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly
   </p>
   <p>
    and entirely lost.  You have burdened your memory with exploded systems
   </p>
   <p>
    and useless names.  Good God!  In what desert land have you lived,
   </p>
   <p>
    where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you
   </p>
   <p>
    have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they
   </p>
   <p>
    are ancient?  I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific
   </p>
   <p>
    age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus.  My dear
   </p>
   <p>
    sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.”
   </p>
   <p>
    So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books
   </p>
   <p>
    treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and
   </p>
   <p>
    dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following
   </p>
   <p>
    week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural
   </p>
   <p>
    philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow
   </p>
   <p>
    professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he
   </p>
   <p>
    omitted.
   </p>
   <p>
    I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long
   </p>
   <p>
    considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I
   </p>
   <p>
    returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any
   </p>
   <p>
    shape.  M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a
   </p>
   <p>
    repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in
   </p>
   <p>
    favour of his pursuits.  In rather a too philosophical and connected a
   </p>
   <p>
    strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come
   </p>
   <p>
    to concerning them in my early years.  As a child I had not been
   </p>
   <p>
    content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural
   </p>
   <p>
    science.  With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my
   </p>
   <p>
    extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the
   </p>
   <p>
    steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the
   </p>
   <p>
    discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.
   </p>
   <p>
    Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was very different when the masters of the science sought
   </p>
   <p>
    immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now
   </p>
   <p>
    the scene was changed.  The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit
   </p>
   <p>
    itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in
   </p>
   <p>
    science was chiefly founded.  I was required to exchange chimeras of
   </p>
   <p>
    boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.
   </p>
   <p>
    Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my
   </p>
   <p>
    residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming
   </p>
   <p>
    acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new
   </p>
   <p>
    abode.  But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information
   </p>
   <p>
    which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures.  And although I
   </p>
   <p>
    could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver
   </p>
   <p>
    sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.
   </p>
   <p>
    Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.
   </p>
   <p>
    Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing
   </p>
   <p>
    room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very
   </p>
   <p>
    unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an
   </p>
   <p>
    aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his
   </p>
   <p>
    temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person
   </p>
   <p>
    was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.
   </p>
   <p>
    He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and
   </p>
   <p>
    the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing
   </p>
   <p>
    with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took
   </p>
   <p>
    a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of
   </p>
   <p>
    its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he
   </p>
   <p>
    concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I
   </p>
   <p>
    shall never forget:
   </p>
   <p>
    “The ancient teachers of this science,” said he,
   </p>
   <p>
    “promised impossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masters
   </p>
   <p>
    promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that
   </p>
   <p>
    the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem
   </p>
   <p>
    only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or
   </p>
   <p>
    crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses
   </p>
   <p>
    of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. They ascend into the
   </p>
   <p>
    heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of
   </p>
   <p>
    the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers;
   </p>
   <p>
    they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even
   </p>
   <p>
    mock the invisible world with its own shadows.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Such were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of
   </p>
   <p>
    the fate—enounced to destroy me.  As he went on I felt as if my soul
   </p>
   <p>
    were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were
   </p>
   <p>
    touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was
   </p>
   <p>
    sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,
   </p>
   <p>
    one purpose.  So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of
   </p>
   <p>
    Frankenstein—more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps
   </p>
   <p>
    already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and
   </p>
   <p>
    unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.
   </p>
   <p>
    I closed not my eyes that night.  My internal being was in a state of
   </p>
   <p>
    insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I
   </p>
   <p>
    had no power to produce it.  By degrees, after the morning’s dawn,
   </p>
   <p>
    sleep came.  I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream.
   </p>
   <p>
    There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to
   </p>
   <p>
    devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a
   </p>
   <p>
    natural talent.  On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit.  His
   </p>
   <p>
    manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,
   </p>
   <p>
    for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in
   </p>
   <p>
    his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had
   </p>
   <p>
    given to his fellow professor.  He heard with attention the little
   </p>
   <p>
    narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius
   </p>
   <p>
    Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had
   </p>
   <p>
    exhibited. He said that “These were men to whose indefatigable zeal
   </p>
   <p>
    modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their
   </p>
   <p>
    knowledge.  They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names
   </p>
   <p>
    and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a
   </p>
   <p>
    great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light.  The
   </p>
   <p>
    labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever
   </p>
   <p>
    fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.”  I
   </p>
   <p>
    listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption
   </p>
   <p>
    or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my
   </p>
   <p>
    prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured
   </p>
   <p>
    terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his
   </p>
   <p>
    instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have
   </p>
   <p>
    made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended
   </p>
   <p>
    labours.  I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to
   </p>
   <p>
    procure.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a
   </p>
   <p>
    disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of
   </p>
   <p>
    your success. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the
   </p>
   <p>
    greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that
   </p>
   <p>
    I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not
   </p>
   <p>
    neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry
   </p>
   <p>
    chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your
   </p>
   <p>
    wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty
   </p>
   <p>
    experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural
   </p>
   <p>
    philosophy, including mathematics.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his
   </p>
   <p>
    various machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and
   </p>
   <p>
    promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in
   </p>
   <p>
    the science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of
   </p>
   <p>
    books which I had requested, and I took my leave.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 4
   </p>
   <p>
    From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the
   </p>
   <p>
    most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.
   </p>
   <p>
    I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,
   </p>
   <p>
    which modern inquirers have written on these subjects.  I attended the
   </p>
   <p>
    lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the
   </p>
   <p>
    university, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense
   </p>
   <p>
    and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive
   </p>
   <p>
    physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable.  In
   </p>
   <p>
    M. Waldman I found a true friend.  His gentleness was never tinged by
   </p>
   <p>
    dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and
   </p>
   <p>
    good nature that banished every idea of pedantry.  In a thousand ways
   </p>
   <p>
    he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse
   </p>
   <p>
    inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension.  My application was at
   </p>
   <p>
    first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and
   </p>
   <p>
    soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the
   </p>
   <p>
    light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.
   </p>
   <p>
    As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress
   </p>
   <p>
    was rapid.  My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and
   </p>
   <p>
    my proficiency that of the masters.  Professor Krempe often asked me,
   </p>
   <p>
    with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman
   </p>
   <p>
    expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress.  Two years
   </p>
   <p>
    passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was
   </p>
   <p>
    engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I
   </p>
   <p>
    hoped to make.  None but those who have experienced them can conceive
   </p>
   <p>
    of the enticements of science.  In other studies you go as far as
   </p>
   <p>
    others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in
   </p>
   <p>
    a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.
   </p>
   <p>
    A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must
   </p>
   <p>
    infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who
   </p>
   <p>
    continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was
   </p>
   <p>
    solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two
   </p>
   <p>
    years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical
   </p>
   <p>
    instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the
   </p>
   <p>
    university.  When I had arrived at this point and had become as well
   </p>
   <p>
    acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as
   </p>
   <p>
    depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my
   </p>
   <p>
    residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought
   </p>
   <p>
    of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident
   </p>
   <p>
    happened that protracted my stay.
   </p>
   <p>
    One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was
   </p>
   <p>
    the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with
   </p>
   <p>
    life.  Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?
   </p>
   <p>
    It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a
   </p>
   <p>
    mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming
   </p>
   <p>
    acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our
   </p>
   <p>
    inquiries.  I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined
   </p>
   <p>
    thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of
   </p>
   <p>
    natural philosophy which relate to physiology.  Unless I had been
   </p>
   <p>
    animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this
   </p>
   <p>
    study would have been irksome and almost intolerable.  To examine the
   </p>
   <p>
    causes of life, we must first have recourse to death.  I became
   </p>
   <p>
    acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I
   </p>
   <p>
    must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.
   </p>
   <p>
    In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my
   </p>
   <p>
    mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors.  I do not ever
   </p>
   <p>
    remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared
   </p>
   <p>
    the apparition of a spirit.  Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and
   </p>
   <p>
    a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of
   </p>
   <p>
    life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become
   </p>
   <p>
    food for the worm.  Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of
   </p>
   <p>
    this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and
   </p>
   <p>
    charnel-houses.  My attention was fixed upon every object the most
   </p>
   <p>
    insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings.  I saw how the
   </p>
   <p>
    fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of
   </p>
   <p>
    death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm
   </p>
   <p>
    inherited the wonders of the eye and brain.  I paused, examining and
   </p>
   <p>
    analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change
   </p>
   <p>
    from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this
   </p>
   <p>
    darkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and
   </p>
   <p>
    wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity
   </p>
   <p>
    of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so
   </p>
   <p>
    many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same
   </p>
   <p>
    science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a
   </p>
   <p>
    secret.
   </p>
   <p>
    Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman.  The sun does not
   </p>
   <p>
    more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is
   </p>
   <p>
    true.  Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the
   </p>
   <p>
    discovery were distinct and probable.  After days and nights of
   </p>
   <p>
    incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of
   </p>
   <p>
    generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing
   </p>
   <p>
    animation upon lifeless matter.
   </p>
   <p>
    The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery
   </p>
   <p>
    soon gave place to delight and rapture.  After so much time spent in
   </p>
   <p>
    painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the
   </p>
   <p>
    most gratifying consummation of my toils.  But this discovery was so
   </p>
   <p>
    great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been
   </p>
   <p>
    progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.
   </p>
   <p>
    What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation
   </p>
   <p>
    of the world was now within my grasp.  Not that, like a magic scene, it
   </p>
   <p>
    all opened upon me at once:  the information I had obtained was of a
   </p>
   <p>
    nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them
   </p>
   <p>
    towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already
   </p>
   <p>
    accomplished.  I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead
   </p>
   <p>
    and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly
   </p>
   <p>
    ineffectual light.
   </p>
   <p>
    I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes
   </p>
   <p>
    express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with
   </p>
   <p>
    which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end
   </p>
   <p>
    of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that
   </p>
   <p>
    subject.  I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was,
   </p>
   <p>
    to your destruction and infallible misery.  Learn from me, if not by my
   </p>
   <p>
    precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of
   </p>
   <p>
    knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town
   </p>
   <p>
    to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature
   </p>
   <p>
    will allow.
   </p>
   <p>
    When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated
   </p>
   <p>
    a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to
   </p>
   <p>
    prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of
   </p>
   <p>
    fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable
   </p>
   <p>
    difficulty and labour.  I doubted at first whether I should attempt the
   </p>
   <p>
    creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my
   </p>
   <p>
    imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to
   </p>
   <p>
    doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful
   </p>
   <p>
    as man.  The materials at present within my command hardly appeared
   </p>
   <p>
    adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should
   </p>
   <p>
    ultimately succeed.  I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my
   </p>
   <p>
    operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be
   </p>
   <p>
    imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes
   </p>
   <p>
    place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present
   </p>
   <p>
    attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success.  Nor
   </p>
   <p>
    could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any
   </p>
   <p>
    argument of its impracticability.  It was with these feelings that I
   </p>
   <p>
    began the creation of a human being.  As the minuteness of the parts
   </p>
   <p>
    formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first
   </p>
   <p>
    intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,
   </p>
   <p>
    about eight feet in height, and proportionably large.  After having
   </p>
   <p>
    formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully
   </p>
   <p>
    collecting and arranging my materials, I began.
   </p>
   <p>
    No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like
   </p>
   <p>
    a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success.  Life and death
   </p>
   <p>
    appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and
   </p>
   <p>
    pour a torrent of light into our dark world.  A new species would bless
   </p>
   <p>
    me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would
   </p>
   <p>
    owe their being to me.  No father could claim the gratitude of his
   </p>
   <p>
    child so completely as I should deserve theirs.  Pursuing these
   </p>
   <p>
    reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless
   </p>
   <p>
    matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible)
   </p>
   <p>
    renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.
   </p>
   <p>
    These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking
   </p>
   <p>
    with unremitting ardour.  My cheek had grown pale with study, and my
   </p>
   <p>
    person had become emaciated with confinement.  Sometimes, on the very
   </p>
   <p>
    brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the
   </p>
   <p>
    next day or the next hour might realise.  One secret which I alone
   </p>
   <p>
    possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon
   </p>
   <p>
    gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless
   </p>
   <p>
    eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places.  Who shall conceive
   </p>
   <p>
    the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps
   </p>
   <p>
    of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless
   </p>
   <p>
    clay?  My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but
   </p>
   <p>
    then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed
   </p>
   <p>
    to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit.  It was
   </p>
   <p>
    indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed
   </p>
   <p>
    acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had
   </p>
   <p>
    returned to my old habits.  I collected bones from charnel-houses and
   </p>
   <p>
    disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human
   </p>
   <p>
    frame.  In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,
   </p>
   <p>
    and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,
   </p>
   <p>
    I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from
   </p>
   <p>
    their sockets in attending to the details of my employment.  The
   </p>
   <p>
    dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;
   </p>
   <p>
    and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,
   </p>
   <p>
    whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I
   </p>
   <p>
    brought my work near to a conclusion.
   </p>
   <p>
    The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in
   </p>
   <p>
    one pursuit.  It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields
   </p>
   <p>
    bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant
   </p>
   <p>
    vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature.  And the
   </p>
   <p>
    same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also
   </p>
   <p>
    to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had
   </p>
   <p>
    not seen for so long a time.  I knew my silence disquieted them, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    well remembered the words of my father:  “I know that while you are
   </p>
   <p>
    pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall
   </p>
   <p>
    hear regularly from you.  You must pardon me if I regard any
   </p>
   <p>
    interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties
   </p>
   <p>
    are equally neglected.”
   </p>
   <p>
    I knew well therefore what would be my father’s feelings, but I could
   </p>
   <p>
    not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which
   </p>
   <p>
    had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination.  I wished, as it
   </p>
   <p>
    were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection
   </p>
   <p>
    until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature,
   </p>
   <p>
    should be completed.
   </p>
   <p>
    I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect
   </p>
   <p>
    to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was
   </p>
   <p>
    justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from
   </p>
   <p>
    blame.  A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and
   </p>
   <p>
    peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to
   </p>
   <p>
    disturb his tranquillity.  I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge
   </p>
   <p>
    is an exception to this rule.  If the study to which you apply yourself
   </p>
   <p>
    has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for
   </p>
   <p>
    those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that
   </p>
   <p>
    study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human
   </p>
   <p>
    mind.  If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit
   </p>
   <p>
    whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic
   </p>
   <p>
    affections, Greece had not been enslaved, Cæsar would have spared his
   </p>
   <p>
    country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.
   </p>
   <p>
    But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my
   </p>
   <p>
    tale, and your looks remind me to proceed.
   </p>
   <p>
    My father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my
   </p>
   <p>
    silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.
   </p>
   <p>
    Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not
   </p>
   <p>
    watch the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before always
   </p>
   <p>
    yielded me supreme delight—so deeply was I engrossed in my
   </p>
   <p>
    occupation. The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near
   </p>
   <p>
    to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had
   </p>
   <p>
    succeeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared
   </p>
   <p>
    rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other
   </p>
   <p>
    unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.
   </p>
   <p>
    Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most
   </p>
   <p>
    painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow
   </p>
   <p>
    creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed at
   </p>
   <p>
    the wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone
   </p>
   <p>
    sustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and
   </p>
   <p>
    amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself
   </p>
   <p>
    both of these when my creation should be complete.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 5
   </p>
   <p>
    It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment
   </p>
   <p>
    of my toils.  With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I
   </p>
   <p>
    collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a
   </p>
   <p>
    spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet.  It was
   </p>
   <p>
    already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the
   </p>
   <p>
    panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the
   </p>
   <p>
    half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature
   </p>
   <p>
    open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.
   </p>
   <p>
    How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate
   </p>
   <p>
    the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to
   </p>
   <p>
    form?  His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as
   </p>
   <p>
    beautiful.  Beautiful!  Great God!  His yellow skin scarcely covered
   </p>
   <p>
    the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous
   </p>
   <p>
    black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these
   </p>
   <p>
    luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes,
   </p>
   <p>
    that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which
   </p>
   <p>
    they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.
   </p>
   <p>
    The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings
   </p>
   <p>
    of human nature.  I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole
   </p>
   <p>
    purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body.  For this I had
   </p>
   <p>
    deprived myself of rest and health.  I had desired it with an ardour
   </p>
   <p>
    that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty
   </p>
   <p>
    of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my
   </p>
   <p>
    heart.  Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I
   </p>
   <p>
    rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my
   </p>
   <p>
    bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep.  At length lassitude
   </p>
   <p>
    succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the
   </p>
   <p>
    bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.
   </p>
   <p>
    But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest
   </p>
   <p>
    dreams.  I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in
   </p>
   <p>
    the streets of Ingolstadt.  Delighted and surprised, I embraced her,
   </p>
   <p>
    but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with
   </p>
   <p>
    the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I
   </p>
   <p>
    held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her
   </p>
   <p>
    form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.
   </p>
   <p>
    I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my
   </p>
   <p>
    teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and
   </p>
   <p>
    yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window
   </p>
   <p>
    shutters, I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom I had
   </p>
   <p>
    created.  He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they
   </p>
   <p>
    may be called, were fixed on me.  His jaws opened, and he muttered some
   </p>
   <p>
    inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks.  He might have
   </p>
   <p>
    spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to
   </p>
   <p>
    detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs.  I took refuge in the
   </p>
   <p>
    courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained
   </p>
   <p>
    during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest
   </p>
   <p>
    agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if
   </p>
   <p>
    it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I
   </p>
   <p>
    had so miserably given life.
   </p>
   <p>
    Oh!  No mortal could support the horror of that countenance.  A mummy
   </p>
   <p>
    again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those
   </p>
   <p>
    muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing
   </p>
   <p>
    such as even Dante could not have conceived.
   </p>
   <p>
    I passed the night wretchedly.  Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and
   </p>
   <p>
    hardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly
   </p>
   <p>
    sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness.  Mingled with
   </p>
   <p>
    this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had
   </p>
   <p>
    been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a
   </p>
   <p>
    hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!
   </p>
   <p>
    Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my
   </p>
   <p>
    sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple
   </p>
   <p>
    and clock, which indicated the sixth hour.  The porter opened the gates
   </p>
   <p>
    of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into
   </p>
   <p>
    the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the
   </p>
   <p>
    wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my
   </p>
   <p>
    view.  I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but
   </p>
   <p>
    felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured
   </p>
   <p>
    from a black and comfortless sky.
   </p>
   <p>
    I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by
   </p>
   <p>
    bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or
   </p>
   <p>
    what I was doing.  My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:
   </p>
   <p>
    Like one who, on a lonely road,
   </p>
   <p>
    Doth walk in fear and dread,
   </p>
   <p>
    And, having once turned round, walks on,
   </p>
   <p>
    And turns no more his head;
   </p>
   <p>
    Because he knows a frightful fiend
   </p>
   <p>
    Doth close behind him tread.
   </p>
   <p>
    [Coleridge’s “Ancient Mariner.”]
   </p>
   <p>
    Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various
   </p>
   <p>
    diligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why;
   </p>
   <p>
    but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming
   </p>
   <p>
    towards me from the other end of the street. As it drew nearer I observed
   </p>
   <p>
    that it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and
   </p>
   <p>
    on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me,
   </p>
   <p>
    instantly sprung out. “My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed he,
   </p>
   <p>
    “how glad I am to see you! How fortunate that you should be here at
   </p>
   <p>
    the very moment of my alighting!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back
   </p>
   <p>
    to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear
   </p>
   <p>
    to my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror
   </p>
   <p>
    and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months,
   </p>
   <p>
    calm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial
   </p>
   <p>
    manner, and we walked towards my college. Clerval continued talking for
   </p>
   <p>
    some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being
   </p>
   <p>
    permitted to come to Ingolstadt. “You may easily believe,” said
   </p>
   <p>
    he, “how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all
   </p>
   <p>
    necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping;
   </p>
   <p>
    and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant
   </p>
   <p>
    answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch
   </p>
   <p>
    schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: ‘I have ten thousand florins
   </p>
   <p>
    a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.’ But his
   </p>
   <p>
    affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has
   </p>
   <p>
    permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of
   </p>
   <p>
    knowledge.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left
   </p>
   <p>
    my father, brothers, and Elizabeth.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from
   </p>
   <p>
    you so seldom.  By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their
   </p>
   <p>
    account myself.  But, my dear Frankenstein,” continued he, stopping
   </p>
   <p>
    short and gazing full in my face, “I did not before remark how very ill
   </p>
   <p>
    you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for
   </p>
   <p>
    several nights.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one
   </p>
   <p>
    occupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see;
   </p>
   <p>
    but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an
   </p>
   <p>
    end and that I am at length free.”
   </p>
   <p>
    I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to
   </p>
   <p>
    allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night.  I walked with a
   </p>
   <p>
    quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college.  I then reflected, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my
   </p>
   <p>
    apartment might still be there, alive and walking about.  I dreaded to
   </p>
   <p>
    behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.
   </p>
   <p>
    Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the
   </p>
   <p>
    stairs, I darted up towards my own room.  My hand was already on the
   </p>
   <p>
    lock of the door before I recollected myself.  I then paused, and a
   </p>
   <p>
    cold shivering came over me.  I threw the door forcibly open, as
   </p>
   <p>
    children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in
   </p>
   <p>
    waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared.  I stepped
   </p>
   <p>
    fearfully in:  the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed
   </p>
   <p>
    from its hideous guest.  I could hardly believe that so great a good
   </p>
   <p>
    fortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy
   </p>
   <p>
    had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.
   </p>
   <p>
    We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast;
   </p>
   <p>
    but I was unable to contain myself.  It was not joy only that possessed
   </p>
   <p>
    me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse
   </p>
   <p>
    beat rapidly.  I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same
   </p>
   <p>
    place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival,
   </p>
   <p>
    but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes
   </p>
   <p>
    for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless
   </p>
   <p>
    laughter frightened and astonished him.
   </p>
   <p>
    “My dear Victor,” cried he, “what, for God’s sake,
   </p>
   <p>
    is the matter?  Do not laugh in that manner.  How ill you are!  What is the
   </p>
   <p>
    cause of all this?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Do not ask me,” cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I
   </p>
   <p>
    thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; “_he_ can
   </p>
   <p>
    tell. Oh, save me!  Save me!”  I imagined that the monster seized me;
   </p>
   <p>
    I struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.
   </p>
   <p>
    Poor Clerval!  What must have been his feelings?  A meeting, which he
   </p>
   <p>
    anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness.  But I
   </p>
   <p>
    was not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not
   </p>
   <p>
    recover my senses for a long, long time.
   </p>
   <p>
    This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for
   </p>
   <p>
    several months.  During all that time Henry was my only nurse.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    afterwards learned that, knowing my father’s advanced age and unfitness
   </p>
   <p>
    for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make
   </p>
   <p>
    Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my
   </p>
   <p>
    disorder.  He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive
   </p>
   <p>
    nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he
   </p>
   <p>
    did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest
   </p>
   <p>
    action that he could towards them.
   </p>
   <p>
    But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and
   </p>
   <p>
    unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.
   </p>
   <p>
    The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever
   </p>
   <p>
    before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him.  Doubtless my
   </p>
   <p>
    words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings
   </p>
   <p>
    of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I
   </p>
   <p>
    continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder
   </p>
   <p>
    indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.
   </p>
   <p>
    By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and
   </p>
   <p>
    grieved my friend, I recovered.  I remember the first time I became
   </p>
   <p>
    capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I
   </p>
   <p>
    perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young
   </p>
   <p>
    buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window.  It was
   </p>
   <p>
    a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my
   </p>
   <p>
    convalescence.  I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in
   </p>
   <p>
    my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as
   </p>
   <p>
    cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Dearest Clerval,” exclaimed I, “how kind, how very good
   </p>
   <p>
    you are to me. This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you
   </p>
   <p>
    promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever
   </p>
   <p>
    repay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I
   </p>
   <p>
    have been the occasion, but you will forgive me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get
   </p>
   <p>
    well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I
   </p>
   <p>
    may speak to you on one subject, may I not?”
   </p>
   <p>
    I trembled. One subject! What could it be? Could he allude to an object on
   </p>
   <p>
    whom I dared not even think?
   </p>
   <p>
    “Compose yourself,” said Clerval, who observed my change of
   </p>
   <p>
    colour, “I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father
   </p>
   <p>
    and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your
   </p>
   <p>
    own handwriting. They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at
   </p>
   <p>
    your long silence.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Is that all, my dear Henry?  How could you suppose that my first
   </p>
   <p>
    thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and
   </p>
   <p>
    who are so deserving of my love?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad
   </p>
   <p>
    to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from
   </p>
   <p>
    your cousin, I believe.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 6
   </p>
   <p>
    Clerval then put the following letter into my hands.  It was from my
   </p>
   <p>
    own Elizabeth:
   </p>
   <p>
    “My dearest Cousin,
   </p>
   <p>
    “You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear
   </p>
   <p>
    kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account.  You are
   </p>
   <p>
    forbidden to write—to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor,
   </p>
   <p>
    is necessary to calm our apprehensions.  For a long time I have thought
   </p>
   <p>
    that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have
   </p>
   <p>
    restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt.  I have
   </p>
   <p>
    prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so
   </p>
   <p>
    long a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to
   </p>
   <p>
    perform it myself!  I figure to myself that the task of attending on
   </p>
   <p>
    your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never
   </p>
   <p>
    guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of
   </p>
   <p>
    your poor cousin.  Yet that is over now:  Clerval writes that indeed
   </p>
   <p>
    you are getting better.  I eagerly hope that you will confirm this
   </p>
   <p>
    intelligence soon in your own handwriting.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Get well—and return to us.  You will find a happy, cheerful home and
   </p>
   <p>
    friends who love you dearly.  Your father’s health is vigorous, and he
   </p>
   <p>
    asks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a
   </p>
   <p>
    care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance.  How pleased you would
   </p>
   <p>
    be to remark the improvement of our Ernest!  He is now sixteen and full
   </p>
   <p>
    of activity and spirit.  He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter
   </p>
   <p>
    into foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his
   </p>
   <p>
    elder brother returns to us.  My uncle is not pleased with the idea of
   </p>
   <p>
    a military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your
   </p>
   <p>
    powers of application.  He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his
   </p>
   <p>
    time is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the
   </p>
   <p>
    lake.  I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point
   </p>
   <p>
    and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken
   </p>
   <p>
    place since you left us.  The blue lake and snow-clad mountains—they
   </p>
   <p>
    never change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are
   </p>
   <p>
    regulated by the same immutable laws.  My trifling occupations take up
   </p>
   <p>
    my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing
   </p>
   <p>
    none but happy, kind faces around me.  Since you left us, but one
   </p>
   <p>
    change has taken place in our little household.  Do you remember on
   </p>
   <p>
    what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family?  Probably you do not;
   </p>
   <p>
    I will relate her history, therefore in a few words.  Madame Moritz,
   </p>
   <p>
    her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the
   </p>
   <p>
    third.  This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but
   </p>
   <p>
    through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and
   </p>
   <p>
    after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill.  My aunt observed
   </p>
   <p>
    this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother
   </p>
   <p>
    to allow her to live at our house.  The republican institutions of our
   </p>
   <p>
    country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which
   </p>
   <p>
    prevail in the great monarchies that surround it.  Hence there is less
   </p>
   <p>
    distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the
   </p>
   <p>
    lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are
   </p>
   <p>
    more refined and moral.  A servant in Geneva does not mean the same
   </p>
   <p>
    thing as a servant in France and England.  Justine, thus received in
   </p>
   <p>
    our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our
   </p>
   <p>
    fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a
   </p>
   <p>
    sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I
   </p>
   <p>
    recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one
   </p>
   <p>
    glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that
   </p>
   <p>
    Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica—she looked so
   </p>
   <p>
    frank-hearted and happy.  My aunt conceived a great attachment for her,
   </p>
   <p>
    by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that
   </p>
   <p>
    which she had at first intended.  This benefit was fully repaid;
   </p>
   <p>
    Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world:  I do not
   </p>
   <p>
    mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but
   </p>
   <p>
    you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.
   </p>
   <p>
    Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate,
   </p>
   <p>
    yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt.  She
   </p>
   <p>
    thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her
   </p>
   <p>
    phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.
   </p>
   <p>
    “When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own
   </p>
   <p>
    grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness
   </p>
   <p>
    with the most anxious affection.  Poor Justine was very ill; but other
   </p>
   <p>
    trials were reserved for her.
   </p>
   <p>
    “One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the
   </p>
   <p>
    exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless.  The
   </p>
   <p>
    conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the
   </p>
   <p>
    deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her
   </p>
   <p>
    partiality.  She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor
   </p>
   <p>
    confirmed the idea which she had conceived.  Accordingly, a few months
   </p>
   <p>
    after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her
   </p>
   <p>
    repentant mother.  Poor girl!  She wept when she quitted our house; she
   </p>
   <p>
    was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness
   </p>
   <p>
    and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable
   </p>
   <p>
    for vivacity.  Nor was her residence at her mother’s house of a nature
   </p>
   <p>
    to restore her gaiety.  The poor woman was very vacillating in her
   </p>
   <p>
    repentance.  She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness,
   </p>
   <p>
    but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her
   </p>
   <p>
    brothers and sister.  Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz
   </p>
   <p>
    into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is
   </p>
   <p>
    now at peace for ever.  She died on the first approach of cold weather,
   </p>
   <p>
    at the beginning of this last winter.  Justine has just returned to us;
   </p>
   <p>
    and I assure you I love her tenderly.  She is very clever and gentle,
   </p>
   <p>
    and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her
   </p>
   <p>
    expression continually remind me of my dear aunt.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling
   </p>
   <p>
    William.  I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with
   </p>
   <p>
    sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair.  When he
   </p>
   <p>
    smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with
   </p>
   <p>
    health.  He has already had one or two little _wives,_ but Louisa Biron
   </p>
   <p>
    is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little
   </p>
   <p>
    gossip concerning the good people of Geneva.  The pretty Miss Mansfield
   </p>
   <p>
    has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching
   </p>
   <p>
    marriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq.  Her ugly
   </p>
   <p>
    sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Your
   </p>
   <p>
    favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes
   </p>
   <p>
    since the departure of Clerval from Geneva.  But he has already
   </p>
   <p>
    recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a
   </p>
   <p>
    lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier.  She is a widow, and much
   </p>
   <p>
    older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with
   </p>
   <p>
    everybody.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety
   </p>
   <p>
    returns upon me as I conclude.  Write, dearest Victor,—one line—one
   </p>
   <p>
    word will be a blessing to us.  Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his
   </p>
   <p>
    kindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely
   </p>
   <p>
    grateful.  Adieu!  my cousin; take care of yourself; and, I entreat
   </p>
   <p>
    you, write!
   </p>
   <p>
    “Elizabeth Lavenza.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Geneva, March 18th, 17—.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Dear, dear Elizabeth!” I exclaimed, when I had read her
   </p>
   <p>
    letter: “I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety
   </p>
   <p>
    they must feel.” I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but
   </p>
   <p>
    my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly. In another
   </p>
   <p>
    fortnight I was able to leave my chamber.
   </p>
   <p>
    One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the
   </p>
   <p>
    several professors of the university.  In doing this, I underwent a
   </p>
   <p>
    kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had
   </p>
   <p>
    sustained.  Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even
   </p>
   <p>
    to the name of natural philosophy.  When I was otherwise quite restored
   </p>
   <p>
    to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony
   </p>
   <p>
    of my nervous symptoms.  Henry saw this, and had removed all my
   </p>
   <p>
    apparatus from my view.  He had also changed my apartment; for he
   </p>
   <p>
    perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had
   </p>
   <p>
    previously been my laboratory.  But these cares of Clerval were made of
   </p>
   <p>
    no avail when I visited the professors.  M. Waldman inflicted torture
   </p>
   <p>
    when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I
   </p>
   <p>
    had made in the sciences.  He soon perceived that I disliked the
   </p>
   <p>
    subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to
   </p>
   <p>
    modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science
   </p>
   <p>
    itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out.  What
   </p>
   <p>
    could I do?  He meant to please, and he tormented me.  I felt as if he
   </p>
   <p>
    had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which
   </p>
   <p>
    were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the
   </p>
   <p>
    sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his
   </p>
   <p>
    total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak.  I saw plainly
   </p>
   <p>
    that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from
   </p>
   <p>
    me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence
   </p>
   <p>
    that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in
   </p>
   <p>
    him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which
   </p>
   <p>
    I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.
   </p>
   <p>
    M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of
   </p>
   <p>
    almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even
   </p>
   <p>
    more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. “D—n
   </p>
   <p>
    the fellow!” cried he; “why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has
   </p>
   <p>
    outstript us all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A
   </p>
   <p>
    youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly
   </p>
   <p>
    as in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if
   </p>
   <p>
    he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.—Ay,
   </p>
   <p>
    ay,” continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering,
   </p>
   <p>
    “M. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.
   </p>
   <p>
    Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was
   </p>
   <p>
    myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.”
   </p>
   <p>
    M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned
   </p>
   <p>
    the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his
   </p>
   <p>
    literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me.  He
   </p>
   <p>
    came to the university with the design of making himself complete
   </p>
   <p>
    master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for
   </p>
   <p>
    the plan of life he had marked out for himself.  Resolved to pursue no
   </p>
   <p>
    inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording
   </p>
   <p>
    scope for his spirit of enterprise.  The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit
   </p>
   <p>
    languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on
   </p>
   <p>
    the same studies.  Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I
   </p>
   <p>
    wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt
   </p>
   <p>
    great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not
   </p>
   <p>
    only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for
   </p>
   <p>
    I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary
   </p>
   <p>
    amusement.  I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well
   </p>
   <p>
    repaid my labours.  Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy
   </p>
   <p>
    elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of
   </p>
   <p>
    any other country.  When you read their writings, life appears to
   </p>
   <p>
    consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,—in the smiles and frowns
   </p>
   <p>
    of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart.  How
   </p>
   <p>
    different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!
   </p>
   <p>
    Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was
   </p>
   <p>
    fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several
   </p>
   <p>
    accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable,
   </p>
   <p>
    and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring.  I felt this
   </p>
   <p>
    delay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved
   </p>
   <p>
    friends.  My return had only been delayed so long, from an
   </p>
   <p>
    unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become
   </p>
   <p>
    acquainted with any of its inhabitants.  The winter, however, was spent
   </p>
   <p>
    cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came
   </p>
   <p>
    its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.
   </p>
   <p>
    The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily
   </p>
   <p>
    which was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a
   </p>
   <p>
    pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a
   </p>
   <p>
    personal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited.  I acceded
   </p>
   <p>
    with pleasure to this proposition:  I was fond of exercise, and Clerval
   </p>
   <p>
    had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature
   </p>
   <p>
    that I had taken among the scenes of my native country.
   </p>
   <p>
    We passed a fortnight in these perambulations:  my health and spirits
   </p>
   <p>
    had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the
   </p>
   <p>
    salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the conversation of my friend.  Study had before secluded me from the
   </p>
   <p>
    intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but
   </p>
   <p>
    Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught
   </p>
   <p>
    me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.
   </p>
   <p>
    Excellent friend!  how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to
   </p>
   <p>
    elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own.  A selfish
   </p>
   <p>
    pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and
   </p>
   <p>
    affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature
   </p>
   <p>
    who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.
   </p>
   <p>
    When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most
   </p>
   <p>
    delightful sensations.  A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with
   </p>
   <p>
    ecstasy.  The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring
   </p>
   <p>
    bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed
   </p>
   <p>
    upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an
   </p>
   <p>
    invincible burden.
   </p>
   <p>
    Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he
   </p>
   <p>
    exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled
   </p>
   <p>
    his soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly
   </p>
   <p>
    astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in
   </p>
   <p>
    imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful
   </p>
   <p>
    fancy and passion. At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew
   </p>
   <p>
    me out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.
   </p>
   <p>
    We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were
   </p>
   <p>
    dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits were
   </p>
   <p>
    high, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 7
   </p>
   <p>
    On my return, I found the following letter from my father:—
   </p>
   <p>
    “My dear Victor,
   </p>
   <p>
    “You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of
   </p>
   <p>
    your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few
   </p>
   <p>
    lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you.  But
   </p>
   <p>
    that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it.  What would be
   </p>
   <p>
    your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to
   </p>
   <p>
    behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?  And how, Victor, can
   </p>
   <p>
    I relate our misfortune?  Absence cannot have rendered you callous to
   </p>
   <p>
    our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent
   </p>
   <p>
    son?  I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is
   </p>
   <p>
    impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words
   </p>
   <p>
    which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.
   </p>
   <p>
    “William is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed
   </p>
   <p>
    my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay!  Victor, he is murdered!
   </p>
   <p>
    “I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the
   </p>
   <p>
    circumstances of the transaction.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to
   </p>
   <p>
    walk in Plainpalais.  The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged
   </p>
   <p>
    our walk farther than usual.  It was already dusk before we thought of
   </p>
   <p>
    returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone
   </p>
   <p>
    on before, were not to be found.  We accordingly rested on a seat until
   </p>
   <p>
    they should return.  Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen
   </p>
   <p>
    his brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William
   </p>
   <p>
    had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and
   </p>
   <p>
    afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.
   </p>
   <p>
    “This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him
   </p>
   <p>
    until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have
   </p>
   <p>
    returned to the house.  He was not there.  We returned again, with
   </p>
   <p>
    torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had
   </p>
   <p>
    lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night;
   </p>
   <p>
    Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish.  About five in the morning I
   </p>
   <p>
    discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and
   </p>
   <p>
    active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the
   </p>
   <p>
    print of the murder’s finger was on his neck.
   </p>
   <p>
    “He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my
   </p>
   <p>
    countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth.  She was very earnest to
   </p>
   <p>
    see the corpse.  At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted,
   </p>
   <p>
    and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the
   </p>
   <p>
    victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, ‘O God!  I have murdered my
   </p>
   <p>
    darling child!’
   </p>
   <p>
    “She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty.  When she again
   </p>
   <p>
    lived, it was only to weep and sigh.  She told me, that that same
   </p>
   <p>
    evening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable
   </p>
   <p>
    miniature that she possessed of your mother.  This picture is gone, and
   </p>
   <p>
    was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed.  We
   </p>
   <p>
    have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him
   </p>
   <p>
    are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!
   </p>
   <p>
    “Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth.  She weeps
   </p>
   <p>
    continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death;
   </p>
   <p>
    her words pierce my heart.  We are all unhappy; but will not that be an
   </p>
   <p>
    additional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?
   </p>
   <p>
    Your dear mother!  Alas, Victor!  I now say, Thank God she did not live
   </p>
   <p>
    to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!
   </p>
   <p>
    “Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin,
   </p>
   <p>
    but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of
   </p>
   <p>
    festering, the wounds of our minds.  Enter the house of mourning, my
   </p>
   <p>
    friend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not
   </p>
   <p>
    with hatred for your enemies.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Your affectionate and afflicted father,
   </p>
   <p>
    “Alphonse Frankenstein.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Geneva, May 12th, 17—.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was
   </p>
   <p>
    surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at first
   </p>
   <p>
    expressed on receiving new from my friends.  I threw the letter on the
   </p>
   <p>
    table, and covered my face with my hands.
   </p>
   <p>
    “My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me
   </p>
   <p>
    weep with bitterness, “are you always to be unhappy?  My dear friend,
   </p>
   <p>
    what has happened?”
   </p>
   <p>
    I motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the
   </p>
   <p>
    room in the extremest agitation.  Tears also gushed from the eyes of
   </p>
   <p>
    Clerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said he;
   </p>
   <p>
    “your disaster is irreparable.  What do you intend to do?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.”
   </p>
   <p>
    During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation;
   </p>
   <p>
    he could only express his heartfelt sympathy.  “Poor William!” said he,
   </p>
   <p>
    “dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother!  Who that had
   </p>
   <p>
    seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his
   </p>
   <p>
    untimely loss!  To die so miserably; to feel the murderer’s grasp!  How
   </p>
   <p>
    much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence!  Poor little
   </p>
   <p>
    fellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but
   </p>
   <p>
    he is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.
   </p>
   <p>
    A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain.  He can no longer
   </p>
   <p>
    be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable
   </p>
   <p>
    survivors.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words
   </p>
   <p>
    impressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in
   </p>
   <p>
    solitude.  But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a
   </p>
   <p>
    cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.
   </p>
   <p>
    My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed
   </p>
   <p>
    to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I
   </p>
   <p>
    drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustain
   </p>
   <p>
    the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through
   </p>
   <p>
    scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years.
   </p>
   <p>
    How altered every thing might be during that time! One sudden and
   </p>
   <p>
    desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances
   </p>
   <p>
    might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were
   </p>
   <p>
    done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I
   </p>
   <p>
    dared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble,
   </p>
   <p>
    although I was unable to define them.
   </p>
   <p>
    I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I
   </p>
   <p>
    contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the
   </p>
   <p>
    snowy mountains, “the palaces of nature,” were not changed. By
   </p>
   <p>
    degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey
   </p>
   <p>
    towards Geneva.
   </p>
   <p>
    The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I
   </p>
   <p>
    approached my native town.  I discovered more distinctly the black
   </p>
   <p>
    sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc.  I wept like a
   </p>
   <p>
    child.  “Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your
   </p>
   <p>
    wanderer?  Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and
   </p>
   <p>
    placid.  Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?”
   </p>
   <p>
    I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on
   </p>
   <p>
    these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative
   </p>
   <p>
    happiness, and I think of them with pleasure.  My country, my beloved
   </p>
   <p>
    country! who but a native can tell the delight I took in again
   </p>
   <p>
    beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely
   </p>
   <p>
    lake!
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also
   </p>
   <p>
    closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still
   </p>
   <p>
    more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human
   </p>
   <p>
    beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single
   </p>
   <p>
    circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not
   </p>
   <p>
    conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates
   </p>
   <p>
    of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at
   </p>
   <p>
    Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. The sky
   </p>
   <p>
    was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot
   </p>
   <p>
    where my poor William had been murdered. As I could not pass through the
   </p>
   <p>
    town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.
   </p>
   <p>
    During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont
   </p>
   <p>
    Blanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach
   </p>
   <p>
    rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its
   </p>
   <p>
    progress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain
   </p>
   <p>
    coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.
   </p>
   <p>
    I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm
   </p>
   <p>
    increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash
   </p>
   <p>
    over my head.  It was echoed from Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps of
   </p>
   <p>
    Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the
   </p>
   <p>
    lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant
   </p>
   <p>
    every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself
   </p>
   <p>
    from the preceding flash.  The storm, as is often the case in
   </p>
   <p>
    Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The
   </p>
   <p>
    most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the
   </p>
   <p>
    lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of
   </p>
   <p>
    Copêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another
   </p>
   <p>
    darkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain to the
   </p>
   <p>
    east of the lake.
   </p>
   <p>
    While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with
   </p>
   <p>
    a hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my
   </p>
   <p>
    hands, and exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel! this is thy
   </p>
   <p>
    funeral, this thy dirge!” As I said these words, I perceived in the
   </p>
   <p>
    gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood
   </p>
   <p>
    fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning
   </p>
   <p>
    illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its
   </p>
   <p>
    gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs
   </p>
   <p>
    to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy
   </p>
   <p>
    dæmon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I
   </p>
   <p>
    shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that
   </p>
   <p>
    idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth
   </p>
   <p>
    chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure
   </p>
   <p>
    passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could
   </p>
   <p>
    have destroyed the fair child. _He_ was the murderer! I could not
   </p>
   <p>
    doubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the
   </p>
   <p>
    fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for
   </p>
   <p>
    another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly
   </p>
   <p>
    perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the
   </p>
   <p>
    south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.
   </p>
   <p>
    I remained motionless.  The thunder ceased; but the rain still
   </p>
   <p>
    continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget:
   </p>
   <p>
    the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of
   </p>
   <p>
    the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure.  Two years had
   </p>
   <p>
    now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and
   </p>
   <p>
    was this his first crime?  Alas!  I had turned loose into the world a
   </p>
   <p>
    depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not
   </p>
   <p>
    murdered my brother?
   </p>
   <p>
    No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the
   </p>
   <p>
    night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air.  But I did not
   </p>
   <p>
    feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in
   </p>
   <p>
    scenes of evil and despair.  I considered the being whom I had cast
   </p>
   <p>
    among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes
   </p>
   <p>
    of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light
   </p>
   <p>
    of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced
   </p>
   <p>
    to destroy all that was dear to me.
   </p>
   <p>
    Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town.  The gates were
   </p>
   <p>
    open, and I hastened to my father’s house.  My first thought was to
   </p>
   <p>
    discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be
   </p>
   <p>
    made.  But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A
   </p>
   <p>
    being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at
   </p>
   <p>
    midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at
   </p>
   <p>
    the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of
   </p>
   <p>
    delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable.  I well knew that
   </p>
   <p>
    if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have
   </p>
   <p>
    looked upon it as the ravings of insanity.  Besides, the strange nature
   </p>
   <p>
    of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited
   </p>
   <p>
    as to persuade my relatives to commence it.  And then of what use would
   </p>
   <p>
    be pursuit?  Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the
   </p>
   <p>
    overhanging sides of Mont Salêve?  These reflections determined me, and
   </p>
   <p>
    I resolved to remain silent.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library
   </p>
   <p>
    to attend their usual hour of rising.
   </p>
   <p>
    Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my
   </p>
   <p>
    departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained
   </p>
   <p>
    to me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the
   </p>
   <p>
    mantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my father’s
   </p>
   <p>
    desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling
   </p>
   <p>
    by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale;
   </p>
   <p>
    but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the
   </p>
   <p>
    sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my
   </p>
   <p>
    tears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest
   </p>
   <p>
    entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:
   </p>
   <p>
    “Welcome, my dearest Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish you
   </p>
   <p>
    had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and
   </p>
   <p>
    delighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can
   </p>
   <p>
    alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems
   </p>
   <p>
    sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor
   </p>
   <p>
    Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—Poor
   </p>
   <p>
    William! he was our darling and our pride!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother’s eyes; a sense of mortal
   </p>
   <p>
    agony crept over my frame.  Before, I had only imagined the
   </p>
   <p>
    wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and
   </p>
   <p>
    a not less terrible, disaster.  I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more
   </p>
   <p>
    minutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.
   </p>
   <p>
    “She most of all,” said Ernest, “requires consolation; she accused
   </p>
   <p>
    herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her
   </p>
   <p>
    very wretched.  But since the murderer has been discovered—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “The murderer discovered!  Good God! how can that be? who could attempt
   </p>
   <p>
    to pursue him?  It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the
   </p>
   <p>
    winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw.  I saw him too; he
   </p>
   <p>
    was free last night!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I do not know what you mean,” replied my brother, in accents of
   </p>
   <p>
    wonder, “but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery.  No
   </p>
   <p>
    one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be
   </p>
   <p>
    convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence.  Indeed, who would credit
   </p>
   <p>
    that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family,
   </p>
   <p>
    could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Justine Moritz!  Poor, poor girl, is she the accused?  But it is
   </p>
   <p>
    wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have
   </p>
   <p>
    almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so
   </p>
   <p>
    confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear,
   </p>
   <p>
    leaves no hope for doubt.  But she will be tried today, and you will
   </p>
   <p>
    then hear all.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William
   </p>
   <p>
    had been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her
   </p>
   <p>
    bed for several days.  During this interval, one of the servants,
   </p>
   <p>
    happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the
   </p>
   <p>
    murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which
   </p>
   <p>
    had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer.  The servant
   </p>
   <p>
    instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to
   </p>
   <p>
    any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition,
   </p>
   <p>
    Justine was apprehended.  On being charged with the fact, the poor girl
   </p>
   <p>
    confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of
   </p>
   <p>
    manner.
   </p>
   <p>
    This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied
   </p>
   <p>
    earnestly, “You are all mistaken; I know the murderer.  Justine, poor,
   </p>
   <p>
    good Justine, is innocent.”
   </p>
   <p>
    At that instant my father entered.  I saw unhappiness deeply impressed
   </p>
   <p>
    on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and,
   </p>
   <p>
    after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced
   </p>
   <p>
    some other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed,
   </p>
   <p>
    “Good God, papa!  Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of
   </p>
   <p>
    poor William.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father, “for indeed I had
   </p>
   <p>
    rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much
   </p>
   <p>
    depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty.  She is to be
   </p>
   <p>
    tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.”
   </p>
   <p>
    This speech calmed me.  I was firmly convinced in my own mind that
   </p>
   <p>
    Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be
   </p>
   <p>
    brought forward strong enough to convict her.  My tale was not one to
   </p>
   <p>
    announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as
   </p>
   <p>
    madness by the vulgar.  Did any one indeed exist, except I, the
   </p>
   <p>
    creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the
   </p>
   <p>
    existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance
   </p>
   <p>
    which I had let loose upon the world?
   </p>
   <p>
    We were soon joined by Elizabeth.  Time had altered her since I last
   </p>
   <p>
    beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of
   </p>
   <p>
    her childish years.  There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but
   </p>
   <p>
    it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.
   </p>
   <p>
    She welcomed me with the greatest affection.  “Your arrival, my dear
   </p>
   <p>
    cousin,” said she, “fills me with hope.  You perhaps will find some
   </p>
   <p>
    means to justify my poor guiltless Justine.  Alas! who is safe, if she
   </p>
   <p>
    be convicted of crime?  I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do
   </p>
   <p>
    upon my own.  Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only
   </p>
   <p>
    lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely
   </p>
   <p>
    love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate.  If she is condemned, I
   </p>
   <p>
    never shall know joy more.  But she will not, I am sure she will not;
   </p>
   <p>
    and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little
   </p>
   <p>
    William.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “She is innocent, my Elizabeth,” said I, “and that shall
   </p>
   <p>
    be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance
   </p>
   <p>
    of her acquittal.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “How kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt,
   </p>
   <p>
    and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible:  and to
   </p>
   <p>
    see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me
   </p>
   <p>
    hopeless and despairing.”  She wept.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Dearest niece,” said my father, “dry your tears. If she
   </p>
   <p>
    is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of
   </p>
   <p>
    partiality.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 8
   </p>
   <p>
    We passed a few sad hours until eleven o’clock, when the trial was to
   </p>
   <p>
    commence.  My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend
   </p>
   <p>
    as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court.  During the whole of
   </p>
   <p>
    this wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture.  It was to
   </p>
   <p>
    be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would
   </p>
   <p>
    cause the death of two of my fellow beings:  one a smiling babe full of
   </p>
   <p>
    innocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every
   </p>
   <p>
    aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.
   </p>
   <p>
    Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised
   </p>
   <p>
    to render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an
   </p>
   <p>
    ignominious grave, and I the cause!  A thousand times rather would I
   </p>
   <p>
    have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I
   </p>
   <p>
    was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have
   </p>
   <p>
    been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have
   </p>
   <p>
    exculpated her who suffered through me.
   </p>
   <p>
    The appearance of Justine was calm.  She was dressed in mourning, and
   </p>
   <p>
    her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her
   </p>
   <p>
    feelings, exquisitely beautiful.  Yet she appeared confident in
   </p>
   <p>
    innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by
   </p>
   <p>
    thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have
   </p>
   <p>
    excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the
   </p>
   <p>
    imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed.  She
   </p>
   <p>
    was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as
   </p>
   <p>
    her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she
   </p>
   <p>
    worked up her mind to an appearance of courage.  When she entered the
   </p>
   <p>
    court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were
   </p>
   <p>
    seated.  A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly
   </p>
   <p>
    recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest
   </p>
   <p>
    her utter guiltlessness.
   </p>
   <p>
    The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the
   </p>
   <p>
    charge, several witnesses were called.  Several strange facts combined
   </p>
   <p>
    against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof
   </p>
   <p>
    of her innocence as I had.  She had been out the whole of the night on
   </p>
   <p>
    which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been
   </p>
   <p>
    perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the
   </p>
   <p>
    murdered child had been afterwards found.  The woman asked her what she
   </p>
   <p>
    did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused
   </p>
   <p>
    and unintelligible answer.  She returned to the house about eight
   </p>
   <p>
    o’clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she
   </p>
   <p>
    replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly
   </p>
   <p>
    if anything had been heard concerning him.  When shown the body, she
   </p>
   <p>
    fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days.  The
   </p>
   <p>
    picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;
   </p>
   <p>
    and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same
   </p>
   <p>
    which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round
   </p>
   <p>
    his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.
   </p>
   <p>
    Justine was called on for her defence.  As the trial had proceeded, her
   </p>
   <p>
    countenance had altered.  Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly
   </p>
   <p>
    expressed.  Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was
   </p>
   <p>
    desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible
   </p>
   <p>
    although variable voice.
   </p>
   <p>
    “God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am innocent. But I
   </p>
   <p>
    do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence
   </p>
   <p>
    on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced
   </p>
   <p>
    against me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my
   </p>
   <p>
    judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears
   </p>
   <p>
    doubtful or suspicious.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed
   </p>
   <p>
    the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the
   </p>
   <p>
    house of an aunt at Chêne, a village situated at about a league from
   </p>
   <p>
    Geneva.  On her return, at about nine o’clock, she met a man who asked
   </p>
   <p>
    her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost.  She was
   </p>
   <p>
    alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him,
   </p>
   <p>
    when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain
   </p>
   <p>
    several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being
   </p>
   <p>
    unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known.  Most
   </p>
   <p>
    of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that
   </p>
   <p>
    she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour
   </p>
   <p>
    to find my brother.  If she had gone near the spot where his body lay,
   </p>
   <p>
    it was without her knowledge.  That she had been bewildered when
   </p>
   <p>
    questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed
   </p>
   <p>
    a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.
   </p>
   <p>
    Concerning the picture she could give no account.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily and
   </p>
   <p>
    fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of
   </p>
   <p>
    explaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left
   </p>
   <p>
    to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been
   </p>
   <p>
    placed in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have no
   </p>
   <p>
    enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me
   </p>
   <p>
    wantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity
   </p>
   <p>
    afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the
   </p>
   <p>
    jewel, to part with it again so soon?
   </p>
   <p>
    “I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for
   </p>
   <p>
    hope.  I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my
   </p>
   <p>
    character, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed
   </p>
   <p>
    guilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my
   </p>
   <p>
    innocence.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and
   </p>
   <p>
    they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they
   </p>
   <p>
    supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come
   </p>
   <p>
    forward.  Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent
   </p>
   <p>
    dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,
   </p>
   <p>
    when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address
   </p>
   <p>
    the court.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy child who
   </p>
   <p>
    was murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived
   </p>
   <p>
    with his parents ever since and even long before his birth. It may
   </p>
   <p>
    therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but
   </p>
   <p>
    when I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her
   </p>
   <p>
    pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I
   </p>
   <p>
    know of her character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived
   </p>
   <p>
    in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly
   </p>
   <p>
    two years. During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and
   </p>
   <p>
    benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in
   </p>
   <p>
    her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards
   </p>
   <p>
    attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited
   </p>
   <p>
    the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my
   </p>
   <p>
    uncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was
   </p>
   <p>
    warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a
   </p>
   <p>
    most affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that,
   </p>
   <p>
    notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely
   </p>
   <p>
    on her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for such an action; as to
   </p>
   <p>
    the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it,
   </p>
   <p>
    I should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value
   </p>
   <p>
    her.”
   </p>
   <p>
    A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth’s simple and powerful
   </p>
   <p>
    appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in
   </p>
   <p>
    favour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with
   </p>
   <p>
    renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude.  She
   </p>
   <p>
    herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer.  My own
   </p>
   <p>
    agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial.  I believed
   </p>
   <p>
    in her innocence; I knew it.  Could the dæmon who had (I did not for a
   </p>
   <p>
    minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have
   </p>
   <p>
    betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy?  I could not sustain the
   </p>
   <p>
    horror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and
   </p>
   <p>
    the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim,
   </p>
   <p>
    I rushed out of the court in agony.  The tortures of the accused did
   </p>
   <p>
    not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of
   </p>
   <p>
    remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.
   </p>
   <p>
    I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness.  In the morning I went to
   </p>
   <p>
    the court; my lips and throat were parched.  I dared not ask the fatal
   </p>
   <p>
    question, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my
   </p>
   <p>
    visit.  The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine
   </p>
   <p>
    was condemned.
   </p>
   <p>
    I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt.  I had before
   </p>
   <p>
    experienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon
   </p>
   <p>
    them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the
   </p>
   <p>
    heart-sickening despair that I then endured.  The person to whom I
   </p>
   <p>
    addressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt.
   </p>
   <p>
    “That evidence,” he observed, “was hardly required in so glaring a
   </p>
   <p>
    case, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to
   </p>
   <p>
    condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so
   </p>
   <p>
    decisive.”
   </p>
   <p>
    This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean?  Had
   </p>
   <p>
    my eyes deceived me?  And was I really as mad as the whole world would
   </p>
   <p>
    believe me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions?  I
   </p>
   <p>
    hastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.
   </p>
   <p>
    “My cousin,” replied I, “it is decided as you may have expected; all
   </p>
   <p>
    judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty
   </p>
   <p>
    should escape.  But she has confessed.”
   </p>
   <p>
    This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon
   </p>
   <p>
    Justine’s innocence. “Alas!” said she. “How shall I
   </p>
   <p>
    ever again believe in human goodness? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as
   </p>
   <p>
    my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?
   </p>
   <p>
    Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has
   </p>
   <p>
    committed a murder.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my
   </p>
   <p>
    cousin. My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own
   </p>
   <p>
    judgment and feelings to decide. “Yes,” said Elizabeth,
   </p>
   <p>
    “I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany
   </p>
   <p>
    me; I cannot go alone.” The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet
   </p>
   <p>
    I could not refuse.
   </p>
   <p>
    We entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some
   </p>
   <p>
    straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on
   </p>
   <p>
    her knees. She rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with
   </p>
   <p>
    her, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My
   </p>
   <p>
    cousin wept also.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh, Justine!” said she.  “Why did you rob me of my last consolation?
   </p>
   <p>
    I relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I
   </p>
   <p>
    was not so miserable as I am now.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked?  Do you also
   </p>
   <p>
    join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?” Her
   </p>
   <p>
    voice was suffocated with sobs.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Rise, my poor girl,” said Elizabeth; “why do you kneel,
   </p>
   <p>
    if you are innocent? I am not one of your enemies, I believed you
   </p>
   <p>
    guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had
   </p>
   <p>
    yourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be
   </p>
   <p>
    assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a
   </p>
   <p>
    moment, but your own confession.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I did confess, but I confessed a lie.  I confessed, that I might
   </p>
   <p>
    obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than
   </p>
   <p>
    all my other sins.  The God of heaven forgive me!  Ever since I was
   </p>
   <p>
    condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced,
   </p>
   <p>
    until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I
   </p>
   <p>
    was.  He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if
   </p>
   <p>
    I continued obdurate.  Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked
   </p>
   <p>
    on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition.  What could I do?
   </p>
   <p>
    In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly
   </p>
   <p>
    miserable.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She paused, weeping, and then continued, “I thought with horror, my
   </p>
   <p>
    sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed
   </p>
   <p>
    aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable
   </p>
   <p>
    of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.
   </p>
   <p>
    Dear William! dearest blessed child!  I soon shall see you again in
   </p>
   <p>
    heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I
   </p>
   <p>
    am to suffer ignominy and death.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh, Justine!  Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.
   </p>
   <p>
    Why did you confess?  But do not mourn, dear girl.  Do not fear.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    will proclaim, I will prove your innocence.  I will melt the stony
   </p>
   <p>
    hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers.  You shall not die!
   </p>
   <p>
    You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold!
   </p>
   <p>
    No!  No!  I never could survive so horrible a misfortune.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Justine shook her head mournfully.  “I do not fear to die,” she said;
   </p>
   <p>
    “that pang is past.  God raises my weakness and gives me courage to
   </p>
   <p>
    endure the worst.  I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember
   </p>
   <p>
    me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the
   </p>
   <p>
    fate awaiting me.  Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to
   </p>
   <p>
    the will of heaven!”
   </p>
   <p>
    During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room,
   </p>
   <p>
    where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me.  Despair!
   </p>
   <p>
    Who dared talk of that?  The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass
   </p>
   <p>
    the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such
   </p>
   <p>
    deep and bitter agony.  I gnashed my teeth and ground them together,
   </p>
   <p>
    uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul.  Justine started.  When
   </p>
   <p>
    she saw who it was, she approached me and said, “Dear sir, you are very
   </p>
   <p>
    kind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?”
   </p>
   <p>
    I could not answer.  “No, Justine,” said Elizabeth; “he is more
   </p>
   <p>
    convinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you
   </p>
   <p>
    had confessed, he did not credit it.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I truly thank him.  In these last moments I feel the sincerest
   </p>
   <p>
    gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness.  How sweet is
   </p>
   <p>
    the affection of others to such a wretch as I am!  It removes more than
   </p>
   <p>
    half my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my
   </p>
   <p>
    innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself.  She indeed
   </p>
   <p>
    gained the resignation she desired.  But I, the true murderer, felt the
   </p>
   <p>
    never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or
   </p>
   <p>
    consolation.  Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was
   </p>
   <p>
    the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair
   </p>
   <p>
    moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness.  Anguish and
   </p>
   <p>
    despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within
   </p>
   <p>
    me which nothing could extinguish.  We stayed several hours with
   </p>
   <p>
    Justine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear
   </p>
   <p>
    herself away.  “I wish,” cried she, “that I were to die with you; I
   </p>
   <p>
    cannot live in this world of misery.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty
   </p>
   <p>
    repressed her bitter tears.  She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice
   </p>
   <p>
    of half-suppressed emotion, “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth,
   </p>
   <p>
    my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and
   </p>
   <p>
    preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever
   </p>
   <p>
    suffer!  Live, and be happy, and make others so.”
   </p>
   <p>
    And on the morrow Justine died.  Elizabeth’s heart-rending eloquence
   </p>
   <p>
    failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the
   </p>
   <p>
    criminality of the saintly sufferer.  My passionate and indignant
   </p>
   <p>
    appeals were lost upon them.  And when I received their cold answers
   </p>
   <p>
    and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed
   </p>
   <p>
    avowal died away on my lips.  Thus I might proclaim myself a madman,
   </p>
   <p>
    but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim.  She
   </p>
   <p>
    perished on the scaffold as a murderess!
   </p>
   <p>
    From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and
   </p>
   <p>
    voiceless grief of my Elizabeth.  This also was my doing!  And my
   </p>
   <p>
    father’s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was
   </p>
   <p>
    the work of my thrice-accursed hands!  Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these
   </p>
   <p>
    are not your last tears!  Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!
   </p>
   <p>
    Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he
   </p>
   <p>
    who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no
   </p>
   <p>
    thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear
   </p>
   <p>
    countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life
   </p>
   <p>
    in serving you—he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond
   </p>
   <p>
    his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction
   </p>
   <p>
    pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair,
   </p>
   <p>
    I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and
   </p>
   <p>
    Justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 9
   </p>
   <p>
    Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have
   </p>
   <p>
    been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of
   </p>
   <p>
    inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope
   </p>
   <p>
    and fear.  Justine died, she rested, and I was alive.  The blood flowed
   </p>
   <p>
    freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my
   </p>
   <p>
    heart which nothing could remove.  Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered
   </p>
   <p>
    like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond
   </p>
   <p>
    description horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet
   </p>
   <p>
    behind.  Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.
   </p>
   <p>
    I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment
   </p>
   <p>
    when I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow
   </p>
   <p>
    beings.  Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience
   </p>
   <p>
    which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and
   </p>
   <p>
    from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and
   </p>
   <p>
    the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures
   </p>
   <p>
    such as no language can describe.
   </p>
   <p>
    This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never
   </p>
   <p>
    entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained.  I shunned
   </p>
   <p>
    the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me;
   </p>
   <p>
    solitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, deathlike solitude.
   </p>
   <p>
    My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition
   </p>
   <p>
    and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his
   </p>
   <p>
    serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and
   </p>
   <p>
    awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Do you think, Victor,” said he, “that I do not suffer
   </p>
   <p>
    also? No one could love a child more than I loved your
   </p>
   <p>
    brother”—tears came into his eyes as he spoke—“but
   </p>
   <p>
    is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting
   </p>
   <p>
    their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty
   </p>
   <p>
    owed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment,
   </p>
   <p>
    or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for
   </p>
   <p>
    society.”
   </p>
   <p>
    This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I
   </p>
   <p>
    should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if
   </p>
   <p>
    remorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my
   </p>
   <p>
    other sensations.  Now I could only answer my father with a look of
   </p>
   <p>
    despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.
   </p>
   <p>
    About this time we retired to our house at Belrive.  This change was
   </p>
   <p>
    particularly agreeable to me.  The shutting of the gates regularly at
   </p>
   <p>
    ten o’clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that
   </p>
   <p>
    hour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome
   </p>
   <p>
    to me.  I was now free.  Often, after the rest of the family had
   </p>
   <p>
    retired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the
   </p>
   <p>
    water.  Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to
   </p>
   <p>
    pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only
   </p>
   <p>
    unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and
   </p>
   <p>
    heavenly—if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and
   </p>
   <p>
    interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore—often,
   </p>
   <p>
    I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters
   </p>
   <p>
    might close over me and my calamities for ever.  But I was restrained,
   </p>
   <p>
    when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly
   </p>
   <p>
    loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine.  I thought also of my
   </p>
   <p>
    father and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave them
   </p>
   <p>
    exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose
   </p>
   <p>
    among them?
   </p>
   <p>
    At these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my
   </p>
   <p>
    mind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness. But that
   </p>
   <p>
    could not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of
   </p>
   <p>
    unalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had
   </p>
   <p>
    created should perpetrate some new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling
   </p>
   <p>
    that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime,
   </p>
   <p>
    which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.
   </p>
   <p>
    There was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained
   </p>
   <p>
    behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of
   </p>
   <p>
    him I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to
   </p>
   <p>
    extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I
   </p>
   <p>
    reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds
   </p>
   <p>
    of moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the
   </p>
   <p>
    Andes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base. I wished
   </p>
   <p>
    to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his
   </p>
   <p>
    head and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.
   </p>
   <p>
    Our house was the house of mourning. My father’s health was deeply
   </p>
   <p>
    shaken by the horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and
   </p>
   <p>
    desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she
   </p>
   <p>
    then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted
   </p>
   <p>
    and destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth
   </p>
   <p>
    wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our
   </p>
   <p>
    future prospects. The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from
   </p>
   <p>
    the earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest
   </p>
   <p>
    smiles.
   </p>
   <p>
    “When I reflect, my dear cousin,” said she, “on the miserable death of
   </p>
   <p>
    Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before
   </p>
   <p>
    appeared to me.  Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and
   </p>
   <p>
    injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient
   </p>
   <p>
    days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to
   </p>
   <p>
    reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men
   </p>
   <p>
    appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other’s blood.  Yet I am
   </p>
   <p>
    certainly unjust.  Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and
   </p>
   <p>
    if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly
   </p>
   <p>
    she would have been the most depraved of human creatures.  For the sake
   </p>
   <p>
    of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend,
   </p>
   <p>
    a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if
   </p>
   <p>
    it had been her own!  I could not consent to the death of any human
   </p>
   <p>
    being, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to
   </p>
   <p>
    remain in the society of men.  But she was innocent.  I know, I feel
   </p>
   <p>
    she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me.
   </p>
   <p>
    Alas!  Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can
   </p>
   <p>
    assure themselves of certain happiness?  I feel as if I were walking on
   </p>
   <p>
    the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and
   </p>
   <p>
    endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss.  William and Justine were
   </p>
   <p>
    assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free,
   </p>
   <p>
    and perhaps respected.  But even if I were condemned to suffer on the
   </p>
   <p>
    scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a
   </p>
   <p>
    wretch.”
   </p>
   <p>
    I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony.  I, not in deed,
   </p>
   <p>
    but in effect, was the true murderer.  Elizabeth read my anguish in my
   </p>
   <p>
    countenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, “My dearest friend, you
   </p>
   <p>
    must calm yourself.  These events have affected me, God knows how
   </p>
   <p>
    deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are.  There is an expression of
   </p>
   <p>
    despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me
   </p>
   <p>
    tremble.  Dear Victor, banish these dark passions.  Remember the
   </p>
   <p>
    friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you.  Have we lost
   </p>
   <p>
    the power of rendering you happy?  Ah!  While we love, while we are
   </p>
   <p>
    true to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native
   </p>
   <p>
    country, we may reap every tranquil blessing—what can disturb our
   </p>
   <p>
    peace?”
   </p>
   <p>
    And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every
   </p>
   <p>
    other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my
   </p>
   <p>
    heart?  Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at
   </p>
   <p>
    that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of
   </p>
   <p>
    heaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were
   </p>
   <p>
    ineffectual.  I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial
   </p>
   <p>
    influence could penetrate.  The wounded deer dragging its fainting
   </p>
   <p>
    limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had
   </p>
   <p>
    pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily
   </p>
   <p>
    exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable
   </p>
   <p>
    sensations.  It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left
   </p>
   <p>
    my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought
   </p>
   <p>
    in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and
   </p>
   <p>
    my ephemeral, because human, sorrows.  My wanderings were directed
   </p>
   <p>
    towards the valley of Chamounix.  I had visited it frequently during my
   </p>
   <p>
    boyhood.  Six years had passed since then: _I_ was a wreck, but nought
   </p>
   <p>
    had changed in those savage and enduring scenes.
   </p>
   <p>
    I performed the first part of my journey on horseback.  I afterwards
   </p>
   <p>
    hired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive
   </p>
   <p>
    injury on these rugged roads.  The weather was fine; it was about the
   </p>
   <p>
    middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of
   </p>
   <p>
    Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe.  The
   </p>
   <p>
    weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in
   </p>
   <p>
    the ravine of Arve.  The immense mountains and precipices that overhung
   </p>
   <p>
    me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as
   </p>
   <p>
    Omnipotence—and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less
   </p>
   <p>
    almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here
   </p>
   <p>
    displayed in their most terrific guise.  Still, as I ascended higher,
   </p>
   <p>
    the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.
   </p>
   <p>
    Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the
   </p>
   <p>
    impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from
   </p>
   <p>
    among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty.  But it was
   </p>
   <p>
    augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and
   </p>
   <p>
    shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another
   </p>
   <p>
    earth, the habitations of another race of beings.
   </p>
   <p>
    I passed the bridge of Pélissier, where the ravine, which the river
   </p>
   <p>
    forms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that
   </p>
   <p>
    overhangs it.  Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix.  This
   </p>
   <p>
    valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and
   </p>
   <p>
    picturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed.  The
   </p>
   <p>
    high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no
   </p>
   <p>
    more ruined castles and fertile fields.  Immense glaciers approached
   </p>
   <p>
    the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and
   </p>
   <p>
    marked the smoke of its passage.  Mont Blanc, the supreme and
   </p>
   <p>
    magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_,
   </p>
   <p>
    and its tremendous _dôme_ overlooked the valley.
   </p>
   <p>
    A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this
   </p>
   <p>
    journey.  Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and
   </p>
   <p>
    recognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the
   </p>
   <p>
    lighthearted gaiety of boyhood.  The very winds whispered in soothing
   </p>
   <p>
    accents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more.  Then again the
   </p>
   <p>
    kindly influence ceased to act—I found myself fettered again to grief
   </p>
   <p>
    and indulging in all the misery of reflection.  Then I spurred on my
   </p>
   <p>
    animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all,
   </p>
   <p>
    myself—or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on
   </p>
   <p>
    the grass, weighed down by horror and despair.
   </p>
   <p>
    At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix.  Exhaustion succeeded
   </p>
   <p>
    to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured.
   </p>
   <p>
    For a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid
   </p>
   <p>
    lightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of
   </p>
   <p>
    the Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath.  The same lulling sounds
   </p>
   <p>
    acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head
   </p>
   <p>
    upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed
   </p>
   <p>
    the giver of oblivion.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 10
   </p>
   <p>
    I spent the following day roaming through the valley.  I stood beside
   </p>
   <p>
    the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that
   </p>
   <p>
    with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to
   </p>
   <p>
    barricade the valley.  The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before
   </p>
   <p>
    me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were
   </p>
   <p>
    scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious
   </p>
   <p>
    presence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling
   </p>
   <p>
    waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the
   </p>
   <p>
    avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the
   </p>
   <p>
    accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,
   </p>
   <p>
    was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in
   </p>
   <p>
    their hands.  These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the
   </p>
   <p>
    greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving.  They elevated me
   </p>
   <p>
    from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my
   </p>
   <p>
    grief, they subdued and tranquillised it.  In some degree, also, they
   </p>
   <p>
    diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the
   </p>
   <p>
    last month.  I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,
   </p>
   <p>
    waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I
   </p>
   <p>
    had contemplated during the day.  They congregated round me; the
   </p>
   <p>
    unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,
   </p>
   <p>
    and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds—they all
   </p>
   <p>
    gathered round me and bade me be at peace.
   </p>
   <p>
    Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke?  All of
   </p>
   <p>
    soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every
   </p>
   <p>
    thought.  The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the
   </p>
   <p>
    summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those
   </p>
   <p>
    mighty friends.  Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them
   </p>
   <p>
    in their cloudy retreats.  What were rain and storm to me?  My mule was
   </p>
   <p>
    brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of
   </p>
   <p>
    Montanvert.  I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous
   </p>
   <p>
    and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.
   </p>
   <p>
    It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the
   </p>
   <p>
    soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.
   </p>
   <p>
    The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the
   </p>
   <p>
    effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing
   </p>
   <p>
    cares of life.  I determined to go without a guide, for I was well
   </p>
   <p>
    acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the
   </p>
   <p>
    solitary grandeur of the scene.
   </p>
   <p>
    The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short
   </p>
   <p>
    windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the
   </p>
   <p>
    mountain.  It is a scene terrifically desolate.  In a thousand spots
   </p>
   <p>
    the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie
   </p>
   <p>
    broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent,
   </p>
   <p>
    leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon
   </p>
   <p>
    other trees.  The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines
   </p>
   <p>
    of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is
   </p>
   <p>
    particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking
   </p>
   <p>
    in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw
   </p>
   <p>
    destruction upon the head of the speaker.  The pines are not tall or
   </p>
   <p>
    luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.
   </p>
   <p>
    I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers
   </p>
   <p>
    which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite
   </p>
   <p>
    mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain
   </p>
   <p>
    poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I
   </p>
   <p>
    received from the objects around me.  Alas!  Why does man boast of
   </p>
   <p>
    sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders
   </p>
   <p>
    them more necessary beings.  If our impulses were confined to hunger,
   </p>
   <p>
    thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by
   </p>
   <p>
    every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may
   </p>
   <p>
    convey to us.
   </p>
   <p>
    We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.
   </p>
   <p>
    We rise; one wand’ring thought pollutes the day.
   </p>
   <p>
    We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,
   </p>
   <p>
    Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;
   </p>
   <p>
    It is the same:  for, be it joy or sorrow,
   </p>
   <p>
    The path of its departure still is free.
   </p>
   <p>
    Man’s yesterday may ne’er be like his morrow;
   </p>
   <p>
    Nought may endure but mutability!
   </p>
   <p>
    It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent.  For some
   </p>
   <p>
    time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice.  A mist covered
   </p>
   <p>
    both that and the surrounding mountains.  Presently a breeze dissipated
   </p>
   <p>
    the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier.  The surface is very
   </p>
   <p>
    uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and
   </p>
   <p>
    interspersed by rifts that sink deep.  The field of ice is almost a
   </p>
   <p>
    league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it.  The
   </p>
   <p>
    opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock.  From the side where I
   </p>
   <p>
    now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;
   </p>
   <p>
    and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty.  I remained in a recess
   </p>
   <p>
    of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene.  The sea,
   </p>
   <p>
    or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains,
   </p>
   <p>
    whose aerial summits hung over its recesses.  Their icy and glittering
   </p>
   <p>
    peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds.  My heart, which was
   </p>
   <p>
    before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed,
   </p>
   <p>
    “Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow
   </p>
   <p>
    beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion,
   </p>
   <p>
    away from the joys of life.”
   </p>
   <p>
    As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,
   </p>
   <p>
    advancing towards me with superhuman speed.  He bounded over the
   </p>
   <p>
    crevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his
   </p>
   <p>
    stature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man.  I was
   </p>
   <p>
    troubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me,
   </p>
   <p>
    but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!)
   </p>
   <p>
    that it was the wretch whom I had created.  I trembled with rage and
   </p>
   <p>
    horror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in
   </p>
   <p>
    mortal combat.  He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish,
   </p>
   <p>
    combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness
   </p>
   <p>
    rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes.  But I scarcely
   </p>
   <p>
    observed this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious
   </p>
   <p>
    detestation and contempt.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Devil,” I exclaimed, “do you dare approach me? And do
   </p>
   <p>
    not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?
   </p>
   <p>
    Begone, vile insect! Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust! And,
   </p>
   <p>
    oh! That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore
   </p>
   <p>
    those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I expected this reception,” said the dæmon.  “All men hate the
   </p>
   <p>
    wretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all
   </p>
   <p>
    living things!  Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature,
   </p>
   <p>
    to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of
   </p>
   <p>
    one of us.  You purpose to kill me.  How dare you sport thus with life?
   </p>
   <p>
    Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of
   </p>
   <p>
    mankind.  If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and
   </p>
   <p>
    you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it
   </p>
   <p>
    be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Abhorred monster!  Fiend that thou art!  The tortures of hell are too
   </p>
   <p>
    mild a vengeance for thy crimes.  Wretched devil!  You reproach me with
   </p>
   <p>
    your creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I
   </p>
   <p>
    so negligently bestowed.”
   </p>
   <p>
    My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the
   </p>
   <p>
    feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.
   </p>
   <p>
    He easily eluded me and said,
   </p>
   <p>
    “Be calm!  I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred
   </p>
   <p>
    on my devoted head.  Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to
   </p>
   <p>
    increase my misery?  Life, although it may only be an accumulation of
   </p>
   <p>
    anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it.  Remember, thou hast made
   </p>
   <p>
    me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my
   </p>
   <p>
    joints more supple.  But I will not be tempted to set myself in
   </p>
   <p>
    opposition to thee.  I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and
   </p>
   <p>
    docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part,
   </p>
   <p>
    the which thou owest me.  Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every
   </p>
   <p>
    other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy
   </p>
   <p>
    clemency and affection, is most due.  Remember that I am thy creature;
   </p>
   <p>
    I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou
   </p>
   <p>
    drivest from joy for no misdeed.  Everywhere I see bliss, from which I
   </p>
   <p>
    alone am irrevocably excluded.  I was benevolent and good; misery made
   </p>
   <p>
    me a fiend.  Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Begone!  I will not hear you.  There can be no community between you
   </p>
   <p>
    and me; we are enemies.  Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight,
   </p>
   <p>
    in which one must fall.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “How can I move thee?  Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a
   </p>
   <p>
    favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and
   </p>
   <p>
    compassion?  Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed
   </p>
   <p>
    with love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone?  You, my
   </p>
   <p>
    creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures,
   </p>
   <p>
    who owe me nothing?  They spurn and hate me.  The desert mountains and
   </p>
   <p>
    dreary glaciers are my refuge.  I have wandered here many days; the
   </p>
   <p>
    caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    only one which man does not grudge.  These bleak skies I hail, for they
   </p>
   <p>
    are kinder to me than your fellow beings.  If the multitude of mankind
   </p>
   <p>
    knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for
   </p>
   <p>
    my destruction.  Shall I not then hate them who abhor me?  I will keep
   </p>
   <p>
    no terms with my enemies.  I am miserable, and they shall share my
   </p>
   <p>
    wretchedness.  Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver
   </p>
   <p>
    them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that
   </p>
   <p>
    not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be
   </p>
   <p>
    swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage.  Let your compassion be
   </p>
   <p>
    moved, and do not disdain me.  Listen to my tale; when you have heard
   </p>
   <p>
    that, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve.
   </p>
   <p>
    But hear me.  The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they
   </p>
   <p>
    are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned.  Listen
   </p>
   <p>
    to me, Frankenstein.  You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with
   </p>
   <p>
    a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature.  Oh, praise the
   </p>
   <p>
    eternal justice of man!  Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me,
   </p>
   <p>
    and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why do you call to my remembrance,” I rejoined, “circumstances of
   </p>
   <p>
    which I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and
   </p>
   <p>
    author?  Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw
   </p>
   <p>
    light!  Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you!
   </p>
   <p>
    You have made me wretched beyond expression.  You have left me no power
   </p>
   <p>
    to consider whether I am just to you or not.  Begone!  Relieve me from
   </p>
   <p>
    the sight of your detested form.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Thus I relieve thee, my creator,” he said, and placed his hated hands
   </p>
   <p>
    before my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; “thus I take from
   </p>
   <p>
    thee a sight which you abhor.  Still thou canst listen to me and grant
   </p>
   <p>
    me thy compassion.  By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this
   </p>
   <p>
    from you.  Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of
   </p>
   <p>
    this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon
   </p>
   <p>
    the mountain.  The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends
   </p>
   <p>
    to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another
   </p>
   <p>
    world, you will have heard my story and can decide.  On you it rests,
   </p>
   <p>
    whether I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless
   </p>
   <p>
    life, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of
   </p>
   <p>
    your own speedy ruin.”
   </p>
   <p>
    As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed.  My heart
   </p>
   <p>
    was full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the
   </p>
   <p>
    various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to
   </p>
   <p>
    his tale.  I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my
   </p>
   <p>
    resolution.  I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my
   </p>
   <p>
    brother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.
   </p>
   <p>
    For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards
   </p>
   <p>
    his creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I
   </p>
   <p>
    complained of his wickedness.  These motives urged me to comply with
   </p>
   <p>
    his demand.  We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite
   </p>
   <p>
    rock.  The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we
   </p>
   <p>
    entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy
   </p>
   <p>
    heart and depressed spirits.  But I consented to listen, and seating
   </p>
   <p>
    myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began
   </p>
   <p>
    his tale.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 11
   </p>
   <p>
    “It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of
   </p>
   <p>
    my being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.
   </p>
   <p>
    A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard,
   </p>
   <p>
    and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I
   </p>
   <p>
    learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses.  By
   </p>
   <p>
    degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I
   </p>
   <p>
    was obliged to shut my eyes.  Darkness then came over me and troubled
   </p>
   <p>
    me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now
   </p>
   <p>
    suppose, the light poured in upon me again.  I walked and, I believe,
   </p>
   <p>
    descended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.
   </p>
   <p>
    Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my
   </p>
   <p>
    touch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with
   </p>
   <p>
    no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid.  The light
   </p>
   <p>
    became more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I
   </p>
   <p>
    walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade.  This was the
   </p>
   <p>
    forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting
   </p>
   <p>
    from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst.  This
   </p>
   <p>
    roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I
   </p>
   <p>
    found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground.  I slaked my thirst
   </p>
   <p>
    at the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it
   </p>
   <p>
    were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate.  Before I had quitted
   </p>
   <p>
    your apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some
   </p>
   <p>
    clothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of
   </p>
   <p>
    night.  I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could
   </p>
   <p>
    distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat
   </p>
   <p>
    down and wept.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasure.  I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the
   </p>
   <p>
    trees.  [The moon]  I gazed with a kind of wonder.  It moved slowly,
   </p>
   <p>
    but it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries.
   </p>
   <p>
    I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with
   </p>
   <p>
    which I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground.  No distinct
   </p>
   <p>
    ideas occupied my mind; all was confused.  I felt light, and hunger,
   </p>
   <p>
    and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on
   </p>
   <p>
    all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could
   </p>
   <p>
    distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasure.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had
   </p>
   <p>
    greatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each
   </p>
   <p>
    other.  I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with
   </p>
   <p>
    drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage.  I was delighted
   </p>
   <p>
    when I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my
   </p>
   <p>
    ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had
   </p>
   <p>
    often intercepted the light from my eyes.  I began also to observe,
   </p>
   <p>
    with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the
   </p>
   <p>
    boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me.  Sometimes I
   </p>
   <p>
    tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the
   </p>
   <p>
    uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into
   </p>
   <p>
    silence again.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened
   </p>
   <p>
    form, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest.  My
   </p>
   <p>
    sensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every
   </p>
   <p>
    day additional ideas.  My eyes became accustomed to the light and to
   </p>
   <p>
    perceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from
   </p>
   <p>
    the herb, and by degrees, one herb from another.  I found that the
   </p>
   <p>
    sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and
   </p>
   <p>
    thrush were sweet and enticing.
   </p>
   <p>
    “One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been
   </p>
   <p>
    left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the
   </p>
   <p>
    warmth I experienced from it.  In my joy I thrust my hand into the live
   </p>
   <p>
    embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain.  How strange,
   </p>
   <p>
    I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects!  I
   </p>
   <p>
    examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be
   </p>
   <p>
    composed of wood.  I quickly collected some branches, but they were wet
   </p>
   <p>
    and would not burn.  I was pained at this and sat still watching the
   </p>
   <p>
    operation of the fire.  The wet wood which I had placed near the heat
   </p>
   <p>
    dried and itself became inflamed.  I reflected on this, and by touching
   </p>
   <p>
    the various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in
   </p>
   <p>
    collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a
   </p>
   <p>
    plentiful supply of fire.  When night came on and brought sleep with
   </p>
   <p>
    it, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches
   </p>
   <p>
    upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank
   </p>
   <p>
    into sleep.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire.
   </p>
   <p>
    I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the
   </p>
   <p>
    embers when they were nearly extinguished.  When night came again I
   </p>
   <p>
    found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that
   </p>
   <p>
    the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found
   </p>
   <p>
    some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and
   </p>
   <p>
    tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on
   </p>
   <p>
    the live embers.  I found that the berries were spoiled by this
   </p>
   <p>
    operation, and the nuts and roots much improved.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day
   </p>
   <p>
    searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When
   </p>
   <p>
    I found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto
   </p>
   <p>
    inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be
   </p>
   <p>
    more easily satisfied.  In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the
   </p>
   <p>
    loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how
   </p>
   <p>
    to reproduce it.  I gave several hours to the serious consideration of
   </p>
   <p>
    this difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply
   </p>
   <p>
    it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood
   </p>
   <p>
    towards the setting sun.  I passed three days in these rambles and at
   </p>
   <p>
    length discovered the open country.  A great fall of snow had taken
   </p>
   <p>
    place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the
   </p>
   <p>
    appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold
   </p>
   <p>
    damp substance that covered the ground.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and
   </p>
   <p>
    shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which
   </p>
   <p>
    had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd.  This
   </p>
   <p>
    was a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great
   </p>
   <p>
    curiosity.  Finding the door open, I entered.  An old man sat in it,
   </p>
   <p>
    near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast.  He turned on
   </p>
   <p>
    hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the
   </p>
   <p>
    hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form
   </p>
   <p>
    hardly appeared capable.  His appearance, different from any I had ever
   </p>
   <p>
    before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me.  But I was enchanted
   </p>
   <p>
    by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not
   </p>
   <p>
    penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite
   </p>
   <p>
    and divine a retreat as Pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell
   </p>
   <p>
    after their sufferings in the lake of fire.  I greedily devoured the
   </p>
   <p>
    remnants of the shepherd’s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese,
   </p>
   <p>
    milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like.  Then, overcome by
   </p>
   <p>
    fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which
   </p>
   <p>
    shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my
   </p>
   <p>
    travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant’s breakfast in a
   </p>
   <p>
    wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until
   </p>
   <p>
    at sunset I arrived at a village.  How miraculous did this appear!  The
   </p>
   <p>
    huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by
   </p>
   <p>
    turns.  The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw
   </p>
   <p>
    placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One
   </p>
   <p>
    of the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within
   </p>
   <p>
    the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.
   </p>
   <p>
    The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,
   </p>
   <p>
    grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I
   </p>
   <p>
    escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,
   </p>
   <p>
    quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had
   </p>
   <p>
    beheld in the village.  This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat
   </p>
   <p>
    and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I
   </p>
   <p>
    dared not enter it.  My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so
   </p>
   <p>
    low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it.  No wood, however,
   </p>
   <p>
    was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and
   </p>
   <p>
    although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an
   </p>
   <p>
    agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter,
   </p>
   <p>
    however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more
   </p>
   <p>
    from the barbarity of man.  As soon as morning dawned I crept from my
   </p>
   <p>
    kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could
   </p>
   <p>
    remain in the habitation I had found.  It was situated against the back
   </p>
   <p>
    of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig
   </p>
   <p>
    sty and a clear pool of water.  One part was open, and by that I had
   </p>
   <p>
    crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived
   </p>
   <p>
    with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on
   </p>
   <p>
    occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and
   </p>
   <p>
    that was sufficient for me.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I
   </p>
   <p>
    retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered
   </p>
   <p>
    too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf
   </p>
   <p>
    of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink
   </p>
   <p>
    more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by
   </p>
   <p>
    my retreat.  The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept
   </p>
   <p>
    perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was
   </p>
   <p>
    tolerably warm.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until
   </p>
   <p>
    something should occur which might alter my determination.  It was
   </p>
   <p>
    indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence,
   </p>
   <p>
    the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth.  I ate my breakfast with
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little
   </p>
   <p>
    water when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld
   </p>
   <p>
    a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. The
   </p>
   <p>
    girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found
   </p>
   <p>
    cottagers and farmhouse servants to be.  Yet she was meanly dressed, a
   </p>
   <p>
    coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair
   </p>
   <p>
    hair was plaited but not adorned:  she looked patient yet sad.  I lost
   </p>
   <p>
    sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing
   </p>
   <p>
    the pail, which was now partly filled with milk.  As she walked along,
   </p>
   <p>
    seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose
   </p>
   <p>
    countenance expressed a deeper despondence.  Uttering a few sounds with
   </p>
   <p>
    an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the
   </p>
   <p>
    cottage himself.  She followed, and they disappeared.  Presently I saw
   </p>
   <p>
    the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field
   </p>
   <p>
    behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the
   </p>
   <p>
    house and sometimes in the yard.
   </p>
   <p>
    “On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the
   </p>
   <p>
    cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been
   </p>
   <p>
    filled up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost
   </p>
   <p>
    imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.
   </p>
   <p>
    Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean
   </p>
   <p>
    but very bare of furniture. In one corner, near a small fire, sat an
   </p>
   <p>
    old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. The
   </p>
   <p>
    young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she
   </p>
   <p>
    took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat
   </p>
   <p>
    down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play
   </p>
   <p>
    and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the
   </p>
   <p>
    nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had
   </p>
   <p>
    never beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent
   </p>
   <p>
    countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle
   </p>
   <p>
    manners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air
   </p>
   <p>
    which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of
   </p>
   <p>
    which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then
   </p>
   <p>
    pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt
   </p>
   <p>
    at his feet. He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection
   </p>
   <p>
    that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were
   </p>
   <p>
    a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced,
   </p>
   <p>
    either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the
   </p>
   <p>
    window, unable to bear these emotions.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a
   </p>
   <p>
    load of wood.  The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of
   </p>
   <p>
    his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on
   </p>
   <p>
    the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage,
   </p>
   <p>
    and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese.  She seemed
   </p>
   <p>
    pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she
   </p>
   <p>
    placed in water, and then upon the fire.  She afterwards continued her
   </p>
   <p>
    work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily
   </p>
   <p>
    employed in digging and pulling up roots.  After he had been employed
   </p>
   <p>
    thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the
   </p>
   <p>
    cottage together.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance
   </p>
   <p>
    of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to
   </p>
   <p>
    eat.  The meal was quickly dispatched.  The young woman was again
   </p>
   <p>
    occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the
   </p>
   <p>
    cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.
   </p>
   <p>
    Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent
   </p>
   <p>
    creatures.  One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming
   </p>
   <p>
    with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his
   </p>
   <p>
    figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency.  The
   </p>
   <p>
    old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different
   </p>
   <p>
    from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the
   </p>
   <p>
    fields.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the
   </p>
   <p>
    cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was
   </p>
   <p>
    delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours.  In the evening
   </p>
   <p>
    the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations
   </p>
   <p>
    which I did not understand; and the old man again took up the
   </p>
   <p>
    instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in
   </p>
   <p>
    the morning.  So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play,
   </p>
   <p>
    but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the
   </p>
   <p>
    harmony of the old man’s instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since
   </p>
   <p>
    found that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the
   </p>
   <p>
    science of words or letters.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time,
   </p>
   <p>
    extinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 12
   </p>
   <p>
    “I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep.  I thought of the
   </p>
   <p>
    occurrences of the day.  What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners
   </p>
   <p>
    of these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from
   </p>
   <p>
    the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I
   </p>
   <p>
    might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would
   </p>
   <p>
    remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the
   </p>
   <p>
    motives which influenced their actions.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun.  The young woman
   </p>
   <p>
    arranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed
   </p>
   <p>
    after the first meal.
   </p>
   <p>
    “This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.
   </p>
   <p>
    The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in
   </p>
   <p>
    various laborious occupations within.  The old man, whom I soon
   </p>
   <p>
    perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or
   </p>
   <p>
    in contemplation.  Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the
   </p>
   <p>
    younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion.  They
   </p>
   <p>
    performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with
   </p>
   <p>
    gentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.
   </p>
   <p>
    “They were not entirely happy.  The young man and his companion often
   </p>
   <p>
    went apart and appeared to weep.  I saw no cause for their unhappiness,
   </p>
   <p>
    but I was deeply affected by it.  If such lovely creatures were
   </p>
   <p>
    miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being,
   </p>
   <p>
    should be wretched.  Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy?  They
   </p>
   <p>
    possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every
   </p>
   <p>
    luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands
   </p>
   <p>
    when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more,
   </p>
   <p>
    they enjoyed one another’s company and speech, interchanging each day
   </p>
   <p>
    looks of affection and kindness.  What did their tears imply?  Did they
   </p>
   <p>
    really express pain?  I was at first unable to solve these questions,
   </p>
   <p>
    but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which
   </p>
   <p>
    were at first enigmatic.
   </p>
   <p>
    “A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of
   </p>
   <p>
    the uneasiness of this amiable family:  it was poverty, and they
   </p>
   <p>
    suffered that evil in a very distressing degree.  Their nourishment
   </p>
   <p>
    consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of
   </p>
   <p>
    one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters
   </p>
   <p>
    could scarcely procure food to support it.  They often, I believe,
   </p>
   <p>
    suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two
   </p>
   <p>
    younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old
   </p>
   <p>
    man when they reserved none for themselves.
   </p>
   <p>
    “This trait of kindness moved me sensibly.  I had been accustomed,
   </p>
   <p>
    during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own
   </p>
   <p>
    consumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on
   </p>
   <p>
    the cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and
   </p>
   <p>
    roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist
   </p>
   <p>
    their labours.  I found that the youth spent a great part of each day
   </p>
   <p>
    in collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often
   </p>
   <p>
    took his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home
   </p>
   <p>
    firing sufficient for the consumption of several days.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she
   </p>
   <p>
    opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great
   </p>
   <p>
    pile of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    youth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure,
   </p>
   <p>
    that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the
   </p>
   <p>
    cottage and cultivating the garden.
   </p>
   <p>
    “By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that
   </p>
   <p>
    these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and
   </p>
   <p>
    feelings to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words
   </p>
   <p>
    they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the
   </p>
   <p>
    minds and countenances of the hearers.  This was indeed a godlike science,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in
   </p>
   <p>
    every attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible
   </p>
   <p>
    objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the
   </p>
   <p>
    mystery of their reference.  By great application, however, and after having
   </p>
   <p>
    remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I
   </p>
   <p>
    discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of
   </p>
   <p>
    discourse; I learned and applied the words, _fire, milk, bread,_ and
   </p>
   <p>
    _wood._ I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth
   </p>
   <p>
    and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only
   </p>
   <p>
    one, which was _father._ The girl was called _sister_ or
   </p>
   <p>
    _Agatha,_ and the youth _Felix, brother,_ or _son_. I cannot
   </p>
   <p>
    describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of
   </p>
   <p>
    these sounds and was able to pronounce them.  I distinguished several other
   </p>
   <p>
    words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as _good,
   </p>
   <p>
    dearest, unhappy._
   </p>
   <p>
    “I spent the winter in this manner.  The gentle manners and beauty of
   </p>
   <p>
    the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I
   </p>
   <p>
    felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys.  I saw
   </p>
   <p>
    few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the
   </p>
   <p>
    cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the
   </p>
   <p>
    superior accomplishments of my friends.  The old man, I could perceive,
   </p>
   <p>
    often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that
   </p>
   <p>
    he called them, to cast off their melancholy.  He would talk in a
   </p>
   <p>
    cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure
   </p>
   <p>
    even upon me.  Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled
   </p>
   <p>
    with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I
   </p>
   <p>
    generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after
   </p>
   <p>
    having listened to the exhortations of her father.  It was not thus
   </p>
   <p>
    with Felix.  He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my
   </p>
   <p>
    unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his
   </p>
   <p>
    friends.  But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more
   </p>
   <p>
    cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old
   </p>
   <p>
    man.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked
   </p>
   <p>
    the dispositions of these amiable cottagers.  In the midst of poverty
   </p>
   <p>
    and want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little
   </p>
   <p>
    white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground.  Early in
   </p>
   <p>
    the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that
   </p>
   <p>
    obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and
   </p>
   <p>
    brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual
   </p>
   <p>
    astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible
   </p>
   <p>
    hand.  In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring
   </p>
   <p>
    farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner,
   </p>
   <p>
    yet brought no wood with him.  At other times he worked in the garden,
   </p>
   <p>
    but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old
   </p>
   <p>
    man and Agatha.
   </p>
   <p>
    “This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I
   </p>
   <p>
    discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when
   </p>
   <p>
    he talked.  I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs
   </p>
   <p>
    for speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend
   </p>
   <p>
    these also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand
   </p>
   <p>
    the sounds for which they stood as signs?  I improved, however,
   </p>
   <p>
    sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of
   </p>
   <p>
    conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I
   </p>
   <p>
    easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to
   </p>
   <p>
    the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become
   </p>
   <p>
    master of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them
   </p>
   <p>
    overlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast
   </p>
   <p>
    perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty,
   </p>
   <p>
    and delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself
   </p>
   <p>
    in a transparent pool!  At first I started back, unable to believe that
   </p>
   <p>
    it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became
   </p>
   <p>
    fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was
   </p>
   <p>
    filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.
   </p>
   <p>
    Alas!  I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable
   </p>
   <p>
    deformity.
   </p>
   <p>
    “As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow
   </p>
   <p>
    vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth.  From this
   </p>
   <p>
    time Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of
   </p>
   <p>
    impending famine disappeared.  Their food, as I afterwards found, was
   </p>
   <p>
    coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they
   </p>
   <p>
    dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season
   </p>
   <p>
    advanced.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did
   </p>
   <p>
    not rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its
   </p>
   <p>
    waters.  This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the
   </p>
   <p>
    earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.
   </p>
   <p>
    “My mode of life in my hovel was uniform.  During the morning I
   </p>
   <p>
    attended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in
   </p>
   <p>
    various occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in
   </p>
   <p>
    observing my friends.  When they had retired to rest, if there was any
   </p>
   <p>
    moon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected
   </p>
   <p>
    my own food and fuel for the cottage.  When I returned, as often as it
   </p>
   <p>
    was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those
   </p>
   <p>
    offices that I had seen done by Felix.  I afterwards found that these
   </p>
   <p>
    labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and
   </p>
   <p>
    once or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words _good
   </p>
   <p>
    spirit, wonderful_; but I did not then understand the signification
   </p>
   <p>
    of these terms.
   </p>
   <p>
    “My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the
   </p>
   <p>
    motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to
   </p>
   <p>
    know why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad.  I thought
   </p>
   <p>
    (foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to
   </p>
   <p>
    these deserving people.  When I slept or was absent, the forms of the
   </p>
   <p>
    venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix
   </p>
   <p>
    flitted before me.  I looked upon them as superior beings who would be
   </p>
   <p>
    the arbiters of my future destiny.  I formed in my imagination a
   </p>
   <p>
    thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of
   </p>
   <p>
    me.  I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle
   </p>
   <p>
    demeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and
   </p>
   <p>
    afterwards their love.
   </p>
   <p>
    “These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to
   </p>
   <p>
    the acquiring the art of language.  My organs were indeed harsh, but
   </p>
   <p>
    supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their
   </p>
   <p>
    tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose
   </p>
   <p>
    intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved
   </p>
   <p>
    better treatment than blows and execration.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the
   </p>
   <p>
    aspect of the earth.  Men who before this change seemed to have been
   </p>
   <p>
    hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of
   </p>
   <p>
    cultivation.  The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves
   </p>
   <p>
    began to bud forth on the trees.  Happy, happy earth!  Fit habitation
   </p>
   <p>
    for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and
   </p>
   <p>
    unwholesome.  My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of
   </p>
   <p>
    nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 13
   </p>
   <p>
    “I now hasten to the more moving part of my story.  I shall relate
   </p>
   <p>
    events that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been,
   </p>
   <p>
    have made me what I am.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies
   </p>
   <p>
    cloudless.  It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy
   </p>
   <p>
    should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure.  My
   </p>
   <p>
    senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and
   </p>
   <p>
    a thousand sights of beauty.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested
   </p>
   <p>
    from labour—the old man played on his guitar, and the children
   </p>
   <p>
    listened to him—that I observed the countenance of Felix was
   </p>
   <p>
    melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father
   </p>
   <p>
    paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired
   </p>
   <p>
    the cause of his son’s sorrow.  Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide.
   </p>
   <p>
    The lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black
   </p>
   <p>
    veil.  Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by
   </p>
   <p>
    pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix.  Her voice was
   </p>
   <p>
    musical but unlike that of either of my friends.  On hearing this word,
   </p>
   <p>
    Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her
   </p>
   <p>
    veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression.  Her
   </p>
   <p>
    hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were
   </p>
   <p>
    dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular
   </p>
   <p>
    proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with
   </p>
   <p>
    a lovely pink.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of
   </p>
   <p>
    sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of
   </p>
   <p>
    ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I
   </p>
   <p>
    thought him as beautiful as the stranger.  She appeared affected by
   </p>
   <p>
    different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held
   </p>
   <p>
    out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as
   </p>
   <p>
    well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian.  She did not appear to
   </p>
   <p>
    understand him, but smiled.  He assisted her to dismount, and
   </p>
   <p>
    dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage.  Some
   </p>
   <p>
    conversation took place between him and his father, and the young
   </p>
   <p>
    stranger knelt at the old man’s feet and would have kissed his hand,
   </p>
   <p>
    but he raised her and embraced her affectionately.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds
   </p>
   <p>
    and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood
   </p>
   <p>
    by nor herself understood the cottagers.  They made many signs which I
   </p>
   <p>
    did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness
   </p>
   <p>
    through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the
   </p>
   <p>
    morning mists.  Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of
   </p>
   <p>
    delight welcomed his Arabian.  Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed
   </p>
   <p>
    the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made
   </p>
   <p>
    signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she
   </p>
   <p>
    came.  Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances,
   </p>
   <p>
    expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend.  Presently I
   </p>
   <p>
    found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger
   </p>
   <p>
    repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language;
   </p>
   <p>
    and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the
   </p>
   <p>
    same instructions to the same end.  The stranger learned about twenty
   </p>
   <p>
    words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had
   </p>
   <p>
    before understood, but I profited by the others.
   </p>
   <p>
    “As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early.  When they
   </p>
   <p>
    separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, ‘Good night
   </p>
   <p>
    sweet Safie.’  He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and
   </p>
   <p>
    by the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely
   </p>
   <p>
    guest was the subject of their conversation.  I ardently desired to
   </p>
   <p>
    understand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found
   </p>
   <p>
    it utterly impossible.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual
   </p>
   <p>
    occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the
   </p>
   <p>
    old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly
   </p>
   <p>
    beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes.  She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or
   </p>
   <p>
    dying away like a nightingale of the woods.
   </p>
   <p>
    “When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first
   </p>
   <p>
    declined it.  She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in
   </p>
   <p>
    sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger.  The old
   </p>
   <p>
    man appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to
   </p>
   <p>
    explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she
   </p>
   <p>
    bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration
   </p>
   <p>
    that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.
   </p>
   <p>
    Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the
   </p>
   <p>
    knowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most
   </p>
   <p>
    of the words uttered by my protectors.
   </p>
   <p>
    “In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the
   </p>
   <p>
    scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods;
   </p>
   <p>
    the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal
   </p>
   <p>
    rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably
   </p>
   <p>
    shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never
   </p>
   <p>
    ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same
   </p>
   <p>
    treatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered.
   </p>
   <p>
    “My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily
   </p>
   <p>
    master the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than
   </p>
   <p>
    the Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken
   </p>
   <p>
    accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that
   </p>
   <p>
    was spoken.
   </p>
   <p>
    “While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as
   </p>
   <p>
    it was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field
   </p>
   <p>
    for wonder and delight.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney’s _Ruins
   </p>
   <p>
    of Empires_. I should not have understood the purport of this book had not
   </p>
   <p>
    Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this
   </p>
   <p>
    work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the
   </p>
   <p>
    Eastern authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history
   </p>
   <p>
    and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave
   </p>
   <p>
    me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different
   </p>
   <p>
    nations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous
   </p>
   <p>
    genius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue
   </p>
   <p>
    of the early Romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of the
   </p>
   <p>
    decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard
   </p>
   <p>
    of the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the
   </p>
   <p>
    hapless fate of its original inhabitants.
   </p>
   <p>
    “These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings.  Was
   </p>
   <p>
    man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so
   </p>
   <p>
    vicious and base?  He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil
   </p>
   <p>
    principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and
   </p>
   <p>
    godlike.  To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour
   </p>
   <p>
    that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on
   </p>
   <p>
    record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more
   </p>
   <p>
    abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm.  For a long time I
   </p>
   <p>
    could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or
   </p>
   <p>
    even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of
   </p>
   <p>
    vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and
   </p>
   <p>
    loathing.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.
   </p>
   <p>
    While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the
   </p>
   <p>
    Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid
   </p>
   <p>
    poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The words induced me to turn towards myself.  I learned that the
   </p>
   <p>
    possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and
   </p>
   <p>
    unsullied descent united with riches.  A man might be respected with
   </p>
   <p>
    only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered,
   </p>
   <p>
    except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to
   </p>
   <p>
    waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few!  And what was I? Of
   </p>
   <p>
    my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I
   </p>
   <p>
    possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property.  I was, besides,
   </p>
   <p>
    endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even
   </p>
   <p>
    of the same nature as man.  I was more agile than they and could
   </p>
   <p>
    subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with
   </p>
   <p>
    less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs.  When I looked
   </p>
   <p>
    around I saw and heard of none like me.  Was I, then, a monster, a blot
   </p>
   <p>
    upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?
   </p>
   <p>
    “I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted
   </p>
   <p>
    upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with
   </p>
   <p>
    knowledge.  Oh, that I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor
   </p>
   <p>
    known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!
   </p>
   <p>
    “Of what a strange nature is knowledge!  It clings to the mind when it
   </p>
   <p>
    has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock.  I wished sometimes to
   </p>
   <p>
    shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one
   </p>
   <p>
    means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death—a state
   </p>
   <p>
    which I feared yet did not understand.  I admired virtue and good
   </p>
   <p>
    feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my
   </p>
   <p>
    cottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except
   </p>
   <p>
    through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and
   </p>
   <p>
    unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of
   </p>
   <p>
    becoming one among my fellows.  The gentle words of Agatha and  the
   </p>
   <p>
    animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me.  The mild
   </p>
   <p>
    exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved
   </p>
   <p>
    Felix were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch!
   </p>
   <p>
    “Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply.  I heard of the
   </p>
   <p>
    difference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the
   </p>
   <p>
    father doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the
   </p>
   <p>
    older child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up
   </p>
   <p>
    in the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained
   </p>
   <p>
    knowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which
   </p>
   <p>
    bind one human being to another in mutual bonds.
   </p>
   <p>
    “But where were my friends and relations?  No father had watched my
   </p>
   <p>
    infant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if
   </p>
   <p>
    they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I
   </p>
   <p>
    distinguished nothing.  From my earliest remembrance I had been as I
   </p>
   <p>
    then was in height and proportion.  I had never yet seen a being
   </p>
   <p>
    resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me.  What was I?  The
   </p>
   <p>
    question again recurred, to be answered only with groans.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to
   </p>
   <p>
    return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various
   </p>
   <p>
    feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated
   </p>
   <p>
    in additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in
   </p>
   <p>
    an innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them).”
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 14
   </p>
   <p>
    “Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends.  It was
   </p>
   <p>
    one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding
   </p>
   <p>
    as it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to
   </p>
   <p>
    one so utterly inexperienced as I was.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The name of the old man was De Lacey.  He was descended from a good
   </p>
   <p>
    family in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence,
   </p>
   <p>
    respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals.  His son was bred
   </p>
   <p>
    in the service of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the
   </p>
   <p>
    highest distinction.  A few months before my arrival they had lived in
   </p>
   <p>
    a large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and
   </p>
   <p>
    possessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or
   </p>
   <p>
    taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin.  He was a
   </p>
   <p>
    Turkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some
   </p>
   <p>
    reason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government.
   </p>
   <p>
    He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from
   </p>
   <p>
    Constantinople to join him.  He was tried and condemned to death.  The
   </p>
   <p>
    injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant;
   </p>
   <p>
    and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime
   </p>
   <p>
    alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and
   </p>
   <p>
    indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the
   </p>
   <p>
    court.  He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then
   </p>
   <p>
    looked around for the means.  After many fruitless attempts to gain
   </p>
   <p>
    admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an
   </p>
   <p>
    unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the
   </p>
   <p>
    unfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the
   </p>
   <p>
    execution of the barbarous sentence.  Felix visited the grate at night
   </p>
   <p>
    and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour.  The Turk,
   </p>
   <p>
    amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer
   </p>
   <p>
    by promises of reward and wealth.  Felix rejected his offers with
   </p>
   <p>
    contempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit
   </p>
   <p>
    her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the
   </p>
   <p>
    youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed
   </p>
   <p>
    a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made
   </p>
   <p>
    on the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in
   </p>
   <p>
    his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he
   </p>
   <p>
    should be conveyed to a place of safety.  Felix was too delicate to
   </p>
   <p>
    accept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the
   </p>
   <p>
    event as to the consummation of his happiness.
   </p>
   <p>
    “During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for
   </p>
   <p>
    the escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several
   </p>
   <p>
    letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to
   </p>
   <p>
    express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old
   </p>
   <p>
    man, a servant of her father who understood French.  She thanked him in
   </p>
   <p>
    the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and
   </p>
   <p>
    at the same time she gently deplored her own fate.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence
   </p>
   <p>
    in the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters
   </p>
   <p>
    were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha.  Before I depart I will
   </p>
   <p>
    give them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present,
   </p>
   <p>
    as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat
   </p>
   <p>
    the substance of them to you.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a
   </p>
   <p>
    slave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of
   </p>
   <p>
    the father of Safie, who married her.  The young girl spoke in high and
   </p>
   <p>
    enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the
   </p>
   <p>
    bondage to which she was now reduced.  She instructed her daughter in
   </p>
   <p>
    the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of
   </p>
   <p>
    intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female
   </p>
   <p>
    followers of Muhammad.  This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly
   </p>
   <p>
    impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again
   </p>
   <p>
    returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem,
   </p>
   <p>
    allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to
   </p>
   <p>
    the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble
   </p>
   <p>
    emulation for virtue.  The prospect of marrying a Christian and
   </p>
   <p>
    remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in
   </p>
   <p>
    society was enchanting to her.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the night
   </p>
   <p>
    previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant
   </p>
   <p>
    many leagues from Paris.  Felix had procured passports in the name of
   </p>
   <p>
    his father, sister, and himself.  He had previously communicated his
   </p>
   <p>
    plan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under
   </p>
   <p>
    the pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, in
   </p>
   <p>
    an obscure part of Paris.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont
   </p>
   <p>
    Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable
   </p>
   <p>
    opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his
   </p>
   <p>
    departure, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she
   </p>
   <p>
    should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in
   </p>
   <p>
    expectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society
   </p>
   <p>
    of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest
   </p>
   <p>
    affection.  They conversed with one another through the means of an
   </p>
   <p>
    interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie
   </p>
   <p>
    sang to him the divine airs of her native country.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes
   </p>
   <p>
    of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other
   </p>
   <p>
    plans.  He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a
   </p>
   <p>
    Christian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear
   </p>
   <p>
    lukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer
   </p>
   <p>
    if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they
   </p>
   <p>
    inhabited.  He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled
   </p>
   <p>
    to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and
   </p>
   <p>
    secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed.  His plans
   </p>
   <p>
    were facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their
   </p>
   <p>
    victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer.  The
   </p>
   <p>
    plot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were
   </p>
   <p>
    thrown into prison.  The news reached Felix and roused him from his
   </p>
   <p>
    dream of pleasure.  His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay
   </p>
   <p>
    in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of
   </p>
   <p>
    her whom he loved.  This idea was torture to him.  He quickly arranged
   </p>
   <p>
    with the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity
   </p>
   <p>
    for escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a
   </p>
   <p>
    boarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian,
   </p>
   <p>
    he hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the
   </p>
   <p>
    law, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.
   </p>
   <p>
    “He did not succeed.  They remained confined for five months before the
   </p>
   <p>
    trial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune
   </p>
   <p>
    and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.
   </p>
   <p>
    “They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I
   </p>
   <p>
    discovered them.  Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for
   </p>
   <p>
    whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on
   </p>
   <p>
    discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin,
   </p>
   <p>
    became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with
   </p>
   <p>
    his daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him,
   </p>
   <p>
    as he said, in some plan of future maintenance.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered
   </p>
   <p>
    him, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family.  He could
   </p>
   <p>
    have endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his
   </p>
   <p>
    virtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss
   </p>
   <p>
    of his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable.  The
   </p>
   <p>
    arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.
   </p>
   <p>
    “When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth
   </p>
   <p>
    and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her
   </p>
   <p>
    lover, but to prepare to return to her native country.  The generous
   </p>
   <p>
    nature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to
   </p>
   <p>
    expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his
   </p>
   <p>
    tyrannical mandate.
   </p>
   <p>
    “A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter’s apartment and told
   </p>
   <p>
    her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn
   </p>
   <p>
    had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the
   </p>
   <p>
    French government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to
   </p>
   <p>
    Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours.  He
   </p>
   <p>
    intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential
   </p>
   <p>
    servant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his
   </p>
   <p>
    property, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.
   </p>
   <p>
    “When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it
   </p>
   <p>
    would become her to pursue in this emergency.  A residence in Turkey
   </p>
   <p>
    was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse
   </p>
   <p>
    to it.  By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she
   </p>
   <p>
    heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where
   </p>
   <p>
    he then resided.  She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her
   </p>
   <p>
    determination.  Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a
   </p>
   <p>
    sum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn,
   </p>
   <p>
    but who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for
   </p>
   <p>
    Germany.
   </p>
   <p>
    “She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage
   </p>
   <p>
    of De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill.  Safie nursed her
   </p>
   <p>
    with the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    Arabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country
   </p>
   <p>
    and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world.  She fell, however,
   </p>
   <p>
    into good hands.  The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for
   </p>
   <p>
    which they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in
   </p>
   <p>
    which they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at
   </p>
   <p>
    the cottage of her lover.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 15
   </p>
   <p>
    “Such was the history of my beloved cottagers.  It impressed me deeply.
   </p>
   <p>
    I learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire
   </p>
   <p>
    their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.
   </p>
   <p>
    “As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and
   </p>
   <p>
    generosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to
   </p>
   <p>
    become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities
   </p>
   <p>
    were called forth and displayed.  But in giving an account of the
   </p>
   <p>
    progress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred
   </p>
   <p>
    in the beginning of the month of August of the same year.
   </p>
   <p>
    “One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I
   </p>
   <p>
    collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on
   </p>
   <p>
    the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and
   </p>
   <p>
    some books.  I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel.
   </p>
   <p>
    Fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I
   </p>
   <p>
    had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of _Paradise Lost_, a volume
   </p>
   <p>
    of _Plutarch’s Lives_, and the _Sorrows of Werter_. The
   </p>
   <p>
    possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually
   </p>
   <p>
    studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were
   </p>
   <p>
    employed in their ordinary occupations.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books.  They produced
   </p>
   <p>
    in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me
   </p>
   <p>
    to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection.  In
   </p>
   <p>
    the _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affecting
   </p>
   <p>
    story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon
   </p>
   <p>
    what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a
   </p>
   <p>
    never-ending source of speculation and astonishment.  The gentle and
   </p>
   <p>
    domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and
   </p>
   <p>
    feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded
   </p>
   <p>
    well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which
   </p>
   <p>
    were for ever alive in my own bosom.  But I thought Werter himself a
   </p>
   <p>
    more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character
   </p>
   <p>
    contained no pretension, but it sank deep.  The disquisitions upon
   </p>
   <p>
    death and suicide were calculated to fill  me with wonder.  I did not
   </p>
   <p>
    pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards
   </p>
   <p>
    the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely
   </p>
   <p>
    understanding it.
   </p>
   <p>
    “As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and
   </p>
   <p>
    condition.  I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely
   </p>
   <p>
    unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I
   </p>
   <p>
    was a listener.  I sympathised with and partly understood them, but I
   </p>
   <p>
    was unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none.
   </p>
   <p>
    ‘The path of my departure was free,’ and there was none to lament my
   </p>
   <p>
    annihilation.  My person was hideous and my stature gigantic.  What did
   </p>
   <p>
    this mean?  Who was I?  What was I?  Whence did I come?  What was my
   </p>
   <p>
    destination?  These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to
   </p>
   <p>
    solve them.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The volume of _Plutarch’s Lives_ which I possessed contained the
   </p>
   <p>
    histories of the first founders of the ancient republics.  This book
   </p>
   <p>
    had a far different effect upon me from the _Sorrows of Werter_.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    learned from Werter’s imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch
   </p>
   <p>
    taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my
   </p>
   <p>
    own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages.  Many
   </p>
   <p>
    things I read surpassed my understanding and experience.  I had a very
   </p>
   <p>
    confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers,
   </p>
   <p>
    and boundless seas.  But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and
   </p>
   <p>
    large assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the
   </p>
   <p>
    only school in which I had studied human nature, but this book
   </p>
   <p>
    developed new and mightier scenes of action.  I read of men concerned
   </p>
   <p>
    in public affairs, governing or massacring their species.  I felt the
   </p>
   <p>
    greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as
   </p>
   <p>
    far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they
   </p>
   <p>
    were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone.  Induced by these
   </p>
   <p>
    feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa,
   </p>
   <p>
    Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus.  The
   </p>
   <p>
    patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a
   </p>
   <p>
    firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had
   </p>
   <p>
    been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should
   </p>
   <p>
    have been imbued with different sensations.
   </p>
   <p>
    “But _Paradise Lost_ excited different and far deeper emotions.  I read
   </p>
   <p>
    it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as
   </p>
   <p>
    a true history.  It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the
   </p>
   <p>
    picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of
   </p>
   <p>
    exciting.  I often referred the several situations, as their similarity
   </p>
   <p>
    struck me, to my own.  Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to
   </p>
   <p>
    any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine
   </p>
   <p>
    in every other respect.  He had come forth from the hands of God a
   </p>
   <p>
    perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of
   </p>
   <p>
    his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from
   </p>
   <p>
    beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.
   </p>
   <p>
    Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for
   </p>
   <p>
    often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter
   </p>
   <p>
    gall of envy rose within me.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings.  Soon
   </p>
   <p>
    after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of
   </p>
   <p>
    the dress which I had taken from your laboratory.  At first I had
   </p>
   <p>
    neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in
   </p>
   <p>
    which they were written, I began to study them with diligence.  It was
   </p>
   <p>
    your journal of the four months that preceded my creation.  You
   </p>
   <p>
    minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress
   </p>
   <p>
    of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic
   </p>
   <p>
    occurrences.  You doubtless recollect these papers.  Here they are.
   </p>
   <p>
    Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed
   </p>
   <p>
    origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances
   </p>
   <p>
    which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious
   </p>
   <p>
    and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own
   </p>
   <p>
    horrors and rendered mine indelible.  I sickened as I read.  ‘Hateful
   </p>
   <p>
    day when I received life!’ I exclaimed in agony.  ‘Accursed creator!
   </p>
   <p>
    Why did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me in
   </p>
   <p>
    disgust?  God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own
   </p>
   <p>
    image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the
   </p>
   <p>
    very resemblance.  Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire
   </p>
   <p>
    and encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.’
   </p>
   <p>
    “These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude;
   </p>
   <p>
    but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and
   </p>
   <p>
    benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should
   </p>
   <p>
    become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they  would
   </p>
   <p>
    compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity.  Could they turn
   </p>
   <p>
    from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion
   </p>
   <p>
    and friendship?  I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way
   </p>
   <p>
    to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance
   </p>
   <p>
    attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.
   </p>
   <p>
    Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every
   </p>
   <p>
    day’s experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking
   </p>
   <p>
    until a few more months should have added to my sagacity.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage.  The
   </p>
   <p>
    presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also
   </p>
   <p>
    found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there.  Felix and Agatha
   </p>
   <p>
    spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in
   </p>
   <p>
    their labours by servants.  They did not appear rich, but they were
   </p>
   <p>
    contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while
   </p>
   <p>
    mine became every day more tumultuous.  Increase of knowledge only
   </p>
   <p>
    discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person
   </p>
   <p>
    reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail
   </p>
   <p>
    image and that inconstant shade.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial
   </p>
   <p>
    which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my
   </p>
   <p>
    thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and
   </p>
   <p>
    dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my
   </p>
   <p>
    feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed
   </p>
   <p>
    smiles of consolation.  But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my
   </p>
   <p>
    sorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone.  I remembered Adam’s
   </p>
   <p>
    supplication to his Creator.  But where was mine?  He had abandoned me,
   </p>
   <p>
    and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Autumn passed thus.  I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay
   </p>
   <p>
    and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it
   </p>
   <p>
    had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon.  Yet I did
   </p>
   <p>
    not heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my
   </p>
   <p>
    conformation for the endurance of cold than heat.  But my chief
   </p>
   <p>
    delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay
   </p>
   <p>
    apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention
   </p>
   <p>
    towards the cottagers.  Their happiness was not decreased by the
   </p>
   <p>
    absence of summer.  They loved and sympathised with one another; and
   </p>
   <p>
    their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the
   </p>
   <p>
    casualties that took place around them.  The more I saw of them, the
   </p>
   <p>
    greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my
   </p>
   <p>
    heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see
   </p>
   <p>
    their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost
   </p>
   <p>
    limit of my ambition.  I dared not think that they would turn them from
   </p>
   <p>
    me with disdain and horror.  The poor that stopped at their door were
   </p>
   <p>
    never driven away.  I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a
   </p>
   <p>
    little food or rest:  I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not
   </p>
   <p>
    believe myself utterly unworthy of it.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken
   </p>
   <p>
    place since I awoke into life.  My attention at this time was solely
   </p>
   <p>
    directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my
   </p>
   <p>
    protectors.  I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally
   </p>
   <p>
    fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.
   </p>
   <p>
    I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my
   </p>
   <p>
    person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly
   </p>
   <p>
    beheld me.  My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I
   </p>
   <p>
    thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain
   </p>
   <p>
    the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means
   </p>
   <p>
    be tolerated by my younger protectors.
   </p>
   <p>
    “One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground
   </p>
   <p>
    and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha,
   </p>
   <p>
    and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own
   </p>
   <p>
    desire, was left alone in the cottage.  When his children had departed,
   </p>
   <p>
    he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more
   </p>
   <p>
    sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before.  At first his
   </p>
   <p>
    countenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued,
   </p>
   <p>
    thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the
   </p>
   <p>
    instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.
   </p>
   <p>
    “My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which
   </p>
   <p>
    would decide my hopes or realise my fears. The servants were gone to a
   </p>
   <p>
    neighbouring fair.  All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an
   </p>
   <p>
    excellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my
   </p>
   <p>
    limbs failed me and I sank to the ground.  Again I rose, and exerting
   </p>
   <p>
    all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had
   </p>
   <p>
    placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat.  The fresh air revived
   </p>
   <p>
    me, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their
   </p>
   <p>
    cottage.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I knocked. ‘Who is there?’ said the old man. ‘Come in.’
   </p>
   <p>
    “I entered. ‘Pardon this intrusion,’ said I; ‘I am
   </p>
   <p>
    a traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you
   </p>
   <p>
    would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.’
   </p>
   <p>
    “‘Enter,’ said De Lacey, ‘and I will try in what
   </p>
   <p>
    manner I can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are
   </p>
   <p>
    from home, and as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to
   </p>
   <p>
    procure food for you.’
   </p>
   <p>
    “‘Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is
   </p>
   <p>
    warmth and rest only that I need.’
   </p>
   <p>
    “I sat down, and a silence ensued.  I knew that every minute was
   </p>
   <p>
    precious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence
   </p>
   <p>
    the interview, when the old man addressed me.
   </p>
   <p>
    ‘By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you
   </p>
   <p>
    French?’
   </p>
   <p>
    “‘No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that
   </p>
   <p>
    language only.  I am now going to claim the protection of some friends,
   </p>
   <p>
    whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.’
   </p>
   <p>
    “‘Are they Germans?’
   </p>
   <p>
    “‘No, they are French.  But let us change the subject.  I am an
   </p>
   <p>
    unfortunate and deserted creature, I look around and I have no relation
   </p>
   <p>
    or friend upon earth.  These amiable people to whom I go have never
   </p>
   <p>
    seen me and know little of me.  I am full of fears, for if I fail
   </p>
   <p>
    there, I am an outcast in the world for ever.’
   </p>
   <p>
    “‘Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but
   </p>
   <p>
    the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are
   </p>
   <p>
    full of brotherly love and charity.  Rely, therefore, on your hopes;
   </p>
   <p>
    and if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair.’
   </p>
   <p>
    “‘They are kind—they are the most excellent creatures in the world;
   </p>
   <p>
    but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me.  I have good
   </p>
   <p>
    dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree
   </p>
   <p>
    beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they
   </p>
   <p>
    ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable
   </p>
   <p>
    monster.’
   </p>
   <p>
    “‘That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot
   </p>
   <p>
    you undeceive them?’
   </p>
   <p>
    “‘I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I
   </p>
   <p>
    feel so many overwhelming terrors.  I tenderly love these friends; I
   </p>
   <p>
    have, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily
   </p>
   <p>
    kindness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and
   </p>
   <p>
    it is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.’
   </p>
   <p>
    “‘Where do these friends reside?’
   </p>
   <p>
    “‘Near this spot.’
   </p>
   <p>
    “The old man paused and then continued, ‘If you will unreservedly
   </p>
   <p>
    confide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in
   </p>
   <p>
    undeceiving them.  I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but
   </p>
   <p>
    there is something in your words which persuades me that you are
   </p>
   <p>
    sincere.  I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure
   </p>
   <p>
    to be in any way serviceable to a human creature.’
   </p>
   <p>
    “‘Excellent man!  I thank you and accept your generous offer.  You
   </p>
   <p>
    raise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid,
   </p>
   <p>
    I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow
   </p>
   <p>
    creatures.’
   </p>
   <p>
    “‘Heaven forbid!  Even if you were really criminal, for that can only
   </p>
   <p>
    drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue.  I also am
   </p>
   <p>
    unfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent;
   </p>
   <p>
    judge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.’
   </p>
   <p>
    “‘How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor?  From your lips
   </p>
   <p>
    first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall
   </p>
   <p>
    be for ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success
   </p>
   <p>
    with those friends whom I am on the point of meeting.’
   </p>
   <p>
    “‘May I know the names and residence of those friends?’
   </p>
   <p>
    “I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to
   </p>
   <p>
    rob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever.  I struggled vainly for
   </p>
   <p>
    firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my
   </p>
   <p>
    remaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud.  At that
   </p>
   <p>
    moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors.  I had not a moment
   </p>
   <p>
    to lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, ‘Now is the
   </p>
   <p>
    time!  Save and protect me!  You and your family are the friends whom I
   </p>
   <p>
    seek.  Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!’
   </p>
   <p>
    “‘Great God!’ exclaimed the old man.  ‘Who are you?’
   </p>
   <p>
    “At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and
   </p>
   <p>
    Agatha entered.  Who can describe their horror and consternation on
   </p>
   <p>
    beholding me?  Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her
   </p>
   <p>
    friend, rushed out of the cottage.  Felix darted forward, and with
   </p>
   <p>
    supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in
   </p>
   <p>
    a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently
   </p>
   <p>
    with a stick.  I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends
   </p>
   <p>
    the antelope.  But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and
   </p>
   <p>
    I refrained.  I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when,
   </p>
   <p>
    overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general
   </p>
   <p>
    tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 16
   </p>
   <p>
    “Cursed, cursed creator!  Why did I live?  Why, in that instant, did I
   </p>
   <p>
    not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly
   </p>
   <p>
    bestowed?  I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my
   </p>
   <p>
    feelings were those of rage and revenge.  I could with pleasure have
   </p>
   <p>
    destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with
   </p>
   <p>
    their shrieks and misery.
   </p>
   <p>
    “When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and
   </p>
   <p>
    now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my
   </p>
   <p>
    anguish in fearful howlings.  I was like a wild beast that had broken
   </p>
   <p>
    the toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging
   </p>
   <p>
    through the wood with a stag-like swiftness.  Oh!  What a miserable
   </p>
   <p>
    night I passed!  The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees
   </p>
   <p>
    waved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird
   </p>
   <p>
    burst forth amidst the universal stillness.  All, save I, were at rest
   </p>
   <p>
    or in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and
   </p>
   <p>
    finding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spread
   </p>
   <p>
    havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed
   </p>
   <p>
    the ruin.
   </p>
   <p>
    “But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became
   </p>
   <p>
    fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in
   </p>
   <p>
    the sick impotence of despair.  There was none among the myriads of men
   </p>
   <p>
    that existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness
   </p>
   <p>
    towards my enemies?  No; from that moment I declared everlasting war
   </p>
   <p>
    against the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me
   </p>
   <p>
    and sent me forth to this insupportable misery.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was
   </p>
   <p>
    impossible to return to my retreat during that day.  Accordingly I hid
   </p>
   <p>
    myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours
   </p>
   <p>
    to reflection on my situation.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some
   </p>
   <p>
    degree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the
   </p>
   <p>
    cottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my
   </p>
   <p>
    conclusions.  I had certainly acted imprudently.  It was apparent that
   </p>
   <p>
    my conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and  I was a
   </p>
   <p>
    fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    ought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to
   </p>
   <p>
    have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have
   </p>
   <p>
    been  prepared for my approach.  But I did not believe my errors to be
   </p>
   <p>
    irretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the
   </p>
   <p>
    cottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my
   </p>
   <p>
    party.
   </p>
   <p>
    “These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound
   </p>
   <p>
    sleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by
   </p>
   <p>
    peaceful dreams.  The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever
   </p>
   <p>
    acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix
   </p>
   <p>
    tearing me from his father’s feet.  I awoke exhausted, and finding that
   </p>
   <p>
    it was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in
   </p>
   <p>
    search of food.
   </p>
   <p>
    “When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the
   </p>
   <p>
    well-known path that conducted to the cottage.  All there was at peace.
   </p>
   <p>
    I crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the
   </p>
   <p>
    accustomed hour when the family arose.  That hour passed, the sun
   </p>
   <p>
    mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune.  The inside
   </p>
   <p>
    of the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe the
   </p>
   <p>
    agony of this suspense.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they
   </p>
   <p>
    entered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not
   </p>
   <p>
    understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country,
   </p>
   <p>
    which differed from that of my protectors.  Soon after, however, Felix
   </p>
   <p>
    approached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not
   </p>
   <p>
    quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from
   </p>
   <p>
    his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.
   </p>
   <p>
    “‘Do you consider,’ said his companion to him,
   </p>
   <p>
    ‘that you will be obliged to pay three months’ rent and to lose
   </p>
   <p>
    the produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and
   </p>
   <p>
    I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your
   </p>
   <p>
    determination.’
   </p>
   <p>
    “‘It is utterly useless,’ replied Felix; ‘we can
   </p>
   <p>
    never again inhabit your cottage. The life of my father is in the greatest
   </p>
   <p>
    danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and
   </p>
   <p>
    my sister will never recover from their horror. I entreat you not to reason
   </p>
   <p>
    with me any more. Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this
   </p>
   <p>
    place.’
   </p>
   <p>
    “Felix trembled violently as he said this.  He and his companion
   </p>
   <p>
    entered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then
   </p>
   <p>
    departed.  I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of
   </p>
   <p>
    utter and stupid despair.  My protectors had departed and had broken
   </p>
   <p>
    the only link that held me to the world.  For the first time the
   </p>
   <p>
    feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to
   </p>
   <p>
    control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I
   </p>
   <p>
    bent my mind towards injury and death.  When I thought of my friends,
   </p>
   <p>
    of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of
   </p>
   <p>
    tears somewhat soothed me.  But again when I reflected that they had
   </p>
   <p>
    spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to
   </p>
   <p>
    injure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects.  As
   </p>
   <p>
    night advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage,
   </p>
   <p>
    and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden,
   </p>
   <p>
    I waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my
   </p>
   <p>
    operations.
   </p>
   <p>
    “As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly
   </p>
   <p>
    dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore
   </p>
   <p>
    along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my
   </p>
   <p>
    spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection.  I lighted the
   </p>
   <p>
    dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage,
   </p>
   <p>
    my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon
   </p>
   <p>
    nearly touched.  A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my
   </p>
   <p>
    brand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath,
   </p>
   <p>
    and bushes, which I had collected.  The wind fanned the fire, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and
   </p>
   <p>
    licked it with their forked and destroying tongues.
   </p>
   <p>
    “As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of
   </p>
   <p>
    the habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.
   </p>
   <p>
    “And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps?  I
   </p>
   <p>
    resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated
   </p>
   <p>
    and despised, every country must be equally horrible.  At length the
   </p>
   <p>
    thought of you crossed my mind.  I learned from your papers that you
   </p>
   <p>
    were my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness
   </p>
   <p>
    than to him who had given me life?  Among the lessons that Felix had
   </p>
   <p>
    bestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned from
   </p>
   <p>
    these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth.
   </p>
   <p>
    You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards
   </p>
   <p>
    this place I resolved to proceed.
   </p>
   <p>
    “But how was I to direct myself?  I knew that I must travel in a
   </p>
   <p>
    southwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my
   </p>
   <p>
    only guide.  I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass
   </p>
   <p>
    through, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I
   </p>
   <p>
    did not despair.  From you only could I hope for succour, although
   </p>
   <p>
    towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred.  Unfeeling,
   </p>
   <p>
    heartless creator!  You had endowed me with perceptions and passions
   </p>
   <p>
    and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.
   </p>
   <p>
    But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I
   </p>
   <p>
    determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from
   </p>
   <p>
    any other being that wore the human form.
   </p>
   <p>
    “My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense.  It was
   </p>
   <p>
    late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided.
   </p>
   <p>
    I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a
   </p>
   <p>
    human being.  Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless;
   </p>
   <p>
    rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface
   </p>
   <p>
    of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter.  Oh,
   </p>
   <p>
    earth!  How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being!  The
   </p>
   <p>
    mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall
   </p>
   <p>
    and bitterness.  The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more
   </p>
   <p>
    deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart.  Snow
   </p>
   <p>
    fell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not.  A few incidents
   </p>
   <p>
    now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I
   </p>
   <p>
    often wandered wide from my path.  The agony of my feelings allowed me
   </p>
   <p>
    no respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could
   </p>
   <p>
    not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived
   </p>
   <p>
    on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth
   </p>
   <p>
    and the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial
   </p>
   <p>
    manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was
   </p>
   <p>
    secured by night from the view of man.  One morning, however, finding
   </p>
   <p>
    that my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey
   </p>
   <p>
    after the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring,
   </p>
   <p>
    cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of
   </p>
   <p>
    the air.  I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long
   </p>
   <p>
    appeared dead, revive within me.  Half surprised by the novelty of
   </p>
   <p>
    these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and
   </p>
   <p>
    forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy.  Soft tears
   </p>
   <p>
    again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with
   </p>
   <p>
    thankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its
   </p>
   <p>
    boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many
   </p>
   <p>
    of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.
   </p>
   <p>
    Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard
   </p>
   <p>
    the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade
   </p>
   <p>
    of a cypress.  I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running
   </p>
   <p>
    towards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from
   </p>
   <p>
    someone in sport.  She continued her course along the precipitous sides
   </p>
   <p>
    of the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the
   </p>
   <p>
    rapid stream.  I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour,
   </p>
   <p>
    from the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore.  She
   </p>
   <p>
    was senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore
   </p>
   <p>
    animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic,
   </p>
   <p>
    who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled.  On
   </p>
   <p>
    seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms,
   </p>
   <p>
    hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood.  I followed speedily, I
   </p>
   <p>
    hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun,
   </p>
   <p>
    which he carried, at my body and fired.  I sank to the ground, and my
   </p>
   <p>
    injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.
   </p>
   <p>
    “This was then the reward of my benevolence!  I had saved a human being
   </p>
   <p>
    from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable
   </p>
   <p>
    pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone.  The feelings of
   </p>
   <p>
    kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments
   </p>
   <p>
    before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth.  Inflamed by
   </p>
   <p>
    pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind.  But the
   </p>
   <p>
    agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.
   </p>
   <p>
    “For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to
   </p>
   <p>
    cure the wound which I had received.  The ball had entered my shoulder,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any
   </p>
   <p>
    rate I had no means of extracting it.  My sufferings were augmented
   </p>
   <p>
    also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their
   </p>
   <p>
    infliction.  My daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly revenge,
   </p>
   <p>
    such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had
   </p>
   <p>
    endured.
   </p>
   <p>
    “After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey.  The
   </p>
   <p>
    labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or
   </p>
   <p>
    gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my
   </p>
   <p>
    desolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for
   </p>
   <p>
    the enjoyment of pleasure.
   </p>
   <p>
    “But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I
   </p>
   <p>
    reached the environs of Geneva.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among
   </p>
   <p>
    the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply
   </p>
   <p>
    to you.  I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to
   </p>
   <p>
    enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting
   </p>
   <p>
    behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.
   </p>
   <p>
    “At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection,
   </p>
   <p>
    which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came
   </p>
   <p>
    running into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of
   </p>
   <p>
    infancy.  Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this
   </p>
   <p>
    little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have
   </p>
   <p>
    imbibed a horror of deformity.  If, therefore, I could seize him and
   </p>
   <p>
    educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in
   </p>
   <p>
    this peopled earth.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him
   </p>
   <p>
    towards me.  As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before
   </p>
   <p>
    his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his
   </p>
   <p>
    face and said, ‘Child, what is the meaning of this?  I do not intend to
   </p>
   <p>
    hurt you; listen to me.’
   </p>
   <p>
    “He struggled violently. ‘Let me go,’ he cried;
   </p>
   <p>
    ‘monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. You
   </p>
   <p>
    are an ogre. Let me go, or I will tell my papa.’
   </p>
   <p>
    “‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.’
   </p>
   <p>
    “‘Hideous monster!  Let me go.  My papa is a syndic—he is M.
   </p>
   <p>
    Frankenstein—he will punish you.  You dare not keep me.’
   </p>
   <p>
    “‘Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom I have
   </p>
   <p>
    sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.’
   </p>
   <p>
    “The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried
   </p>
   <p>
    despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a
   </p>
   <p>
    moment he lay dead at my feet.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish
   </p>
   <p>
    triumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, ‘I too can create desolation;
   </p>
   <p>
    my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and
   </p>
   <p>
    a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.’
   </p>
   <p>
    “As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his
   </p>
   <p>
    breast.  I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman.  In spite
   </p>
   <p>
    of my malignity, it softened and attracted me.  For a few moments I
   </p>
   <p>
    gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her
   </p>
   <p>
    lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was
   </p>
   <p>
    for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could
   </p>
   <p>
    bestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in
   </p>
   <p>
    regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one
   </p>
   <p>
    expressive of disgust and affright.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage?  I only
   </p>
   <p>
    wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in
   </p>
   <p>
    exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the
   </p>
   <p>
    attempt to destroy them.
   </p>
   <p>
    “While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had
   </p>
   <p>
    committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I
   </p>
   <p>
    entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty.  A woman was
   </p>
   <p>
    sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her
   </p>
   <p>
    whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the
   </p>
   <p>
    loveliness of youth and health.  Here, I thought, is one of those whose
   </p>
   <p>
    joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me.  And then I bent over
   </p>
   <p>
    her and whispered, ‘Awake, fairest, thy lover is near—he who would
   </p>
   <p>
    give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my
   </p>
   <p>
    beloved, awake!’
   </p>
   <p>
    “The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me.  Should she
   </p>
   <p>
    indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus
   </p>
   <p>
    would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.
   </p>
   <p>
    The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me—not I, but
   </p>
   <p>
    she, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am for ever
   </p>
   <p>
    robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone.  The crime had
   </p>
   <p>
    its source in her; be hers the punishment!  Thanks to the lessons of
   </p>
   <p>
    Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work
   </p>
   <p>
    mischief.  I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of
   </p>
   <p>
    the folds of her dress.  She moved again, and I fled.
   </p>
   <p>
    “For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place,
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and
   </p>
   <p>
    its miseries for ever.  At length I wandered towards these mountains,
   </p>
   <p>
    and have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning
   </p>
   <p>
    passion which you alone can gratify.  We may not part until you have
   </p>
   <p>
    promised to comply with my requisition.  I am alone and miserable; man
   </p>
   <p>
    will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself
   </p>
   <p>
    would not deny herself to me.  My companion must be of the same species
   </p>
   <p>
    and have the same defects.  This being you must create.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 17
   </p>
   <p>
    The being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the
   </p>
   <p>
    expectation of a reply.  But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to
   </p>
   <p>
    arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his
   </p>
   <p>
    proposition.  He continued,
   </p>
   <p>
    “You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the
   </p>
   <p>
    interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being.  This you alone
   </p>
   <p>
    can do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to
   </p>
   <p>
    concede.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had
   </p>
   <p>
    died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and
   </p>
   <p>
    as he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within
   </p>
   <p>
    me.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I do refuse it,” I replied; “and no torture shall ever extort a
   </p>
   <p>
    consent from me.  You may render me the most miserable of men, but you
   </p>
   <p>
    shall never make me base in my own eyes.  Shall I create another like
   </p>
   <p>
    yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world.  Begone!  I
   </p>
   <p>
    have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You are in the wrong,” replied the fiend; “and instead
   </p>
   <p>
    of threatening, I am content to reason with you. I am malicious because I
   </p>
   <p>
    am miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator,
   </p>
   <p>
    would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I
   </p>
   <p>
    should pity man more than he pities me? You would not call it murder if you
   </p>
   <p>
    could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the
   </p>
   <p>
    work of your own hands. Shall I respect man when he condemns me? Let him
   </p>
   <p>
    live with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would
   </p>
   <p>
    bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance.
   </p>
   <p>
    But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our
   </p>
   <p>
    union. Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery. I will
   </p>
   <p>
    revenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and
   </p>
   <p>
    chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear
   </p>
   <p>
    inextinguishable hatred. Have a care; I will work at your destruction, nor
   </p>
   <p>
    finish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of
   </p>
   <p>
    your birth.”
   </p>
   <p>
    A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled
   </p>
   <p>
    into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently
   </p>
   <p>
    he calmed himself and proceeded—
   </p>
   <p>
    “I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me, for you do
   </p>
   <p>
    not reflect that _you_ are the cause of its excess. If any being felt
   </p>
   <p>
    emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a
   </p>
   <p>
    hundredfold; for that one creature’s sake I would make peace with the
   </p>
   <p>
    whole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised.
   </p>
   <p>
    What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of
   </p>
   <p>
    another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it
   </p>
   <p>
    is all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be
   </p>
   <p>
    monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more
   </p>
   <p>
    attached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will be
   </p>
   <p>
    harmless and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! My creator, make me
   </p>
   <p>
    happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit! Let me see that I
   </p>
   <p>
    excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my
   </p>
   <p>
    request!”
   </p>
   <p>
    I was moved.  I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences
   </p>
   <p>
    of my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument.
   </p>
   <p>
    His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature
   </p>
   <p>
    of fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion
   </p>
   <p>
    of happiness that it was in my power to bestow?  He saw my change of
   </p>
   <p>
    feeling and continued,
   </p>
   <p>
    “If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see
   </p>
   <p>
    us again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America.  My food is not
   </p>
   <p>
    that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite;
   </p>
   <p>
    acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment.  My companion will
   </p>
   <p>
    be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare.
   </p>
   <p>
    We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on
   </p>
   <p>
    man and will ripen our food.  The picture I present to you is peaceful
   </p>
   <p>
    and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the
   </p>
   <p>
    wantonness of power and cruelty.  Pitiless as you have been towards me,
   </p>
   <p>
    I now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment
   </p>
   <p>
    and persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You propose,” replied I, “to fly from the habitations of
   </p>
   <p>
    man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your
   </p>
   <p>
    only companions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man,
   </p>
   <p>
    persevere in this exile? You will return and again seek their kindness, and
   </p>
   <p>
    you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed,
   </p>
   <p>
    and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction.
   </p>
   <p>
    This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “How inconstant are your feelings! But a moment ago you were moved by
   </p>
   <p>
    my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?
   </p>
   <p>
    I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that
   </p>
   <p>
    with the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man and
   </p>
   <p>
    dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places. My evil passions
   </p>
   <p>
    will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy! My life will flow quietly
   </p>
   <p>
    away, and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker.”
   </p>
   <p>
    His words had a strange effect upon me.  I compassionated him and
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when
   </p>
   <p>
    I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my
   </p>
   <p>
    feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred.  I tried to stifle
   </p>
   <p>
    these sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathise with him, I
   </p>
   <p>
    had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which
   </p>
   <p>
    was yet in my power to bestow.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You swear,” I said, “to be harmless; but have you not
   </p>
   <p>
    already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust
   </p>
   <p>
    you? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by
   </p>
   <p>
    affording a wider scope for your revenge?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “How is this?  I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer.  If
   </p>
   <p>
    I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion;
   </p>
   <p>
    the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall
   </p>
   <p>
    become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant.  My vices
   </p>
   <p>
    are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will
   </p>
   <p>
    necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal.  I shall feel
   </p>
   <p>
    the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of
   </p>
   <p>
    existence and events from which I am now excluded.”
   </p>
   <p>
    I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various
   </p>
   <p>
    arguments which he had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues which
   </p>
   <p>
    he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight
   </p>
   <p>
    of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had
   </p>
   <p>
    manifested towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my
   </p>
   <p>
    calculations; a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers
   </p>
   <p>
    and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices
   </p>
   <p>
    was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a
   </p>
   <p>
    long pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him and
   </p>
   <p>
    my fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request.
   </p>
   <p>
    Turning to him, therefore, I said,
   </p>
   <p>
    “I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever,
   </p>
   <p>
    and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall
   </p>
   <p>
    deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I swear,” he cried, “by the sun, and by the blue sky of
   </p>
   <p>
    heaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my
   </p>
   <p>
    prayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again. Depart to your
   </p>
   <p>
    home and commence your labours; I shall watch their progress with
   </p>
   <p>
    unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall
   </p>
   <p>
    appear.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in
   </p>
   <p>
    my sentiments.  I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than
   </p>
   <p>
    the flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the
   </p>
   <p>
    sea of ice.
   </p>
   <p>
    His tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of
   </p>
   <p>
    the horizon when he departed.  I knew that I ought to hasten my descent
   </p>
   <p>
    towards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my
   </p>
   <p>
    heart was heavy, and my steps slow.  The labour of winding among the
   </p>
   <p>
    little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced
   </p>
   <p>
    perplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences
   </p>
   <p>
    of the day had produced.  Night was far advanced when I came to the
   </p>
   <p>
    halfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain.  The stars
   </p>
   <p>
    shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines
   </p>
   <p>
    rose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the
   </p>
   <p>
    ground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange
   </p>
   <p>
    thoughts within me.  I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I
   </p>
   <p>
    exclaimed, “Oh! stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock
   </p>
   <p>
    me; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as
   </p>
   <p>
    nought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness.”
   </p>
   <p>
    These were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to you
   </p>
   <p>
    how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I
   </p>
   <p>
    listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its
   </p>
   <p>
    way to consume me.
   </p>
   <p>
    Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no
   </p>
   <p>
    rest, but returned immediately to Geneva.  Even in my own heart I could
   </p>
   <p>
    give no expression to my sensations—they weighed on me with a
   </p>
   <p>
    mountain’s weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the
   </p>
   <p>
    family.  My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I
   </p>
   <p>
    answered no question, scarcely did I speak.  I felt as if I were placed
   </p>
   <p>
    under a ban—as if I had no right to claim their sympathies—as if
   </p>
   <p>
    never more might I enjoy companionship with them.  Yet even thus I
   </p>
   <p>
    loved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate
   </p>
   <p>
    myself to my most abhorred task.  The prospect of such an occupation
   </p>
   <p>
    made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream,
   </p>
   <p>
    and that thought only had to me the reality of life.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 18
   </p>
   <p>
    Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and
   </p>
   <p>
    I could not collect the courage to recommence my work.  I feared the
   </p>
   <p>
    vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my
   </p>
   <p>
    repugnance to the task which was enjoined me.  I found that I could not
   </p>
   <p>
    compose a female without again devoting several months to profound
   </p>
   <p>
    study and laborious disquisition.  I had heard of some discoveries
   </p>
   <p>
    having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was
   </p>
   <p>
    material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my
   </p>
   <p>
    father’s consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to
   </p>
   <p>
    every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an
   </p>
   <p>
    undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to
   </p>
   <p>
    me.  A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had
   </p>
   <p>
    hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when
   </p>
   <p>
    unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably.  My
   </p>
   <p>
    father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts
   </p>
   <p>
    towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy,
   </p>
   <p>
    which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring
   </p>
   <p>
    blackness overcast the approaching sunshine.  At these moments I took
   </p>
   <p>
    refuge in the most perfect solitude.  I passed whole days on the lake
   </p>
   <p>
    alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the
   </p>
   <p>
    rippling of the waves, silent and listless.  But the fresh air and
   </p>
   <p>
    bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and
   </p>
   <p>
    on my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile
   </p>
   <p>
    and a more cheerful heart.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father,
   </p>
   <p>
    calling me aside, thus addressed me,
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself.  And yet you are still
   </p>
   <p>
    unhappy and still avoid our society.  For some time I was lost in
   </p>
   <p>
    conjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me,
   </p>
   <p>
    and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it.  Reserve on such a
   </p>
   <p>
    point would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.”
   </p>
   <p>
    I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued—
   </p>
   <p>
    “I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your
   </p>
   <p>
    marriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the
   </p>
   <p>
    stay of my declining years. You were attached to each other from your
   </p>
   <p>
    earliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and
   </p>
   <p>
    tastes, entirely suited to one another. But so blind is the experience of
   </p>
   <p>
    man that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have
   </p>
   <p>
    entirely destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any
   </p>
   <p>
    wish that she might become your wife. Nay, you may have met with another
   </p>
   <p>
    whom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to
   </p>
   <p>
    Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear
   </p>
   <p>
    to feel.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “My dear father, reassure yourself.  I love my cousin tenderly and
   </p>
   <p>
    sincerely.  I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my
   </p>
   <p>
    warmest admiration and affection.  My future hopes and prospects are
   </p>
   <p>
    entirely bound up in the expectation of our union.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor,
   </p>
   <p>
    gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced.  If you
   </p>
   <p>
    feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast
   </p>
   <p>
    a gloom over us.  But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so
   </p>
   <p>
    strong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate.  Tell me,
   </p>
   <p>
    therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the
   </p>
   <p>
    marriage.  We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us
   </p>
   <p>
    from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You
   </p>
   <p>
    are younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent
   </p>
   <p>
    fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future
   </p>
   <p>
    plans of honour and utility that you may have formed.  Do not suppose,
   </p>
   <p>
    however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on
   </p>
   <p>
    your part would cause me any serious uneasiness.  Interpret my words
   </p>
   <p>
    with candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and
   </p>
   <p>
    sincerity.”
   </p>
   <p>
    I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable
   </p>
   <p>
    of offering any reply.  I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of
   </p>
   <p>
    thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion.  Alas!  To me
   </p>
   <p>
    the idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and
   </p>
   <p>
    dismay.  I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled
   </p>
   <p>
    and dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not
   </p>
   <p>
    impend over me and my devoted family!  Could I enter into a festival
   </p>
   <p>
    with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the
   </p>
   <p>
    ground?  I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with
   </p>
   <p>
    his mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from
   </p>
   <p>
    which I expected peace.
   </p>
   <p>
    I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to
   </p>
   <p>
    England or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers
   </p>
   <p>
    of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable
   </p>
   <p>
    use to me in my present undertaking.  The latter method of obtaining
   </p>
   <p>
    the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I
   </p>
   <p>
    had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my
   </p>
   <p>
    loathsome task in my father’s house while in habits of familiar
   </p>
   <p>
    intercourse with those I loved.  I knew that a thousand fearful
   </p>
   <p>
    accidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to
   </p>
   <p>
    thrill all connected with me with horror.  I was aware also that I
   </p>
   <p>
    should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the
   </p>
   <p>
    harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my
   </p>
   <p>
    unearthly occupation.  I must absent myself from all I loved while thus
   </p>
   <p>
    employed.  Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be
   </p>
   <p>
    restored to my family in peace and happiness.  My promise fulfilled,
   </p>
   <p>
    the monster would depart for ever.  Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some
   </p>
   <p>
    accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my
   </p>
   <p>
    slavery for ever.
   </p>
   <p>
    These feelings dictated my answer to my father.  I expressed a wish to
   </p>
   <p>
    visit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I
   </p>
   <p>
    clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I
   </p>
   <p>
    urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to
   </p>
   <p>
    comply.  After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that
   </p>
   <p>
    resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find
   </p>
   <p>
    that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey,
   </p>
   <p>
    and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my
   </p>
   <p>
    return, have restored me entirely to myself.
   </p>
   <p>
    The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or
   </p>
   <p>
    at most a year, was the period contemplated.  One paternal kind
   </p>
   <p>
    precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion.  Without
   </p>
   <p>
    previously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth,
   </p>
   <p>
    arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh.  This interfered
   </p>
   <p>
    with the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the
   </p>
   <p>
    commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be
   </p>
   <p>
    an impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many
   </p>
   <p>
    hours of lonely, maddening reflection.  Nay, Henry might stand between
   </p>
   <p>
    me and the intrusion of my foe.  If I were alone, would he not at times
   </p>
   <p>
    force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to
   </p>
   <p>
    contemplate its progress?
   </p>
   <p>
    To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union
   </p>
   <p>
    with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return.  My father’s
   </p>
   <p>
    age rendered him extremely averse to delay.  For myself, there was one
   </p>
   <p>
    reward I promised myself from my detested toils—one consolation for my
   </p>
   <p>
    unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when,
   </p>
   <p>
    enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and
   </p>
   <p>
    forget the past in my union with her.
   </p>
   <p>
    I now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me
   </p>
   <p>
    which filled me with fear and agitation.  During my absence I should
   </p>
   <p>
    leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and
   </p>
   <p>
    unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my
   </p>
   <p>
    departure.  But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and
   </p>
   <p>
    would he not accompany me to England?  This imagination was dreadful in
   </p>
   <p>
    itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.
   </p>
   <p>
    I was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of
   </p>
   <p>
    this might happen.  But through the whole period during which I was the
   </p>
   <p>
    slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of
   </p>
   <p>
    the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend
   </p>
   <p>
    would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his
   </p>
   <p>
    machinations.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native
   </p>
   <p>
    country.  My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth
   </p>
   <p>
    therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of
   </p>
   <p>
    my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief.  It had
   </p>
   <p>
    been her care which provided me a companion in Clerval—and yet a man
   </p>
   <p>
    is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman’s
   </p>
   <p>
    sedulous attention.  She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand
   </p>
   <p>
    conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent
   </p>
   <p>
    farewell.
   </p>
   <p>
    I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly
   </p>
   <p>
    knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around.
   </p>
   <p>
    I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on
   </p>
   <p>
    it, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with
   </p>
   <p>
    me.  Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful
   </p>
   <p>
    and majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving.  I could
   </p>
   <p>
    only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy
   </p>
   <p>
    me whilst they endured.
   </p>
   <p>
    After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed
   </p>
   <p>
    many leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for
   </p>
   <p>
    Clerval.  He came.  Alas, how great was the contrast between us!  He
   </p>
   <p>
    was alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the
   </p>
   <p>
    setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new
   </p>
   <p>
    day.  He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and
   </p>
   <p>
    the appearances of the sky.  “This is what it is to live,” he cried;
   </p>
   <p>
    “now I enjoy existence!  But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are
   </p>
   <p>
    you desponding and sorrowful!” In truth, I was occupied by gloomy
   </p>
   <p>
    thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden
   </p>
   <p>
    sunrise reflected in the Rhine.  And you, my friend, would be far more
   </p>
   <p>
    amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an
   </p>
   <p>
    eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections.  I, a
   </p>
   <p>
    miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to
   </p>
   <p>
    enjoyment.
   </p>
   <p>
    We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to
   </p>
   <p>
    Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London.  During this
   </p>
   <p>
    voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.
   </p>
   <p>
    We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from
   </p>
   <p>
    Strasburgh, arrived at Mainz.  The course of the Rhine below Mainz
   </p>
   <p>
    becomes much more picturesque.  The river descends rapidly and winds
   </p>
   <p>
    between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms.  We saw
   </p>
   <p>
    many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by
   </p>
   <p>
    black woods, high and inaccessible.  This part of the Rhine, indeed,
   </p>
   <p>
    presents a singularly variegated landscape.  In one spot you view
   </p>
   <p>
    rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with
   </p>
   <p>
    the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory,
   </p>
   <p>
    flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river
   </p>
   <p>
    and populous towns occupy the scene.
   </p>
   <p>
    We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers
   </p>
   <p>
    as we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits
   </p>
   <p>
    continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the
   </p>
   <p>
    bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to
   </p>
   <p>
    drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these
   </p>
   <p>
    were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had
   </p>
   <p>
    been transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by
   </p>
   <p>
    man. “I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenes
   </p>
   <p>
    of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the
   </p>
   <p>
    snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black
   </p>
   <p>
    and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance
   </p>
   <p>
    were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay
   </p>
   <p>
    appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore
   </p>
   <p>
    up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be
   </p>
   <p>
    on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain,
   </p>
   <p>
    where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and
   </p>
   <p>
    where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the
   </p>
   <p>
    nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud;
   </p>
   <p>
    but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The
   </p>
   <p>
    mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a
   </p>
   <p>
    charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.
   </p>
   <p>
    Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the
   </p>
   <p>
    island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now
   </p>
   <p>
    that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village
   </p>
   <p>
    half hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits
   </p>
   <p>
    and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who
   </p>
   <p>
    pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of
   </p>
   <p>
    our own country.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Clerval! Beloved friend! Even now it delights me to record your words and
   </p>
   <p>
    to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a
   </p>
   <p>
    being formed in the “very poetry of nature.” His wild and
   </p>
   <p>
    enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His
   </p>
   <p>
    soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that
   </p>
   <p>
    devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only
   </p>
   <p>
    in the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to
   </p>
   <p>
    satisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regard
   </p>
   <p>
    only with admiration, he loved with ardour:—
   </p>
   <p>
    ——The sounding cataract
   </p>
   <p>
    Haunted him like a passion:  the tall rock,
   </p>
   <p>
    The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,
   </p>
   <p>
    Their colours and their forms, were then to him
   </p>
   <p>
    An appetite; a feeling, and a love,
   </p>
   <p>
    That had no need of a remoter charm,
   </p>
   <p>
    By thought supplied, or any interest
   </p>
   <p>
    Unborrow’d from the eye.
   </p>
   <p>
    [Wordsworth’s “Tintern Abbey”.]
   </p>
   <p>
    And where does he now exist?  Is this gentle and lovely being lost
   </p>
   <p>
    for ever?  Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful
   </p>
   <p>
    and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the
   </p>
   <p>
    life of its creator;—has this mind perished?  Does it now only exist
   </p>
   <p>
    in my memory?  No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and
   </p>
   <p>
    beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and
   </p>
   <p>
    consoles your unhappy friend.
   </p>
   <p>
    Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight
   </p>
   <p>
    tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart,
   </p>
   <p>
    overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates.  I will
   </p>
   <p>
    proceed with my tale.
   </p>
   <p>
    Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to
   </p>
   <p>
    post the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream of
   </p>
   <p>
    the river was too gentle to aid us.
   </p>
   <p>
    Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we
   </p>
   <p>
    arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw
   </p>
   <p>
    the white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new scene;
   </p>
   <p>
    they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the
   </p>
   <p>
    remembrance of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish
   </p>
   <p>
    Armada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich—places which I had heard
   </p>
   <p>
    of even in my country.
   </p>
   <p>
    At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul’s towering
   </p>
   <p>
    above all, and the Tower famed in English history.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 19
   </p>
   <p>
    London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several
   </p>
   <p>
    months in this wonderful and celebrated city.  Clerval desired the
   </p>
   <p>
    intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this
   </p>
   <p>
    time, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally
   </p>
   <p>
    occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the
   </p>
   <p>
    completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of
   </p>
   <p>
    introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most
   </p>
   <p>
    distinguished natural philosophers.
   </p>
   <p>
    If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness,
   </p>
   <p>
    it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure.  But a blight had
   </p>
   <p>
    come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of
   </p>
   <p>
    the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest
   </p>
   <p>
    was so terribly profound.  Company was irksome to me; when alone, I
   </p>
   <p>
    could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of
   </p>
   <p>
    Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory
   </p>
   <p>
    peace.  But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to
   </p>
   <p>
    my heart.  I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my
   </p>
   <p>
    fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and
   </p>
   <p>
    Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled
   </p>
   <p>
    my soul with anguish.
   </p>
   <p>
    But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive
   </p>
   <p>
    and anxious to gain experience and instruction.  The difference of
   </p>
   <p>
    manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of
   </p>
   <p>
    instruction and amusement.  He was also pursuing an object he had long
   </p>
   <p>
    had in view.  His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had
   </p>
   <p>
    in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had
   </p>
   <p>
    taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of
   </p>
   <p>
    European colonization and trade.  In Britain only could he further the
   </p>
   <p>
    execution of his plan.  He was for ever busy, and the only check to his
   </p>
   <p>
    enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind.  I tried to conceal this
   </p>
   <p>
    as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures
   </p>
   <p>
    natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by
   </p>
   <p>
    any care or bitter recollection.  I often refused to accompany him,
   </p>
   <p>
    alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone.  I now also
   </p>
   <p>
    began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this
   </p>
   <p>
    was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling
   </p>
   <p>
    on the head.  Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme
   </p>
   <p>
    anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips
   </p>
   <p>
    to quiver, and my heart to palpitate.
   </p>
   <p>
    After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in
   </p>
   <p>
    Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the
   </p>
   <p>
    beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient
   </p>
   <p>
    allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth,
   </p>
   <p>
    where he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I,
   </p>
   <p>
    although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and
   </p>
   <p>
    all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.
   </p>
   <p>
    We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now
   </p>
   <p>
    February. We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the
   </p>
   <p>
    north at the expiration of another month. In this expedition we did not
   </p>
   <p>
    intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford,
   </p>
   <p>
    Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of
   </p>
   <p>
    this tour about the end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments and
   </p>
   <p>
    the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some
   </p>
   <p>
    obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.
   </p>
   <p>
    We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at
   </p>
   <p>
    Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest.  This was a new scene to us
   </p>
   <p>
    mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of
   </p>
   <p>
    stately deer were all novelties to us.
   </p>
   <p>
    From thence we proceeded to Oxford.  As we entered this city, our minds
   </p>
   <p>
    were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted
   </p>
   <p>
    there more than a century and a half before.  It was here that Charles
   </p>
   <p>
    I. had collected his forces.  This city had remained faithful to him,
   </p>
   <p>
    after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of
   </p>
   <p>
    Parliament and liberty.  The memory of that unfortunate king and his
   </p>
   <p>
    companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and
   </p>
   <p>
    son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they
   </p>
   <p>
    might be supposed to have inhabited.  The spirit of elder days found a
   </p>
   <p>
    dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps.  If these
   </p>
   <p>
    feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of
   </p>
   <p>
    the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.
   </p>
   <p>
    The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost
   </p>
   <p>
    magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows
   </p>
   <p>
    of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,
   </p>
   <p>
    which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and
   </p>
   <p>
    domes, embosomed among aged trees.
   </p>
   <p>
    I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the
   </p>
   <p>
    memory of the past and the anticipation of the future.  I was formed
   </p>
   <p>
    for peaceful happiness.  During my youthful days discontent never
   </p>
   <p>
    visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what
   </p>
   <p>
    is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in
   </p>
   <p>
    the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate
   </p>
   <p>
    elasticity to my spirits.  But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has
   </p>
   <p>
    entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what
   </p>
   <p>
    I shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity,
   </p>
   <p>
    pitiable to others and intolerable to myself.
   </p>
   <p>
    We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs
   </p>
   <p>
    and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most
   </p>
   <p>
    animating epoch of English history.  Our little voyages of discovery
   </p>
   <p>
    were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves.  We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the
   </p>
   <p>
    field on which that patriot fell.  For a moment my soul was elevated
   </p>
   <p>
    from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas
   </p>
   <p>
    of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments
   </p>
   <p>
    and the remembrancers.  For an instant I dared to shake off my chains
   </p>
   <p>
    and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten
   </p>
   <p>
    into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my
   </p>
   <p>
    miserable self.
   </p>
   <p>
    We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next
   </p>
   <p>
    place of rest.  The country in the neighbourhood of this village
   </p>
   <p>
    resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but
   </p>
   <p>
    everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of
   </p>
   <p>
    distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my
   </p>
   <p>
    native country.  We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets
   </p>
   <p>
    of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same
   </p>
   <p>
    manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix.  The latter name
   </p>
   <p>
    made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit
   </p>
   <p>
    Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.
   </p>
   <p>
    From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in
   </p>
   <p>
    Cumberland and Westmorland.  I could now almost fancy myself among the
   </p>
   <p>
    Swiss mountains.  The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the
   </p>
   <p>
    northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the
   </p>
   <p>
    rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me.  Here also we
   </p>
   <p>
    made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into
   </p>
   <p>
    happiness.  The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than
   </p>
   <p>
    mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found
   </p>
   <p>
    in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have
   </p>
   <p>
    imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his
   </p>
   <p>
    inferiors.  “I could pass my life here,” said he to me; “and among
   </p>
   <p>
    these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.”
   </p>
   <p>
    But he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain
   </p>
   <p>
    amidst its enjoyments.  His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and
   </p>
   <p>
    when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit
   </p>
   <p>
    that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again
   </p>
   <p>
    engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.
   </p>
   <p>
    We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland
   </p>
   <p>
    and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period
   </p>
   <p>
    of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them
   </p>
   <p>
    to travel on.  For my own part I was not sorry.  I had now neglected my
   </p>
   <p>
    promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dæmon’s
   </p>
   <p>
    disappointment.  He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance
   </p>
   <p>
    on my relatives.  This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment
   </p>
   <p>
    from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace.  I waited
   </p>
   <p>
    for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was
   </p>
   <p>
    miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I
   </p>
   <p>
    saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to
   </p>
   <p>
    read and ascertain my fate.  Sometimes I thought that the fiend
   </p>
   <p>
    followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.
   </p>
   <p>
    When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment,
   </p>
   <p>
    but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of
   </p>
   <p>
    his destroyer.  I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the
   </p>
   <p>
    consciousness of which haunted me.  I was guiltless, but I had indeed
   </p>
   <p>
    drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.
   </p>
   <p>
    I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might
   </p>
   <p>
    have interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well
   </p>
   <p>
    as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.
   </p>
   <p>
    But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic
   </p>
   <p>
    castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur’s
   </p>
   <p>
    Seat, St. Bernard’s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for
   </p>
   <p>
    the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was
   </p>
   <p>
    impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.
   </p>
   <p>
    We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew’s, and
   </p>
   <p>
    along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.
   </p>
   <p>
    But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into
   </p>
   <p>
    their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and
   </p>
   <p>
    accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland
   </p>
   <p>
    alone.  “Do you,” said I, “enjoy yourself, and let this be our
   </p>
   <p>
    rendezvous.  I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with
   </p>
   <p>
    my motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short
   </p>
   <p>
    time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more
   </p>
   <p>
    congenial to your own temper.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to
   </p>
   <p>
    remonstrate.  He entreated me to write often.  “I had rather be with
   </p>
   <p>
    you,” he said, “in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch
   </p>
   <p>
    people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear  friend, to return,
   </p>
   <p>
    that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in
   </p>
   <p>
    your absence.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of
   </p>
   <p>
    Scotland and finish my work in solitude. I did not doubt but that the
   </p>
   <p>
    monster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have
   </p>
   <p>
    finished, that he might receive his companion.
   </p>
   <p>
    With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of
   </p>
   <p>
    the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours. It was a place
   </p>
   <p>
    fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were
   </p>
   <p>
    continually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely
   </p>
   <p>
    affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its
   </p>
   <p>
    inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs
   </p>
   <p>
    gave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they
   </p>
   <p>
    indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from
   </p>
   <p>
    the mainland, which was about five miles distant.
   </p>
   <p>
    On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of
   </p>
   <p>
    these was vacant when I arrived.  This I hired.  It contained but two
   </p>
   <p>
    rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable
   </p>
   <p>
    penury.  The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    door was off its hinges.  I ordered it to be repaired, bought some
   </p>
   <p>
    furniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have
   </p>
   <p>
    occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been
   </p>
   <p>
    benumbed by want and squalid poverty.  As it was, I lived ungazed at
   </p>
   <p>
    and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes
   </p>
   <p>
    which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations
   </p>
   <p>
    of men.
   </p>
   <p>
    In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,
   </p>
   <p>
    when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to
   </p>
   <p>
    listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet.  It was a
   </p>
   <p>
    monotonous yet ever-changing scene.  I thought of Switzerland; it was
   </p>
   <p>
    far different from this desolate and appalling landscape.  Its hills
   </p>
   <p>
    are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the
   </p>
   <p>
    plains.  Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when
   </p>
   <p>
    troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively
   </p>
   <p>
    infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.
   </p>
   <p>
    In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but
   </p>
   <p>
    as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and
   </p>
   <p>
    irksome to me.  Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my
   </p>
   <p>
    laboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night
   </p>
   <p>
    in order to complete my work.  It was, indeed, a filthy process in
   </p>
   <p>
    which I was engaged.  During my first experiment, a kind of
   </p>
   <p>
    enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my
   </p>
   <p>
    mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes
   </p>
   <p>
    were shut to the horror of my proceedings.  But now I went to it in
   </p>
   <p>
    cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in
   </p>
   <p>
    a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from
   </p>
   <p>
    the actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I
   </p>
   <p>
    grew restless and nervous.  Every moment I feared to meet my
   </p>
   <p>
    persecutor.  Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing
   </p>
   <p>
    to raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much
   </p>
   <p>
    dreaded to behold.  I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow
   </p>
   <p>
    creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably
   </p>
   <p>
    advanced.  I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager
   </p>
   <p>
    hope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was
   </p>
   <p>
    intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken
   </p>
   <p>
    in my bosom.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 20
   </p>
   <p>
    I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just
   </p>
   <p>
    rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my
   </p>
   <p>
    labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention
   </p>
   <p>
    to it. As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to
   </p>
   <p>
    consider the effects of what I was now doing. Three years before, I was
   </p>
   <p>
    engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled
   </p>
   <p>
    barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest
   </p>
   <p>
    remorse. I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was
   </p>
   <p>
    alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her
   </p>
   <p>
    mate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had
   </p>
   <p>
    sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she
   </p>
   <p>
    had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and
   </p>
   <p>
    reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her
   </p>
   <p>
    creation. They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived
   </p>
   <p>
    loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence
   </p>
   <p>
    for it when it came before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn
   </p>
   <p>
    with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him,
   </p>
   <p>
    and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being
   </p>
   <p>
    deserted by one of his own species.
   </p>
   <p>
    Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world,
   </p>
   <p>
    yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmon
   </p>
   <p>
    thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon
   </p>
   <p>
    the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a
   </p>
   <p>
    condition precarious and full of terror. Had I right, for my own benefit,
   </p>
   <p>
    to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? I had before been moved
   </p>
   <p>
    by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by
   </p>
   <p>
    his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my
   </p>
   <p>
    promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me
   </p>
   <p>
    as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at
   </p>
   <p>
    the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.
   </p>
   <p>
    I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by
   </p>
   <p>
    the light of the moon the dæmon at the casement.  A ghastly grin
   </p>
   <p>
    wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task
   </p>
   <p>
    which he had allotted to me.  Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he
   </p>
   <p>
    had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide
   </p>
   <p>
    and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the
   </p>
   <p>
    fulfilment of my promise.
   </p>
   <p>
    As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of
   </p>
   <p>
    malice and treachery.  I thought with a sensation of madness on my
   </p>
   <p>
    promise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion,
   </p>
   <p>
    tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged.  The wretch saw me
   </p>
   <p>
    destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for
   </p>
   <p>
    happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.
   </p>
   <p>
    I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own
   </p>
   <p>
    heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I
   </p>
   <p>
    sought my own apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate
   </p>
   <p>
    the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most
   </p>
   <p>
    terrible reveries.
   </p>
   <p>
    Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea;
   </p>
   <p>
    it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature
   </p>
   <p>
    reposed under the eye of the quiet moon.  A few fishing vessels alone
   </p>
   <p>
    specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound
   </p>
   <p>
    of voices as the fishermen called to one another.  I felt the silence,
   </p>
   <p>
    although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear
   </p>
   <p>
    was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a
   </p>
   <p>
    person landed close to my house.
   </p>
   <p>
    In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one
   </p>
   <p>
    endeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a
   </p>
   <p>
    presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who
   </p>
   <p>
    dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation
   </p>
   <p>
    of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain
   </p>
   <p>
    endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.
   </p>
   <p>
    Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door
   </p>
   <p>
    opened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he
   </p>
   <p>
    approached me and said in a smothered voice,
   </p>
   <p>
    “You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you
   </p>
   <p>
    intend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured toil and misery;
   </p>
   <p>
    I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among
   </p>
   <p>
    its willow islands and over the summits of its hills. I have dwelt many
   </p>
   <p>
    months in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland. I have
   </p>
   <p>
    endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my
   </p>
   <p>
    hopes?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Begone!  I do break my promise; never will I create another like
   </p>
   <p>
    yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself
   </p>
   <p>
    unworthy of my condescension.  Remember that I have power; you believe
   </p>
   <p>
    yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of
   </p>
   <p>
    day will be hateful to you.  You are my creator, but I am your master;
   </p>
   <p>
    obey!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is
   </p>
   <p>
    arrived.  Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but
   </p>
   <p>
    they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in
   </p>
   <p>
    vice.  Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a dæmon whose
   </p>
   <p>
    delight is in death and wretchedness?  Begone!  I am firm, and your
   </p>
   <p>
    words will only exasperate my rage.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the
   </p>
   <p>
    impotence of anger. “Shall each man,” cried he, “find a
   </p>
   <p>
    wife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone? I had
   </p>
   <p>
    feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.
   </p>
   <p>
    Man! You may hate, but beware! Your hours will pass in dread and misery,
   </p>
   <p>
    and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for
   </p>
   <p>
    ever. Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my
   </p>
   <p>
    wretchedness? You can blast my other passions, but revenge
   </p>
   <p>
    remains—revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die, but
   </p>
   <p>
    first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your
   </p>
   <p>
    misery. Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful. I will watch with
   </p>
   <p>
    the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall
   </p>
   <p>
    repent of the injuries you inflict.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend
   </p>
   <p>
    beneath words.  Leave me; I am inexorable.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It is well.  I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your
   </p>
   <p>
    wedding-night.”
   </p>
   <p>
    I started forward and exclaimed, “Villain!  Before you sign my
   </p>
   <p>
    death-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.”
   </p>
   <p>
    I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with
   </p>
   <p>
    precipitation.  In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot
   </p>
   <p>
    across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the
   </p>
   <p>
    waves.
   </p>
   <p>
    All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears. I burned with rage to
   </p>
   <p>
    pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean. I
   </p>
   <p>
    walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination
   </p>
   <p>
    conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me. Why had I not
   </p>
   <p>
    followed him and closed with him in mortal strife? But I had suffered him
   </p>
   <p>
    to depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland. I shuddered
   </p>
   <p>
    to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.
   </p>
   <p>
    And then I thought again of his words—“_I will be with you on
   </p>
   <p>
    your wedding-night._” That, then, was the period fixed for the
   </p>
   <p>
    fulfilment of my destiny. In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and
   </p>
   <p>
    extinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I
   </p>
   <p>
    thought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she
   </p>
   <p>
    should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I
   </p>
   <p>
    had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall
   </p>
   <p>
    before my enemy without a bitter struggle.
   </p>
   <p>
    The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became
   </p>
   <p>
    calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into
   </p>
   <p>
    the depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last
   </p>
   <p>
    night’s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I
   </p>
   <p>
    almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow
   </p>
   <p>
    creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. I
   </p>
   <p>
    desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true,
   </p>
   <p>
    but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to
   </p>
   <p>
    be sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a
   </p>
   <p>
    dæmon whom I had myself created.
   </p>
   <p>
    I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it
   </p>
   <p>
    loved and miserable in the separation.  When it became noon, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep
   </p>
   <p>
    sleep.  I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves
   </p>
   <p>
    were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery.  The sleep
   </p>
   <p>
    into which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as
   </p>
   <p>
    if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to
   </p>
   <p>
    reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the
   </p>
   <p>
    words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared
   </p>
   <p>
    like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.
   </p>
   <p>
    The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my
   </p>
   <p>
    appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a
   </p>
   <p>
    fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;
   </p>
   <p>
    it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to
   </p>
   <p>
    join him.  He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where
   </p>
   <p>
    he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired
   </p>
   <p>
    his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his
   </p>
   <p>
    Indian enterprise.  He could not any longer delay his departure; but as
   </p>
   <p>
    his journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now
   </p>
   <p>
    conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of
   </p>
   <p>
    my society on him as I could spare.  He besought me, therefore, to
   </p>
   <p>
    leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed
   </p>
   <p>
    southwards together.  This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and
   </p>
   <p>
    I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered
   </p>
   <p>
    to reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I
   </p>
   <p>
    must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must
   </p>
   <p>
    handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. The next
   </p>
   <p>
    morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door
   </p>
   <p>
    of my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had
   </p>
   <p>
    destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had
   </p>
   <p>
    mangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself and
   </p>
   <p>
    then entered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments
   </p>
   <p>
    out of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my
   </p>
   <p>
    work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly
   </p>
   <p>
    put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them
   </p>
   <p>
    up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the
   </p>
   <p>
    meantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my
   </p>
   <p>
    chemical apparatus.
   </p>
   <p>
    Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place
   </p>
   <p>
    in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon.  I had
   </p>
   <p>
    before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with
   </p>
   <p>
    whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film
   </p>
   <p>
    had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw
   </p>
   <p>
    clearly.  The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur
   </p>
   <p>
    to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not
   </p>
   <p>
    reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it.  I had resolved in
   </p>
   <p>
    my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made
   </p>
   <p>
    would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different
   </p>
   <p>
    conclusion.
   </p>
   <p>
    Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my
   </p>
   <p>
    basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.
   </p>
   <p>
    The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land,
   </p>
   <p>
    but I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a
   </p>
   <p>
    dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my
   </p>
   <p>
    fellow creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was
   </p>
   <p>
    suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of
   </p>
   <p>
    darkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound
   </p>
   <p>
    as it sank and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded, but
   </p>
   <p>
    the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then
   </p>
   <p>
    rising. But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations
   </p>
   <p>
    that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a
   </p>
   <p>
    direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the
   </p>
   <p>
    moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its
   </p>
   <p>
    keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I
   </p>
   <p>
    slept soundly.
   </p>
   <p>
    I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I
   </p>
   <p>
    found that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found
   </p>
   <p>
    that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from
   </p>
   <p>
    which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found
   </p>
   <p>
    that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with
   </p>
   <p>
    water. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. I
   </p>
   <p>
    confess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me
   </p>
   <p>
    and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the
   </p>
   <p>
    world that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into the
   </p>
   <p>
    wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in
   </p>
   <p>
    the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had already
   </p>
   <p>
    been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to
   </p>
   <p>
    my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds
   </p>
   <p>
    that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the
   </p>
   <p>
    sea; it was to be my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your
   </p>
   <p>
    task is already fulfilled!” I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and
   </p>
   <p>
    of Clerval—all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his
   </p>
   <p>
    sanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie so
   </p>
   <p>
    despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of
   </p>
   <p>
    closing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the
   </p>
   <p>
    horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became
   </p>
   <p>
    free from breakers.  But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick
   </p>
   <p>
    and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high
   </p>
   <p>
    land towards the south.
   </p>
   <p>
    Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured
   </p>
   <p>
    for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of
   </p>
   <p>
    warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.
   </p>
   <p>
    How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have
   </p>
   <p>
    of life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a
   </p>
   <p>
    part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a
   </p>
   <p>
    wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived
   </p>
   <p>
    the traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore and found myself
   </p>
   <p>
    suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. I
   </p>
   <p>
    carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at
   </p>
   <p>
    length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state of
   </p>
   <p>
    extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place
   </p>
   <p>
    where I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with
   </p>
   <p>
    me. As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good
   </p>
   <p>
    harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected
   </p>
   <p>
    escape.
   </p>
   <p>
    As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several
   </p>
   <p>
    people crowded towards the spot.  They seemed much surprised at my
   </p>
   <p>
    appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered
   </p>
   <p>
    together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me
   </p>
   <p>
    a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they
   </p>
   <p>
    spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language.  “My
   </p>
   <p>
    good friends,” said I, “will you be so kind as to tell me the name of
   </p>
   <p>
    this town and inform me where I am?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste,
   </p>
   <p>
    but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a
   </p>
   <p>
    stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and
   </p>
   <p>
    angry countenances of his companions.  “Why do you answer me so
   </p>
   <p>
    roughly?”  I replied.  “Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to
   </p>
   <p>
    receive strangers so inhospitably.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the
   </p>
   <p>
    English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.”
   </p>
   <p>
    While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly
   </p>
   <p>
    increase. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which
   </p>
   <p>
    annoyed and in some degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn, but
   </p>
   <p>
    no one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the
   </p>
   <p>
    crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man
   </p>
   <p>
    approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Come, sir, you must
   </p>
   <p>
    follow me to Mr. Kirwin’s to give an account of yourself.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Who is Mr. Kirwin?  Why am I to give an account of myself?  Is not
   </p>
   <p>
    this a free country?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks.  Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate,
   </p>
   <p>
    and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was
   </p>
   <p>
    found murdered here last night.”
   </p>
   <p>
    This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent;
   </p>
   <p>
    that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence
   </p>
   <p>
    and was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from
   </p>
   <p>
    fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic
   </p>
   <p>
    to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into
   </p>
   <p>
    apprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that
   </p>
   <p>
    was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair
   </p>
   <p>
    all fear of ignominy or death.
   </p>
   <p>
    I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of
   </p>
   <p>
    the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my
   </p>
   <p>
    recollection.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 21
   </p>
   <p>
    I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old
   </p>
   <p>
    benevolent man with calm and mild manners.  He looked upon me, however,
   </p>
   <p>
    with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,
   </p>
   <p>
    he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.
   </p>
   <p>
    About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the
   </p>
   <p>
    magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with
   </p>
   <p>
    his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o’clock,
   </p>
   <p>
    they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in
   </p>
   <p>
    for port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did
   </p>
   <p>
    not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about
   </p>
   <p>
    two miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,
   </p>
   <p>
    and his companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding
   </p>
   <p>
    along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his
   </p>
   <p>
    length on the ground. His companions came up to assist him, and by the
   </p>
   <p>
    light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man,
   </p>
   <p>
    who was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition was that it was the
   </p>
   <p>
    corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the
   </p>
   <p>
    waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even
   </p>
   <p>
    that the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage
   </p>
   <p>
    of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it
   </p>
   <p>
    to life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty
   </p>
   <p>
    years of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of
   </p>
   <p>
    any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.
   </p>
   <p>
    The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but
   </p>
   <p>
    when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of
   </p>
   <p>
    my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a
   </p>
   <p>
    mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for
   </p>
   <p>
    support.  The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew
   </p>
   <p>
    an unfavourable augury from my manner.
   </p>
   <p>
    The son confirmed his father’s account, but when Daniel Nugent was
   </p>
   <p>
    called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he
   </p>
   <p>
    saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;
   </p>
   <p>
    and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same
   </p>
   <p>
    boat in which I had just landed.
   </p>
   <p>
    A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door
   </p>
   <p>
    of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour
   </p>
   <p>
    before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with
   </p>
   <p>
    only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse
   </p>
   <p>
    was afterwards found.
   </p>
   <p>
    Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the
   </p>
   <p>
    body into her house; it was not cold.  They put it into a bed and
   </p>
   <p>
    rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was
   </p>
   <p>
    quite gone.
   </p>
   <p>
    Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed
   </p>
   <p>
    that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it
   </p>
   <p>
    was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been
   </p>
   <p>
    obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.
   </p>
   <p>
    Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body
   </p>
   <p>
    from another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know
   </p>
   <p>
    the shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance
   </p>
   <p>
    of the town of —— from the place where I had deposited the corpse.
   </p>
   <p>
    Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into
   </p>
   <p>
    the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what
   </p>
   <p>
    effect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably
   </p>
   <p>
    suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the
   </p>
   <p>
    murder had been described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate
   </p>
   <p>
    and several other persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by the
   </p>
   <p>
    strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but,
   </p>
   <p>
    knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had
   </p>
   <p>
    inhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly
   </p>
   <p>
    tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.
   </p>
   <p>
    I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. How
   </p>
   <p>
    can I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with
   </p>
   <p>
    horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and
   </p>
   <p>
    agony. The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses,
   </p>
   <p>
    passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry
   </p>
   <p>
    Clerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on
   </p>
   <p>
    the body, I exclaimed, “Have my murderous machinations deprived you
   </p>
   <p>
    also, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I have already destroyed; other
   </p>
   <p>
    victims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my
   </p>
   <p>
    benefactor—”
   </p>
   <p>
    The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and
   </p>
   <p>
    I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.
   </p>
   <p>
    A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death; my
   </p>
   <p>
    ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the
   </p>
   <p>
    murderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my
   </p>
   <p>
    attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was
   </p>
   <p>
    tormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping
   </p>
   <p>
    my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke
   </p>
   <p>
    my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and
   </p>
   <p>
    bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.
   </p>
   <p>
    Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not
   </p>
   <p>
    sink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming
   </p>
   <p>
    children, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and
   </p>
   <p>
    youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I
   </p>
   <p>
    made that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of
   </p>
   <p>
    the wheel, continually renewed the torture?
   </p>
   <p>
    But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from
   </p>
   <p>
    a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by
   </p>
   <p>
    gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had
   </p>
   <p>
    forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some
   </p>
   <p>
    great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around
   </p>
   <p>
    and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I
   </p>
   <p>
    was, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.
   </p>
   <p>
    This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside
   </p>
   <p>
    me.  She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her
   </p>
   <p>
    countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise
   </p>
   <p>
    that class.  The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of
   </p>
   <p>
    persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. Her
   </p>
   <p>
    tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Are you better now, sir?” said she.
   </p>
   <p>
    I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am;
   </p>
   <p>
    but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am
   </p>
   <p>
    still alive to feel this misery and horror.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “For that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about the
   </p>
   <p>
    gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you
   </p>
   <p>
    were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you!  However, that’s none
   </p>
   <p>
    of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty
   </p>
   <p>
    with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.”
   </p>
   <p>
    I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a
   </p>
   <p>
    speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt
   </p>
   <p>
    languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed.  The whole series
   </p>
   <p>
    of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it
   </p>
   <p>
    were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force
   </p>
   <p>
    of reality.
   </p>
   <p>
    As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew
   </p>
   <p>
    feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed
   </p>
   <p>
    me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me.  The
   </p>
   <p>
    physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared
   </p>
   <p>
    them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the
   </p>
   <p>
    second.  Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the
   </p>
   <p>
    hangman who would gain his fee?
   </p>
   <p>
    These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had
   </p>
   <p>
    shown me extreme kindness.  He had caused the best room in the prison
   </p>
   <p>
    to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who
   </p>
   <p>
    had provided a physician and a nurse.  It is true, he seldom came to
   </p>
   <p>
    see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of
   </p>
   <p>
    every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and
   </p>
   <p>
    miserable ravings of a murderer.  He came, therefore, sometimes to see
   </p>
   <p>
    that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long
   </p>
   <p>
    intervals.
   </p>
   <p>
    One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes
   </p>
   <p>
    half open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gloom
   </p>
   <p>
    and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to
   </p>
   <p>
    remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I
   </p>
   <p>
    considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the
   </p>
   <p>
    penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my
   </p>
   <p>
    thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.
   </p>
   <p>
    His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to
   </p>
   <p>
    mine and addressed me in French,
   </p>
   <p>
    “I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to
   </p>
   <p>
    make you more comfortable?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole
   </p>
   <p>
    earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to
   </p>
   <p>
    one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune.  But you will, I
   </p>
   <p>
    hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can
   </p>
   <p>
    easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become
   </p>
   <p>
    the most miserable of mortals.  Persecuted and tortured as I am and
   </p>
   <p>
    have been, can death be any evil to me?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the
   </p>
   <p>
    strange chances that have lately occurred.  You were thrown, by some
   </p>
   <p>
    surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,
   </p>
   <p>
    seized immediately, and charged with murder.  The first sight that was
   </p>
   <p>
    presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so
   </p>
   <p>
    unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across
   </p>
   <p>
    your path.”
   </p>
   <p>
    As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on
   </p>
   <p>
    this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at
   </p>
   <p>
    the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me.  I suppose some
   </p>
   <p>
    astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened
   </p>
   <p>
    to say,
   </p>
   <p>
    “Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on
   </p>
   <p>
    your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some
   </p>
   <p>
    trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune
   </p>
   <p>
    and illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one which I
   </p>
   <p>
    discovered from its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote
   </p>
   <p>
    to Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.
   </p>
   <p>
    But you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any
   </p>
   <p>
    kind.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event;
   </p>
   <p>
    tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am
   </p>
   <p>
    now to lament?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Your family is perfectly well,” said Mr. Kirwin with
   </p>
   <p>
    gentleness; “and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it
   </p>
   <p>
    instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my
   </p>
   <p>
    misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for
   </p>
   <p>
    me to comply with his hellish desires.  I put my hand before my eyes,
   </p>
   <p>
    and cried out in agony,
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh! Take him away! I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do not
   </p>
   <p>
    let him enter!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance.  He could not help
   </p>
   <p>
    regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in
   </p>
   <p>
    rather a severe tone,
   </p>
   <p>
    “I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father
   </p>
   <p>
    would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “My father!” cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed
   </p>
   <p>
    from anguish to pleasure.  “Is my father indeed come?  How kind, how
   </p>
   <p>
    very kind!  But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?”
   </p>
   <p>
    My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he
   </p>
   <p>
    thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium,
   </p>
   <p>
    and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence.  He rose and
   </p>
   <p>
    quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the
   </p>
   <p>
    arrival of my father. I stretched out my hand to him and cried,
   </p>
   <p>
    “Are you then safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest?”
   </p>
   <p>
    My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by
   </p>
   <p>
    dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my
   </p>
   <p>
    desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of
   </p>
   <p>
    cheerfulness. “What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!”
   </p>
   <p>
    said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance
   </p>
   <p>
    of the room. “You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems
   </p>
   <p>
    to pursue you. And poor Clerval—”
   </p>
   <p>
    The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too
   </p>
   <p>
    great to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Alas! Yes, my father,” replied I; “some destiny of the
   </p>
   <p>
    most horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I
   </p>
   <p>
    should have died on the coffin of Henry.”
   </p>
   <p>
    We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the
   </p>
   <p>
    precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that
   </p>
   <p>
    could ensure tranquillity.  Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my
   </p>
   <p>
    strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion.  But the
   </p>
   <p>
    appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    gradually recovered my health.
   </p>
   <p>
    As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black
   </p>
   <p>
    melancholy that nothing could dissipate.  The image of Clerval was
   </p>
   <p>
    for ever before me, ghastly and murdered.  More than once the agitation
   </p>
   <p>
    into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous
   </p>
   <p>
    relapse.  Alas!  Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a
   </p>
   <p>
    life?  It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now
   </p>
   <p>
    drawing to a close.  Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these
   </p>
   <p>
    throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears
   </p>
   <p>
    me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also
   </p>
   <p>
    sink to rest.  Then the appearance of death was distant, although the
   </p>
   <p>
    wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours
   </p>
   <p>
    motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that
   </p>
   <p>
    might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.
   </p>
   <p>
    The season of the assizes approached.  I had already been three months
   </p>
   <p>
    in prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a
   </p>
   <p>
    relapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country
   </p>
   <p>
    town where the court was held.  Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every
   </p>
   <p>
    care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence.  I was spared
   </p>
   <p>
    the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not
   </p>
   <p>
    brought before the court that decides on life and death.  The grand
   </p>
   <p>
    jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney
   </p>
   <p>
    Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight
   </p>
   <p>
    after my removal I was liberated from prison.
   </p>
   <p>
    My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a
   </p>
   <p>
    criminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh
   </p>
   <p>
    atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country.  I did not
   </p>
   <p>
    participate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a
   </p>
   <p>
    palace were alike hateful.  The cup of life was poisoned for ever, and
   </p>
   <p>
    although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I
   </p>
   <p>
    saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by
   </p>
   <p>
    no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me.  Sometimes
   </p>
   <p>
    they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark
   </p>
   <p>
    orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed
   </p>
   <p>
    them; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I
   </p>
   <p>
    first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.
   </p>
   <p>
    My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection.  He talked
   </p>
   <p>
    of Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but
   </p>
   <p>
    these words only drew deep groans from me.  Sometimes, indeed, I felt a
   </p>
   <p>
    wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved
   </p>
   <p>
    cousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more
   </p>
   <p>
    the blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early
   </p>
   <p>
    childhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a
   </p>
   <p>
    prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and
   </p>
   <p>
    these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and
   </p>
   <p>
    despair.  At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the
   </p>
   <p>
    existence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance
   </p>
   <p>
    to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally
   </p>
   <p>
    triumphed over my selfish despair.  It was necessary that I should
   </p>
   <p>
    return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those
   </p>
   <p>
    I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any
   </p>
   <p>
    chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to
   </p>
   <p>
    blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to
   </p>
   <p>
    the existence of the monstrous image which  I had endued with the
   </p>
   <p>
    mockery of a soul still more monstrous.  My father still desired to
   </p>
   <p>
    delay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a
   </p>
   <p>
    journey, for I was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being.  My
   </p>
   <p>
    strength was gone.  I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day
   </p>
   <p>
    preyed upon my wasted frame.
   </p>
   <p>
    Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience,
   </p>
   <p>
    my father thought it best to yield. We took our passage on board a vessel
   </p>
   <p>
    bound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was midnight. I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to
   </p>
   <p>
    the dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my
   </p>
   <p>
    sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should
   </p>
   <p>
    soon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;
   </p>
   <p>
    yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested
   </p>
   <p>
    shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly
   </p>
   <p>
    that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest
   </p>
   <p>
    companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I
   </p>
   <p>
    repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing
   </p>
   <p>
    with my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for
   </p>
   <p>
    Ingolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on
   </p>
   <p>
    to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in
   </p>
   <p>
    which he first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a
   </p>
   <p>
    thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.
   </p>
   <p>
    Ever since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of taking
   </p>
   <p>
    every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug
   </p>
   <p>
    only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of
   </p>
   <p>
    life. Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now
   </p>
   <p>
    swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did
   </p>
   <p>
    not afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a
   </p>
   <p>
    thousand objects that scared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kind
   </p>
   <p>
    of nightmare; I felt the fiend’s grasp in my neck and could not free
   </p>
   <p>
    myself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. My father, who was
   </p>
   <p>
    watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves
   </p>
   <p>
    were around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of
   </p>
   <p>
    security, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour
   </p>
   <p>
    and the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm
   </p>
   <p>
    forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly
   </p>
   <p>
    susceptible.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 22
   </p>
   <p>
    The voyage came to an end.  We landed, and proceeded to Paris.  I soon
   </p>
   <p>
    found that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I
   </p>
   <p>
    could continue my journey.  My father’s care and attentions were
   </p>
   <p>
    indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and
   </p>
   <p>
    sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill.  He wished me to
   </p>
   <p>
    seek amusement in society.  I abhorred the face of man.  Oh, not
   </p>
   <p>
    abhorred!  They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt
   </p>
   <p>
    attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an
   </p>
   <p>
    angelic nature and celestial mechanism.  But I felt that I had no right
   </p>
   <p>
    to share their intercourse.  I had unchained an enemy among them whose
   </p>
   <p>
    joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans.  How they
   </p>
   <p>
    would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know
   </p>
   <p>
    my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!
   </p>
   <p>
    My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by
   </p>
   <p>
    various arguments to banish my despair.  Sometimes he thought that I
   </p>
   <p>
    felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of
   </p>
   <p>
    murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Alas!  My father,” said I, “how little do you know me.
   </p>
   <p>
    Human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such
   </p>
   <p>
    a wretch as I felt pride.  Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent
   </p>
   <p>
    as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause
   </p>
   <p>
    of this—I murdered her.  William, Justine, and Henry—they all
   </p>
   <p>
    died by my hands.”
   </p>
   <p>
    My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same
   </p>
   <p>
    assertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an
   </p>
   <p>
    explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of
   </p>
   <p>
    delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented
   </p>
   <p>
    itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my
   </p>
   <p>
    convalescence. I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence
   </p>
   <p>
    concerning the wretch I had created. I had a persuasion that I should be
   </p>
   <p>
    supposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue. But,
   </p>
   <p>
    besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my
   </p>
   <p>
    hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of
   </p>
   <p>
    his breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was
   </p>
   <p>
    silent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably
   </p>
   <p>
    from me. I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part
   </p>
   <p>
    relieved the burden of my mysterious woe.
   </p>
   <p>
    Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder,
   </p>
   <p>
    “My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this? My dear son, I entreat
   </p>
   <p>
    you never to make such an assertion again.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who
   </p>
   <p>
    have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth.  I am the
   </p>
   <p>
    assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations.
   </p>
   <p>
    A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have
   </p>
   <p>
    saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not
   </p>
   <p>
    sacrifice the whole human race.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were
   </p>
   <p>
    deranged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and
   </p>
   <p>
    endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts.  He wished as much as
   </p>
   <p>
    possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in
   </p>
   <p>
    Ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my
   </p>
   <p>
    misfortunes.
   </p>
   <p>
    As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my
   </p>
   <p>
    heart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own
   </p>
   <p>
    crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them.  By the utmost
   </p>
   <p>
    self-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners
   </p>
   <p>
    were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey
   </p>
   <p>
    to the sea of ice.
   </p>
   <p>
    A few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received the
   </p>
   <p>
    following letter from Elizabeth:
   </p>
   <p>
    “My dear Friend,
   </p>
   <p>
    “It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle
   </p>
   <p>
    dated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may
   </p>
   <p>
    hope to see you in less than a fortnight.  My poor cousin, how much you
   </p>
   <p>
    must have suffered!  I expect to see you looking even more ill than
   </p>
   <p>
    when you quitted Geneva.  This winter has been passed most miserably,
   </p>
   <p>
    tortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in
   </p>
   <p>
    your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of
   </p>
   <p>
    comfort and tranquillity.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable
   </p>
   <p>
    a year ago, even perhaps augmented by time.  I would not disturb you at
   </p>
   <p>
    this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a
   </p>
   <p>
    conversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders
   </p>
   <p>
    some explanation necessary before we meet.
   </p>
   <p>
    Explanation! You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain? If
   </p>
   <p>
    you really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied.
   </p>
   <p>
    But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet
   </p>
   <p>
    be pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the
   </p>
   <p>
    case, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I
   </p>
   <p>
    have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of
   </p>
   <p>
    your parents ever since our infancy.  We were told this when young, and
   </p>
   <p>
    taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take
   </p>
   <p>
    place.  We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I
   </p>
   <p>
    believe, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older. But
   </p>
   <p>
    as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each
   </p>
   <p>
    other without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our
   </p>
   <p>
    case?  Tell me, dearest Victor.  Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual
   </p>
   <p>
    happiness, with simple truth—Do you not love another?
   </p>
   <p>
    “You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at
   </p>
   <p>
    Ingolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last
   </p>
   <p>
    autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every
   </p>
   <p>
    creature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our
   </p>
   <p>
    connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of
   </p>
   <p>
    your parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations.
   </p>
   <p>
    But this is false reasoning.  I confess to you, my friend, that I love
   </p>
   <p>
    you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant
   </p>
   <p>
    friend and companion.   But it is your happiness I desire as well as my
   </p>
   <p>
    own when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally
   </p>
   <p>
    miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice.  Even now
   </p>
   <p>
    I weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest
   </p>
   <p>
    misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word _honour_, all hope of that
   </p>
   <p>
    love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself.  I, who
   </p>
   <p>
    have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries
   </p>
   <p>
    tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes.  Ah! Victor, be assured
   </p>
   <p>
    that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be
   </p>
   <p>
    made miserable by this supposition.  Be happy, my friend; and if you
   </p>
   <p>
    obey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth
   </p>
   <p>
    will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the
   </p>
   <p>
    next day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain.  My uncle
   </p>
   <p>
    will send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on your
   </p>
   <p>
    lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I
   </p>
   <p>
    shall need no other happiness.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Elizabeth Lavenza.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Geneva, May 18th, 17—”
   </p>
   <p>
    This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of
   </p>
   <p>
    the fiend—“_I will be with you on your
   </p>
   <p>
    wedding-night!_” Such was my sentence, and on that night would the
   </p>
   <p>
    dæmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of
   </p>
   <p>
    happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings. On that night he
   </p>
   <p>
    had determined to consummate his crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a
   </p>
   <p>
    deadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were
   </p>
   <p>
    victorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end. If he
   </p>
   <p>
    were vanquished, I should be a free man. Alas! What freedom? Such as the
   </p>
   <p>
    peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his
   </p>
   <p>
    cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless,
   </p>
   <p>
    penniless, and alone, but free. Such would be my liberty except that in my
   </p>
   <p>
    Elizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of
   </p>
   <p>
    remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and reread her letter, and some
   </p>
   <p>
    softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal
   </p>
   <p>
    dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    angel’s arm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I would die to make
   </p>
   <p>
    her happy. If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet,
   </p>
   <p>
    again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. My
   </p>
   <p>
    destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer
   </p>
   <p>
    should suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would
   </p>
   <p>
    surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. He had vowed
   </p>
   <p>
    _to be with me on my wedding-night_, yet he did not consider that
   </p>
   <p>
    threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that
   </p>
   <p>
    he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately
   </p>
   <p>
    after the enunciation of his threats. I resolved, therefore, that if my
   </p>
   <p>
    immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my
   </p>
   <p>
    father’s happiness, my adversary’s designs against my life
   </p>
   <p>
    should not retard it a single hour.
   </p>
   <p>
    In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth.  My letter was calm and
   </p>
   <p>
    affectionate.  “I fear, my beloved girl,” I said, “little happiness
   </p>
   <p>
    remains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in
   </p>
   <p>
    you.  Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life
   </p>
   <p>
    and my endeavours for contentment.  I have one secret, Elizabeth, a
   </p>
   <p>
    dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with
   </p>
   <p>
    horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only
   </p>
   <p>
    wonder that I survive what I have endured.  I will confide this tale of
   </p>
   <p>
    misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place,
   </p>
   <p>
    for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us.  But
   </p>
   <p>
    until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it.  This I most
   </p>
   <p>
    earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.”
   </p>
   <p>
    In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth’s letter we returned
   </p>
   <p>
    to Geneva. The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were
   </p>
   <p>
    in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a
   </p>
   <p>
    change in her also. She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly
   </p>
   <p>
    vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of
   </p>
   <p>
    compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I
   </p>
   <p>
    was.
   </p>
   <p>
    The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure. Memory brought madness
   </p>
   <p>
    with it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed
   </p>
   <p>
    me; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and
   </p>
   <p>
    despondent. I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless,
   </p>
   <p>
    bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.
   </p>
   <p>
    Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice
   </p>
   <p>
    would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human
   </p>
   <p>
    feelings when sunk in torpor. She wept with me and for me. When reason
   </p>
   <p>
    returned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with
   </p>
   <p>
    resignation. Ah! It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the
   </p>
   <p>
    guilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is
   </p>
   <p>
    otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.
   </p>
   <p>
    Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with
   </p>
   <p>
    Elizabeth. I remained silent.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Have you, then, some other attachment?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “None on earth.  I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with
   </p>
   <p>
    delight.  Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate
   </p>
   <p>
    myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “My dear Victor, do not speak thus.  Heavy misfortunes have befallen
   </p>
   <p>
    us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love
   </p>
   <p>
    for those whom we have lost to those who yet live.  Our circle will be
   </p>
   <p>
    small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.
   </p>
   <p>
    And when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of
   </p>
   <p>
    care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly
   </p>
   <p>
    deprived.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Such were the lessons of my father.  But to me the remembrance of the
   </p>
   <p>
    threat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had
   </p>
   <p>
    yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as
   </p>
   <p>
    invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words “_I shall be with
   </p>
   <p>
    you on your wedding-night_,” I should regard the threatened fate as
   </p>
   <p>
    unavoidable.  But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were
   </p>
   <p>
    balanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful
   </p>
   <p>
    countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the
   </p>
   <p>
    ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined,
   </p>
   <p>
    the seal to my fate.
   </p>
   <p>
    Great God!  If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish
   </p>
   <p>
    intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself
   </p>
   <p>
    for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over
   </p>
   <p>
    the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage.  But, as if
   </p>
   <p>
    possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real
   </p>
   <p>
    intentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I
   </p>
   <p>
    hastened that of a far dearer victim.
   </p>
   <p>
    As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or
   </p>
   <p>
    a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my
   </p>
   <p>
    feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the
   </p>
   <p>
    countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer
   </p>
   <p>
    eye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union with placid contentment,
   </p>
   <p>
    not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed,
   </p>
   <p>
    that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate
   </p>
   <p>
    into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.
   </p>
   <p>
    Preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received,
   </p>
   <p>
    and all wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my own
   </p>
   <p>
    heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness
   </p>
   <p>
    into the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the
   </p>
   <p>
    decorations of my tragedy. Through my father’s exertions a part of
   </p>
   <p>
    the inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian
   </p>
   <p>
    government. A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her. It
   </p>
   <p>
    was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa
   </p>
   <p>
    Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake
   </p>
   <p>
    near which it stood.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the
   </p>
   <p>
    fiend should openly attack me.  I carried pistols and a dagger
   </p>
   <p>
    constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and
   </p>
   <p>
    by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity.  Indeed, as the
   </p>
   <p>
    period approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be
   </p>
   <p>
    regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for
   </p>
   <p>
    in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed
   </p>
   <p>
    for its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of
   </p>
   <p>
    as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.
   </p>
   <p>
    Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to
   </p>
   <p>
    calm her mind.  But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my
   </p>
   <p>
    destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her;
   </p>
   <p>
    and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had
   </p>
   <p>
    promised to reveal to her on the following day.  My father was in the
   </p>
   <p>
    meantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in
   </p>
   <p>
    the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.
   </p>
   <p>
    After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my
   </p>
   <p>
    father’s, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our
   </p>
   <p>
    journey by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our
   </p>
   <p>
    voyage on the following day.  The day was fair, the wind favourable;
   </p>
   <p>
    all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.
   </p>
   <p>
    Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the
   </p>
   <p>
    feeling of happiness.  We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we
   </p>
   <p>
    were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the
   </p>
   <p>
    beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw
   </p>
   <p>
    Mont Salêve, the pleasant banks of Montalègre, and at a distance,
   </p>
   <p>
    surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy
   </p>
   <p>
    mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the
   </p>
   <p>
    opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the
   </p>
   <p>
    ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost
   </p>
   <p>
    insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.
   </p>
   <p>
    I took the hand of Elizabeth.  “You are sorrowful, my love.  Ah!  If
   </p>
   <p>
    you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would
   </p>
   <p>
    endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this
   </p>
   <p>
    one day at least permits me to enjoy.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied Elizabeth; “there is, I hope,
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not
   </p>
   <p>
    painted in my face, my heart is contented.  Something whispers to me
   </p>
   <p>
    not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I
   </p>
   <p>
    will not listen to such a sinister voice.  Observe how fast we move
   </p>
   <p>
    along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise
   </p>
   <p>
    above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more
   </p>
   <p>
    interesting.  Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in
   </p>
   <p>
    the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at
   </p>
   <p>
    the bottom.  What a divine day!  How happy and serene all nature
   </p>
   <p>
    appears!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all
   </p>
   <p>
    reflection upon melancholy subjects.  But her temper was fluctuating;
   </p>
   <p>
    joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place
   </p>
   <p>
    to distraction and reverie.
   </p>
   <p>
    The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and
   </p>
   <p>
    observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the
   </p>
   <p>
    lower hills.  The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached
   </p>
   <p>
    the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary.  The
   </p>
   <p>
    spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range
   </p>
   <p>
    of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.
   </p>
   <p>
    The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity,
   </p>
   <p>
    sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water
   </p>
   <p>
    and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the
   </p>
   <p>
    shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and
   </p>
   <p>
    hay.  The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched
   </p>
   <p>
    the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp
   </p>
   <p>
    me and cling to me for ever.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 23
   </p>
   <p>
    It was eight o’clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the
   </p>
   <p>
    shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and
   </p>
   <p>
    contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured
   </p>
   <p>
    in darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.
   </p>
   <p>
    The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence
   </p>
   <p>
    in the west.  The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was
   </p>
   <p>
    beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the
   </p>
   <p>
    flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the
   </p>
   <p>
    scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves
   </p>
   <p>
    that were beginning to rise.  Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.
   </p>
   <p>
    I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the
   </p>
   <p>
    shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind.  I was anxious
   </p>
   <p>
    and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in
   </p>
   <p>
    my bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my
   </p>
   <p>
    life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that
   </p>
   <p>
    of my adversary was extinguished.
   </p>
   <p>
    Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence,
   </p>
   <p>
    but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and
   </p>
   <p>
    trembling, she asked, “What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?
   </p>
   <p>
    What is it you fear?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh! Peace, peace, my love,” replied I; “this night, and
   </p>
   <p>
    all will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.”
   </p>
   <p>
    I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how
   </p>
   <p>
    fearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her
   </p>
   <p>
    until I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.
   </p>
   <p>
    She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages
   </p>
   <p>
    of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to
   </p>
   <p>
    my adversary.  But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to
   </p>
   <p>
    conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the
   </p>
   <p>
    execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful
   </p>
   <p>
    scream.  It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired.  As I
   </p>
   <p>
    heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the
   </p>
   <p>
    motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood
   </p>
   <p>
    trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This
   </p>
   <p>
    state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed
   </p>
   <p>
    into the room.
   </p>
   <p>
    Great God! Why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the
   </p>
   <p>
    destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth? She was
   </p>
   <p>
    there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down
   </p>
   <p>
    and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Everywhere I
   </p>
   <p>
    turn I see the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung
   </p>
   <p>
    by the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this and live? Alas!
   </p>
   <p>
    Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment
   </p>
   <p>
    only did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.
   </p>
   <p>
    When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their
   </p>
   <p>
    countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others
   </p>
   <p>
    appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I
   </p>
   <p>
    escaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my
   </p>
   <p>
    wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from the
   </p>
   <p>
    posture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon
   </p>
   <p>
    her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have
   </p>
   <p>
    supposed her asleep. I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but
   </p>
   <p>
    the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held
   </p>
   <p>
    in my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.
   </p>
   <p>
    The murderous mark of the fiend’s grasp was on her neck, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    breath had ceased to issue from her lips.
   </p>
   <p>
    While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.
   </p>
   <p>
    The windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of
   </p>
   <p>
    panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber.
   </p>
   <p>
    The shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be
   </p>
   <p>
    described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.
   </p>
   <p>
    A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his
   </p>
   <p>
    fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards
   </p>
   <p>
    the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me,
   </p>
   <p>
    leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning,
   </p>
   <p>
    plunged into the lake.
   </p>
   <p>
    The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to
   </p>
   <p>
    the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with
   </p>
   <p>
    boats; nets were cast, but in vain.  After passing several hours, we
   </p>
   <p>
    returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a
   </p>
   <p>
    form conjured up by my fancy.  After having landed, they proceeded to
   </p>
   <p>
    search the country, parties going in different directions among the
   </p>
   <p>
    woods and vines.
   </p>
   <p>
    I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the
   </p>
   <p>
    house, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken
   </p>
   <p>
    man, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever.  In this state I
   </p>
   <p>
    was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had
   </p>
   <p>
    happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that
   </p>
   <p>
    I had lost.
   </p>
   <p>
    After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room
   </p>
   <p>
    where the corpse of my beloved lay.  There were women weeping around; I
   </p>
   <p>
    hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no
   </p>
   <p>
    distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to
   </p>
   <p>
    various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their
   </p>
   <p>
    cause.  I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror.  The death
   </p>
   <p>
    of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly
   </p>
   <p>
    of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining
   </p>
   <p>
    friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now
   </p>
   <p>
    might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his
   </p>
   <p>
    feet.  This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action.  I started
   </p>
   <p>
    up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.
   </p>
   <p>
    There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the
   </p>
   <p>
    wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it was
   </p>
   <p>
    hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men
   </p>
   <p>
    to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from
   </p>
   <p>
    mental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any
   </p>
   <p>
    exertion. I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way
   </p>
   <p>
    to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were
   </p>
   <p>
    familiar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day
   </p>
   <p>
    before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw
   </p>
   <p>
    the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had
   </p>
   <p>
    then been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as
   </p>
   <p>
    a great and sudden change. The sun might shine or the clouds might lower,
   </p>
   <p>
    but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had
   </p>
   <p>
    snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been
   </p>
   <p>
    so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of
   </p>
   <p>
    man.
   </p>
   <p>
    But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last
   </p>
   <p>
    overwhelming event? Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their
   </p>
   <p>
    _acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know
   </p>
   <p>
    that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My
   </p>
   <p>
    own strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of
   </p>
   <p>
    my hideous narration.
   </p>
   <p>
    I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk
   </p>
   <p>
    under the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old
   </p>
   <p>
    man! His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their
   </p>
   <p>
    delight—his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with
   </p>
   <p>
    all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having
   </p>
   <p>
    few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed
   </p>
   <p>
    be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste
   </p>
   <p>
    in wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated
   </p>
   <p>
    around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to
   </p>
   <p>
    rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.
   </p>
   <p>
    What then became of me?  I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and
   </p>
   <p>
    darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me.  Sometimes,
   </p>
   <p>
    indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales
   </p>
   <p>
    with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a
   </p>
   <p>
    dungeon.  Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear
   </p>
   <p>
    conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my
   </p>
   <p>
    prison.  For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I
   </p>
   <p>
    understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.
   </p>
   <p>
    Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I
   </p>
   <p>
    awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge.  As the
   </p>
   <p>
    memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their
   </p>
   <p>
    cause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable dæmon whom I had
   </p>
   <p>
    sent abroad into the world for my destruction.  I was possessed by a
   </p>
   <p>
    maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed
   </p>
   <p>
    that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal
   </p>
   <p>
    revenge on his cursed head.
   </p>
   <p>
    Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to
   </p>
   <p>
    reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about
   </p>
   <p>
    a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town
   </p>
   <p>
    and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the
   </p>
   <p>
    destroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole
   </p>
   <p>
    authority for the apprehension of the murderer.
   </p>
   <p>
    The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness. “Be
   </p>
   <p>
    assured, sir,” said he, “no pains or exertions on my part shall
   </p>
   <p>
    be spared to discover the villain.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I thank you,” replied I; “listen, therefore, to the
   </p>
   <p>
    deposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange that I
   </p>
   <p>
    should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth
   </p>
   <p>
    which, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to
   </p>
   <p>
    be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.” My
   </p>
   <p>
    manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my
   </p>
   <p>
    own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose
   </p>
   <p>
    quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now related
   </p>
   <p>
    my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with
   </p>
   <p>
    accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.
   </p>
   <p>
    The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued
   </p>
   <p>
    he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with
   </p>
   <p>
    horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted
   </p>
   <p>
    on his countenance.
   </p>
   <p>
    When I had concluded my narration, I said, “This is the being whom I
   </p>
   <p>
    accuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your
   </p>
   <p>
    whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that
   </p>
   <p>
    your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those
   </p>
   <p>
    functions on this occasion.”
   </p>
   <p>
    This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own
   </p>
   <p>
    auditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given
   </p>
   <p>
    to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon
   </p>
   <p>
    to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity
   </p>
   <p>
    returned. He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly afford you
   </p>
   <p>
    every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to
   </p>
   <p>
    have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an
   </p>
   <p>
    animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where
   </p>
   <p>
    no man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since
   </p>
   <p>
    the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he
   </p>
   <p>
    has wandered or what region he may now inhabit.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if
   </p>
   <p>
    he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois
   </p>
   <p>
    and destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do not
   </p>
   <p>
    credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the
   </p>
   <p>
    punishment which is his desert.”
   </p>
   <p>
    As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You are mistaken,” said he. “I will exert myself, and if
   </p>
   <p>
    it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer
   </p>
   <p>
    punishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have
   </p>
   <p>
    yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove
   </p>
   <p>
    impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should
   </p>
   <p>
    make up your mind to disappointment.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail.  My
   </p>
   <p>
    revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I
   </p>
   <p>
    confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul.  My rage
   </p>
   <p>
    is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned
   </p>
   <p>
    loose upon society, still exists.  You refuse my just demand; I have
   </p>
   <p>
    but one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to
   </p>
   <p>
    his destruction.”
   </p>
   <p>
    I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy
   </p>
   <p>
    in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness
   </p>
   <p>
    which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed.  But to a Genevan
   </p>
   <p>
    magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of
   </p>
   <p>
    devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of
   </p>
   <p>
    madness.  He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and
   </p>
   <p>
    reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride of
   </p>
   <p>
    wisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you say.”
   </p>
   <p>
    I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on
   </p>
   <p>
    some other mode of action.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 24
   </p>
   <p>
    My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was
   </p>
   <p>
    swallowed up and lost.  I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone
   </p>
   <p>
    endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and
   </p>
   <p>
    allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise
   </p>
   <p>
    delirium or death would have been my portion.
   </p>
   <p>
    My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I
   </p>
   <p>
    was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became
   </p>
   <p>
    hateful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels
   </p>
   <p>
    which had belonged to my mother, and departed.
   </p>
   <p>
    And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. I have
   </p>
   <p>
    traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships
   </p>
   <p>
    which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. How I
   </p>
   <p>
    have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon
   </p>
   <p>
    the sandy plain and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared
   </p>
   <p>
    not die and leave my adversary in being.
   </p>
   <p>
    When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I
   </p>
   <p>
    might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy.  But my plan was unsettled,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain
   </p>
   <p>
    what path I should pursue.  As night approached I found myself at the
   </p>
   <p>
    entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father
   </p>
   <p>
    reposed.  I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their
   </p>
   <p>
    graves.  Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which
   </p>
   <p>
    were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested
   </p>
   <p>
    observer.  The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to
   </p>
   <p>
    cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the
   </p>
   <p>
    mourner.
   </p>
   <p>
    The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to
   </p>
   <p>
    rage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived,
   </p>
   <p>
    and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass
   </p>
   <p>
    and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, “By the
   </p>
   <p>
    sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the
   </p>
   <p>
    deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery,
   </p>
   <p>
    until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I will
   </p>
   <p>
    preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun
   </p>
   <p>
    and tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering
   </p>
   <p>
    ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed
   </p>
   <p>
    and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now
   </p>
   <p>
    torments me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    I had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me
   </p>
   <p>
    that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but
   </p>
   <p>
    the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.
   </p>
   <p>
    I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish
   </p>
   <p>
    laugh.  It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed
   </p>
   <p>
    it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.
   </p>
   <p>
    Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have
   </p>
   <p>
    destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I
   </p>
   <p>
    was reserved for vengeance.  The laughter died away, when a well-known
   </p>
   <p>
    and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an
   </p>
   <p>
    audible whisper, “I am satisfied, miserable wretch!  You have
   </p>
   <p>
    determined to live, and I am satisfied.”
   </p>
   <p>
    I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil
   </p>
   <p>
    eluded my grasp.  Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone
   </p>
   <p>
    full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than
   </p>
   <p>
    mortal speed.
   </p>
   <p>
    I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task.  Guided by a
   </p>
   <p>
    slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly.  The
   </p>
   <p>
    blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend
   </p>
   <p>
    enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.
   </p>
   <p>
    Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I
   </p>
   <p>
    have ever followed in his track.  Sometimes the peasants, scared by
   </p>
   <p>
    this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself,
   </p>
   <p>
    who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die,
   </p>
   <p>
    left some mark to guide me.  The snows descended on my head, and I saw
   </p>
   <p>
    the print of his huge step on the white plain.  To you first entering
   </p>
   <p>
    on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand
   </p>
   <p>
    what I have felt and still feel?  Cold, want, and fatigue were the
   </p>
   <p>
    least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil
   </p>
   <p>
    and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good
   </p>
   <p>
    followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly
   </p>
   <p>
    extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties.  Sometimes,
   </p>
   <p>
    when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast
   </p>
   <p>
    was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me.  The
   </p>
   <p>
    fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but
   </p>
   <p>
    I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had
   </p>
   <p>
    invoked to aid me.  Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and
   </p>
   <p>
    I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the
   </p>
   <p>
    few drops that revived me, and vanish.
   </p>
   <p>
    I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the dæmon
   </p>
   <p>
    generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the
   </p>
   <p>
    country chiefly collected.  In other places human beings were seldom
   </p>
   <p>
    seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my
   </p>
   <p>
    path.  I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers
   </p>
   <p>
    by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed,
   </p>
   <p>
    which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had
   </p>
   <p>
    provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.
   </p>
   <p>
    My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during
   </p>
   <p>
    sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most
   </p>
   <p>
    miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The
   </p>
   <p>
    spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of
   </p>
   <p>
    happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of
   </p>
   <p>
    this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was
   </p>
   <p>
    sustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my
   </p>
   <p>
    friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent
   </p>
   <p>
    countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth’s
   </p>
   <p>
    voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by
   </p>
   <p>
    a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should
   </p>
   <p>
    come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest
   </p>
   <p>
    friends. What agonising fondness did I feel for them! How did I cling to
   </p>
   <p>
    their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and
   </p>
   <p>
    persuade myself that they still lived! At such moments vengeance, that
   </p>
   <p>
    burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the
   </p>
   <p>
    destruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the
   </p>
   <p>
    mechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the
   </p>
   <p>
    ardent desire of my soul.
   </p>
   <p>
    What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he
   </p>
   <p>
    left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided
   </p>
   <p>
    me and instigated my fury. “My reign is not yet
   </p>
   <p>
    over”—these words were legible in one of these
   </p>
   <p>
    inscriptions—“you live, and my power is complete. Follow me; I
   </p>
   <p>
    seek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of
   </p>
   <p>
    cold and frost, to which I am impassive. You will find near this place, if
   </p>
   <p>
    you follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed. Come on, my
   </p>
   <p>
    enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable
   </p>
   <p>
    hours must you endure until that period shall arrive.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Scoffing devil!  Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee,
   </p>
   <p>
    miserable fiend, to torture and death.  Never will I give up my search
   </p>
   <p>
    until he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my
   </p>
   <p>
    Elizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the
   </p>
   <p>
    reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!
   </p>
   <p>
    As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the
   </p>
   <p>
    cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. The peasants were
   </p>
   <p>
    shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to
   </p>
   <p>
    seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to
   </p>
   <p>
    seek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be
   </p>
   <p>
    procured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.
   </p>
   <p>
    The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One
   </p>
   <p>
    inscription that he left was in these words: “Prepare! Your toils
   </p>
   <p>
    only begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter
   </p>
   <p>
    upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting
   </p>
   <p>
    hatred.”
   </p>
   <p>
    My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I
   </p>
   <p>
    resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support
   </p>
   <p>
    me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts,
   </p>
   <p>
    until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary
   </p>
   <p>
    of the horizon.  Oh!  How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the
   </p>
   <p>
    south!  Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by
   </p>
   <p>
    its superior wildness and ruggedness.  The Greeks wept for joy when
   </p>
   <p>
    they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with
   </p>
   <p>
    rapture the boundary of their toils.  I did not weep, but I knelt down
   </p>
   <p>
    and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in
   </p>
   <p>
    safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary’s gibe,
   </p>
   <p>
    to meet and grapple with him.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus
   </p>
   <p>
    traversed the snows with inconceivable speed.  I know not whether the
   </p>
   <p>
    fiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had
   </p>
   <p>
    daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that
   </p>
   <p>
    when I first saw the ocean he was but one day’s journey in advance, and
   </p>
   <p>
    I hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach.  With new
   </p>
   <p>
    courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched
   </p>
   <p>
    hamlet on the seashore.  I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the
   </p>
   <p>
    fiend and gained accurate information.  A gigantic monster, they said,
   </p>
   <p>
    had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols,
   </p>
   <p>
    putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of
   </p>
   <p>
    his terrific appearance.  He had carried off their store of winter
   </p>
   <p>
    food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a
   </p>
   <p>
    numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same
   </p>
   <p>
    night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his
   </p>
   <p>
    journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they
   </p>
   <p>
    conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the
   </p>
   <p>
    ice or frozen by the eternal  frosts.
   </p>
   <p>
    On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair.
   </p>
   <p>
    He had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless
   </p>
   <p>
    journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few
   </p>
   <p>
    of the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a
   </p>
   <p>
    genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive.  Yet at the idea
   </p>
   <p>
    that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance
   </p>
   <p>
    returned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.
   </p>
   <p>
    After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered
   </p>
   <p>
    round and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.
   </p>
   <p>
    I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of
   </p>
   <p>
    the Frozen Ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I
   </p>
   <p>
    departed from land.
   </p>
   <p>
    I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured
   </p>
   <p>
    misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution
   </p>
   <p>
    burning within my heart could have enabled me to support.  Immense and
   </p>
   <p>
    rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard
   </p>
   <p>
    the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction.  But
   </p>
   <p>
    again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.
   </p>
   <p>
    By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that
   </p>
   <p>
    I had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction
   </p>
   <p>
    of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of
   </p>
   <p>
    despondency and grief from my eyes.  Despair had indeed almost secured
   </p>
   <p>
    her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery.  Once, after
   </p>
   <p>
    the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the
   </p>
   <p>
    summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue,
   </p>
   <p>
    died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye
   </p>
   <p>
    caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain.  I strained my sight to
   </p>
   <p>
    discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I
   </p>
   <p>
    distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known
   </p>
   <p>
    form within.  Oh!  With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!
   </p>
   <p>
    Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might
   </p>
   <p>
    not intercept the view I had of the dæmon; but still my sight was
   </p>
   <p>
    dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that
   </p>
   <p>
    oppressed me, I wept aloud.
   </p>
   <p>
    But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their
   </p>
   <p>
    dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an
   </p>
   <p>
    hour’s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly
   </p>
   <p>
    irksome to me, I continued my route.  The sledge was still visible, nor
   </p>
   <p>
    did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short
   </p>
   <p>
    time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags.  I indeed
   </p>
   <p>
    perceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days’ journey, I
   </p>
   <p>
    beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within
   </p>
   <p>
    me.
   </p>
   <p>
    But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were
   </p>
   <p>
    suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had
   </p>
   <p>
    ever done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as
   </p>
   <p>
    the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous
   </p>
   <p>
    and terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared;
   </p>
   <p>
    and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a
   </p>
   <p>
    tremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished; in a few
   </p>
   <p>
    minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left
   </p>
   <p>
    drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and
   </p>
   <p>
    thus preparing for me a hideous death.
   </p>
   <p>
    In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your
   </p>
   <p>
    vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life.
   </p>
   <p>
    I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded
   </p>
   <p>
    at the sight. I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and
   </p>
   <p>
    by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in
   </p>
   <p>
    the direction of your ship. I had determined, if you were going southwards,
   </p>
   <p>
    still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my
   </p>
   <p>
    purpose. I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue
   </p>
   <p>
    my enemy. But your direction was northwards. You took me on board when my
   </p>
   <p>
    vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied
   </p>
   <p>
    hardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.
   </p>
   <p>
    Oh!  When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the dæmon, allow
   </p>
   <p>
    me the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live?  If I do,
   </p>
   <p>
    swear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him
   </p>
   <p>
    and satisfy my vengeance in his death.  And do I dare to ask of you to
   </p>
   <p>
    undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?
   </p>
   <p>
    No; I am not so selfish.  Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if
   </p>
   <p>
    the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he
   </p>
   <p>
    shall not live—swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated
   </p>
   <p>
    woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes.  He is eloquent
   </p>
   <p>
    and persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but
   </p>
   <p>
    trust him not.  His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery
   </p>
   <p>
    and fiend-like malice.  Hear him not; call on the names of William,
   </p>
   <p>
    Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and
   </p>
   <p>
    thrust your sword into his heart.  I will hover near and direct the
   </p>
   <p>
    steel aright.
   </p>
   <p>
    Walton, _in continuation._
   </p>
   <p>
    August 26th, 17—.
   </p>
   <p>
    You have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not
   </p>
   <p>
    feel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles
   </p>
   <p>
    mine?  Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his
   </p>
   <p>
    tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with
   </p>
   <p>
    difficulty the words so replete with anguish.  His fine and lovely eyes
   </p>
   <p>
    were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow
   </p>
   <p>
    and quenched in infinite wretchedness.  Sometimes he commanded his
   </p>
   <p>
    countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a
   </p>
   <p>
    tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a
   </p>
   <p>
    volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression
   </p>
   <p>
    of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.
   </p>
   <p>
    His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth,
   </p>
   <p>
    yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a
   </p>
   <p>
    greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations,
   </p>
   <p>
    however earnest and connected. Such a monster has, then, really existence!
   </p>
   <p>
    I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I
   </p>
   <p>
    endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his
   </p>
   <p>
    creature’s formation, but on this point he was impenetrable.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Are you mad, my friend?” said he. “Or whither does your
   </p>
   <p>
    senseless curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the
   </p>
   <p>
    world a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! Learn my miseries and do not seek
   </p>
   <p>
    to increase your own.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked
   </p>
   <p>
    to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places,
   </p>
   <p>
    but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held
   </p>
   <p>
    with his enemy. “Since you have preserved my narration,” said
   </p>
   <p>
    he, “I would not that a mutilated one should go down to
   </p>
   <p>
    posterity.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest
   </p>
   <p>
    tale that ever imagination formed.  My thoughts and every feeling of my
   </p>
   <p>
    soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale
   </p>
   <p>
    and his own elevated and gentle manners have created.  I wish to soothe
   </p>
   <p>
    him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of
   </p>
   <p>
    every hope of consolation, to live?  Oh, no!  The only joy that he can
   </p>
   <p>
    now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and
   </p>
   <p>
    death.  Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and
   </p>
   <p>
    delirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his
   </p>
   <p>
    friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or
   </p>
   <p>
    excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his
   </p>
   <p>
    fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a
   </p>
   <p>
    remote world.  This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render
   </p>
   <p>
    them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.
   </p>
   <p>
    Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and
   </p>
   <p>
    misfortunes.  On every point of general literature he displays
   </p>
   <p>
    unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension.  His
   </p>
   <p>
    eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates
   </p>
   <p>
    a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love,
   </p>
   <p>
    without tears.  What a glorious creature must he have been in the days
   </p>
   <p>
    of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin!  He seems
   </p>
   <p>
    to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.
   </p>
   <p>
    “When younger,” said he, “I believed myself destined for
   </p>
   <p>
    some great enterprise. My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness
   </p>
   <p>
    of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of
   </p>
   <p>
    the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed,
   </p>
   <p>
    for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that
   </p>
   <p>
    might be useful to my fellow creatures. When I reflected on the work I had
   </p>
   <p>
    completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational
   </p>
   <p>
    animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But
   </p>
   <p>
    this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now
   </p>
   <p>
    serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes
   </p>
   <p>
    are as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am
   </p>
   <p>
    chained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of
   </p>
   <p>
    analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I
   </p>
   <p>
    conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot
   </p>
   <p>
    recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod
   </p>
   <p>
    heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea
   </p>
   <p>
    of their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty
   </p>
   <p>
    ambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once
   </p>
   <p>
    was, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation. Despondency
   </p>
   <p>
    rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell,
   </p>
   <p>
    never, never again to rise.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Must I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have
   </p>
   <p>
    sought one who would sympathise with and love me. Behold, on these desert
   </p>
   <p>
    seas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his
   </p>
   <p>
    value and lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I thank you, Walton,” he said, “for your kind intentions towards so
   </p>
   <p>
    miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh
   </p>
   <p>
    affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone?  Can any
   </p>
   <p>
    man be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth?  Even
   </p>
   <p>
    where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence,
   </p>
   <p>
    the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our
   </p>
   <p>
    minds which hardly any later friend can obtain.  They know our
   </p>
   <p>
    infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified,
   </p>
   <p>
    are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more
   </p>
   <p>
    certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives.  A sister or a
   </p>
   <p>
    brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early,
   </p>
   <p>
    suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend,
   </p>
   <p>
    however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be
   </p>
   <p>
    contemplated with suspicion.  But I enjoyed friends, dear not only
   </p>
   <p>
    through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever
   </p>
   <p>
    I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of
   </p>
   <p>
    Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and but one
   </p>
   <p>
    feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life.  If I
   </p>
   <p>
    were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive
   </p>
   <p>
    utility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it.  But
   </p>
   <p>
    such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I
   </p>
   <p>
    gave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die.”
   </p>
   <p>
    My beloved Sister,
   </p>
   <p>
    September 2d.
   </p>
   <p>
    I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever
   </p>
   <p>
    doomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit
   </p>
   <p>
    it.  I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and
   </p>
   <p>
    threaten every moment to crush my vessel.  The brave fellows whom I
   </p>
   <p>
    have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have
   </p>
   <p>
    none to bestow.  There is something terribly appalling in our
   </p>
   <p>
    situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me.  Yet it is
   </p>
   <p>
    terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered
   </p>
   <p>
    through me.  If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.
   </p>
   <p>
    And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of my
   </p>
   <p>
    destruction, and you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass, and
   </p>
   <p>
    you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! My
   </p>
   <p>
    beloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is,
   </p>
   <p>
    in prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. But you have a husband
   </p>
   <p>
    and lovely children; you may be happy. Heaven bless you and make you so!
   </p>
   <p>
    My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion.  He
   </p>
   <p>
    endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession
   </p>
   <p>
    which he valued.  He reminds me how often the same accidents have
   </p>
   <p>
    happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite
   </p>
   <p>
    of myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries.  Even the sailors feel
   </p>
   <p>
    the power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he
   </p>
   <p>
    rouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these
   </p>
   <p>
    vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the
   </p>
   <p>
    resolutions of man.  These feelings are transitory; each day of
   </p>
   <p>
    expectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny
   </p>
   <p>
    caused by this despair.
   </p>
   <p>
    September 5th.
   </p>
   <p>
    A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is
   </p>
   <p>
    highly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot
   </p>
   <p>
    forbear recording it.
   </p>
   <p>
    We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger
   </p>
   <p>
    of being crushed in their conflict.  The cold is excessive, and many of
   </p>
   <p>
    my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of
   </p>
   <p>
    desolation.  Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire
   </p>
   <p>
    still glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly
   </p>
   <p>
    roused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent
   </p>
   <p>
    lifelessness.
   </p>
   <p>
    I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny.
   </p>
   <p>
    This morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly—I was roused by half
   </p>
   <p>
    a dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin.  They
   </p>
   <p>
    entered, and their leader addressed me.  He told me that he and his
   </p>
   <p>
    companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation
   </p>
   <p>
    to me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse.
   </p>
   <p>
    We were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they
   </p>
   <p>
    feared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free
   </p>
   <p>
    passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and
   </p>
   <p>
    lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted
   </p>
   <p>
    this.  They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn
   </p>
   <p>
    promise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my
   </p>
   <p>
    course southwards.
   </p>
   <p>
    This speech troubled me.  I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived
   </p>
   <p>
    the idea of returning if set free.  Yet could I, in justice, or even in
   </p>
   <p>
    possibility, refuse this demand?  I hesitated before I answered, when
   </p>
   <p>
    Frankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly
   </p>
   <p>
    to have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled,
   </p>
   <p>
    and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour.  Turning towards the men,
   </p>
   <p>
    he said,
   </p>
   <p>
    “What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you, then,
   </p>
   <p>
    so easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious
   </p>
   <p>
    expedition? “And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was
   </p>
   <p>
    smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and
   </p>
   <p>
    terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth
   </p>
   <p>
    and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and
   </p>
   <p>
    these you were to brave and overcome. For this was it a glorious, for this
   </p>
   <p>
    was it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the
   </p>
   <p>
    benefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men
   </p>
   <p>
    who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. And now,
   </p>
   <p>
    behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first
   </p>
   <p>
    mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content
   </p>
   <p>
    to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and
   </p>
   <p>
    peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm
   </p>
   <p>
    firesides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come
   </p>
   <p>
    thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove
   </p>
   <p>
    yourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your
   </p>
   <p>
    purposes and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your
   </p>
   <p>
    hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it
   </p>
   <p>
    shall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace
   </p>
   <p>
    marked on your brows. Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and
   </p>
   <p>
    who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed
   </p>
   <p>
    in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can
   </p>
   <p>
    you wonder that these men were moved? They looked at one another and were
   </p>
   <p>
    unable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had
   </p>
   <p>
    been said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously
   </p>
   <p>
    desired the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage
   </p>
   <p>
    would return.
   </p>
   <p>
    They retired and I turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and
   </p>
   <p>
    almost deprived of life.
   </p>
   <p>
    How all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than
   </p>
   <p>
    return shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled.  Yet I fear such will be my
   </p>
   <p>
    fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never
   </p>
   <p>
    willingly continue to endure their present hardships.
   </p>
   <p>
    September 7th.
   </p>
   <p>
    The die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not destroyed.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back
   </p>
   <p>
    ignorant and disappointed.  It requires more philosophy than I possess
   </p>
   <p>
    to bear this injustice with patience.
   </p>
   <p>
    September 12th.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is past; I am returning to England.  I have lost my hopes of utility
   </p>
   <p>
    and glory; I have lost my friend.  But I will endeavour to detail these
   </p>
   <p>
    bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted
   </p>
   <p>
    towards England and towards you, I will not despond.
   </p>
   <p>
    September 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard
   </p>
   <p>
    at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction. We were
   </p>
   <p>
    in the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief
   </p>
   <p>
    attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in
   </p>
   <p>
    such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed. The ice cracked
   </p>
   <p>
    behind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from
   </p>
   <p>
    the west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly
   </p>
   <p>
    free. When the sailors saw this and that their return to their native
   </p>
   <p>
    country was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them,
   </p>
   <p>
    loud and long-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the
   </p>
   <p>
    cause of the tumult. “They shout,” I said, “because they
   </p>
   <p>
    will soon return to England.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Do you, then, really return?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Alas!  Yes; I cannot withstand their demands.  I cannot lead them
   </p>
   <p>
    unwillingly to danger, and I must return.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Do so, if you will; but I will not.  You may give up your purpose, but
   </p>
   <p>
    mine is assigned to me by Heaven, and I dare not.  I am weak, but
   </p>
   <p>
    surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with
   </p>
   <p>
    sufficient strength.”  Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the
   </p>
   <p>
    bed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was
   </p>
   <p>
    entirely extinct.  At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with
   </p>
   <p>
    difficulty and was unable to speak.  The surgeon gave him a composing
   </p>
   <p>
    draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the meantime he
   </p>
   <p>
    told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.
   </p>
   <p>
    His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient. I sat
   </p>
   <p>
    by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but
   </p>
   <p>
    presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near,
   </p>
   <p>
    said, “Alas! The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall
   </p>
   <p>
    soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think
   </p>
   <p>
    not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning
   </p>
   <p>
    hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself
   </p>
   <p>
    justified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these last days I
   </p>
   <p>
    have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable.
   </p>
   <p>
    In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was
   </p>
   <p>
    bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and
   </p>
   <p>
    well-being. This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to
   </p>
   <p>
    that. My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to
   </p>
   <p>
    my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or
   </p>
   <p>
    misery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to
   </p>
   <p>
    create a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity
   </p>
   <p>
    and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction
   </p>
   <p>
    beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I
   </p>
   <p>
    know where this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself that he may
   </p>
   <p>
    render no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was
   </p>
   <p>
    mine, but I have failed. When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I
   </p>
   <p>
    asked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now,
   </p>
   <p>
    when I am only induced by reason and virtue.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil
   </p>
   <p>
    this task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have
   </p>
   <p>
    little chance of meeting with him.  But the consideration of these
   </p>
   <p>
    points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I
   </p>
   <p>
    leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near
   </p>
   <p>
    approach of death.  I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I
   </p>
   <p>
    may still be misled by passion.
   </p>
   <p>
    “That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in
   </p>
   <p>
    other respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the
   </p>
   <p>
    only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years.  The forms of
   </p>
   <p>
    the beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms.  Farewell,
   </p>
   <p>
    Walton!  Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it
   </p>
   <p>
    be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in
   </p>
   <p>
    science and discoveries.  Yet why do I say this?  I have myself been
   </p>
   <p>
    blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.”
   </p>
   <p>
    His voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his
   </p>
   <p>
    effort, he sank into silence.  About half an hour afterwards he
   </p>
   <p>
    attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and
   </p>
   <p>
    his eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed
   </p>
   <p>
    away from his lips.
   </p>
   <p>
    Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this
   </p>
   <p>
    glorious spirit?  What can I say that will enable you to understand the
   </p>
   <p>
    depth of my sorrow?  All that I should express would be inadequate and
   </p>
   <p>
    feeble.  My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of
   </p>
   <p>
    disappointment.  But I journey towards England, and I may there find
   </p>
   <p>
    consolation.
   </p>
   <p>
    I am interrupted.  What do these sounds portend?  It is midnight; the
   </p>
   <p>
    breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir.  Again there
   </p>
   <p>
    is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin
   </p>
   <p>
    where the remains of Frankenstein still lie.  I must arise and examine.
   </p>
   <p>
    Good night, my sister.
   </p>
   <p>
    Great God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the
   </p>
   <p>
    remembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail
   </p>
   <p>
    it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this
   </p>
   <p>
    final and wonderful catastrophe.
   </p>
   <p>
    I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable
   </p>
   <p>
    friend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to
   </p>
   <p>
    describe—gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its
   </p>
   <p>
    proportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long
   </p>
   <p>
    locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and
   </p>
   <p>
    apparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my
   </p>
   <p>
    approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung
   </p>
   <p>
    towards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of
   </p>
   <p>
    such loathsome yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily and
   </p>
   <p>
    endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.
   </p>
   <p>
    I called on him to stay.
   </p>
   <p>
    He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the
   </p>
   <p>
    lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and
   </p>
   <p>
    every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some
   </p>
   <p>
    uncontrollable passion.
   </p>
   <p>
    “That is also my victim!” he exclaimed. “In his murder my
   </p>
   <p>
    crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its
   </p>
   <p>
    close! Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does it
   </p>
   <p>
    avail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee
   </p>
   <p>
    by destroying all thou lovedst. Alas! He is cold, he cannot answer
   </p>
   <p>
    me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to
   </p>
   <p>
    me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his
   </p>
   <p>
    enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I
   </p>
   <p>
    approached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his
   </p>
   <p>
    face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I
   </p>
   <p>
    attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster
   </p>
   <p>
    continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I
   </p>
   <p>
    gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Your repentance,” I said, “is now superfluous. If you
   </p>
   <p>
    had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse
   </p>
   <p>
    before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity,
   </p>
   <p>
    Frankenstein would yet have lived.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And do you dream?” said the dæmon.  “Do you think that I was then
   </p>
   <p>
    dead to agony and remorse?  He,” he continued, pointing to the corpse,
   </p>
   <p>
    “he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. Oh!  Not the
   </p>
   <p>
    ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the
   </p>
   <p>
    lingering detail of its execution.  A frightful selfishness hurried me
   </p>
   <p>
    on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse.  Think you that the
   </p>
   <p>
    groans of Clerval were music to my ears?  My heart was fashioned to be
   </p>
   <p>
    susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice
   </p>
   <p>
    and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without
   </p>
   <p>
    torture such as you cannot even imagine.
   </p>
   <p>
    “After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken
   </p>
   <p>
    and overcome.  I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I
   </p>
   <p>
    abhorred myself.  But when I discovered that he, the author at once of
   </p>
   <p>
    my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for
   </p>
   <p>
    happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me
   </p>
   <p>
    he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the
   </p>
   <p>
    indulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter
   </p>
   <p>
    indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished.  I
   </p>
   <p>
    knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the
   </p>
   <p>
    slave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not
   </p>
   <p>
    disobey.  Yet when she died!  Nay, then I was not miserable.  I had
   </p>
   <p>
    cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my
   </p>
   <p>
    despair.  Evil thenceforth became my good.  Urged thus far, I had no
   </p>
   <p>
    choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly
   </p>
   <p>
    chosen.  The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable
   </p>
   <p>
    passion.  And now it is ended; there is my last victim!”
   </p>
   <p>
    I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called
   </p>
   <p>
    to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and
   </p>
   <p>
    persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my
   </p>
   <p>
    friend, indignation was rekindled within me. “Wretch!” I said.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you
   </p>
   <p>
    have made. You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are
   </p>
   <p>
    consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend!
   </p>
   <p>
    If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would
   </p>
   <p>
    he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you
   </p>
   <p>
    feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn
   </p>
   <p>
    from your power.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh, it is not thus—not thus,” interrupted the being.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to
   </p>
   <p>
    be the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.
   </p>
   <p>
    No sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of
   </p>
   <p>
    virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being
   </p>
   <p>
    overflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has
   </p>
   <p>
    become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into
   </p>
   <p>
    bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am
   </p>
   <p>
    content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am
   </p>
   <p>
    well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once
   </p>
   <p>
    my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once
   </p>
   <p>
    I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would
   </p>
   <p>
    love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was
   </p>
   <p>
    nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has
   </p>
   <p>
    degraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no
   </p>
   <p>
    malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over the
   </p>
   <p>
    frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same
   </p>
   <p>
    creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent
   </p>
   <p>
    visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the
   </p>
   <p>
    fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man
   </p>
   <p>
    had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my
   </p>
   <p>
    crimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them
   </p>
   <p>
    he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured
   </p>
   <p>
    wasting in impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did
   </p>
   <p>
    not satisfy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; still
   </p>
   <p>
    I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned.  Was there no
   </p>
   <p>
    injustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all
   </p>
   <p>
    humankind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his
   </p>
   <p>
    friend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic
   </p>
   <p>
    who sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous
   </p>
   <p>
    and immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an
   </p>
   <p>
    abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my
   </p>
   <p>
    blood boils at the recollection of this injustice.
   </p>
   <p>
    “But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and
   </p>
   <p>
    the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to
   </p>
   <p>
    death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have
   </p>
   <p>
    devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and
   </p>
   <p>
    admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that
   </p>
   <p>
    irremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but
   </p>
   <p>
    your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the
   </p>
   <p>
    hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the
   </p>
   <p>
    imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands
   </p>
   <p>
    will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work
   </p>
   <p>
    is nearly complete. Neither yours nor any man’s death is needed to
   </p>
   <p>
    consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done,
   </p>
   <p>
    but it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this
   </p>
   <p>
    sacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me
   </p>
   <p>
    thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall
   </p>
   <p>
    collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its
   </p>
   <p>
    remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would
   </p>
   <p>
    create such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel the
   </p>
   <p>
    agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet
   </p>
   <p>
    unquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no
   </p>
   <p>
    more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no
   </p>
   <p>
    longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks. Light,
   </p>
   <p>
    feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my
   </p>
   <p>
    happiness. Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first
   </p>
   <p>
    opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the
   </p>
   <p>
    rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to
   </p>
   <p>
    me, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by
   </p>
   <p>
    crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in
   </p>
   <p>
    death?
   </p>
   <p>
    “Farewell!  I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive
   </p>
   <p>
    and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better
   </p>
   <p>
    satiated in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou
   </p>
   <p>
    didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness;
   </p>
   <p>
    and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think
   </p>
   <p>
    and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than
   </p>
   <p>
    that which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to
   </p>
   <p>
    thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my
   </p>
   <p>
    wounds until death shall close them for ever.
   </p>
   <p>
    “But soon,” he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, “I
   </p>
   <p>
    shall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon these burning
   </p>
   <p>
    miseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and
   </p>
   <p>
    exult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration
   </p>
   <p>
    will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit
   </p>
   <p>
    will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus.
   </p>
   <p>
    Farewell.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He sprang from the cabin-window as he said this, upon the ice raft
   </p>
   <p>
    which lay close to the vessel.  He was soon borne away by the waves and
   </p>
   <p>
    lost in darkness and distance.
