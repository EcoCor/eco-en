     CHAPTER I.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50">
     It is a matchless morning in rural England. On a fair hill we see a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60">
     majestic pile, the ivied walls and towers of Cholmondeley Castle, huge
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_70">
     relic and witness of the baronial grandeurs of the Middle Ages. This is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_80">
     one of the seats of the Earl of Rossmore, K. G. G. C. B. K. C. M. G.,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_90">
     etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., who possesses twenty-two thousand acres
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_100">
     of English land, owns a parish in London with two thousand houses on its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_110">
     lease-roll, and struggles comfortably along on an income of two hundred
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_120">
     thousand pounds a year. The father and founder of this proud old line
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_130">
     was William the Conqueror his very self; the mother of it was not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_140">
     inventoried in history by name, she being merely a random episode and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_150">
     inconsequential, like the tanner's daughter of Falaise.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_170">
     In a breakfast room of the castle on this breezy fine morning there are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_180">
     two persons and the cooling remains of a deserted meal. One of these
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_190">
     persons is the old lord, tall, erect, square-shouldered, white-haired,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_200">
     stern-browed, a man who shows character in every feature, attitude,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_210">
     and movement, and carries his seventy years as easily as most men carry
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_220">
     fifty. The other person is his only son and heir, a dreamy-eyed young
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_230">
     fellow, who looks about twenty-six but is nearer thirty. Candor,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_240">
     kindliness, honesty, sincerity, simplicity, modesty--it is easy to see
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_250">
     that these are cardinal traits of his character; and so when you have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_260">
     clothed him in the formidable components of his name, you somehow
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_270">
     seem to be contemplating a lamb in armor: his name and style being
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_280">
     the Honourable Kirkcudbright Llanover Marjoribanks Sellers

     Viscount-Berkeley, of Cholmondeley Castle, Warwickshire. (Pronounced

     Warrikshr.) He is standing by a great window, in an attitude suggestive
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_320">
     of respectful attention to what his father is saying and equally
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_330">
     respectful dissent from the positions and arguments offered. The father
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_340">
     walks the floor as he talks, and his talk shows that his temper is away
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_350">
     up toward summer heat.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_370">
     “Soft-spirited as you are, Berkeley, I am quite aware that when you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_380">
     have once made up your mind to do a thing which your ideas of honor and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_390">
     justice require you to do, argument and reason are (for the time being,)
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_400">
     wasted upon you--yes, and ridicule; persuasion, supplication, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_410">
     command as well. To my mind--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_430">
     “Father, if you will look at it without prejudice, without passion, you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_440">
     must concede that I am not doing a rash thing, a thoughtless, wilful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_450">
     thing, with nothing substantial behind it to justify it. I did not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_460">
     create the American claimant to the earldom of Rossmore; I did not hunt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_470">
     for him, did not find him, did not obtrude him upon your notice. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_480">
     found himself, he injected himself into our lives--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_500">
     “And has made mine a purgatory for ten years with his tiresome letters,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_510">
     his wordy reasonings, his acres of tedious evidence,--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_530">
     “Which you would never read, would never consent to read. Yet in common
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_540">
     fairness he was entitled to a hearing. That hearing would either prove
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_550">
     he was the rightful earl--in which case our course would be plain--or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_560">
     it would prove that he wasn't--in which case our course would be equally
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_570">
     plain. I have read his evidences, my lord. I have conned them well,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_580">
     studied them patiently and thoroughly. The chain seems to be complete,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_590">
     no important link wanting. I believe he is the rightful earl.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_610">
     “And I a usurper--a--nameless pauper, a tramp! Consider what you are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_620">
     saying, sir.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_640">
     “Father, if he is the rightful earl, would you, could you--that fact
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_650">
     being established--consent to keep his titles and his properties from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_660">
     him a day, an hour, a minute?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_680">
     “You are talking nonsense--nonsense--lurid idiocy! Now, listen to me. I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_690">
     will make a confession--if you wish to call it by that name. I did not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_700">
     read those evidences because I had no occasion to--I was made familiar
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_710">
     with them in the time of this claimant's father and of my own father
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_720">
     forty years ago. This fellow's predecessors have kept mine more or less
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_730">
     familiar with them for close upon a hundred and fifty years. The truth
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_740">
     is, the rightful heir did go to America, with the Fairfax heir or about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_750">
     the same time--but disappeared--somewhere in the wilds of Virginia, got
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_760">
     married, and began to breed savages for the Claimant market; wrote no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_770">
     letters home; was supposed to be dead; his younger brother softly took
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_780">
     possession; presently the American did die, and straightway his eldest
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_790">
     product put in his claim--by letter--letter still in existence--and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_800">
     died before the uncle in-possession found time--or maybe
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_810">
     inclination--to--answer. The infant son of that eldest product
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_820">
     grew up--long interval, you see--and he took to writing letters and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_830">
     furnishing evidences. Well, successor after successor has done the same,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_840">
     down to the present idiot. It was a succession of paupers; not one of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_850">
     them was ever able to pay his passage to England or institute suit. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_860">
     Fairfaxes kept their lordship alive, and so they have never lost it to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_870">
     this day, although they live in Maryland; their friend lost his by his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_880">
     own neglect. You perceive now, that the facts in this case bring us to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_890">
     precisely this result: morally the American tramp is rightful earl of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_900">
     Rossmore; legally he has no more right than his dog. There now--are you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_910">
     satisfied?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_930">
     There was a pause, then the son glanced at the crest carved in the great
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_940">
     oaken mantel and said, with a regretful note in his voice:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_960">
     “Since the introduction of heraldic symbols,--the motto of this house
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_970">
     has been 'Suum cuique'--to every man his own. By your own intrepidly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_980">
     frank confession, my lord, it is become a sarcasm: If Simon Lathers--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1000">
     “Keep that exasperating name to yourself! For ten years it has pestered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1010">
     my eye--and tortured my ear; till at last my very footfalls time
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1020">
     themselves to the brain-racking rhythm of Simon Lathers!--Simon Lathers!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1030">
     --Simon Lathers! And now, to make its presence in my soul eternal,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1040">
     immortal, imperishable, you have resolved to--to--what is it you have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1050">
     resolved to do?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1070">
     “To go to Simon Lathers, in America, and change places with him.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1090">
     “What? Deliver the reversion of the earldom into his hands?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1110">
     “That is my purpose.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1130">
     “Make this tremendous surrender without even trying the fantastic case
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1140">
     in the Lords?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1160">
     “Ye--s--” with hesitation and some embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1180">
     “By all that is amazing, I believe you are insane, my son. See here
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1190">
     --have you been training with that ass again--that radical, if you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1200">
     prefer the term, though the words are synonymous--Lord Tanzy, of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1210">
     Tollmache?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1230">
     The son did not reply, and the old lord continued:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1250">
     “Yes, you confess. That puppy, that shame to his birth and caste, who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1260">
     holds all hereditary lordships and privilege to be usurpation, all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1270">
     nobility a tinsel sham, all aristocratic institutions a fraud, all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1280">
     inequalities in rank a legalized crime and an infamy, and no bread
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1290">
     honest bread that a man doesn't earn by his own work--work, pah!”--and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1300">
     the old patrician brushed imaginary labor-dirt from his white hands.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1310">
     “You have come to hold just those opinions yourself, I suppose,”--he added
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1320">
     with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1340">
     A faint flush in the younger man's cheek told that the shot had hit and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1350">
     hurt; but he answered with dignity:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1370">
     “I have. I say it without shame--I feel none. And now my reason for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1380">
     resolving to renounce my heirship without resistance is explained. I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1390">
     wish to retire from what to me is a false existence, a false position,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1400">
     and begin my life over again--begin it right--begin it on the level of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1410">
     mere manhood, unassisted by factitious aids, and succeed or fail by pure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1420">
     merit or the want of it. I will go to America, where all men are equal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1430">
     and all have an equal chance; I will live or die, sink or swim, win or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1440">
     lose as just a man--that alone, and not a single helping gaud or fiction
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1450">
     back of it.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1470">
     “Hear, hear!” The two men looked each other steadily in the eye a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1480">
     moment or two, then the elder one added, musingly, “Ab-so-lutely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1490">
     cra-zy--ab-solutely!” After another silence, he said, as one who, long
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1500">
     troubled by clouds, detects a ray of sunshine, “Well, there will be one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1510">
     satisfaction--Simon Lathers will come here to enter into his own, and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1520">
     will drown him in the horsepond. The poor devil--always so humble in

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1530">
     his letters, so pitiful, so deferential; so steeped in reverence for our

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1540">
     great line and lofty-station; so anxious to placate us, so prayerful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_1550">
     for recognition as a relative, a bearer in his veins of our sacred

     to Lord Rossmore--was seated in his “library,” which was also his

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_2550">
     “work-shop.” Sometimes he called it by one of these names, sometimes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_2560">
     by another, according to occasion and circumstance. He was constructing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_2570">
     what seemed to be some kind of a frail mechanical toy; and was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_2580">
     apparently very much interested in his work. He was a white-headed
    </p>

     knitting and thinking, with a cat asleep in her lap. The room was large,
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_2660">
     unclassifiable something about the place which betrayed the presence in

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_8520">
     Washington innocently offered to go and look. When he was gone the

     to the wall and began to dust off a peculiarly atrocious chromo with
    </p>

     his handkerchief. Then he brought it reverently, offered it to the

     The day wore itself out. After dinner the two friends put in a long and

     harassing evening trying to decide what to do with the five thousand

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_9790">
     there were so many dazzling openings for ready cash that they found it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_9800">
     impossible to make up their minds and keep them made up. Finally, Mrs.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_9810">
     Sellers grew very weary of it all, and said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_9830">
     “What is the sense in cooking a rabbit before it's caught?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_9850">
     Then the matter was dropped, for the time being, and all went to bed.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_9860">
     Next morning, being persuaded by Hawkins, the colonel made drawings
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_9870">
     and specifications and went down and applied for a patent for his toy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_9880">
     puzzle, and Hawkins took the toy itself and started out to see what
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_9890">
     chance there might be to do something with it commercially. He did
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_9900">
     not have to go far. In a small old wooden shanty which had once been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_9910">
     occupied as a dwelling by some humble negro family he found a keen-eyed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_9920">
     Yankee engaged in repairing cheap chairs and other second-hand
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_9930">
     furniture. This man examined the toy indifferently; attempted to do the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_9940">
     puzzle; found it not so easy as he had expected; grew more interested,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_9950">
     and finally emphatically so; achieved a success at last, and asked:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_9970">
     “Is it patented?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_9990">
     “Patent applied for.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_10010">
     “That will answer. What do you want for it?”
    </p>

     “What will it retail for?”
    </p>

     “Well, twenty-five cents, I should think.”
    </p>

     “What will you give for the exclusive right?”
    </p>

     Washington sighed. Another dream disappeared; no money in the thing. So
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_10140">
     he said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_10160">
     “All right, take it at that. Draw me a paper.” He went his way with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_10170">
     paper, and dropped the matter out of his mind dropped it out to make

     He had not been very long at home when Sellers arrived sodden with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_10230">
     grief and booming with glad excitement--working both these emotions
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_10240">
     successfully, sometimes separately, sometimes together. He fell on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_10250">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_10300">
     He turned to his wife, who had entered while this was going on, put his

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_10310">
     arms about her and said--“You will bear up, for my sake, my lady--it had

     to happen, it was decreed.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_10340">
     She bore up very well, and said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_10360">
     “It's no great loss. Simon Lathers was a poor well-meaning useless thing

    </p>

     repay her by assuring her that he remembered her, and not only that but
    </p>

     better even than he remembered his own children, but the facts would not

     which answered just as well, since the purport of it was an awkward and

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_13360">
     be certain as to whether he remembered her at all or not. The speech
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_13370">
     made him her friend; it couldn't well help it.

     In truth the beauty of this fair creature was of a rare type, and may

     The excitement died out of both men's faces. There was a brooding

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_13810">
     silence for a while, then the younger one said with a sigh:

     Between them they framed twenty-two different advertisements, but none
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_14030">
     was satisfactory. A main fault in all of them was urgency. That feature
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_14040">
     was very troublesome: if made prominent, it was calculated to excite
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_14050">
     Pete's suspicion; if modified below the suspicion-point it was flat and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_14060">
     meaningless. Finally the Colonel resigned, and said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_14080">
     “I have noticed, in such literary experiences as I have had, that one
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_14100">
     are trying to conceal it. Whereas, if you go at literature with a free
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_14110">
     conscience and nothing to conceal, you can turn out a book, every time,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_14120">
     that the very elect can't understand. They all do.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_14140">
     Then Hawkins resigned also, and the two agreed that they must manage to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_14150">
     wait the ten days some how or other. Next, they caught a ray of cheer:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_14160">
     since they had something definite to go upon, now, they could probably
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_14170">
     borrow money on the reward--enough, at any rate, to tide them over till
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_14180">
     they got it; and meantime the materializing recipe would be perfected,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_14190">
     and then good bye to trouble for good and all.

     nearly swamped with work, and the sacrificing of the family chromos for

     The two friends had haunted the general post-office daily. At last they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_14830">
     had their reward. Toward evening on the 20th of May, they got a letter

     Presently the earl said:

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_15370">
     “Well, what a head you have got, Colonel Sellers! I never should have

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_15470">
     “There you are,” said the colonel, triumphantly, with a wave of his hand

     which took in the whole side of the hotel. “There it is--what did I tell

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_15580">
     The earl drifted here and there through the swarming lobby, and finally
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_15590">
     took a waiting position in the neighborhood of the elevator. During an

     hour crowds went up and crowds came down; and all complete as to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_15610">
     limbs; but at last the watcher got a glimpse of a figure that was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_15620">
     satisfactory--got a glimpse of the back of it, though he had missed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_15630">
     his chance at the face through waning alertness. The glimpse revealed a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_15640">
     cowboy hat, and below it a plaided sack of rather loud pattern, and an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_15650">
     empty sleeve pinned up to the shoulder. Then the elevator snatched
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_15660">
     the vision aloft and the watcher fled away in joyful excitement, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_15670">
     rejoined the fellow-conspirator.
    </p>

     “We've got him, Major--got him sure! I've seen him--seen him good; and

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_15730">
     They got it, after the delays usual in such cases. By half past eleven
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_15740">
     they were at home and happy, and went to bed full of dreams of the

     morrow's great promise.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_15770">
     Among the elevator load which had the suspect for fellow-passenger was a

     young kinsman of Mulberry Sellers, but Mulberry was not aware of it and

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_15860">
     Arrived in his room Lord Berkeley made preparations for that first and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_15870">
     last and all-the-time duty of the visiting Englishman--the jotting down
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_15880">
     in his diary of his “impressions” to date. His preparations consisted in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_15890">
     ransacking his “box” for a pen. There was a plenty of steel pens on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_15900">
     his table with the ink bottle, but he was English. The English people
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_15910">
     manufacture steel pens for nineteen-twentieths of the globe, but they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_15920">
     never use any themselves. They use exclusively the pre-historic quill.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_15930">
     My lord not only found a quill pen, but the best one he had seen in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_15940">
     several years--and after writing diligently for some time, closed with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_15950">
     the following entry:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_15970">
     BUT IN ONE THING I HAVE MADE AN IMMENSE MISTAKE, I OUGHT TO HAVE SHUCKED

     MY TITLE AND CHANGED MY NAME BEFORE I STARTED.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16010">
     He sat admiring that pen a while, and then went on:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16030">
     “All attempts to mingle with the common people and become permanently
    </p>

     one of them are going to fail, unless I can get rid of it, disappear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16050">
     from it, and re-appear with the solid protection of a new name. I am
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16060">
     astonished and pained to see how eager the most of these Americans are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16070">
     to get acquainted with a lord, and how diligent they are in pushing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16080">
     attentions upon him. They lack English servility, it is true--but they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16090">
     could acquire it, with practice. My quality travels ahead of me in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16100">
     most mysterious way. I write my family name without additions, on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16110">
     register of this hotel, and imagine that I am going to pass for an

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16120">
     obscure and unknown wanderer, but the clerk promptly calls out, 'Front!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16130">
     show his lordship to four-eighty-two!' and before I can get to the lift
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16140">
     there is a reporter trying to interview me as they call it. This sort

     the first thing in the morning, accomplish my mission, then change my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16170">
     lodging and vanish from scrutiny under a fictitious name.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16190">
     He left his diary on the table, where it would be handy in case any new
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16200">
     “impressions” should wake him up in the night, then he went to bed and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16210">
     presently fell asleep. An hour or two passed, and then he came slowly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16220">
     to consciousness with a confusion of mysterious and augmenting sounds
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16230">
     hammering at the gates of his brain for admission; the next moment he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16240">
     was sharply awake, and those sounds burst with the rush and roar and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16250">
     boom of an undammed freshet into his ears. Banging and slamming of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16260">
     shutters; smashing of windows and the ringing clash of falling glass;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16270">
     clatter of flying feet along the halls; shrieks, supplications,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16280">
     dumb moanings of despair, within, hoarse shouts of command outside;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16290">
     cracklings and snappings, and the windy roar of victorious flames!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16310">
     Bang, bang, bang! on the door, and a cry:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16330">
     “Turn out--the house is on fire!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16350">
     The cry passed on, and the banging. Lord Berkeley sprang out of bed and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16360">
     moved with all possible speed toward the clothes-press in the darkness
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16370">
     and the gathering smoke, but fell over a chair and lost his bearings.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16380">
     He groped desperately about on his hands, and presently struck his head
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16390">
     against the table and was deeply grateful, for it gave him his bearings
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16400">
     again, since it stood close by the door. He seized his most precious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16410">
     possession; his journaled Impressions of America, and darted from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16420">
     room.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16440">
     He ran down the deserted hall toward the red lamp which he knew
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16450">
     indicated the place of a fire-escape. The door of the room beside it was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16460">
     open. In the room the gas was burning full head; on a chair was a pile
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16470">
     of clothing. He ran to the window, could not get it up, but smashed it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16480">
     with a chair, and stepped out on the landing of the fire-escape; below
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16490">
     him was a crowd of men, with a sprinkling of women and youth, massed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16500">
     in a ruddy light. Must he go down in his spectral night dress? No--this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16510">
     side of the house was not yet on fire except at the further end; he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16520">
     would snatch on those clothes. Which he did. They fitted well enough,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16530">
     though a trifle loosely, and they were just a shade loud as to pattern.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16540">
     Also as to hat--which was of a new breed to him, Buffalo Bill not having
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16550">
     been to England yet. One side of the coat went on, but the other side
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16560">
     refused; one of its sleeves was turned up and stitched to the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16570">
     He started down without waiting to get it loose, made the trip
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16580">
     successfully, and was promptly hustled outside the limit-rope by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16590">
     police.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16610">
     The cowboy hat and the coat but half on made him too much of a centre
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16620">
     of attraction for comfort, although nothing could be more profoundly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16630">
     respectful, not to say deferential, than was the manner of the crowd
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16640">
     toward him. In his mind he framed a discouraged remark for early entry
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16650">
     in his diary: “It is of no use; they know a lord through any disguise,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16660">
     and show awe of him--even something very like fear, indeed.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16680">
     Presently one of the gaping and adoring half-circle of boys ventured
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16690">
     a timid question. My lord answered it. The boys glanced wonderingly at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16700">
     each other and from somewhere fell the comment:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16720">
     “English cowboy! Well, if that ain't curious.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16740">
     Another mental note to be preserved for the diary: “Cowboy. Now what
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16750">
     might a cowboy be? Perhaps--” But the viscount perceived that some more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16760">
     questions were about to be asked; so he worked his way out of the crowd,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16770">
     released the sleeve, put on the coat and wandered away to seek a humble
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16780">
     and obscure lodging. He found it and went to bed and was soon asleep.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16800">
     In the morning, he examined his clothes. They were rather assertive,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16810">
     it seemed to him, but they were new and clean, at any rate. There was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16820">
     considerable property in the pockets. Item, five one-hundred dollar
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16830">
     bills. Item, near fifty dollars in small bills and silver. Plug of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16840">
     tobacco. Hymn-book, which refuses to open; found to contain whiskey.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16850">
     Memorandum book bearing no name. Scattering entries in it, recording in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16860">
     a sprawling, ignorant hand, appointments, bets, horse-trades, and so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_16870">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21030">
     “Oh!” and a shudder shook Lady Rossmore to her foundations. “I see it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21040">
     all. Keep away from them--they're his.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21060">
     “His, m' lady?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21080">
     “Yes--your young Marse Sellers from England that's burnt up.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21100">
     She was alone with the ashes--alone before she could take half a breath.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21110">
     Then she went after Mulberry Sellers, purposing to make short work
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21120">
     of his program, whatever it might be; “for,” said she, “when his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21130">
     sentimentals are up, he's a numskull, and there's no knowing what
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21140">
     extravagance he'll contrive, if you let him alone.” She found him. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21150">
     had found the flag and was bringing it. When she heard that his idea
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21160">
     was to have the remains “lie in state, and invite the government and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21170">
     public,” she broke it up. She said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21190">
     “Your intentions are all right--they always are--you want to do honour
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21200">
     to the remains, and surely nobody can find any fault with that, for he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21210">
     was your kin; but you are going the wrong way about it, and you will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21220">
     see it yourself if you stop and think. You can't file around a basket
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21230">
     of ashes trying to look sorry for it and make a sight that is really
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21240">
     solemn, because the solemner it is, the more it isn't--anybody can see
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21250">
     that. It would be so with one basket; it would be three times so with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21260">
     three. Well, it stands to reason that if it wouldn't be solemn with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21270">
     one mourner, it wouldn't be with a procession--and there would be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21280">
     five thousand people here. I don't know but it would be pretty near
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21290">
     ridiculous; I think it would. No, Mulberry, they can't lie in state--it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21300">
     would be a mistake. Give that up and think of something else.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21320">
     So he gave it up; and not reluctantly, when he had thought it over and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21330">
     realized how right her instinct was. He concluded to merely sit up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21340">
     with the remains just himself and Hawkins. Even this seemed a doubtful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21350">
     attention, to his wife, but she offered no objection, for it was plain
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21360">
     that he had a quite honest and simple-hearted desire to do the friendly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21370">
     and honourable thing by these forlorn poor relics which could command
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21380">
     no hospitality in this far off land of strangers but his. He draped the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21390">
     flag about the baskets, put some crape on the door-knob, and said with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21400">
     satisfaction:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21420">
     “There--he is as comfortable, now, as we can make him in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21430">
     circumstances. Except--yes, we must strain a point there--one must do as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21440">
     one would wish to be done by--he must have it.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21460">
     “Have what, dear?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21480">
     “Hatchment.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21500">
     The wife felt that the house-front was standing about all it could well
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21510">
     stand, in that way; the prospect of another stunning decoration of that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21520">
     nature distressed her, and she wished the thing had not occurred to him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21530">
     She said, hesitatingly:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21550">
     “But I thought such an honour as that wasn't allowed to any but very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21560">
     very near relations, who--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21580">
     “Right, you are quite right, my lady, perfectly right; but there aren't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21590">
     any nearer relatives than relatives by usurpation. We cannot avoid it;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21600">
     we are slaves of aristocratic custom and must submit.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21620">
     The hatchments were unnecessarily generous, each being as large as a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21630">
     blanket, and they were unnecessarily volcanic, too, as to variety and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21640">
     violence of color, but they pleased the earl's barbaric eye, and they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21650">
     satisfied his taste for symmetry and completeness, too, for they left no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21660">
     waste room to speak of on the house-front.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21680">
     Lady Rossmore and her daughter assisted at the sitting-up till near
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21690">
     midnight, and helped the gentlemen to consider what ought to be done
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21700">
     next with the remains. Rossmore thought they ought to be sent home with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21710">
     a committee and resolutions,--at once. But the wife was doubtful. She
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21720">
     said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21740">
     “Would you send all of the baskets?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21760">
     “Oh, yes, all.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21780">
     “All at once?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21800">
     “To his father? Oh, no--by no means. Think of the shock. No--one at a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21810">
     time; break it to him by degrees.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21830">
     “Would that have that effect, father?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21850">
     “Yes, my daughter. Remember, you are young and elastic, but he is old.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21860">
     To send him the whole at once might well be more than he could bear.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21870">
     But mitigated--one basket at a time, with restful intervals between, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21880">
     would be used to it by the time he got all of him. And sending him in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21890">
     three ships is safer anyway. On account of wrecks and storms.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21910">
     “I don't like the idea, father. If I were his father it would be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21920">
     dreadful to have him coming in that--in that--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21940">
     “On the installment plan,” suggested Hawkins, gravely, and proud of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21950">
     being able to help.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21970">
     “Yes--dreadful to have him coming in that incoherent way. There would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21980">
     be the strain of suspense upon me all the time. To have so depressing a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_21990">
     thing as a funeral impending, delayed, waiting, unaccomplished--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22010">
     “Oh, no, my child,” said the earl reassuringly, “there would be nothing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22020">
     of that kind; so old a gentleman could not endure a long-drawn suspense
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22030">
     like that. There will be three funerals.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22050">
     Lady Rossmore looked up surprised, and said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22070">
     “How is that going to make it easier for him? It's a total mistake, to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22080">
     my mind. He ought to be buried all at once; I'm sure of it.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22100">
     “I should think so, too,” said Hawkins.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22120">
     “And certainly I should,” said the daughter.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22140">
     “You are all wrong,” said the earl. “You will see it yourselves, if you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22150">
     think. Only one of these baskets has got him in it.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22170">
     “Very well, then,” said Lady Rossmore, “the thing is perfectly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22180">
     simple--bury that one.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22200">
     “Certainly,” said Lady Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22220">
     “But it is not simple,” said the earl, “because we do not know which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22230">
     basket he is in. We know he is in one of them, but that is all we do
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22240">
     know. You see now, I reckon, that I was right; it takes three funerals,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22250">
     there is no other way.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22270">
     “And three graves and three monuments and three inscriptions?” asked the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22280">
     daughter.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22300">
     “Well--yes--to do it right. That is what I should do.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22320">
     “It could not be done so, father. Each of the inscriptions would give
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22330">
     the same name and the same facts and say he was under each and all of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22340">
     these monuments, and that would not answer at all.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22360">
     The earl nestled uncomfortably in his chair.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22380">
     “No,” he said, “that is an objection. That is a serious objection. I see
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22390">
     no way out.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22410">
     There was a general silence for a while. Then Hawkins said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22430">
     “It seems to me that if we mixed the three ramifications together--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22450">
     The earl grasped him by the hand and shook it gratefully.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22470">
     “It solves the whole problem,” he said. “One ship, one funeral, one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22480">
     grave, one monument--it is admirably conceived. It does you honor,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22490">
     Major Hawkins, it has relieved me of a most painful embarrassment and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22500">
     distress, and it will save that poor stricken old father much suffering.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22510">
     Yes, he shall go over in one basket.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22530">
     “When?” asked the wife.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22550">
     “To-morrow-immediately, of course.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22570">
     “I would wait, Mulberry.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22590">
     “Wait? Why?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22610">
     “You don't want to break that childless old man's heart.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22630">
     “God knows I don't!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22650">
     “Then wait till he sends for his son's remains. If you do that, you will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22660">
     never have to give him the last and sharpest pain a parent can know--I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22670">
     mean, the certainty that his son is dead. For he will never send.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22690">
     “Why won't he?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22710">
     “Because to send--and find out the truth--would rob him of the one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22720">
     precious thing left him, the uncertainty, the dim hope that maybe, after
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22730">
     all, his boy escaped, and he will see him again some day.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22750">
     “Why Polly, he'll know by the papers that he was burnt up.”
    </p>

     “He won't let himself believe the papers; he'll argue against anything
    </p>

     and everything that proves his son is dead; and he will keep that up and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22790">
     live on it, and on nothing else till he dies. But if the remains should
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22800">
     actually come, and be put before that poor old dim-hoping soul--”
    </p>

     I'll bless you for it always. Now we know what to do. We'll place them

     The young Lord Berkeley, with the fresh air of freedom in his nostrils,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22920">
     was feeling invincibly strong for his new career; and yet--and yet--if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22930">
     the fight should prove a very hard one at first, very discouraging, very

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22940">
     taxing on untoughened moral sinews, he might in some weak moment want to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22950">
     retreat. Not likely, of course, but possibly that might happen. And so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22960">
     on the whole it might be pardonable caution to burn his bridges behind
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22970">
     him. Oh, without doubt. He must not stop with advertising for the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22980">
     owner of that money, but must put it where he could not borrow from it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_22990">
     himself, meantime, under stress of circumstances. So he went down town,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23000">
     and put in his advertisement, then went to a bank and handed in $500 for

     deposit.

     “What name?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23050">
     He hesitated and colored a little; he had forgotten to make a selection.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23060">
     He now brought out the first one that suggested itself:

     When he was gone the clerks, marveling, said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23120">
     “The cowboy blushed.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23140">
     The first step was accomplished. The money was still under his command
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23150">
     and at his disposal, but the next step would dispose of that difficulty.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23160">
     He went to another bank and drew upon the first bank for the $500 by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23170">
     check. The money was collected and deposited a second time to the credit
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23180">
     of Howard Tracy. He was asked to leave a few samples of his signature,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23190">
     which he did. Then he went away, once more proud and of perfect courage,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23200">
     saying:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23220">
     “No help for me now, for henceforth I couldn't draw that money without
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23230">
     identification, and that is become legally impossible. No resources to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23240">
     fall back on. It is work or starve from now to the end. I am ready--and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23250">
     not afraid!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23270">
     Then he sent this cablegram to his father:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23290">
     “Escaped unhurt from burning hotel. Have taken fictitious name.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23300">
     Goodbye.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23320">
     During the evening while he was wandering about in one of the outlying
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23330">
     districts of the city, he came across a small brick church, with a bill
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23340">
     posted there with these words printed on it: “MECHANICS' CLUB DEBATE.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23350">
     ALL INVITED.” He saw people, apparently mainly of the working class,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23360">
     entering the place, and he followed and took his seat. It was a humble
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23370">
     little church, quite bare as to ornamentation. It had painted pews
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23380">
     without cushions, and no pulpit, properly speaking, but it had a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23390">
     platform. On the platform sat the chairman, and by his side sat a man
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23400">
     who held a manuscript in his hand and had the waiting look of one who is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23410">
     going to perform the principal part. The church was soon filled with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23420">
     quiet and orderly congregation of decently dressed and modest people.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23430">
     This is what the chairman said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23450">
     “The essayist for this evening is an old member of our club whom you all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23460">
     know, Mr. Parker, assistant editor of the Daily Democrat. The subject of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23470">
     his essay is the American Press, and he will use as his text a couple of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23480">
     paragraphs taken from Mr. Matthew Arnold's new book. He asks me to read
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23490">
     these texts for him. The first is as follows:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23510">
     “'Goethe says somewhere that “the thrill of awe,” that is to say,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23520">
     REVERENCE, is the best thing humanity has.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23540">
     “Mr. Arnold's other paragraph is as follows:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23560">
     “'I should say that if one were searching for the best means to efface
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23570">
     and kill in a whole nation the discipline of respect, one could not do
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23580">
     better than take the American newspapers.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23600">
     Mr. Parker rose and bowed, and was received with warm applause. He then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23610">
     began to read in a good round resonant voice, with clear enunciation and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23620">
     careful attention to his pauses and emphases. His points were received
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23630">
     with approval as he went on.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23650">
     The essayist took the position that the most important function of a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23660">
     public journal in any country was the propagating of national feeling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23670">
     and pride in the national name--the keeping the people “in love with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23680">
     their country and its institutions, and shielded from the allurements
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23690">
     of alien and inimical systems.” He sketched the manner in which the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23700">
     reverent Turkish or Russian journalist fulfilled this function--the one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23710">
     assisted by the prevalent “discipline of respect” for the bastinado, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23720">
     other for Siberia. Continuing, he said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23740">
     The chief function of an English journal is that of all other journals
    </p>

     the fact that all these glories were for the enrichment and

     aggrandizement of the petted and privileged few, at cost of the blood

     only business-wise--merely as retail differs from wholesale. It must
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23920">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23980">
     The essayist thought that Mr. Arnold, with his trained eye and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_23990">
     intelligent observation, ought to have perceived that the very quality
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_24000">
     which he so regretfully missed from our press--respectfulness, reverence
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_24010">
     --was exactly the thing which would make our press useless to us if it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_24020">
     had it--rob it of the very thing which differentiates it from all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_24030">
     other journalism in the world and makes it distinctively and preciously
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_24040">
     American, its frank and cheerful irreverence being by all odds the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_24050">
     most valuable of all its qualities. “For its mission--overlooked by Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_24060">
     Arnold--is to stand guard over a nation's liberties, not its humbugs and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_24070">
     shams.” He thought that if during fifty years the institutions of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_24080">
     old world could be exposed to the fire of a flouting and scoffing press
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_24090">
     like ours, “monarchy and its attendant crimes would disappear from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_24100">
     Christendom.” Monarchists might doubt this; then “why not persuade the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_24110">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_24130">
     Well, the charge is, that our press has but little of that old world
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_24150">
     limited reverence it at least reveres the things which this nation
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_24160">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_24170">
     fairly and properly matter of light importance to us. Our press does not

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_24240">

     protector of all forms of human slavery, bodily and mental.

     Tracy said to himself, almost shouted to himself, “I'm glad I came to

     the innumerable slaveries imposed by misplaced reverence! How well he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_24380">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_24390">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_24400">
     your slave. Oh, yes, in all the ages the peoples of Europe have been

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_24440">
     In order to shock them it is sufficient to inject a thought of the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_24780">
     But I think he a little overrated the college-culture share in the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_24790">
     production of that result. It can no doubt be easily shown that the

     that that part is vast; but that the material progress has been

     over a list of inventors--the creators of this amazing material

     development--and I find that they were not college-bred men. Of course
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_24850">
     there are exceptions--like Professor Henry of Princeton, the inventor of

     During the first few days he kept the fact diligently before his mind
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_25570">
     that he was in a land where there was “work and bread for all.” In fact,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_25580">
     for convenience' sake he fitted it to a little tune and hummed it to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_25590">
     himself; but as time wore on the fact itself began to take on a doubtful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_25600">
     look, and next the tune got fatigued and presently ran down and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_25610">
     stopped. His first effort was to get an upper clerkship in one of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_25620">
     departments, where his Oxford education could come into play and do
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_25630">
     him service. But he stood no chance whatever. There, competency was no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_25640">
     recommendation; political backing, without competency, was worth six of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_25650">
     it. He was glaringly English, and that was necessarily against him in

     the political centre of a nation where both parties prayed for the Irish

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_25680">
     was a cowboy; that won him respect--when his back was not turned--but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_25690">
     it couldn't get a clerkship for him. But he had said, in a rash moment,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_25700">
     that he would wear those clothes till the owner or the owner's friends

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_25710">
     caught sight of them and asked for that money, and his conscience would

     not let him retire from that engagement now.

     At the end of a week things were beginning to wear rather a startling

     look. He had hunted everywhere for work, descending gradually the scale

     work a man without a special calling might hope to be able to do, except
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_25780">
     ditching and the other coarse manual sorts--and had got neither work nor

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_25880">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_25890">
     quaking through him, and he exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_25910">
     “What have I been thinking of! THIS the bottom! Mooning along a whole

     must end this folly straightway.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_25950">
     He settled up at once and went forth to find less sumptuous lodgings. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_25960">
     had to wander far and seek with diligence, but he succeeded. They made
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_25970">
     him pay in advance--four dollars and a half; this secured both bed and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_25980">
     food for a week. The good-natured, hardworked landlady took him up three
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_25990">
     flights of narrow, uncarpeted stairs and delivered him into his room.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_26000">
     There were two double-bedsteads in it, and one single one. He would be

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_26010">
     allowed to sleep alone in one of the double beds until some new boarder
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_26020">
     should come, but he wouldn't be charged extra.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_26040">
     So he would presently be required to sleep with some stranger! The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_26050">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28330">
     no beard, and a pleasant face badly freckled but alive and intelligent,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28340">
     and he wore slop-shop clothing which was neat but showed wear. He had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28350">
     come from the front room beyond the hall, where he had left his hat, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28360">
     he had a chipped and cracked white wash-bowl in his hand. The girl came
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28370">
     and took the bowl.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28390">
     “I'll get it for you. You go right ahead and give it to him, Mr. Barrow.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28400">
     He's the new boarder--Mr. Tracy--and I'd just got to where it was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28410">
     getting too deep for me.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28430">
     “Much obliged if you will, Hattie. I was coming to borrow of the boys.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28440">
     He sat down at his ease on an old trunk, and said, “I've been listening
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28450">
     and got interested; and as I was saying, I wouldn't go on, if I were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28460">
     you. You see where you are coming to, don't you? Calling yourself a lady
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28470">
     doesn't elect you; that is what you were going to say; and you saw that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28480">
     if you said it you were going to run right up against another difference
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28490">
     that you hadn't thought of: to-wit, Whose right is it to do the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28500">
     electing? Over there, twenty thousand people in a million elect
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28510">
     themselves gentlemen and ladies, and the nine hundred and eighty
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28520">
     thousand accept that decree and swallow the affront which it puts upon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28530">
     them. Why, if they didn't accept it, it wouldn't be an election, it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28540">
     would be a dead letter and have no force at all. Over here the twenty
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28550">
     thousand would-be exclusives come up to the polls and vote themselves
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28560">
     to be ladies and gentlemen. But the thing doesn't stop there. The nine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28570">
     hundred and eighty thousand come and vote themselves to be ladies and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28580">
     gentlemen too, and that elects the whole nation. Since the whole million
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28590">
     vote themselves ladies and gentlemen, there is no question about that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28600">
     election. It does make absolute equality, and there is no fiction about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28610">
     it; while over yonder the inequality, (by decree of the infinitely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28620">
     feeble, and consent of the infinitely strong,) is also absolute--as real
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28630">
     and absolute as our equality.”
    </p>

     Tracy had shrunk promptly into his English shell when this speech began,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28660">
     notwithstanding he had now been in severe training several weeks for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28670">
     contact and intercourse with the common herd on the common herd's terms;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28680">
     but he lost no time in pulling himself out again, and so by the time the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28690">
     speech was finished his valves were open once more, and he was forcing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28700">
     himself to accept without resentment the common herd's frank fashion of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28710">
     dropping sociably into other people's conversations unembarrassed and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28720">
     uninvited. The process was not very difficult this time, for the man's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28730">
     smile and voice and manner were persuasive and winning. Tracy would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28740">
     even have liked him on the spot, but for the fact--fact which he was not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28750">
     really aware of--that the equality of men was not yet a reality to him,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28760">
     it was only a theory; the mind perceived, but the man failed to feel it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28770">
     It was Hattie's ghost over again, merely turned around. Theoretically
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28780">
     Barrow was his equal, but it was distinctly distasteful to see him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28790">
     exhibit it. He presently said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28810">
     “I hope in all sincerity that what you have said is true, as regards the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28820">
     Americans, for doubts have crept into my mind several times. It seemed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28830">
     that the equality must be ungenuine where the sign-names of castes were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28840">
     still in vogue; but those sign-names have certainly lost their offence
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28850">
     and are wholly neutralized, nullified and harmless if they are the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28860">
     undisputed property of every individual in the nation. I think I realize
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28870">
     that caste does not exist and cannot exist except by common consent of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28880">
     the masses outside of its limits. I thought caste created itself and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28890">
     perpetuated itself; but it seems quite true that it only creates itself,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28900">
     and is perpetuated by the people whom it despises, and who can dissolve
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28910">
     it at any time by assuming its mere sign-names themselves.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_28930">
     “It's what I think. There isn't any power on earth that can prevent

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29110">
     “Why, no.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29130">
     “Well, then, let a man in his right mind try to conceive of Darwin
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29140">
     feeling flattered by the notice of a princess. It's so grotesque that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29150">
     it--well, it paralyzes the imagination. Yet that Memnon was flattered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29160">
     by the notice of that statuette; he says so--says so himself. The system

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29170">
     that can make a god disown his godship and profane it--oh, well, it's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29180">
     all wrong, it's all wrong and ought to be abolished, I should say.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29200">
     The mention of Darwin brought on a literary discussion, and this topic
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29210">
     roused such enthusiasm in Barrow that he took off his coat and made
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29220">
     himself the more free and comfortable for it, and detained him so long
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29230">
     that he was still at it when the noisy proprietors of the room came
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29240">
     shouting and skylarking in and began to romp, scuffle, wash, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29250">
     otherwise entertain themselves. He lingered yet a little longer to offer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29260">
     the hospitalities of his room and his book shelf to Tracy and ask him a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29270">
     personal question or two:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29290">
     “What is your trade?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29310">
     “They--well, they call me a cowboy, but that is a fancy. I'm not that. I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29320">
     haven't any trade.”
    </p>

     “What do you work at for your living?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29360">
     “Oh, anything--I mean I would work at, anything I could get to do, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29370">
     thus far I haven't been able to find an occupation.”
    </p>

     “Maybe I can help you; I'd like to try.”

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29440">
     in this world. What you needed, I reckon, was less book learning and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29450">
     more bread-and-butter learning. I don't know what your father could have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29460">
     been thinking of. You ought to have had a trade, you ought to have had a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29470">
     trade, by all means. But never mind about that; we'll stir up something
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29480">
     to do, I guess. And don't you get homesick; that's a bad business. We'll
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29490">
     talk the thing over and look around a little. You'll come out all right.
    </p>

     Wait for me--I'll go down to supper with you.”

     By this time Tracy had achieved a very friendly feeling for Barrow and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29530">
     would have called him a friend, maybe, if not taken too suddenly on a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29540">
     straight-out requirement to realize on his theories. He was glad of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29550">
     society, anyway, and was feeling lighter hearted than before. Also he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29560">
     was pretty curious to know what vocation it might be which had furnished
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29570">
     Barrow such a large acquaintanceship with books and allowed him so much

     Presently the supper bell began to ring in the depths of the house, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29660">
     the sound proceeded steadily upward, growing in intensity all the way up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29670">
     towards the upper floors. The higher it came the more maddening was the

     noise, until at last what it lacked of being absolutely deafening, was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29690">
     made up of the sudden crash and clatter of an avalanche of boarders
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29700">
     down the uncarpeted stairway. The peerage did not go to meals in this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29710">
     fashion; Tracy's training had not fitted him to enjoy this hilarious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29720">
     zoological clamor and enthusiasm. He had to confess that there was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29730">
     something about this extraordinary outpouring of animal spirits which he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29740">
     would have to get inured to before he could accept it. No doubt in time
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29750">
     he would prefer it; but he wished the process might be modified and made
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29760">
     just a little more gradual, and not quite so pronounced and violent.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29770">
     Barrow and Tracy followed the avalanche down through an ever increasing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29780">
     and ever more and more aggressive stench of bygone cabbage and kindred
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29790">
     smells; smells which are to be found nowhere but in a cheap private
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29800">
     boarding house; smells which once encountered can never be forgotten;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29810">
     smells which encountered generations later are instantly recognizable,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29820">
     but never recognizable with pleasure. To Tracy these odors were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29830">
     suffocating, horrible, almost unendurable; but he held his peace and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29840">
     said nothing. Arrived in the basement, they entered a large dining-room
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29850">
     where thirty-five or forty people sat at a long table. They took their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29860">
     places. The feast had already begun and the conversation was going on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29870">
     in the liveliest way from one end of the table to the other. The table
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29880">
     cloth was of very coarse material and was liberally spotted with coffee
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29890">
     stains and grease. The knives and forks were iron, with bone handles,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29900">
     the spoons appeared to be iron or sheet iron or something of the sort.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29910">
     The tea and coffee cups were of the commonest and heaviest and most
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29920">
     durable stone ware. All the furniture of the table was of the commonest
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29930">
     and cheapest sort. There was a single large thick slice of bread by each
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29940">
     boarder's plate, and it was observable that he economized it as if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29950">
     he were not expecting it to be duplicated. Dishes of butter were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29960">
     distributed along the table within reach of people's arms, if they

     had long ones, but there were no private butter plates. The butter was

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29980">
     perhaps good enough, and was quiet and well behaved; but it had more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_29990">
     bouquet than was necessary, though nobody commented upon that fact or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30000">
     seemed in any way disturbed by it. The main feature of the feast was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30010">
     a piping hot Irish stew made of the potatoes and meat left over from a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30020">
     procession of previous meals. Everybody was liberally supplied with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30030">
     this dish. On the table were a couple of great dishes of sliced ham, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30040">
     there were some other eatables of minor importance--preserves and New
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30050">
     Orleans molasses and such things. There was also plenty of tea and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30060">
     coffee of an infernal sort, with brown sugar and condensed milk, but the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30070">
     milk and sugar supply was not left at the discretion of the boarders,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30080">
     but was rationed out at headquarters--one spoonful of sugar and one of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30090">
     condensed milk to each cup and no more. The table was waited upon by two
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30100">
     stalwart negro women who raced back and forth from the bases of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30110">
     supplies with splendid dash and clatter and energy. Their labors were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30120">
     supplemented after a fashion by the young girl Puss. She carried
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30130">
     coffee and tea back and forth among the boarders, but she made pleasure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30140">
     excursions rather than business ones in this way, to speak strictly. She
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30150">
     made jokes with various people. She chaffed the young men pleasantly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30160">
     and wittily, as she supposed, and as the rest also supposed, apparently,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30170">
     judging by the applause and laughter which she got by her efforts.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30180">
     Manifestly she was a favorite with most of the young fellows and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30190">
     sweetheart of the rest of them. Where she conferred notice she conferred
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30200">
     happiness, as was seen by the face of the recipient; and at the same
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30210">
     time she conferred unhappiness--one could see it fall and dim the faces
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30220">
     of the other young fellows like a shadow. She never “Mistered” these
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30230">
     friends of hers, but called them “Billy,” “Tom,” “John,” and they called
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30240">
     her “Puss” or “Hattie.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30260">
     Mr. Marsh sat at the head of the table, his wife sat at the foot. Marsh
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30270">
     was a man of sixty, and was an American; but if he had been born a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30280">
     month earlier he would have been a Spaniard. He was plenty good enough
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30290">
     Spaniard as it was; his face was very dark, his hair very black, and his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30300">
     eyes were not only exceedingly black but were very intense, and there
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30310">
     was something about them that indicated that they could burn with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30320">
     passion upon occasion. He was stoop-shouldered and lean-faced, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30330">
     general aspect of him was disagreeable; he was evidently not a very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30340">
     companionable person. If looks went for anything, he was the very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30350">
     opposite of his wife, who was all motherliness and charity, good
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30360">
     will and good nature. All the young men and the women called her Aunt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30370">
     Rachael, which was another sign. Tracy's wandering and interested
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30380">
     eye presently fell upon one boarder who had been overlooked in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30390">
     distribution of the stew. He was very pale and looked as if he had but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30400">
     lately come out of a sick bed, and also as if he ought to get back into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30410">
     it again as soon as possible. His face was very melancholy. The waves
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30420">
     of laughter and conversation broke upon it without affecting it any more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30430">
     than if it had been a rock in the sea and the words and the laughter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30440">
     veritable waters. He held his head down and looked ashamed. Some of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30450">
     women cast glances of pity toward him from time to time in a furtive
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30460">
     and half afraid way, and some of the youngest of the men plainly had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30470">
     compassion on the young fellow--a compassion exhibited in their faces
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30480">
     but not in any more active or compromising way. But the great majority
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30490">
     of the people present showed entire indifference to the youth and his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30500">
     sorrows. Marsh sat with his head down, but one could catch the malicious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30510">
     gleam of his eyes through his shaggy brows. He was watching that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30520">
     young fellow with evident relish. He had not neglected him through
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30530">
     carelessness, and apparently the table understood that fact. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30540">
     spectacle was making Mrs. Marsh very uncomfortable. She had the look of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30550">
     one who hopes against hope that the impossible may happen. But as the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30560">
     impossible did not happen, she finally ventured to speak up and remind
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30570">
     her husband that Nat Brady hadn't been helped to the Irish stew.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30590">
     Marsh lifted his head and gasped out with mock courtliness, “Oh, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30600">
     hasn't, hasn't he? What a pity that is. I don't know how I came
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30610">
     to overlook him. Ah, he must pardon me. You must indeed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30620">
     Mr--er--Baxter--Barker, you must pardon me. I--er--my attention was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30630">
     directed to some other matter, I don't know what. The thing that grieves
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30640">
     me mainly is, that it happens every meal now. But you must try to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30650">
     overlook these little things, Mr. Bunker, these little neglects on my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30660">
     part. They're always likely to happen with me in any case, and they are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30670">
     especially likely to happen where a person has--er--well, where a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30680">
     person is, say, about three weeks in arrears for his board. You get my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30690">
     meaning?--you get my idea? Here is your Irish stew, and--er--it gives me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30700">
     the greatest pleasure to send it to you, and I hope that you will enjoy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30710">
     the charity as much as I enjoy conferring it.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30730">
     A blush rose in Brady's white cheeks and flowed slowly backward to his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30740">
     ears and upward toward his forehead, but he said nothing and began to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30750">
     eat his food under the embarrassment of a general silence and the sense
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30760">
     that all eyes were fastened upon him. Barrow whispered to Tracy:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30780">
     “The old man's been waiting for that. He wouldn't have missed that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30790">
     chance for anything.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30810">
     “It's a brutal business,” said Tracy. Then he said to himself, purposing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30820">
     to set the thought down in his diary later:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30840">
     “Well, here in this very house is a republic where all are free and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30850">
     equal, if men are free and equal anywhere in the earth, therefore I have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30860">
     arrived at the place I started to find, and I am a man among men, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30870">
     on the strictest equality possible to men, no doubt. Yet here on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30880">
     threshold I find an inequality. There are people at this table who are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30890">
     looked up to for some reason or another, and here is a poor devil of a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30900">
     boy who is looked down upon, treated with indifference, and shamed by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30910">
     humiliations, when he has committed no crime but that common one of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30920">
     being poor. Equality ought to make men noble-minded. In fact I had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30930">
     supposed it did do that.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30950">
     After supper, Barrow proposed a walk, and they started. Barrow had a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30960">
     purpose. He wanted Tracy to get rid of that cowboy hat. He didn't see
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30970">
     his way to finding mechanical or manual employment for a person rigged
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_30980">
     in that fashion. Barrow presently said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31000">
     “As I understand it, you're not a cowboy.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31020">
     “No, I'm not.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31040">
     “Well, now if you will not think me too curious, how did you come to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31050">
     mount that hat? Where'd you get it?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31070">
     Tracy didn't know quite how to reply to this, but presently said,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31090">
     “Well, without going into particulars, I exchanged clothes with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31100">
     stranger under stress of weather, and I would like to find him and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31110">
     re-exchange.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31130">
     “Well, why don't you find him? Where is he?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31150">
     “I don't know. I supposed the best way to find him would be to continue
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31160">
     to wear his clothes, which are conspicuous enough to attract his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31170">
     attention if I should meet him on the street.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31190">
     “Oh, very well,” said Barrow, “the rest of the outfit, is well enough,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31200">
     and while it's not too conspicuous, it isn't quite like the clothes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31210">
     that anybody else wears. Suppress the hat. When you meet your man he'll
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31220">
     recognize the rest of his suit. That's a mighty embarrassing hat, you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31230">
     know, in a centre of civilization like this. I don't believe an angel
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31240">
     could get employment in Washington in a halo like that.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31270">
     Tracy agreed to replace the hat with something of a modester form, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31280">
     they stepped aboard a crowded car and stood with others on the rear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31290">
     platform. Presently, as the car moved swiftly along the rails, two men
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31300">
     crossing the street caught sight of the backs of Barrow and Tracy, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31310">
     both exclaimed at once, “There he is!” It was Sellers and Hawkins.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31320">
     Both were so paralyzed with joy that before they could pull themselves
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31330">
     together and make an effort to stop the car, it was gone too far, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31340">
     they decided to wait for the next one. They waited a while; then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31350">
     it occurred to Washington that there could be no use in chasing one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31360">
     horse-car with another, and he wanted to hunt up a hack. But the Colonel
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31370">
     said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31390">
     “When you come to think of it, there's no occasion for that at all. Now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31400">
     that I've got him materialized, I can command his motions. I'll have him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31410">
     at the house by the time we get there.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31430">
     Then they hurried off home in a state of great and joyful excitement.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31450">
     The hat exchange accomplished, the two new friends started to walk back
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31460">
     leisurely to the boarding house. Barrow's mind was full of curiosity
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31470">
     about this young fellow. He said,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31490">
     “You've never been to the Rocky Mountains?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31510">
     “No.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31530">
     “You've never been out on the plains?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31550">
     “No.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31570">
     “How long have you been in this country?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31590">
     “Only a few days.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31610">
     “You've never been in America before?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31630">
     “No.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31650">
     Then Barrow communed with himself. “Now what odd shapes the notions of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31660">
     romantic people take. Here's a young fellow who's read in England about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31670">
     cowboys and adventures on the plains. He comes here and buys a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31680">
     cowboy's suit. Thinks he can play himself on folks for a cowboy, all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31690">
     inexperienced as he is. Now the minute he's caught in this poor little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31700">
     game, he's ashamed of it and ready to retire from it. It is that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31710">
     exchange that he has put up as an explanation. It's rather thin, too

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31720">
     thin altogether. Well, he's young, never been anywhere, knows nothing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31730">
     about the world, sentimental, no doubt. Perhaps it was the natural
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31740">
     thing for him to do, but it was a most singular choice, curious freak,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31750">
     altogether.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31770">
     Both men were busy with their thoughts for a time, then Tracy heaved a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31780">
     sigh and said,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31800">
     “Mr. Barrow, the case of that young fellow troubles me.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31820">
     “You mean Nat Brady?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31840">
     “Yes, Brady, or Baxter, or whatever it was. The old landlord called him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31850">
     by several different names.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31870">
     “Oh, yes, he has been very liberal with names for Brady, since Brady
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31880">
     fell into arrears for his board. Well, that's one of his sarcasms--the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31890">
     old man thinks he's great on sarcasm.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31910">
     “Well, what is Brady's difficulty? What is Brady--who is he?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31930">
     “Brady is a tinner. He's a young journeyman tinner who was getting along
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31940">
     all right till he fell sick and lost his job. He was very popular before
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31950">
     he lost his job; everybody in the house liked Brady. The old man was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31960">
     rather especially fond of him, but you know that when a man loses his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31970">
     job and loses his ability to support himself and to pay his way as he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31980">
     goes, it makes a great difference in the way people look at him and feel
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_31990">
     about him.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32010">
     “Is that so! Is it so?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32030">
     Barrow looked at Tracy in a puzzled way. “Why of course it's so.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32040">
     Wouldn't you know that, naturally. Don't you know that the wounded deer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32050">
     is always attacked and killed by its companions and friends?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32070">
     Tracy said to himself, while a chilly and boding discomfort spread
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32080">
     itself through his system, “In a republic of deer and men where all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32090">
     are free and equal, misfortune is a crime, and the prosperous gore the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32100">
     unfortunate to death.” Then he said aloud, “Here in the boarding house,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32110">
     if one would have friends and be popular instead of having the cold
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32120">
     shoulder turned upon him, he must be prosperous.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32140">
     “Yes,” Barrow said, “that is so. It's their human nature. They do turn
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32150">
     against Brady, now that he's unfortunate, and they don't like him as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32160">
     well as they did before; but it isn't because of any lack in Brady--he's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32170">
     just as he was before, has the same nature and the same impulses, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32180">
     they--well, Brady is a thorn in their consciences, you see. They know
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32190">
     they ought to help him and they're too stingy to do it, and they're
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32200">
     ashamed of themselves for that, and they ought also to hate themselves
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32210">
     on that account, but instead of that they hate Brady because he makes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32220">
     them ashamed of themselves. I say that's human nature; that occurs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32230">
     everywhere; this boarding house is merely the world in little, it's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32240">
     the case all over--they're all alike. In prosperity we are popular;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32250">
     popularity comes easy in that case, but when the other thing comes our
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32260">
     friends are pretty likely to turn against us.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32280">
     Tracy's noble theories and high purposes were beginning to feel pretty
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32290">
     damp and clammy. He wondered if by any possibility he had made a mistake
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32300">
     in throwing his own prosperity to the winds and taking up the cross
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32310">
     of other people's unprosperity. But he wouldn't listen to that sort of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32320">
     thing; he cast it out of his mind and resolved to go ahead resolutely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32330">
     along the course he had mapped out for himself.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32350">
     Extracts from his diary:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32370">
     Have now spent several days in this singular hive. I don't know quite
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32380">
     what to make out of these people. They have merits and virtues, but they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32390">
     have some other qualities, and some ways that are hard to get along
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32400">
     with. I can't enjoy them. The moment I appeared in a hat of the period,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32410">
     I noticed a change. The respect which had been paid me before, passed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32420">
     suddenly away, and the people became friendly--more than that--they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32430">
     became familiar, and I'm not used to familiarity, and can't take to it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32440">
     right off; I find that out. These people's familiarity amounts to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32450">
     impudence, sometimes. I suppose it's all right; no doubt I can get used
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32460">
     to it, but it's not a satisfactory process at all. I have accomplished
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32470">
     my dearest wish, I am a man among men, on an equal footing with Tom,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32480">
     Dick and Harry, and yet it isn't just exactly what I thought it was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32490">
     going to be. I--I miss home. Am obliged to say I am homesick. Another
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32500">
     thing--and this is a confession--a reluctant one, but I will make it:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32510">
     The thing I miss most and most severely, is the respect, the deference,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32520">
     with which I was treated all my life in England, and which seems to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32530">
     somehow necessary to me. I get along very well without the luxury and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32540">
     the wealth and the sort of society I've been accustomed to, but I do
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32550">
     miss the respect and can't seem to get reconciled to the absence of it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32560">
     There is respect, there is deference here, but it doesn't fall to my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32570">
     share. It is lavished on two men. One of them is a portly man of middle
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32580">
     age who is a retired plumber. Everybody is pleased to have that man's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32590">
     notice. He's full of pomp and circumstance and self complacency and bad
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32600">
     grammar, and at table he is Sir Oracle and when he opens his mouth not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32610">
     any dog in the kennel barks. The other person is a policeman at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32620">
     capitol-building. He represents the government. The deference paid to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32630">
     these two men is not so very far short of that paid to an earl in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32640">
     England, though the method of it differs. Not so much courtliness, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32650">
     the deference is all there.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32670">
     Yes, and there is obsequiousness, too.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32690">
     It does rather look as if in a republic where all are free and equal,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32700">
     prosperity and position constitute rank.

     CHAPTER XIII.
    </head>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32760">
     The days drifted by, and they grew ever more dreary. For Barrow's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32770">
     efforts to find work for Tracy were unavailing. Always the first
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32780">
     question asked was, “What Union do you belong to?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32800">
     Tracy was obliged to reply that he didn't belong to any trade-union.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32820">
     “Very well, then, it's impossible to employ you. My men wouldn't stay
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32830">
     with me if I should employ a 'scab,' or 'rat,'” or whatever the phrase
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32840">
     was.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32860">
     Finally, Tracy had a happy thought. He said, “Why the thing for me to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32870">
     do, of course, is to join a trade-union.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32890">
     “Yes,” Barrow said, “that is the thing for you to do--if you can.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32910">
     “If I can? Is it difficult?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32930">
     “Well, Yes,” Barrow said, “it's sometimes difficult--in fact, very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32940">
     difficult. But you can try, and of course it will be best to try.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32960">
     Therefore Tracy tried; but he did not succeed. He was refused admission
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32970">
     with a good deal of promptness, and was advised to go back home, where
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32980">
     he belonged, not come here taking honest men's bread out of their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_32990">
     mouths. Tracy began to realize that the situation was desperate, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33000">
     thought made him cold to the marrow. He said to himself, “So there is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33010">
     an aristocracy of position here, and an aristocracy of prosperity, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33020">
     apparently there is also an aristocracy of the ins as opposed to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33030">
     outs, and I am with the outs. So the ranks grow daily, here. Plainly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33040">
     there are all kinds of castes here and only one that I belong to, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33050">
     outcasts.” But he couldn't even smile at his small joke, although he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33060">
     was obliged to confess that he had a rather good opinion of it. He was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33070">
     feeling so defeated and miserable by this time that he could no longer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33080">
     look with philosophical complacency on the horseplay of the young
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33090">
     fellows in the upper rooms at night. At first it had been pleasant to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33100">
     see them unbend and have a good time after having so well earned it by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33110">
     the labors of the day, but now it all rasped upon his feelings and his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33120">
     dignity. He lost patience with the spectacle. When they were feeling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33130">
     good, they shouted, they scuffled, they sang songs, they romped about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33140">
     the place like cattle, and they generally wound up with a pillow fight,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33150">
     in which they banged each other over the head, and threw the pillows in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33160">
     all directions, and every now and then he got a buffet himself; and they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33170">
     were always inviting him to join in. They called him “Johnny Bull,” and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33180">
     invited him with excessive familiarity to take a hand. At first he had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33190">
     endured all this with good nature, but latterly he had shown by his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33200">
     manner that it was distinctly distasteful to him, and very soon he saw a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33210">
     change in the manner of these young people toward him. They were souring
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33220">
     on him as they would have expressed it in their language. He had never
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33230">
     been what might be called popular. That was hardly the phrase for it; he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33240">
     had merely been liked, but now dislike for him was growing. His case
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33250">
     was not helped by the fact that he was out of luck, couldn't get work,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33260">
     didn't belong to a union, and couldn't gain admission to one. He got a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33270">
     good many slights of that small ill-defined sort that you can't quite
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33280">
     put your finger on, and it was manifest that there was only one thing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33290">
     which protected him from open insult, and that was his muscle. These
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33300">
     young people had seen him exercising, mornings, after his cold sponge
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33310">
     bath, and they had perceived by his performance and the build of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33320">
     body, that he was athletic, and also versed in boxing. He felt pretty
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33330">
     naked now, recognizing that he was shorn of all respect except respect
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33340">
     for his fists. One night when he entered his room he found about a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33350">
     dozen of the young fellows there carrying on a very lively conversation
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33360">
     punctuated with horse-laughter. The talking ceased instantly, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33370">
     frank affront of a dead silence followed. He said,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33390">
     “Good evening gentlemen,” and sat down.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33410">
     There was no response. He flushed to the temples but forced himself
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33420">
     to maintain silence. He sat there in this uncomfortable stillness some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33430">
     time, then got up and went out.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33450">
     The moment he had disappeared he heard a prodigious shout of laughter

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33460">
     break forth. He saw that their plain purpose had been to insult him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33470">
     He ascended to the flat roof, hoping to be able to cool down his spirit
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33480">
     there and get back his tranquility. He found the young tinner up there,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33490">
     alone and brooding, and entered into conversation with him. They were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33500">
     pretty fairly matched, now, in unpopularity and general ill-luck and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33510">
     misery, and they had no trouble in meeting upon this common ground with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33520">
     advantage and something of comfort to both. But Tracy's movements had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33530">
     been watched, and in a few minutes the tormentors came straggling one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33540">
     after another to the roof, where they began to stroll up and down in an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33550">
     apparently purposeless way. But presently they fell to dropping remarks
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33560">
     that were evidently aimed at Tracy, and some of them at the tinner.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33570">
     The ringleader of this little mob was a short-haired bully and amateur
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33580">
     prize-fighter named Allen, who was accustomed to lording it over the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33590">
     upper floor, and had more than once shown a disposition to make trouble
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33600">
     with Tracy. Now there was an occasional cat-call, and hootings, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33610">
     whistlings, and finally the diversion of an exchange of connected
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33620">
     remarks was introduced:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33640">
     “How many does it take to make a pair?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33660">
     “Well, two generally makes a pair, but sometimes there ain't stuff
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33670">
     enough in them to make a whole pair.” General laugh.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33690">
     “What were you saying about the English a while ago?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33710">
     “Oh, nothing, the English are all right, only--I--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33730">
     “What was it you said about them?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33750">
     “Oh, I only said they swallow well.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33770">
     “Swallow better than other people?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33790">
     “Oh, yes, the English swallow a good deal better than other people.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33810">
     “What is it they swallow best?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33830">
     “Oh, insults.” Another general laugh.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33850">
     “Pretty hard to make 'em fight, ain't it?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33870">
     “No, taint hard to make 'em fight.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33890">
     “Ain't it, really?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33910">
     “No, taint hard. It's impossible.” Another laugh.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33930">
     “This one's kind of spiritless, that's certain.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33950">
     “Couldn't be the other way--in his case.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33970">
     “Why?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_33990">
     “Don't you know the secret of his birth?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34010">
     “No! has he got a secret of his birth?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34030">
     “You bet he has.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34050">
     “What is it?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34070">
     “His father was a wax-figger.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34090">
     Allen came strolling by where the pair were sitting; stopped, and said
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34100">
     to the tinner;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34120">
     “How are you off for friends, these days?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34140">
     “Well enough off.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34160">
     “Got a good many?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34180">
     “Well, as many as I need.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34200">
     “A friend is valuable, sometimes--as a protector, you know. What do you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34210">
     reckon would happen if I was to snatch your cap off and slap you in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34220">
     face with it?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34240">
     “Please don't trouble me, Mr. Allen, I ain't doing anything to you.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34260">
     “You answer me! What do you reckon would happen?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34280">
     “Well, I don't know.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34300">
     Tracy spoke up with a good deal of deliberation and said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34320">
     “Don't trouble the young fellow, I can tell you what would happen.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34340">
     “Oh, you can, can you? Boys, Johnny Bull can tell us what would happen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34350">
     if I was to snatch this chump's cap off and slap him in the face with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34360">
     it. Now you'll see.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34380">
     He snatched the cap and struck the youth in the face, and before he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34390">
     could inquire what was going to happen, it had already happened, and he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34400">
     was warming the tin with the broad of his back. Instantly there was a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34410">
     rush, and shouts of:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34430">
     “A ring, a ring, make a ring! Fair play all round! Johnny's grit; give
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34440">
     him a chance.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34460">
     The ring was quickly chalked on the tin, and Tracy found himself as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34470">
     eager to begin as he could have been if his antagonist had been a prince
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34480">
     instead of a mechanic. At bottom he was a little surprised at this,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34490">
     because although his theories had been all in that direction for some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34500">
     time, he was not prepared to find himself actually eager to measure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34510">
     strength with quite so common a man as this ruffian. In a moment all the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34520">
     windows in the neighborhood were filled with people, and the roofs also.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34530">
     The men squared off, and the fight began. But Allen stood no chance
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34540">
     whatever, against the young Englishman. Neither in muscle nor in science
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34550">
     was he his equal. He measured his length on the tin time and again; in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34560">
     fact, as fast as he could get up he went down again, and the applause
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34570">
     was kept up in liberal fashion from all the neighborhood around.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34580">
     Finally, Allen had to be helped up. Then Tracy declined to punish him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34590">
     further and the fight was at an end. Allen was carried off by some of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34600">
     his friends in a very much humbled condition, his face black and blue
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34610">
     and bleeding, and Tracy was at once surrounded by the young fellows,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34620">
     who congratulated him, and told him that he had done the whole house
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34630">
     a service, and that from this out Mr. Allen would be a little more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34640">
     particular about how he handled slights and insults and maltreatment
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34650">
     around amongst the boarders.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34670">
     Tracy was a hero now, and exceedingly popular. Perhaps nobody had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34680">
     ever been quite so popular on that upper floor before. But if being
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34690">
     discountenanced by these young fellows had been hard to bear, their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34700">
     lavish commendations and approval and hero-worship were harder still to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34710">
     endure. He felt degraded, but he did not allow himself to analyze the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34720">
     reasons why, too closely. He was content to satisfy himself with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34730">
     the suggestion that he looked upon himself as degraded by the public
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34740">
     spectacle which he had made of himself, fighting on a tin roof, for the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34750">
     delectation of everybody a block or two around. But he wasn't entirely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34760">
     satisfied with that explanation of it. Once he went a little too far
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34770">
     and wrote in his diary that his case was worse than that of the prodigal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34780">
     son. He said the prodigal son merely fed swine, he didn't have to chum
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34790">
     with them. But he struck that out, and said “All men are equal. I will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34800">
     not disown my principles. These men are as good as I am.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34820">
     Tracy was become popular on the lower floors also. Everybody was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34830">
     grateful for Allen's reduction to the ranks, and for his transformation
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34840">
     from a doer of outrages to a mere threatener of them. The young girls,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34850">
     of whom there were half a dozen, showed many attentions to Tracy,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34860">
     particularly that boarding house pet Hattie, the landlady's daughter.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34870">
     She said to him, very sweetly,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34890">
     “I think you're ever so nice.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34910">
     And when he said, “I'm glad you think so, Miss Hattie,” she said, still
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34920">
     more sweetly,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34940">
     “Don't call me Miss Hattie--call me Puss.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34960">
     Ah, here was promotion! He had struck the summit. There were no higher
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34970">
     heights to climb in that boarding house. His popularity was complete.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_34990">
     In the presence of people, Tracy showed a tranquil outside, but his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35000">
     heart was being eaten out of him by distress and despair.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35020">
     In a little while he should be out of money, and then what should he do?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35030">
     He wished, now, that he had borrowed a little more liberally from that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35040">
     stranger's store. He found it impossible to sleep. A single torturing,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35050">
     terrifying thought went racking round and round in his head, wearing a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35060">
     groove in his brain: What should he do--What was to become of him? And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35070">
     along with it began to intrude a something presently which was very like
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35080">
     a wish that he had not joined the great and noble ranks of martyrdom,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35090">
     but had stayed at home and been content to be merely an earl and nothing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35100">
     better, with nothing more to do in this world of a useful sort than an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35110">
     earl finds to do. But he smothered that part of his thought as well as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35120">
     he could; he made every effort to drive it away, and with fair success,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35130">
     but he couldn't keep it from intruding a little now and then, and when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35140">
     it intruded it came suddenly and nipped him like a bite, a sting, a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35150">
     burn. He recognized that thought by the peculiar sharpness of its pang.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35160">
     The others were painful enough, but that one cut to the quick when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35170">
     it came. Night after night he lay tossing to the music of the hideous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35180">
     snoring of the honest bread-winners until two and three o'clock in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35190">
     morning, then got up and took refuge on the roof, where he sometimes got
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35200">
     a nap and sometimes failed entirely. His appetite was leaving him and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35210">
     the zest of life was going along with it. Finally, one day, being near
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35220">
     the imminent verge of total discouragement, he said to himself--and took
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35230">
     occasion to blush privately when he said it, “If my father knew what my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35240">
     American name is,--he--well, my duty to my father rather requires that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35250">
     I furnish him my name. I have no right to make his days and nights
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35260">
     unhappy, I can do enough unhappiness for the family all by myself.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35270">
     Really he ought to know what my American name is.” He thought over it a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35280">
     while and framed a cablegram in his mind to this effect:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35300">
     “My American name is Howard Tracy.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35320">
     That wouldn't be suggesting anything. His father could understand that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35330">
     as he chose, and doubtless he would understand it as it was meant, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35340">
     a dutiful and affectionate desire on the part of a son to make his old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35350">
     father happy for a moment. Continuing his train of thought, Tracy said
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35360">
     to himself, “Ah, but if he should cable me to come home! I--I--couldn't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35370">
     do that--I mustn't do that. I've started out on a mission, and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35380">
     mustn't turn my back on it in cowardice. No, no, I couldn't go home,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35390">
     at--at--least I shouldn't want to go home.” After a reflective pause:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35400">
     “Well, maybe--perhaps--it would be my duty to go in the circumstances;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35410">
     he's very old and he does need me by him to stay his footsteps down the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35420">
     long hill that inclines westward toward the sunset of his life. Well,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35430">
     I'll think about that. Yes, of course it wouldn't be right to stay here.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35440">
     If I--well, perhaps I could just drop him a line and put it off a little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35450">
     while and satisfy him in that way. It would be--well, it would mar
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35460">
     everything to have him require me to come instantly.” Another reflective
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35470">
     pause--then: “And yet if he should do that I don't know but--oh, dear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35480">
     me--home! how good it sounds! and a body is excusable for wanting to see
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35490">
     his home again, now and then, anyway.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35510">
     He went to one of the telegraph offices in the avenue and got the first
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35520">
     end of what Barrow called the “usual Washington courtesy,” where “they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35530">
     treat you as a tramp until they find out you're a congressman, and then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35540">
     they slobber all over you.” There was a boy of seventeen on duty there,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35550">
     tying his shoe. He had his foot on a chair and his back turned toward
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35560">
     the wicket. He glanced over his shoulder, took Tracy's measure, turned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35570">
     back, and went on tying his shoe. Tracy finished writing his telegram
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35580">
     and waited, still waited, and still waited, for that performance to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35590">
     finish, but there didn't seem to be any finish to it; so finally Tracy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35600">
     said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35620">
     “Can't you take my telegram?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35640">
     The youth looked over his shoulder and said, by his manner, not his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35650">
     words:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35670">
     “Don't you think you could wait a minute, if you tried?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35690">
     However, he got the shoe tied at last, and came and took the telegram,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35700">
     glanced over it, then looked up surprised, at Tracy. There was something
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35710">
     in his look that bordered upon respect, almost reverence, it seemed to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35720">
     Tracy, although he had been so long without anything of this kind he was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35730">
     not sure that he knew the signs of it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35750">
     The boy read the address aloud, with pleased expression in face and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35760">
     voice.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35780">
     “The Earl of Rossmore! Cracky! Do you know him?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35800">
     “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35820">
     “Is that so! Does he know you?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35840">
     “Well--yes.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35860">
     “Well, I swear! Will he answer you?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35880">
     “I think he will.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35900">
     “Will he though? Where'll you have it sent?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35920">
     “Oh, nowhere. I'll call here and get it. When shall I call?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35940">
     “Oh, I don't know--I'll send it to you. Where shall I send it? Give me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35950">
     your address; I'll send it to you soon's it comes.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35970">
     But Tracy didn't propose to do this. He had acquired the boy's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35980">
     admiration and deferential respect, and he wasn't willing to throw these
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_35990">
     precious things away, a result sure to follow if he should give the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36000">
     address of that boarding house. So he said again that he would call and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36010">
     get the telegram, and went his way.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36030">
     He idled along, reflecting. He said to himself, “There is something
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36040">
     pleasant about being respected. I have acquired the respect of Mr. Allen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36050">
     and some of those others, and almost the deference of some of them on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36060">
     pure merit, for having thrashed Allen. While their respect and their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36070">
     deference--if it is deference--is pleasant, a deference based upon a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36080">
     sham, a shadow, does really seem pleasanter still. It's no real merit to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36090">
     be in correspondence with an earl, and yet after all, that boy makes me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36100">
     feel as if there was.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36120">
     The cablegram was actually gone home! the thought of it gave him an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36130">
     immense uplift. He walked with a lighter tread. His heart was full of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36140">
     happiness. He threw aside all hesitances and confessed to himself
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36150">
     that he was glad through and through that he was going to give up this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36160">
     experiment and go back to his home again. His eagerness to get his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36170">
     father's answer began to grow, now, and it grew with marvelous celerity,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36180">
     after it began. He waited an hour, walking about, putting in his time as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36190">
     well as he could, but interested in nothing that came under his eye, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36200">
     at last he presented himself at the office again and asked if any answer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36210">
     had come yet. The boy said,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36230">
     “No, no answer yet,” then glanced at the clock and added, “I don't think
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36240">
     it's likely you'll get one to-day.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36260">
     “Why not?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36280">
     “Well, you see it's getting pretty late. You can't always tell where
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36290">
     'bouts a man is when he's on the other side, and you can't always find
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36300">
     him just the minute you want him, and you see it's getting about six
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36310">
     o'clock now, and over there it's pretty late at night.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36330">
     “Why yes,” said Tracy, “I hadn't thought of that.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36350">
     “Yes, pretty late, now, half past ten or eleven. Oh yes, you probably
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36360">
     won't get any answer to-night.”

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36430">
     So Tracy went home to supper. The odors in that supper room seemed more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36440">
     strenuous and more horrible than ever before, and he was happy in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36450">
     thought that he was so soon to be free from them again. When the supper
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36460">
     was over he hardly knew whether he had eaten any of it or not, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36470">
     he certainly hadn't heard any of the conversation. His heart had been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36480">
     dancing all the time, his thoughts had been faraway from these things,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36490">
     and in the visions of his mind the sumptuous appointments of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36500">
     father's castle had risen before him without rebuke. Even the plushed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36510">
     flunkey, that walking symbol of a sham inequality, had not been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36520">
     unpleasant to his dreaming view. After the meal Barrow said,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36540">
     “Come with me. I'll give you a jolly evening.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36560">
     “Very good. Where are you going?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36580">
     “To my club.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36600">
     “What club is that?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36620">
     “Mechanics' Debating Club.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36640">
     Tracy shuddered, slightly. He didn't say anything about having visited
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36650">
     that place himself. Somehow he didn't quite relish the memory of that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36660">
     time. The sentiments which had made his former visit there so enjoyable,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36670">
     and filled him with such enthusiasm, had undergone a gradual change,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36680">
     and they had rotted away to such a degree that he couldn't contemplate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36690">
     another visit there with anything strongly resembling delight. In fact
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36700">
     he was a little ashamed to go; he didn't want to go there and find out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36710">
     by the rude impact of the thought of those people upon his reorganized
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36720">
     condition of mind, how sharp the change had been. He would have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36730">
     preferred to stay away. He expected that now he should hear nothing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36740">
     except sentiments which would be a reproach to him in his changed mental
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36750">
     attitude, and he rather wished he might be excused. And yet he didn't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36760">
     quite want to say that, he didn't want to show how he did feel, or show
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36770">
     any disinclination to go, and so he forced himself to go along with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36780">
     Barrow, privately purposing to take an early opportunity to get away.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36800">
     After the essayist of the evening had read his paper, the chairman
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36810">
     announced that the debate would now be upon the subject of the previous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36820">
     meeting, “The American Press.” It saddened the backsliding disciple to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36830">
     hear this announcement. It brought up too many reminiscences. He wished
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36840">
     he had happened upon some other subject. But the debate began, and he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36850">
     sat still and listened.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36870">
     In the course of the discussion one of the speakers--a blacksmith named
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36880">
     Tompkins arraigned all monarchs and all lords in the earth for their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36890">
     cold selfishness in retaining their unearned dignities. He said that no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36900">
     monarch and no son of a monarch, no lord and no son of a lord ought
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36910">
     to be able to look his fellow man in the face without shame. Shame for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36920">
     consenting to keep his unearned titles, property, and privileges--at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36930">
     expense of other people; shame for consenting to remain, on any terms,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36940">
     in dishonourable possession of these things, which represented bygone
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36950">
     robberies and wrongs inflicted upon the general people of the nation. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36960">
     said, “if there were a lord or the son of a lord here, I would like
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36970">
     to reason with him, and try to show him how unfair and how selfish his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36980">
     position is. I would try to persuade him to relinquish it, take his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_36990">
     place among men on equal terms, earn the bread he eats, and hold of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_37000">
     slight value all deference paid him because of artificial position, all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_37010">
     reverence not the just due of his own personal merits.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_37030">
     Tracy seemed to be listening to utterances of his own made in talks
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_37040">
     with his radical friends in England. It was as if some eavesdropping
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_37050">
     phonograph had treasured up his words and brought them across the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_37060">
     Atlantic to accuse him with them in the hour of his defection and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_37070">
     retreat. Every word spoken by this stranger seemed to leave a blister on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_37080">
     Tracy's conscience, and by the time the speech was finished he felt that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_37090">
     he was all conscience and one blister. This man's deep compassion for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_37100">
     the enslaved and oppressed millions in Europe who had to bear with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_37110">
     contempt of that small class above them, throned upon shining heights
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_37120">
     whose paths were shut against them, was the very thing he had often
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_37130">
     uttered himself. The pity in this man's voice and words was the very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_37140">
     twin of the pity that used to reside in his own heart and come from his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_37150">
     own lips when he thought of these oppressed peoples.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_37170">
     The homeward tramp was accomplished in brooding silence. It was a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_37180">
     silence most grateful to Tracy's feelings. He wouldn't have broken it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_37190">
     for anything; for he was ashamed of himself all the way through to his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_37200">
     spine. He kept saying to himself:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_37220">
     “How unanswerable it all is--how absolutely unanswerable! It is basely,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_37230">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39290">
     if he had thought of it, that his bearing had stiffened, over night, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39300">
     that his chin had lifted itself a shade. Arrived in the basement, he was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39310">
     about to enter the breakfast room when he saw old Marsh in the dim light
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39320">
     of a corner of the hall, beckoning him with his finger to approach. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39330">
     blood welled slowly up in Tracy's cheek, and he said with a grade of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39340">
     injured dignity almost ducal:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39360">
     “Is that for me?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39380">
     “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39400">
     “What is the purpose of it?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39420">
     “I want to speak to you--in private.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39440">
     “This spot is private enough for me.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39460">
     Marsh was surprised; and not particularly pleased. He approached and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39470">
     said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39490">
     “Oh, in public, then, if you prefer. Though it hasn't been my way.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39510">
     The boarders gathered to the spot, interested.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39530">
     “Speak out,” said Tracy. “What is it you want?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39550">
     “Well, haven't you--er--forgot something?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39570">
     “I? I'm not aware of it.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39590">
     “Oh, you're not? Now you stop and think, a minute.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39610">
     “I refuse to stop and think. It doesn't interest me. If it interests
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39620">
     you, speak out.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39640">
     “Well, then,” said Marsh, raising his voice to a slightly angry pitch,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39650">
     “You forgot to pay your board yesterday--if you're bound to have it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39660">
     public.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39680">
     Oh, yes, this heir to an annual million or so had been dreaming and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39690">
     soaring, and had forgotten that pitiful three or four dollars. For
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39700">
     penalty he must have it coarsely flung in his face in the presence of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39710">
     these people--people in whose countenances was already beginning to dawn
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39720">
     an uncharitable enjoyment of the situation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39740">
     “Is that all! Take your money and give your terrors a rest.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39760">
     Tracy's hand went down into his pocket with angry decision. But--it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39770">
     didn't come out. The color began to ebb out of his face. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39780">
     countenances about him showed a growing interest; and some of them
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39790">
     a heightened satisfaction. There was an uncomfortable pause--then he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39800">
     forced out, with difficulty, the words:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39820">
     “I've--been robbed!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39840">
     Old Marsh's eyes flamed up with Spanish fire, and he exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39860">
     “Robbed, is it? That's your tune? It's too old--been played in this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39870">
     house too often; everybody plays it that can't get work when he wants
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39880">
     it, and won't work when he can get it. Trot out Mr. Allen, somebody,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39890">
     and let him take a toot at it. It's his turn next, he forgot, too, last
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39900">
     night. I'm laying for him.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39920">
     One of the negro women came scrambling down stairs as pale as a sorrel
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39930">
     horse with consternation and excitement:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39950">
     “Misto Marsh, Misto Allen's skipped out!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39970">
     “What!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_39990">
     “Yes-sah, and cleaned out his room clean; tuck bofe towels en de soap!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40010">
     “You lie, you hussy!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40030">
     “It's jes' so, jes' as I tells you--en Misto Summer's socks is gone, en
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40040">
     Misto Naylor's yuther shirt.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40060">
     Mr. Marsh was at boiling point by this time. He turned upon Tracy:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40080">
     “Answer up now--when are you going to settle?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40100">
     “To-day--since you seem to be in a hurry.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40120">
     “To-day is it? Sunday--and you out of work? I like that. Come--where are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40130">
     you going to get the money?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40150">
     Tracy's spirit was rising again. He proposed to impress these people:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40170">
     “I am expecting a cablegram from home.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40190">
     Old Marsh was caught out, with the surprise of it. The idea was so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40200">
     immense, so extravagant, that he couldn't get his breath at first. When
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40210">
     he did get it, it came rancid with sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40230">
     “A cablegram--think of it, ladies and gents, he's expecting a cablegram!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40240">
     He's expecting a cablegram--this duffer, this scrub, this bilk! From
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40250">
     his father--eh? Yes--without a doubt. A dollar or two a word--oh, that's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40260">
     nothing--they don't mind a little thing like that--this kind's fathers
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40270">
     don't. Now his father is--er--well, I reckon his father--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40290">
     “My father is an English earl!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40310">
     The crowd fell back aghast-aghast at the sublimity of the young loafer's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40320">
     “cheek.” Then they burst into a laugh that made the windows rattle.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40330">
     Tracy was too angry to realize that he had done a foolish thing. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40340">
     said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40360">
     “Stand aside, please. I--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40380">
     “Wait a minute, your lordship,” said Marsh, bowing low, “where is your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40390">
     lordship going?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40410">
     “For the cablegram. Let me pass.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40430">
     “Excuse me, your lordship, you'll stay right where you are.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40450">
     “What do you mean by that?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40470">
     “I mean that I didn't begin to keep boarding-house yesterday. It means
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40480">
     that I am not the kind that can be taken in by every hack-driver's son
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40490">
     that comes loafing over here because he can't bum a living at home. It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40500">
     means that you can't skip out on any such--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40520">
     Tracy made a step toward the old man, but Mrs. Marsh sprang between, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40530">
     said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40550">
     “Don't, Mr. Tracy, please.” She turned to her husband and said, “Do
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40560">
     bridle your tongue. What has he done to be treated so? Can't you see he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40570">
     has lost his mind, with trouble and distress? He's not responsible.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40590">
     “Thank your kind heart, madam, but I've not lost my mind; and if I can
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40600">
     have the mere privilege of stepping to the telegraph office--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40620">
     “Well, you can't,” cried Marsh.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40640">
     “--or sending--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40660">
     “Sending! That beats everything. If there's anybody that's fool enough
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40670">
     to go on such a chuckle-headed errand--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40690">
     “Here comes Mr. Barrow--he will go for me. Barrow--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40710">
     A brisk fire of exclamations broke out--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40730">
     “Say, Barrow, he's expecting a cablegram!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40750">
     “Cablegram from his father, you know!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40770">
     “Yes--cablegram from the wax-figger!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40790">
     “And say, Barrow, this fellow's an earl--take off your hat, pull down
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40800">
     your vest!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40820">
     “Yes, he's come off and forgot his crown, that he wears Sundays. He's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40830">
     cabled over to his pappy to send it.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40850">
     “You step out and get that cablegram, Barrow; his majesty's a little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40860">
     lame to-day.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40880">
     “Oh stop,” cried Barrow; “give the man a chance.” He turned, and said
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40890">
     with some severity, “Tracy, what's the matter with you? What kind of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40900">
     foolishness is this you've been talking. You ought to have more sense.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40920">
     “I've not been talking foolishness; and if you'll go to the telegraph
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40930">
     office--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40950">
     “Oh; don't talk so. I'm your friend in trouble and out of it, before
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40960">
     your face and behind your back, for anything in reason; but you've lost
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40970">
     your head, you see, and this moonshine about a cablegram--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_40990">
     “I'll go there and ask for it!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41010">
     “Thank you from the bottom of my heart, Brady. Here, I'll give you a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41020">
     Written order for it. Fly, now, and fetch it. We'll soon see!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41040">
     Brady flew. Immediately the sort of quiet began to steal over the crowd
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41050">
     which means dawning doubt, misgiving; and might be translated into the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41060">
     words, “Maybe he is expecting a cablegram--maybe he has got a father
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41070">
     somewhere--maybe we've been just a little too fresh, just a shade too
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41080">
     'previous'!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41100">
     Loud talk ceased; then the mutterings and low murmurings and whisperings
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41110">
     died out. The crowd began to crumble apart. By ones and twos the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41120">
     fragments drifted to the breakfast table. Barrow tried to bring Tracy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41130">
     in; but he said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41150">
     “Not yet, Barrow--presently.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41170">
     Mrs. Marsh and Hattie tried, offering gentle and kindly persuasions; but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41180">
     he said;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41200">
     “I would rather wait--till he comes.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41220">
     Even old Marsh began to have suspicions that maybe he had been a trifle
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41230">
     too “brash,” as he called it in the privacy of his soul, and he pulled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41240">
     himself together and started toward Tracy with invitation in his eyes;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41250">
     but Tracy warned him off with a gesture which was quite positive and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41260">
     eloquent. Then followed the stillest quarter of an hour which had ever
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41270">
     been known in that house at that time of day. It was so still, and so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41280">
     solemn withal, that when somebody's cup slipped from his fingers and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41290">
     landed in his plate the shock made people start, and the sharp sound
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41300">
     seemed as indecorous there and as out of place as if a coffin and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41310">
     mourners were imminent and being waited for. And at last when Brady's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41320">
     feet came clattering down the stairs the sacrilege seemed unbearable.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41330">
     Everybody rose softly and turned toward the door, where stood Tracy;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41340">
     then with a common impulse, moved a step or two in that direction, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41350">
     stopped. While they gazed, young Brady arrived, panting, and put
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41360">
     into Tracy's hand,--sure enough--an envelope. Tracy fastened a bland
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41370">
     victorious eye upon the gazers, and kept it there till one by one they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41380">
     dropped their eyes, vanquished and embarrassed. Then he tore open the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41390">
     telegram and glanced at its message. The yellow paper fell from his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41400">
     fingers and fluttered to the floor, and his face turned white. There was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41410">
     nothing there but one word--

     apprehension it had brought upon itself by its own too rash freshness
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41610">

     its funniness and the interest of the show died out, along with the

     Finally Marsh was about to take an innings, but Barrow said:

     “Never mind, now--leave him alone. You've no account with him but a

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41770">
     kiss from the tips of her fingers and said, with the darlingest smile
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41780">
     and a sweet little toss of her head:

     “You're the only man here, and I'm going to set my cap for you, you dear

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41850">
     It took a good deal of argument and persuasion--that is to say, petting,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41860">
     under these disguises--to get Tracy to entertain the idea of breakfast.

     He at first said he would never eat again in that house; and added that

     he had enough firmness of character, he trusted, to enable him to starve

     When he had finished his breakfast, Barrow took him to his room,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41920">
     furnished him a pipe, and said cheerily:
    </p>

     “Now, old fellow, take in your battle-flag out of the wet, you're not in

     the hostile camp any more. You're a little upset by your troubles, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41960">
     that's natural enough, but don't let your mind run on them anymore than

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41970">
     you can help; drag your thoughts away from your troubles by the ears, by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41980">
     the heels, or any other way, so you manage it; it's the healthiest thing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_41990">
     a body can do; dwelling on troubles is deadly, just deadly--and that's
    </p>

     the softest name there is for it. You must keep your mind amused--you

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42050">
     “Don't! There's just pure heart-break in that tone. It's just as I say;

     you've got to get right down to it and amuse your mind, as if it was

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42090">
     “They're easy words to say, Barrow, but how am I going to amuse,

     No--no, the bare idea of amusement is repulsive to my feelings: Let us

     Brady arrived with a box, and departed, after saying, “They're finishing

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42310">
     Barrow took a frameless oil portrait a foot square from the box, set it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42320">
     up in a good light, without comment, and reached for another, taking a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42330">
     furtive glance at Tracy, meantime. The stony solemnity in Tracy's face
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42340">
     remained as it was, and gave out no sign of interest. Barrow placed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42350">
     the second portrait beside the first, and stole another glance while
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42360">
     reaching for a third. The stone image softened, a shade. No. 3 forced

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42370">
     the ghost of a smile, No. 4 swept indifference wholly away, and No. 5
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42380">

     “Oh, you're all right, yet,” said Barrow. “You see you're not past

     amusement.”

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42440">
     The pictures were fearful, as to color, and atrocious as to drawing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42450">
     and expression; but the feature which squelched animosity and made them
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42460">
     funny was a feature which could not achieve its full force in a single
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42470">
     picture, but required the wonder-working assistance of repetition. One

     loudly dressed mechanic in stately attitude, with his hand on a cannon,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42490">
     ashore, and a ship riding at anchor in the offing,--this is merely odd;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42500">
     but when one sees the same cannon and the same ship in fourteen pictures

     in a row, and a different mechanic standing watch in each, the thing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42520">
     gets to be funny.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42540">
     “Explain--explain these aberrations,” said Tracy.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42560">
     “Well, they are not the achievement of a single intellect, a single
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42570">
     talent--it takes two to do these miracles. They are collaborations; the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42580">
     one artist does the figure, the other the accessories. The figure-artist

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42600">
     simple hearted old Yankee sailor-man whose possibilities are strictly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42610">
     limited to his ship, his cannon and his patch of petrified sea. They
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42620">
     work these things up from twenty-five-cent tintypes; they get six
    </p>

     dollars apiece for them, and they can grind out a couple a day when they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42640">
     strike what they call a boost--that is, an inspiration.”

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42700">
     whirl a horse in, or a piano, or a guitar, in place of his cannon. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42710">
     fact is, he fatigues the market with that cannon. Even the male market,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42720">
     I mean. These fourteen in the procession are not all satisfied. One is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42730">
     an old 'independent' fireman, and he wants an engine in place of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42740">
     cannon; another is a mate of a tug, and wants a tug in place of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42750">
     ship --and so on, and so on. But the captain can't make a tug that is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42760">
     deceptive, and a fire engine is many flights beyond his power.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42780">
     “This is a most extraordinary form of robbery, I never have heard of
    </p>

     anything like it. It's interesting.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42810">
     “Yes, and so are the artists. They are perfectly honest men, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42820">
     sincere. And the old sailor-man is full of sound religion, and is as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42830">
     devoted a student of the Bible and misquoter of it as you can find
    </p>

     Saltmarsh, although he does swear a little, sometimes.”

     “He seems to be perfect. I want to know him, Barrow.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42890">
     “You'll have the chance. I guess I hear them coming, now. We'll draw

     them out on their art, if you like.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42920">
     The artists arrived and shook hands with great heartiness. The German
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42930">
     was forty and a little fleshy, with a shiny bald head and a kindly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42940">
     face and deferential manner. Capt. Saltmarsh was sixty, tall, erect,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42950">
     powerfully built, with coal-black hair and whiskers, and he had a well
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42960">
     tanned complexion, and a gait and countenance that were full of command,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42970">
     confidence and decision. His horny hands and wrists were covered with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42980">
     tattoo-marks, and when his lips parted, his teeth showed up white and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_42990">
     blemishless. His voice was the effortless deep bass of a church organ,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_43000">
     and would disturb the tranquility of a gas flame fifty yards away.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_43020">
     “They're wonderful pictures,” said Barrow. “We've been examining them.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_43040">
     “It is very bleasant dot you like dem,” said Handel, the German,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_43050">
     greatly pleased. “Und you, Herr Tracy, you haf peen bleased mit dem too,

     alretty?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_43080">
     “I can honestly say I have never seen anything just like them before.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_43100">
     “Schon!” cried the German, delighted. “You hear, Gaptain? Here is a

     chentleman, yes, vot abbreviate unser aart.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_43130">
     The captain was charmed, and said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_43150">
     “Well, sir, we're thankful for a compliment yet, though they're not as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_43160">
     scarce now as they used to be before we made a reputation.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_43180">
     “Getting the reputation is the up-hill time in most things, captain.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_43200">
     “It's so. It ain't enough to know how to reef a gasket, you got to make
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_43210">
     the mate know you know it. That's reputation. The good word, said at the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_43220">
     right time, that's the word that makes us; and evil be to him that evil

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_43230">
     thinks, as Isaiah says.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_43250">
     “It's very relevant, and hits the point exactly,” said Tracy.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_43270">
     “Where did you study art, Captain?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_43290">
     “I haven't studied; it's a natural gift.”

     The artists presently took their leave. Then Barrow put his hands on

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_44650">
     Tracy's shoulders and said:

     of the chairmaker's charity--this was bad enough, but his folly in

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_45030">
     things was a sharper torture still. He made up his mind that he would

     never play earl's son again before a doubtful audience.

     His father's answer was a blow he could not understand. At times he

     thought his father imagined he could get work to do in America without

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_45110">
     that pleased him better was, that this cablegram would be followed by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_45120">
     another, of a gentler sort, requiring him to come home. Should he write

     nearly a week, and asked if there was a cablegram for Howard Tracy. No,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_45170">
     there wasn't any. So they answered him at first. Later, they said it

     of the Czar.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49340">
     “Come, that sounds like exaggeration.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49360">
     “Well, it's what they say anyway. But I think, myself, it's a lie. And

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49390">
     He paused, and his breast began to heave and his eye to burn, under the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49400">
     impulse of strong emotion. Then his words began to stream forth, with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49410">
     constantly increasing energy and fire, and he rose to his feet as if to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49420">
     give himself larger freedom. “The minute I organize that republic, the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49510">
     He stood a moment bereft of earthly consciousness by his exaltation;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49520">
     then consciousness returned, bringing him a slight shock, and he said
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49530">
     with grave earnestness:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49550">
     “I must ask you to pardon me, Major Hawkins. I have never used that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49560">
     expression before, and I beg you will forgive it this time.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49580">
     Hawkins was quite willing.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49600">
     “You see, Washington, it is an error which I am by nature not liable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49610">
     to. Only excitable people, impulsive people, are exposed to it. But

     the circumstances of the present case--I being a democrat by birth and

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49650">
     The earl stopped suddenly, his frame stiffened, and he began to stare
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49660">
     speechless through the curtainless window. Then he pointed, and gasped
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49670">
     out a single rapturous word:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49690">
     “Look!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49710">
     “What is it, Colonel?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49730">
     “IT!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49750">
     “No!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49770">
     “Sure as you're born. Keep perfectly still. I'll apply the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49780">
     influence--I'll turn on all my force. I've brought It thus far--I'll
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49790">
     fetch It right into the house. You'll see.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49810">
     He was making all sorts of passes in the air with his hands.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49830">
     “There! Look at that. I've made It smile! See?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49850">
     Quite true. Tracy, out for an afternoon stroll, had come unexpectantly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49860">
     upon his family arms displayed upon this shabby house-front. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49870">
     hatchments made him smile; which was nothing, they had made the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49880">
     neighborhood cats do that.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49900">
     “Look, Hawkins, look! I'm drawing It over!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49920">
     “You're drawing it sure, Rossmore. If I ever had any doubts about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49930">
     materialization, they're gone, now, and gone for good. Oh, this is a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49940">
     joyful day!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49960">
     Tracy was sauntering over to read the door-plate. Before he was half way
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49970">
     over he was saying to himself, “Why, manifestly these are the American
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_49980">
     Claimant's quarters.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50000">
     “It's coming--coming right along. I'll slide, down and pull It in. You
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50010">
     follow after me.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50030">
     Sellers, pale and a good deal agitated, opened the door and confronted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50040">
     Tracy. The old man could not at once get his voice: then he pumped out a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50050">
     scattering and hardly coherent salutation, and followed it with--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50070">
     “Walk in, walk right in, Mr.--er--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50090">
     “Tracy--Howard Tracy.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50110">
     “Tracy--thanks--walk right in, you're expected.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50130">
     Tracy entered, considerably puzzled, and said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50150">
     “Expected? I think there must be some mistake.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50170">
     “Oh, I judge not,” said Sellers, who--noticing that Hawkins had arrived,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50180">
     gave him a sidewise glance intended to call his close attention to a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50190">
     dramatic effect which he was proposing to produce by his next remark.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50200">
     Then he said, slowly and impressively--“I am--YOU KNOW WHO.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50220">
     To the astonishment of both conspirators the remark produced no dramatic
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50230">
     effect at all; for the new-comer responded with a quite innocent and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50240">
     unembarrassed air--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50260">
     “No, pardon me. I don't know who you are. I only suppose--but no doubt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50270">
     correctly--that you are the gentleman whose title is on the doorplate.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50290">
     “Right, quite right--sit down, pray sit down.” The earl was rattled,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50300">
     thrown off his bearings, his head was in a whirl. Then he noticed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50310">
     Hawkins standing apart and staring idiotically at what to him was the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50320">
     apparition of a defunct man, and a new idea was born to him. He said to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50330">
     Tracy briskly:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50350">
     “But a thousand pardons, dear sir, I am forgetting courtesies due to a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50360">
     guest and stranger. Let me introduce my friend General Hawkins--General
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50370">
     Hawkins, our new Senator--Senator from the latest and grandest addition
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50380">
     to the radiant galaxy of sovereign States, Cherokee Strip”--(to himself,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50390">
     “that name will shrivel him up!”--but it didn't, in the least, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50400">
     the Colonel resumed the introduction piteously disheartened and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50410">
     amazed),--“Senator Hawkins, Mr. Howard Tracy, of--er--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50430">
     “England.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50450">
     “England!--Why that's im--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50470">
     “England, yes, native of England.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50490">
     “Recently from there?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50510">
     “Yes, quite recently.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50530">
     Said the Colonel to himself, “This phantom lies like an expert.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50540">
     Purifying this kind by fire don't work. I'll sound him a little further,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50550">
     give him another chance or two to work his gift.” Then aloud--with deep
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50560">
     irony--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50580">
     “Visiting our great country for recreation and amusement, no doubt. I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50590">
     suppose you find that traveling in the majestic expanses of our Far West
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50600">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50620">
     “I haven't been West, and haven't been devoting myself to amusement with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50630">
     any sort of exclusiveness, I assure you. In fact, to merely live, an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50640">
     artist has got to work, not play.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50660">
     “Artist!” said Hawkins to himself, thinking of the rifled bank; “that is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50670">
     a name for it!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50690">
     “Are you an artist?” asked the colonel; and added to himself, “now I'm
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50700">
     going to catch him.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50720">
     “In a humble way, yes.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50740">
     “What line?” pursued the sly veteran.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50760">
     “Oils.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50780">
     “I've got him!” said Sellers to himself. Then aloud, “This is fortunate.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50790">
     Could I engage you to restore some of my paintings that need that

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50820">
     “I shall be very glad. Pray let me see them.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50840">
     No shuffling, no evasion, no embarrassment, even under this crucial
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50850">
     test. The Colonel was nonplussed. He led Tracy to a chromo which had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50860">
     suffered damage in a former owner's hands through being used as a lamp
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50870">
     mat, and said, with a flourish of his hand toward the picture--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50890">
     “This del Sarto--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50910">
     “Is that a del Sarto?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50930">
     The colonel bent a look of reproach upon Tracy, allowed it to sink home,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50940">
     then resumed as if there had been no interruption--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50960">
     “This del Sarto is perhaps the only original of that sublime master

     in our country. You see, yourself, that the work is of such exceeding
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_50980">
     delicacy that the risk--could--er--would you mind giving me a little

     “Cheerfully, cheerfully. I will copy one of these marvels.”

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51030">
     Water-color materials--relics of Miss Sally's college life--were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51040">
     brought. Tracy said he was better in oils, but would take a chance with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51050">
     these. So he was left alone. He began his work, but the attractions
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51060">
     of the place were too strong for him, and he got up and went drifting

     about, fascinated; also amazed.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51170">
     “The mystery that bothers me, is, where did It get its other arm?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51190">
     “Yes--it worries me, too. And another thing troubles me--the apparition
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51200">
     is English. How do you account for that, Colonel?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51220">
     “Honestly, I don't know, Hawkins, I don't really know. It is very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51230">
     confusing and awful.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51250">
     “Don't you think maybe we've waked up the wrong one?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51270">
     “The wrong one? How do you account for the clothes?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51290">
     “The clothes are right, there's no getting around it. What are we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51300">
     going to do? We can't collect, as I see. The reward is for a one-armed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51310">
     American. This is a two-armed Englishman.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51330">
     “Well, it may be that that is not objectionable. You see it isn't less
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51340">
     than is called for, it is more, and so,--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51360">
     But he saw that this argument was weak, and dropped it. The friends
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51370">
     sat brooding over their perplexities some time in silence. Finally
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51380">
     the earl's face began to glow with an inspiration, and he said,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51390">
     impressively:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51410">
     “Hawkins, this materialization is a grander and nobler science than we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51420">
     have dreamed of. We have little imagined what a solemn and stupendous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51430">
     thing we have done. The whole secret is perfectly clear to me, now,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51440">
     clear as day. Every man is made up of heredities, long-descended
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51450">
     atoms and particles of his ancestors. This present materialization is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51460">
     incomplete. We have only brought it down to perhaps the beginning of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51470">
     this century.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51490">
     “What do you mean, Colonel!” cried Hawkins, filled with vague alarms by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51500">
     the old man's awe-compelling words and manner.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51520">
     “This. We've materialized this burglar's ancestor!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51540">
     “Oh, don't--don't say that. It's hideous.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51560">
     “But it's true, Hawkins, I know it. Look at the facts. This apparition
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51570">
     is distinctly English--note that. It uses good grammar--note that. It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51580">
     is an Artist--note that. It has the manners and carriage of a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51590">
     gentleman--note that. Where's your cow-boy? Answer me that.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51610">
     “Rossmore, this is dreadful--it's too dreadful to think of!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51630">
     “Never resurrected a rag of that burglar but the clothes, not a solitary
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51640">
     rag of him but the clothes.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51660">
     “Colonel, do you really mean--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51680">
     The Colonel brought his fist down with emphasis and said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51700">
     “I mean exactly this. This materialization was immature, the burglar has
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51710">
     evaded us, this is nothing but a damned ancestor!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51730">
     He rose and walked the floor in great excitement.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51750">
     Hawkins said plaintively:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51770">
     “It's a bitter disappointment--bitter.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51790">
     “I know it. I know it, Senator; I feel it as deeply as anybody could.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51800">
     But we've got to submit--on moral grounds. I need money, but God knows I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51810">
     am not poor enough or shabby enough to be an accessory to the punishing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51820">
     of a man's ancestor for crimes committed by that ancestor's posterity.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51840">
     “But Colonel!” implored Hawkins; “stop and think; don't be rash; you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51850">
     know it's the only chance we've got to get the money; and besides, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51860">
     Bible itself says posterity to the fourth generation shall be punished
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51870">
     for the sins and crimes committed by ancestors four generations back
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51880">
     that hadn't anything to do with them; and so it's only fair to turn the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51890">
     rule around and make it work both ways.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51910">
     The Colonel was struck with the strong logic of this position. He strode
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51920">
     up and down, and thought it painfully over. Finally he said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51940">
     “There's reason in it; yes, there's reason in it. And so, although it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51950">
     seems a piteous thing to sweat this poor ancient devil for a burglary he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51960">
     hadn't the least hand in, still if duty commands I suppose we must give
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51970">
     him up to the authorities.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_51990">
     “I would,” said Hawkins, cheered and relieved, “I'd give him up if he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52000">
     was a thousand ancestors compacted into one.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52020">
     “Lord bless me, that's just what he is,” said Sellers, with something
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52030">
     like a groan, “it's exactly what he is; there's a contribution in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52040">
     him from every ancestor he ever had. In him there's atoms of priests,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52050">
     soldiers, crusaders, poets, and sweet and gracious women--all kinds
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52060">
     and conditions of folk who trod this earth in old, old centuries, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52070">
     vanished out of it ages ago, and now by act of ours they are summoned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52080">
     from their holy peace to answer for gutting a one-horse bank away out on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52090">
     the borders of Cherokee Strip, and it's just a howling outrage!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52110">
     “Oh, don't talk like that, Colonel; it takes the heart all out of me,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52120">
     and makes me ashamed of the part I am proposing to--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52140">
     “Wait--I've got it!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52160">
     “A saving hope? Shout it out, I am perishing.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52180">
     “It's perfectly simple; a child would have thought of it. He is all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52190">
     right, not a flaw in him, as far as I have carried the work. If I've
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52200">
     been able to bring him as far as the beginning of this century, what's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52210">
     to stop me now? I'll go on and materialize him down to date.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52230">
     “Land, I never thought of that!” said Hawkins all ablaze with joy again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52240">
     “It's the very thing. What a brain you have got! And will he shed the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52250">
     superfluous arm?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52270">
     “He will.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52290">
     “And lose his English accent?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52310">
     “It will wholly disappear. He will speak Cherokee Strip--and other forms
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52320">
     of profanity.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52340">
     “Colonel, maybe he'll confess!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52360">
     “Confess? Merely that bank robbery?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52380">
     “Merely? Yes, but why 'merely'?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52400">
     The Colonel said in his most impressive manner: “Hawkins, he will be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52410">
     wholly under my command. I will make him confess every crime he ever
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52420">
     committed. There must be a thousand. Do you get the idea?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52440">
     “Well--not quite.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52460">
     “The rewards will come to us.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52480">
     “Prodigious conception! I never saw such a head for seeing with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52490">
     lightning glance all the outlying ramifications and possibilities of a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52500">
     central idea.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52520">
     “It is nothing; it comes natural to me. When his time is out in one jail
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52530">
     he goes to the next and the next, and we shall have nothing to do but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52540">
     collect the rewards as he goes along. It is a perfectly steady income
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52550">
     as long as we live, Hawkins. And much better than other kinds of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52560">
     investments, because he is indestructible.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52580">
     “It looks--it really does look the way you say; it does indeed.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52600">
     “Look?--why it is. It will not be denied that I have had a pretty wide
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52610">
     and comprehensive financial experience, and I do not hesitate to say
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52620">
     that I consider this one of the most valuable properties I have ever

     controlled.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_52650">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_53870">
     down quaking with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_53890">
     Lady Rossmore was smitten dumb with amazement. She gazed at the sheepish

    </p>

     “What is the matter with you, Mulberry?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_53950">
     He did not answer immediately. His back was turned; he was bending over
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_53960">
     his chair, feeling the seat of it. But he answered next moment, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_53970">
     said:
    </p>

     The lady contemplated him doubtfully a moment, then said, pretty

     snappishly:

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54040">
     “All that for a tack! Praise goodness it wasn't a shingle nail, it would

     have landed you in the Milky Way. I do hate to have my nerves shook up

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54060">
     so.” And she turned on her heel and went her way.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54080">
     As soon as she was safely out, the Colonel said, in a suppressed voice:

     “Come--we must see for ourselves. It must be a mistake.”

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54120">
     They hurried softly down and peeped in. Sellers whispered, in a sort of

     Tracy made slow progress with his work, for his mind wandered a good

     of a sudden--seemed to, at any rate--and he said to himself, “I've got

     of perplexities, anyway. These dreadful chromos which he takes for old

     crib--Rossmore Towers; and that odd assertion of his, that I was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54340">
     expected. How could I be expected? that is, Lord Berkeley. He knows by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54350">
     the papers that that person was burned up in the New Gadsby. Why, hang

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54370">
     that he was not expecting an Englishman, or yet an artist, yet I answer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54380">
     his requirements notwithstanding. He seems sufficiently satisfied with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54390">
     me. Yes, he is a little off; in fact I am afraid he is a good deal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54400">
     off, poor old gentleman. But he's interesting--all people in about his

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54420">
     come every day and study him. And when I write my father--ah, that

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54430">

     Somebody coming--I must get to work. It's the old gentleman again. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54450">
     looks bothered. Maybe my clothes are suspicious; and they are--for an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54460">
     artist. If my conscience would allow me to make a change, but that is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54470">
     out of the question. I wonder what he's making those passes in the air
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54480">
     for, with his hands. I seem to be the object of them. Can he be trying
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54490">
     to mesmerize me? I don't quite like it. There's something uncanny about

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54520">
     The colonel muttered to himself, “It has an effect on him, I can see it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54530">
     myself. That's enough for one time, I reckon. He's not very solid, yet,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54540">
     I suppose, and I might disintegrate him. I'll just put a sly question
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54550">
     or two at him, now, and see if I can find out what his condition is, and

     where he's from.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54580">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54600">
     “Don't let me disturb you, Mr. Tracy; I only want to take a little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54610">
     glimpse of your work. Ah, that's fine--that's very fine indeed. You are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54620">
     doing it elegantly. My daughter will be charmed with this. May I sit
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54630">
     down by you?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54650">
     “Oh, do; I shall be glad.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54670">
     “It won't disturb you? I mean, won't dissipate your inspirations?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54690">
     Tracy laughed and said they were not ethereal enough to be very easily
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54700">
     discommoded.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54720">
     The colonel asked a number of cautious and well-considered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54730">
     questions--questions which seemed pretty odd and flighty to Tracy--but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54740">
     the answers conveyed the information desired, apparently, for the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54750">
     colonel said to himself, with mixed pride and gratification:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54770">
     “It's a good job as far as I've got with it. He's solid. Solid and going

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54780">
     to last, solid as the real thing.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54800">
     “It's wonderful--wonderful. I believe I could--petrify him.” After a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54810">
     little he asked, warily “Do you prefer being here, or--or there?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54830">
     “There? Where?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54850">
     “Why--er--where you've been?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54870">
     Tracy's thought flew to his boarding-house, and he answered with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54880">
     decision.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54900">
     “Oh, here, much!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54920">
     The colonel was startled, and said to himself, “There's no uncertain
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54930">
     ring about that. It indicates where he's been to, poor fellow. Well, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54940">
     am satisfied, now. I'm glad I got him out.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54960">
     He sat thinking, and thinking, and watching the brush go. At length he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54970">
     said to himself, “Yes, it certainly seems to account for the failure of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54980">
     my endeavors in poor Berkeley's case. He went in the other direction.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_54990">
     Well, it's all right. He's better off.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55010">
     Sally Sellers entered from the street, now, looking her divinest, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55020">
     the artist was introduced to her. It was a violent case of mutual love
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55030">
     at first sight, though neither party was entirely aware of the fact,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55040">
     perhaps. The Englishman made this irrelevant remark to himself, “Perhaps
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55050">
     he is not insane, after all.” Sally sat down, and showed an interest in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55060">
     Tracy's work which greatly pleased him, and a benevolent forgiveness of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55070">
     it which convinced him that the girl's nature was cast in a large mould.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55080">
     Sellers was anxious to report his discoveries to Hawkins; so he took
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55090">
     his leave, saying that if the two “young devotees of the colored Muse”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55100">
     thought they could manage without him, he would go and look after his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55110">
     affairs. The artist said to himself, “I think he is a little eccentric,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55120">
     perhaps, but that is all.” He reproached himself for having injuriously
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55130">
     judged a man without giving him any fair chance to show what he really
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55140">
     was.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55160">
     Of course the stranger was very soon at his ease and chatting along
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55170">
     comfortably. The average American girl possesses the valuable qualities
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55180">
     of naturalness, honesty, and inoffensive straightforwardness; she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55190">
     is nearly barren of troublesome conventions and artificialities,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55200">
     consequently her presence and her ways are unembarrassing, and one is

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55220">
     he knows how it came about. This new acquaintanceship--friendship,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55230">
     indeed--progressed swiftly; and the unusual swiftness of it, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55240">
     thoroughness of it are sufficiently evidenced and established by one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55250">
     noteworthy fact--that within the first half hour both parties had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55260">
     ceased to be conscious of Tracy's clothes. Later this consciousness
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55270">
     was re-awakened; it was then apparent to Gwendolen that she was almost
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55280">
     reconciled to them, and it was apparent to Tracy that he wasn't. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55290">
     re-awakening was brought about by Gwendolen's inviting the artist to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55300">
     stay to dinner. He had to decline, because he wanted to live, now--that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55310">
     is, now that there was something to live for--and he could not survive
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55320">
     in those clothes at a gentleman's table. He thought he knew that. But he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55330">
     went away happy, for he saw that Gwendolen was disappointed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55350">
     And whither did he go? He went straight to a slopshop and bought as neat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55360">
     and reasonably well-fitting a suit of clothes as an Englishman could be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55370">
     persuaded to wear. He said--to himself, but at his conscience--“I know
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55380">
     it's wrong; but it would be wrong not to do it; and two wrongs do not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55390">
     make a right.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55410">
     This satisfied him, and made his heart light. Perhaps it will also
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55420">
     satisfy the reader--if he can make out what it means.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55440">
     The old people were troubled about Gwendolen at dinner, because she was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55450">
     so distraught and silent. If they had noticed, they would have found
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55460">
     that she was sufficiently alert and interested whenever the talk
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55470">
     stumbled upon the artist and his work; but they didn't notice, and so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55480">
     the chat would swap around to some other subject, and then somebody
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55490">
     would presently be privately worrying about Gwendolen again, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55500">
     wondering if she were not well, or if something had gone wrong in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55510">
     the millinery line. Her mother offered her various reputable patent
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55520">
     medicines, and tonics with iron and other hardware in them, and her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55530">
     father even proposed to send out for wine, relentless prohibitionist
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55540">
     and head of the order in the District of Columbia as he was, but these
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55550">
     kindnesses were all declined--thankfully, but with decision. At bedtime,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55560">
     when the family were breaking up for the night, she privately looted one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55570">
     of the brushes, saying to herself, “It's the one he has used, the most.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55590">
     The next morning Tracy went forth wearing his new suit, and equipped
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55600">
     with a pink in his button-hole--a daily attention from Puss. His
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55610">
     whole soul was full of Gwendolen Sellers, and this condition was an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55620">
     inspiration, art-wise. All the morning his brush pawed nimbly away at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55630">
     the canvases, almost without his awarity--awarity, in this sense being
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55640">
     the sense of being aware, though disputed by some authorities--turning
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55650">
     out marvel upon marvel, in the way of decorative accessories to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55660">
     portraits, with a felicity and celerity which amazed the veterans of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55670">
     firm and fetched out of them continuous explosions of applause.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55690">
     Meantime Gwendolen was losing her morning, and many dollars. She
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55700">
     supposed Tracy was coming in the forenoon--a conclusion which she had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55710">
     jumped to without outside help. So she tripped down stairs every little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55720">
     while from her work-parlor to arrange the brushes and things over again,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55730">
     and see if he had arrived. And when she was in her work-parlor it was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55740">
     not profitable, but just the other way--as she found out to her sorrow.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55760">
     She had put in her idle moments during the last little while back, in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55770">
     designing a particularly rare and capable gown for herself, and this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55780">
     morning she set about making it up; but she was absent minded, and made
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55790">
     an irremediable botch of it. When she saw what she had done, she knew
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55800">
     the reason of it and the meaning of it; and she put her work away from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55810">
     her and said she would accept the sign. And from that time forth she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55820">
     came no more away from the Audience Chamber, but remained there and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55830">
     waited. After luncheon she waited again. A whole hour. Then a great
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55840">
     joy welled up in her heart, for she saw him coming. So she flew back
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55850">
     up stairs thankful, and could hardly wait for him to miss the principal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55860">
     brush, which she had mislaid down there, but knew where she had mislaid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55870">
     it. However, all in good time the others were called in and couldn't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55880">
     find the brush, and then she was sent for, and she couldn't find it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55890">
     herself for some little time; but then she found it when the others had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55900">
     gone away to hunt in the kitchen and down cellar and in the woodshed,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55910">
     and all those other places where people look for things whose ways they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55920">
     are not familiar with. So she gave him the brush, and remarked that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55930">
     she ought to have seen that everything was ready for him, but it hadn't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55940">
     seemed necessary, because it was so early that she wasn't expecting--but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55950">
     she stopped there, surprised at herself for what she was saying; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55960">
     he felt caught and ashamed, and said to himself, “I knew my impatience
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55970">
     would drag me here before I was expected, and betray me, and that is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55980">
     just what it has done; she sees straight through me--and is laughing at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_55990">
     me, inside, of course.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56010">
     Gwendolen was very much pleased, on one account, and a little the other
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56020">
     way in another; pleased with the new clothes and the improvement
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56030">
     which they had achieved; less pleased by the pink in the buttonhole.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56040">
     Yesterday's pink had hardly interested her; this one was just like it,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56050">
     but somehow it had got her immediate attention, and kept it. She wished
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56060">
     she could think of some way of getting at its history in a properly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56070">
     colorless and indifferent way. Presently she made a venture. She said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56090">
     “Whatever a man's age may be, he can reduce it several years by putting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56100">
     a bright-colored flower in his button-hole. I have often noticed that.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56110">
     Is that your sex's reason for wearing a boutonniere?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56130">
     “I fancy not, but certainly that reason would be a sufficient one. I've
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56140">
     never heard of the idea before.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56160">
     “You seem to prefer pinks. Is it on account of the color, or the form?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56180">
     “Oh no,” he said, simply, “they are given to me. I don't think I have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56190">
     any preference.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56210">
     “They are given to him,” she said to herself, and she felt a coldness
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56220">
     toward that pink. “I wonder who it is, and what she is like.” The flower
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56230">
     began to take up a good deal of room; it obtruded itself everywhere,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56240">
     it intercepted all views, and marred them; it was becoming exceedingly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56250">
     annoying and conspicuous for a little thing. “I wonder if he cares for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56260">
     her.” That thought gave her a quite definite pain.

     She had made everything comfortable for the artist; there was no further
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56340">
     pretext for staying. So she said she would go, now, and asked him to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56350">
     summon the servants in case he should need anything. She went away
    </p>

     unhappy; and she left unhappiness behind her; for she carried away all
    </p>

     the sunshine. The time dragged heavily for both, now. He couldn't paint
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56380">
     for thinking of her; she couldn't design or millinerize with any heart,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56390">
     for thinking of him. Never before had painting seemed so empty to him,

     never before had millinerizing seemed so void of interest to her. She
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56410">
     had gone without repeating that dinner-invitation--an almost unendurable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56420">
     disappointment to him. On her part-well, she was suffering, too; for she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56430">
     had found she couldn't invite him. It was not hard yesterday, but it was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56440">
     impossible to-day. A thousand innocent privileges seemed to have been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56450">
     filched from her unawares in the past twenty-four hours. To-day she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56460">
     felt strangely hampered, restrained of her liberty. To-day she couldn't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56470">
     propose to herself to do anything or say anything concerning this young
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56480">
     man without being instantly paralyzed into non-action by the fear that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56490">
     he might “suspect.” Invite him to dinner to-day? It made her shiver to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56500">
     think of it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56520">
     And so her afternoon was one long fret. Broken at intervals. Three times
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56530">
     she had to go down stairs on errands--that is, she thought she had to go
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56540">
     down stairs on errands. Thus, going and coming, she had six glimpses of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56550">
     him, in the aggregate, without seeming to look in his direction; and she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56560">
     tried to endure these electric ecstasies without showing any sign, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56570">
     they fluttered her up a good deal, and she felt that the naturalness
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56580">
     she was putting on was overdone and quite too frantically sober and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56590">
     hysterically calm to deceive.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56610">
     The painter had his share of the rapture; he had his six glimpses, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56620">
     they smote him with waves of pleasure that assaulted him, beat upon him,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56630">
     washed over him deliciously, and drowned out all consciousness of what
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56640">
     he was doing with his brush. So there were six places in his canvas
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56650">
     which had to be done over again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56670">
     At last Gwendolen got some peace of mind by sending word to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56680">
     Thompsons, in the neighborhood, that she was coming there to dinner.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56690">
     She wouldn't be reminded, at that table, that there was an absentee
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56700">
     who ought to be a presentee--a word which she meant to look out in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56710">
     dictionary at a calmer time.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56730">
     About this time the old earl dropped in for a chat with the artist, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56740">
     invited him to stay to dinner. Tracy cramped down his joy and gratitude
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56750">
     by a sudden and powerful exercise of all his forces; and he felt that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56760">
     now that he was going to be close to Gwendolen, and hear her voice and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56770">
     watch her face during several precious hours, earth had nothing valuable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56780">
     to add to his life for the present.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56800">
     The earl said to himself, “This spectre can eat apples, apparently. We
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56810">
     shall find out, now, if that is a specialty. I think, myself, it's a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56820">
     specialty. Apples, without doubt, constitute the spectral limit. It was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56830">
     the case with our first parents. No, I am wrong--at least only partly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56840">
     right. The line was drawn at apples, just as in the present case, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56850">
     it was from the other direction.” The new clothes gave him a thrill of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56860">
     pleasure and pride. He said to himself, “I've got part of him down to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56870">
     date, anyway.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56890">
     Sellers said he was pleased with Tracy's work; and he went on and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56900">
     engaged him to restore his old masters, and said he should also want him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56910">
     to paint his portrait and his wife's and possibly his daughter's.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56920">
     The tide of the artist's happiness was at flood, now. The chat flowed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56930">
     pleasantly along while Tracy painted and Sellers carefully unpacked a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56940">
     picture which he had brought with him. It was a chromo; a new one,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56950">
     just out. It was the smirking, self-satisfied portrait of a man who was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56960">
     inundating the Union with advertisements inviting everybody to buy his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56970">
     specialty, which was a three-dollar shoe or a dress-suit or something
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56980">
     of that kind. The old gentleman rested the chromo flat upon his lap and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_56990">
     gazed down tenderly upon it, and became silent and meditative. Presently
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57000">
     Tracy noticed that he was dripping tears on it. This touched the young
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57010">
     fellow's sympathetic nature, and at the same time gave him the painful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57020">
     sense of being an intruder upon a sacred privacy, an observer of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57030">
     emotions which a stranger ought not to witness. But his pity rose
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57040">
     superior to other considerations, and compelled him to try to comfort
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57050">
     the old mourner with kindly words and a show of friendly interest. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57060">
     said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57080">
     “I am very sorry--is it a friend whom--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57100">
     “Ah, more than that, far more than that--a relative, the dearest I had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57110">
     on earth, although I was never permitted to see him. Yes, it is young
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57120">
     Lord Berkeley, who perished so heroically in the awful conflagration.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57130">
     Why what is the matter?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57150">
     “Oh, nothing, nothing.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57170">
     “It was a little startling to be so suddenly brought face to face, so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57180">
     to speak, with a person one has heard so much talk about. Is it a good
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57190">
     likeness?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57210">
     “Without doubt, yes. I never saw him, but you can easily see the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57220">
     resemblance to his father,” said Sellers, holding up the chromo and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57230">
     glancing from it to the chromo misrepresenting the Usurping Earl and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57240">
     back again with an approving eye.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57260">
     “Well, no--I am not sure that I make out the likeness. It is plain that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57270">
     the Usurping Earl there has a great deal of character and a long
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57280">
     face like a horse's, whereas his heir here is smirky, moon-faced and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57290">
     characterless.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57310">
     “We are all that way in the beginning--all the line,” said Sellers,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57320">
     undisturbed. “We all start as moonfaced fools, then later we tadpole
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57330">
     along into horse-faced marvels of intellect and character. It is by that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57340">
     sign and by that fact that I detect the resemblance here and know this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57350">
     portrait to be genuine and perfect. Yes, all our family are fools at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57360">
     first.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57380">
     “This young man seems to meet the hereditary requirement, certainly.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57400">
     “Yes, yes, he was a fool, without any doubt. Examine the face, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57410">
     shape of the head, the expression. It's all fool, fool, fool, straight
    </p>

     through.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57440">
     “Thanks,--” said Tracy, involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57460">
     “Thanks?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57480">
     “I mean for explaining it to me. Go on, please.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57500">
     “As I was saying, fool is printed all over the face. A body can even

     read the details.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57530">
     “What do they say?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57550">
     “Well, added up, he is a wobbler.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57570">
     “A which?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57590">
     “Wobbler. A person that's always taking a firm stand about something or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57600">
     other--kind of a Gibraltar stand, he thinks, for unshakable fidelity
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57610">
     and everlastingness--and then, inside of a little while, he begins to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57620">
     wobble; no more Gibraltar there; no, sir, a mighty ordinary commonplace
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57630">
     weakling wobbling around on stilts. That's Lord Berkeley to a dot, you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57640">
     can see it--look at that sheep! But,--why are you blushing like sunset!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57650">
     Dear sir, have I unwittingly offended in some way?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57670">
     “Oh, no indeed, no indeed. Far from it. But it always makes me blush to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57680">
     hear a man revile his own blood.” He said to himself, “How strangely his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57690">
     vagrant and unguided fancies have hit upon the truth. By accident, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57700">
     has described me. I am that contemptible thing. When I left England I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57710">
     thought I knew myself; I thought I was a very Frederick the Great for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57720">
     resolution and staying capacity; whereas in truth I am just a Wobbler,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57730">
     simply a Wobbler. Well--after all, it is at least creditable to have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57740">
     high ideals and give birth to lofty resolutions; I will allow myself
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57750">
     that comfort.” Then he said, aloud, “Could this sheep, as you call him,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57760">
     breed a great and self-sacrificing idea in his head, do you think?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57770">
     Could he meditate such a thing, for instance, as the renunciation of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57780">
     earldom and its wealth and its glories, and voluntary retirement to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57790">
     the ranks of the commonalty, there to rise by his own merit or remain
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57830">
     There is your answer. It's the very thing he would think of. And he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57840">
     would start in to do it, too.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57860">
     “And then?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57880">
     “He'd wobble.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57900">
     “And back down?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57920">
     “Every time.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57940">
     “Is that to happen with all my--I mean would that happen to all his high

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57970">
     “Oh certainly--certainly. It's the Rossmore of it.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_57990">
     “Then this creature was fortunate to die! Suppose, for argument's sake,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58000">
     that I was a Rossmore, and--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58020">
     “It can't be done.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58040">
     “Why?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58060">
     “Because it's not a supposable case. To be a Rossmore at your age,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58070">
     you'd have to be a fool, and you're not a fool. And you'd have to be a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58080">
     Wobbler, whereas anybody that is an expert in reading character can see
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58090">
     at a glance that when you set your foot down once, it's there to stay;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58100">
     and earthquake can't wobble it.” He added to himself, “That's enough to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58110">
     say to him, but it isn't half strong enough for the facts. The more I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58120">
     observe him, now, the more remarkable I find him. It is the strongest
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58130">
     face I have ever examined. There is almost superhuman firmness here,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58140">
     immovable purpose, iron steadfastness of will. A most extraordinary
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58150">
     young man.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58170">
     He presently said, aloud:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58190">
     “Some time I want to ask your advice about a little matter, Mr. Tracy.
    </p>

     “Oh, it's nothing, pray go on. You've got his remains?”

     “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58260">
     “Are you sure they are his, and not somebody else's?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58280">
     “Oh, perfectly sure. Samples, I mean. Not all of him.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58300">
     “Samples?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58320">
     “Yes--in baskets. Some time you will be going home; and if you wouldn't

     “Yes--certainly. I don't mean now; but after a while; after--but look

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58380">
     here, would you like to see them?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58400">
     “No! Most certainly not. I don't want to see them.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58420">
     “O, very well. I only thought--hey, where are you going, dear?”
    </p>

     “Out to dinner, papa.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58460">
     Tracy was aghast. The colonel said, in a disappointed voice:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58480">
     “Well, I'm sorry. Sho, I didn't know she was going out, Mr. Tracy.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58500">
     Gwendolen's face began to take on a sort of apprehensive
    </p>

     'What-have-I-done expression.'
    </p>

     fact.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58560">
     Gwendolen's face betrayed a dawning hopefulness and she said--with a
    </p>

     tone of reluctance which hadn't the hall-mark on it:
    </p>

     “If you prefer, I will send word to the Thompsons that I--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58610">
     “Oh, is it the Thompsons? That simplifies it--sets everything right. We
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58620">
     can fix it without spoiling your arrangements, my child. You've got your

     heart set on--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58650">
     “But papa, I'd just as soon go there some other--”
    </p>

     “No--I won't have it. You are a good hard-working darling child, and

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58740">
     Gwendolen was ready to cry with vexation. But there was nothing to do
    </p>

     at the same time we'll be pretty satisfactorily fixed for a good time

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58830">
     mad; you'll go mad inside of a minute; yes, you send her right along,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58840">
     Gwendolen, and tell her--why, she's gone!” He turned--she was already

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_58850">
     passing out at the gate. He muttered, “I wonder what's the matter;

     of the main things that have enabled me to master the difficult science

     Tracy was not hearing a word. His spirits were gone, he was desolate.

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59240">
     the ability to totally conceal it. I may except George Washington and
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59290">
     A deep-drawn yard-long sigh from the distraught and dreaming artist,

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59370">
     themes suited to his size, like the glacial period, and the correlation

     Dinner was kept waiting for a while for Miss Thompson, but as Gwendolen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59450">
     had not delivered the invitation to her the waiting did no good, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59460">

     everything his hospitable soul could devise to make the occasion an
    </p>

     enjoyable one for the guest, and the guest tried his honest best to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59490">
     cheery and chatty and happy for the old gentleman's sake; in fact all

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59500">
     hands worked hard in the interest of a mutual good time, but the thing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59510">
     was a failure from the start; Tracy's heart was lead in his bosom, there
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59520">
     seemed to be only one prominent feature in the landscape and that was a

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59530">
     vacant chair, he couldn't drag his mind away from Gwendolen and his hard
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59540">
     luck; consequently his distractions allowed deadly pauses to slip in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59550">
     every now and then when it was his turn to say something, and of course
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59560">
     this disease spread to the rest of the conversation--wherefore, instead
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59570">
     of having a breezy sail in sunny waters, as anticipated, everybody was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59580">
     bailing out and praying for land. What could the matter be? Tracy alone
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59590">
     could have told, the others couldn't even invent a theory.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59610">
     Meanwhile they were having a similarly dismal time at the Thompson
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59620">
     house; in fact a twin experience. Gwendolen was ashamed of herself for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59630">
     allowing her disappointment to so depress her spirits and make her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59640">
     so strangely and profoundly miserable; but feeling ashamed of herself
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59650">
     didn't improve the matter any; it only seemed to aggravate the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59660">
     suffering. She explained that she was not feeling very well, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59670">
     everybody could see that this was true; so she got sincere sympathy and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59680">
     commiseration; but that didn't help the case. Nothing helps that kind of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59690">
     a case. It is best to just stand off and let it fester. The moment the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59700">
     dinner was over the girl excused herself, and she hurried home feeling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59710">
     unspeakably grateful to get away from that house and that intolerable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59720">
     captivity and suffering.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59740">
     Will he be gone? The thought arose in her brain, but took effect in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59750">
     her heels. She slipped into the house, threw off her things and made
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59760">
     straight for the dining room. She stopped and listened. Her father's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59770">
     voice--with no life in it; presently her mother's--no life in that; a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59780">
     considerable vacancy, then a sterile remark from Washington Hawkins.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59790">
     Another silence; then, not Tracy's but her father's voice again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59810">
     “He's gone,” she said to herself despairingly, and listlessly opened the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59820">
     door and stepped within.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59840">
     “Why, my child,” cried the mother, “how white you are! Are you--has
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59850">
     anything--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59870">
     “White?” exclaimed Sellers. “It's gone like a flash; 'twasn't serious.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59880">
     Already she's as red as the soul of a watermelon! Sit down, dear, sit
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59890">
     down--goodness knows you're welcome. Did you have a good time? We've had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59900">
     great times here--immense. Why didn't Miss Belle come? Mr. Tracy is not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59910">
     feeling well, and she'd have made him forget it.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59930">
     She was content now; and out from her happy eyes there went a light that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59940">
     told a secret to another pair of eyes there and got a secret in return.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59950">
     In just that infinitely small fraction of a second those two great
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59960">
     confessions were made, received, and perfectly understood. All anxiety,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59970">
     apprehension, uncertainty, vanished out of these young people's hearts
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_59980">
     and left them filled with a great peace.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60000">
     Sellers had had the most confident faith that with the new reinforcement
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60010">
     victory would be at this last moment snatched from the jaws of defeat,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60020">
     but it was an error. The talk was as stubbornly disjointed as ever. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60030">
     was proud of Gwendolen, and liked to show her off, even against Miss
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60040">
     Belle Thompson, and here had been a great opportunity, and what had she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60050">
     made of it? He felt a good deal put out. It vexed him to think that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60060">
     this Englishman, with the traveling Briton's everlasting disposition
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60070">
     to generalize whole mountain ranges from single sample-grains of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60080">
     sand, would jump to the conclusion that American girls were as dumb as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60090">
     himself--generalizing the whole tribe from this single sample and she at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60100">
     her poorest, there being nothing at that table to inspire her, give her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60110">
     a start, keep her from going to sleep. He made up his mind that for the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60120">
     honor of the country he would bring these two together again over the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60130">
     social board before long. There would be a different result another
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60140">
     time, he judged. He said to himself, with a deep sense of injury, “He'll
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60150">
     put in his diary--they all keep diaries--he'll put in his diary that she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60160">
     was miraculously uninteresting--dear, dear, but wasn't she! I never saw
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60170">
     the like--and yet looking as beautiful as Satan, too--and couldn't seem
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60180">
     to do anything but paw bread crumbs, and pick flowers to pieces, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60190">
     look fidgety. And it isn't any better here in the Hall of Audience. I've
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60200">
     had enough; I'll haul down my flag--the others may fight it out if they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60210">
     want to.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60230">
     He shook hands all around and went off to do some work which he said was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60240">
     pressing. The idolaters were the width of the room apart; and apparently
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60250">
     unconscious of each other's presence. The distance got shortened a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60260">
     little, now. Very soon the mother withdrew. The distance narrowed again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60270">
     Tracy stood before a chromo of some Ohio politician which had been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60280">
     retouched and chain-mailed for a crusading Rossmore, and Gwendolen was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60290">
     sitting on the sofa not far from his elbow artificially absorbed in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60300">
     examining a photograph album that hadn't any photographs in it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60320">
     The “Senator” still lingered. He was sorry for the young people; it had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60330">
     been a dull evening for them. In the goodness of his heart he tried
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60340">
     to make it pleasant for them now; tried to remove the ill impression
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60350">
     necessarily left by the general defeat; tried to be chatty, even tried
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60360">
     to be gay. But the responses were sickly, there was no starting any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60370">
     enthusiasm; he would give it up and quit--it was a day specially picked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60380">
     out and consecrated to failures.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60400">
     But when Gwendolen rose up promptly and smiled a glad smile and said

     with thankfulness and blessing, “Must you go?” it seemed cruel to

     desert, and he sat down again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60440">
     He was about to begin a remark when--when he didn't. We have all been

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60460">
     a mistake, he merely knew it; and knew it for dead certain, too. And so

     he bade goodnight, and went mooning out, wondering what he could have

     those two were standing side by side, looking at that door--looking at

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60510">
     the instant it closed they flung their arms about each other's necks,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60520">
     and there, heart to heart and lip to lip--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60540">
     “Oh, my God, she's kissing it!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60560">
     Nobody heard this remark, because Hawkins, who bred it, only thought it,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60570">
     he didn't utter it. He had turned, the moment he had closed the door,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60580">
     and had pushed it open a little, intending to re-enter and ask what
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60590">
     ill-advised thing he had done or said, and apologize for it. But he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60600">
     didn't re-enter; he staggered off stunned, terrified, distressed.

     Five minutes later he was sitting in his room, with his head bowed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60670">
     within the circle of his arms, on the table--final attitude of grief and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60680">
     despair. His tears were flowing fast, and now and then a sob broke upon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60690">
     the stillness. Presently he said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60710">
     “I knew her when she was a little child and used to climb about my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60720">
     knees; I love her as I love my own, and now--oh, poor thing, poor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60730">
     thing, I cannot bear it!--she's gone and lost her heart to this mangy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60740">
     materializee! Why didn't we see that that might happen? But how could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60750">
     we? Nobody could; nobody could ever have dreamed of such a thing. You
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60760">
     couldn't expect a person would fall in love with a wax-work. And this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60770">
     one doesn't even amount to that.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60790">
     He went on grieving to himself, and now and then giving voice to his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60800">
     lamentations.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60820">
     “It's done, oh, it's done, and there's no help for it, no undoing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60830">
     the miserable business. If I had the nerve, I would kill it. But
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60840">
     that wouldn't do any good. She loves it; she thinks it's genuine and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60850">
     authentic. If she lost it she would grieve for it just as she would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60860">
     for a real person. And who's to break it to the family! Not I--I'll die
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60870">
     first. Sellers is the best human being I ever knew and I wouldn't any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60880">
     more think of--oh, dear, why it'll break his heart when he finds it out.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60890">
     And Polly's too. This comes of meddling with such infernal matters!

     But for this, the creature would still be roasting in Sheol where
    </p>

     Sometimes I can't come into the same room with him without nearly

     suffocating.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60950">
     After a while he broke out again:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60970">
     “Well, there's one thing, sure. The materializing has got to stop right
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60980">
     where it is. If she's got to marry a spectre, let her marry a decent one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_60990">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61000">
     as this protoplasmic tadpole's going to turn into if Sellers keeps on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61010">
     fussing at it. It costs five thousand dollars cash and shuts down on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61020">
     the incorporated company to stop the works at this point, but Sally
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61030">
     Sellers's happiness is worth more than that.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61050">
     He heard Sellers coming, and got himself to rights. Sellers took a seat,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61060">
     and said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61080">
     “Well, I've got to confess I'm a good deal puzzled. It did certainly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61090">
     eat, there's no getting around it. Not eat, exactly, either, but it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61100">
     nibbled; nibbled in an appetiteless way, but still it nibbled; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61110">
     that's just a marvel. Now the question is, what does it do with those
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61120">
     nibblings? That's it--what does it do with them? My idea is that we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61130">
     don't begin to know all there is to this stupendous discovery yet.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61140">
     But time will show--time and science--give us a chance, and don't get
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61150">
     impatient.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61170">
     But he couldn't get Hawkins interested; couldn't make him talk to amount
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61180">
     to anything; couldn't drag him out of his depression. But at last he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61190">
     took a turn that arrested Hawkins's attention.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61210">
     “I'm coming to like him, Hawkins. He is a person of stupendous

     Clive over again. Yes, I'm all admiration for him, on account of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61250">
     character, and liking naturally follows admiration, you know. I'm coming
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61260">
     to like him immensely. Do you know, I haven't the heart to degrade such
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61270">
     a character as that down to the burglar estate for money or for anything
    </p>

     else; and I've come to ask if you are willing to let the reward go, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61290">
     leave this poor fellow--

     “Where he is?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61330">
     “Yes--not bring him down to date.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61350">
     “Oh, there's my hand; and my heart's in it, too!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61370">
     “I'll never forget you for this, Hawkins,” said the old gentleman in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61380">
     a voice which he found it hard to control. “You are making a great
    </p>

     sacrifice for me, and one which you can ill afford, but I'll never
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61410">
     sure of that.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61430">
     Sally Sellers immediately and vividly realized that she was become a new
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61440">
     being; a being of a far higher and worthier sort than she had been such
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61450">
     a little while before; an earnest being, in place of a dreamer; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61460">
     supplied with a reason for her presence in the world, where merely a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61470">
     wistful and troubled curiosity about it had existed before. So great and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61480">
     so comprehensive was the change which had been wrought, that she seemed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61490">
     to herself to be a real person who had lately been a shadow; a something
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61500">
     which had lately been a nothing; a purpose, which had lately been a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61510">
     fancy; a finished temple, with the altar-fires lit and the voice of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61520">
     worship ascending, where before had been but an architect's confusion
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61530">
     of arid working plans, unintelligible to the passing eye and prophesying
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61540">
     nothing.

     “Lady” Gwendolen! The pleasantness of that sound was all gone; it was an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61570">
     offense to her ear now. She said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61590">
     “There--that sham belongs to the past; I will not be called by it any
    </p>

     more.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61620">
     “I may call you simply Gwendolen? You will allow me to drop the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61630">
     formalities straightway and name you by your dear first name without
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61640">
     additions?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61660">
     She was dethroning the pink and replacing it with a rosebud.
    </p>

     “There--that is better. I hate pinks--some pinks. Indeed yes, you are to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61690">
     call me by my first name without additions--that is,--well, I don't mean

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61700">
     without additions entirely, but--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61720">
     It was as far as she could get. There was a pause; his intellect was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61730">
     struggling to comprehend; presently it did manage to catch the idea in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61740">
     time to save embarrassment all around, and he said gratefully--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61760">
     “Dear Gwendolen! I may say that?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61780">
     “Yes--part of it. But--don't kiss me when I am talking, it makes me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61790">
     forget what I was going to say. You can call me by part of that form,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61800">
     but not the last part. Gwendolen is not my name.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61820">
     “Not your name?” This in a tone of wonder and surprise.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61840">
     The girl's soul was suddenly invaded by a creepy apprehension, a quite
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61850">
     definite sense of suspicion and alarm. She put his arms away from her,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61860">
     looked him searchingly in the eye, and said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61880">
     “Answer me truly, on your honor. You are not seeking to marry me on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61890">
     account of my rank?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61910">
     The shot almost knocked him through the wall, he was so little prepared
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61920">
     for it. There was something so finely grotesque about the question and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61930">
     its parent suspicion, that he stopped to wonder and admire, and thus
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61940">
     was he saved from laughing. Then, without wasting precious time, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61950">
     set about the task of convincing her that he had been lured by herself
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61960">
     alone, and had fallen in love with her only, not her title and position;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61970">
     that he loved her with all his heart, and could not love her more if she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61980">
     were a duchess, or less if she were without home, name or family. She
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_61990">
     watched his face wistfully, eagerly, hopefully, translating his words
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_62000">
     by its expression; and when he had finished there was gladness in her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_62010">
     heart--a tumultuous gladness, indeed, though outwardly she was calm,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_62020">
     tranquil, even judicially austere. She prepared a surprise for him, now,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_62030">
     calculated to put a heavy strain upon those disinterested protestations
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_62040">
     of his; and thus she delivered it, burning it away word by word as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_62050">
     the fuse burns down to a bombshell, and watching to see how far the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_62060">
     explosion would lift him:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_62080">
     “Listen--and do not doubt me, for I shall speak the exact truth. Howard

     Tracy, I am no more an earl's child than you are!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_62110">
     To her joy--and secret surprise, also--it never phased him. He was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_62120">
     ready, this time, and saw his chance. He cried out with enthusiasm,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_62130">
     “Thank heaven for that!” and gathered her to his arms.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_62150">
     To express her happiness was almost beyond her gift of speech.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_62170">
     “You make me the proudest girl in all the earth,” she said, with her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_62180">
     head pillowed on his shoulder. “I thought it only natural that you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_62190">
     should be dazzled by the title--maybe even unconsciously, you being
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_62200">
     English--and that you might be deceiving yourself in thinking you loved
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_62210">
     only me, and find you didn't love me when the deception was swept away;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_62220">
     so it makes me proud that the revelation stands for nothing and that you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_62230">
     do love just me, only me--oh, prouder than any words can tell!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_62250">
     “It is only you, sweetheart, I never gave one envying glance toward your

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63050">
     Tracy felt that this was a little more than was necessary. He was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63060">
     conscious of the sting of jealousy. He said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63080">
     “It is quite right to think of him--at least now and then--that is, at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63090">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63110">
     “Howard Tracy, are you jealous of that dead man?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63130">
     He was ashamed--and at the same time not ashamed. He was jealous--and at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63140">
     the same time he was not jealous. In a sense the dead man was himself;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63150">
     in that case compliments and affection lavished upon that corpse went
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63160">
     into his own till and were clear profit. But in another sense the dead
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63170">
     man was not himself; and in that case all compliments and affection
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63180">
     lavished there were wasted, and a sufficient basis for jealousy. A tiff
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63190">
     was the result of the dispute between the two. Then they made it up,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63200">
     and were more loving than ever. As an affectionate clincher of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63210">
     reconciliation, Sally declared that she had now banished Lord Berkeley
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63220">
     from her mind; and added, “And in order to make sure that he shall never
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63230">
     make trouble between us again, I will teach myself to detest that name
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63240">
     and all that have ever borne it or ever shall bear it.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63260">
     This inflicted another pang, and Tracy was minded to ask her to modify
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63270">
     that a little just on general principles, and as practice in not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63280">
     overdoing a good thing--perhaps he might better leave things as they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63290">
     were and not risk bringing on another tiff. He got away from that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63300">
     particular, and sought less tender ground for conversation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63320">
     “I suppose you disapprove wholly of aristocracies and nobilities, now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63330">
     that you have renounced your title and your father's earldom.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63350">
     “Real ones? Oh, dear no--but I've thrown aside our sham one for good.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63370">
     This answer fell just at the right time and just in the right place, to

     save the poor unstable young man from changing his political complexion
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63390">
     once more. He had been on the point of beginning to totter again,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63400">
     but this prop shored him up and kept him from floundering back into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63410">
     democracy and re-renouncing aristocracy. So he went home glad that he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63420">
     had asked the fortunate question. The girl would accept a little thing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63430">
     like a genuine earldom, she was merely prejudiced against the brummagem
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63440">
     article. Yes, he could have his girl and have his earldom, too: that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63450">
     question was a fortunate stroke.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63470">
     Sally went to bed happy, too; and remained happy, deliriously happy, for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63480">
     nearly two hours; but at last, just as she was sinking into a contented
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63490">
     and luxurious unconsciousness, the shady devil who lives and lurks and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63500">
     hides and watches inside of human beings and is always waiting for a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63510">
     chance to do the proprietor a malicious damage, whispered to her soul
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63520">
     and said, “That question had a harmless look, but what was back of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63530">
     it?--what was the secret motive of it?--what suggested it?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63550">
     The shady devil had knifed her, and could retire, now, and take a rest;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63560">
     the wound would attend to business for him. And it did.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63580">
     Why should Howard Tracy ask that question? If he was not trying to marry
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63590">
     her for the sake of her rank, what should suggest that question to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63600">
     him? Didn't he plainly look gratified when she said her objections to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63610">
     aristocracy had their limitations? Ah, he is after that earldom, that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63620">
     gilded sham--it isn't poor me he wants.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63640">
     So she argued, in anguish and tears. Then she argued the opposite
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63650">
     theory, but made a weak, poor business of it, and lost the case. She
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63660">
     kept the arguing up, one side and then the other, the rest of the night,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63670">
     and at last fell asleep at dawn; fell in the fire at dawn, one may say;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63680">
     for that kind of sleep resembles fire, and one comes out of it with his

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63760">
     Tracy wrote his father before he sought his bed. He wrote a letter which

     he believed would get better treatment than his cablegram received, for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63780">
     it contained what ought to be welcome news; namely, that he had tried
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63790">
     equality and working for a living; had made a fight which he could find
    </p>

     no reason to be ashamed of, and in the matter of earning a living had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63810">
     proved that he was able to do it; but that on the whole he had arrived
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63820">
     at the conclusion that he could not reform the world single-handed, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63830">
     was willing to retire from the conflict with the fair degree of honor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63840">
     which he had gained, and was also willing to return home and resume
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63850">
     his position and be content with it and thankful for it for the future,
    </p>

     health. Then he approached the subject of marriage with the daughter of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63900">
     the American Claimant with a good deal of caution and much painstaking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63910">
     art. He said praiseful and appreciative things about the girl, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63920">
     didn't dwell upon that detail or make it prominent. The thing which he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63930">
     made prominent was the opportunity now so happily afforded, to reconcile
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63940">
     York and Lancaster, graft the warring roses upon one stem, and end
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63950">
     forever a crying injustice which had already lasted far too long. One
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63960">
     could infer that he had thought this thing all out and chosen this way
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63970">
     of making all things fair and right because it was sufficiently fair
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63980">
     and considerably wiser than the renunciation-scheme which he had brought
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_63990">
     with him from England. One could infer that, but he didn't say it. In
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64000">
     fact the more he read his letter over, the more he got to inferring it
    </p>

     himself.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64030">
     When the old earl received that letter, the first part of it filled him
    </p>

     with a grim and snarly satisfaction; but the rest of it brought a snort
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64050">
     or two out of him that could be translated differently. He wasted no

     ship for America to look into the matter himself. He had staunchly held
    </p>

     his grip all this long time, and given no sign of the hunger at his

     heart to see his son; hoping for the cure of his insane dream, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64100">
     resolute that the process should go through all the necessary stages
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64110">
     without assuaging telegrams or other nonsense from home, and here was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64120">
     victory at last. Victory, but stupidly marred by this idiotic marriage

     project. Yes, he would step over and take a hand in this matter himself.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64150">
     During the first ten days following the mailing of the letter Tracy's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64160">
     spirits had no idle time; they were always climbing up into the clouds
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64170">
     or sliding down into the earth as deep as the law of gravitation
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64180">
     reached. He was intensely happy or intensely miserable by turns,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64190">
     according to Miss Sally's moods. He never could tell when the mood was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64200">
     going to change, and when it changed he couldn't tell what it was that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64210">
     had changed it. Sometimes she was so in love with him that her love was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64220">
     tropical, torrid, and she could find no language fervent enough for its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64230">
     expression; then suddenly, and without warning or any apparent reason,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64240">
     the weather would change, and the victim would find himself adrift among
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64250">
     the icebergs and feeling as lonesome and friendless as the north pole.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64260">
     It sometimes seemed to him that a man might better be dead than exposed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64270">
     to these devastating varieties of climate.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64290">
     The case was simple. Sally wanted to believe that Tracy's preference was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64300">
     disinterested; so she was always applying little tests of one sort or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64310">
     another, hoping and expecting that they would bring out evidence which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64320">
     would confirm or fortify her belief. Poor Tracy did not know that these
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64330">
     experiments were being made upon him, consequently he walked promptly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64340">
     into all the traps the girl set for him. These traps consisted in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64350">
     apparently casual references to social distinction, aristocratic
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64360">
     title and privilege, and such things. Often Tracy responded to these
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64370">
     references heedlessly and not much caring what he said provided it kept
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64380">
     the talk going and prolonged the seance. He didn't suspect that the girl
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64390">
     was watching his face and listening for his words as one who watches the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64400">
     judge's face and listens for the words which will restore him to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64410">
     home and friends and freedom or shut him away from the sun and human
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64420">
     companionship forever. He didn't suspect that his careless words were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64430">
     being weighed, and so he often delivered sentence of death when it would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64440">
     have been just as handy and all the same to him to pronounce acquittal.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64450">
     Daily he broke the girl's heart, nightly he sent her to the rack for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64460">
     sleep. He couldn't understand it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64480">
     Some people would have put this and that together and perceived that the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64490">
     weather never changed until one particular subject was introduced, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64500">
     that then it always changed. And they would have looked further, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64510">
     perceived that that subject was always introduced by the one party,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64520">
     never the other. They would have argued, then, that this was done for a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64530">
     purpose. If they could not find out what that purpose was in any simpler
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64540">
     or easier way, they would ask.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64560">
     But Tracy was not deep enough or suspicious enough to think of these
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64570">
     things. He noticed only one particular; that the weather was always
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64580">
     sunny when a visit began. No matter how much it might cloud up later, it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64590">
     always began with a clear sky. He couldn't explain this curious fact to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64600">
     himself, he merely knew it to be a fact. The truth of the matter was,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64610">
     that by the time Tracy had been out of Sally's sight six hours she was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64620">
     so famishing for a sight of him that her doubts and suspicions were all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64630">
     consumed away in the fire of that longing, and so always she came into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64640">
     his presence as surprisingly radiant and joyous as she wasn't when she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64650">
     went out of it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64670">
     In circumstances like these a growing portrait runs a good many risks.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64680">
     The portrait of Sellers, by Tracy, was fighting along, day by day,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64690">
     through this mixed weather, and daily adding to itself ineradicable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64700">
     signs of the checkered life it was leading. It was the happiest
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64710">
     portrait, in spots, that was ever seen; but in other spots a damned soul
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64720">
     looked out from it; a soul that was suffering all the different kinds of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64730">
     distress there are, from stomach ache to rabies. But Sellers liked it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64740">
     He said it was just himself all over--a portrait that sweated moods from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64750">
     every pore, and no two moods alike. He said he had as many different
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64760">
     kinds of emotions in him as a jug.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64780">
     It was a kind of a deadly work of art, maybe, but it was a starchy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64790">
     picture for show; for it was life size, full length, and represented
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64800">
     the American earl in a peer's scarlet robe, with the three ermine bars
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64810">
     indicative of an earl's rank, and on the gray head an earl's coronet,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64820">
     tilted just a wee bit to one side in a most gallus and winsome way. When
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64830">
     Sally's weather was sunny the portrait made Tracy chuckle, but when her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64840">
     weather was overcast it disordered his mind and stopped the circulation
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64850">
     of his blood.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64870">
     Late one night when the sweethearts had been having a flawless visit
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64880">
     together, Sally's interior devil began to work his specialty, and soon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64890">
     the conversation was drifting toward the customary rock. Presently, in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64900">
     the midst of Tracy's serene flow of talk, he felt a shudder which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64910">
     he knew was not his shudder, but exterior to his breast although
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64920">
     immediately against it. After the shudder came sobs; Sally was crying.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64940">
     “Oh, my darling, what have I done--what have I said? It has happened
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64950">
     again! What have I done to wound you?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64970">
     She disengaged herself from his arms and gave him a look of deep
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_64980">
     reproach.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65000">
     “What have you done? I will tell you what you have done. You have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65010">
     unwittingly revealed--oh, for the twentieth time, though I could not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65020">
     believe it, would not believe it!--that it is not me you love, but that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65030">
     foolish sham, my father's imitation earldom; and you have broken my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65040">
     heart!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65060">
     “Oh, my child, what are you saying! I never dreamed of such a thing.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65080">
     “Oh, Howard, Howard, the things you have uttered when you were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65090">
     forgetting to guard your tongue, have betrayed you.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65110">
     “Things I have uttered when I was forgetting to guard my tongue?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65120">
     These are hard words. When have I remembered to guard it? Never in one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65130">
     instance. It has no office but to speak the truth. It needs no guarding
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65140">
     for that.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65160">
     “Howard, I have noted your words and weighed them, when you were not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65170">
     thinking of their significance--and they have told me more than you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65180">
     meant they should.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65200">
     “Do you mean to say you have answered the trust I had in you by using
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65210">
     it as an ambuscade from which you could set snares for my unsuspecting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65220">
     tongue and be safe from detection while you did it? You have not done
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65230">
     this--surely you have not done this thing. Oh, one's enemy could not do
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65240">
     it.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65260">
     This was an aspect of the girl's conduct which she had not clearly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65270">
     perceived before. Was it treachery? Had she abused a trust? The thought
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65280">
     crimsoned her cheeks with shame and remorse.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65300">
     “Oh, forgive me,” she said, “I did not know what I was doing. I have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65310">
     been so tortured--you will forgive me, you must; I have suffered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65320">
     so much, and I am so sorry and so humble; you do forgive me, don't

     bear to--oh, dear, dear, I am so miserable, and I never meant any harm,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65360">
     and I didn't see where this insanity was carrying me, and how it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65370">
     was wronging and abusing the dearest heart in all the world to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65380">
     me--and--and--oh, take me in your arms again, I have no other refuge, no

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65390">
     other home and hope!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65410">
     There was reconciliation again--immediate, perfect, all-embracing--and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65420">
     with it utter happiness. This would have been a good time to adjourn.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65430">
     But no, now that the cloud-breeder was revealed at last; now that it was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65440">
     manifest that all the sour weather had come from this girl's dread that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65450">
     Tracy was lured by her rank and not herself, he resolved to lay that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65460">
     ghost immediately and permanently by furnishing the best possible proof
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65470">
     that he couldn't have had back of him at any time the suspected motive.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65480">
     So he said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65500">
     “Let me whisper a little secret in your ear--a secret which I have kept
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65510">
     shut up in my breast all this time. Your rank couldn't ever have been an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65520">
     enticement. I am son and heir to an English earl!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65540">
     The girl stared at him--one, two, three moments, maybe a dozen--then her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65550">
     lips parted:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65570">
     “You?” she said, and moved away from him, still gazing at him in a kind
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65580">
     of blank amazement.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65600">
     “Why--why, certainly I am. Why do you act like this? What have I done

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65610">
     now?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65630">
     “What have you done? You have certainly made a most strange statement.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65640">
     You must see that yourself.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65660">
     “Well,” with a timid little laugh, “it may be a strange enough
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65670">
     statement; but of what consequence is that, if it is true?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65690">
     “If it is true. You are already retiring from it.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65710">
     “Oh, not for a moment! You should not say that. I have not deserved it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65720">
     I have spoken the truth; why do you doubt it?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65740">
     Her reply was prompt.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65760">
     “Simply because you didn't speak it earlier!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65780">
     “Oh!” It wasn't a groan, exactly, but it was an intelligible enough
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65790">
     expression of the fact that he saw the point and recognized that there
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65800">
     was reason in it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65820">
     “You have seemed to conceal nothing from me that I ought to know

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65840">
     a thing as this from me a moment after--after--well, after you had

     the way--circumstances which--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65900">
     She waved the circumstances aside.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_65920">
     “Well, you see,” he said, pleadingly, “you seemed so bent on our

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_66010">
     He was silent a while. Then he said, in a discouraged way:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_66030">
     “I don't see any way out of it. It was a mistake. That is in truth
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_66040">
     all it was, just a mistake. No harm was meant, no harm in the world. I

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_66050">
     didn't see how it might some time look. It is my way. I don't seem to

     see far.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_66080">
     The girl was almost disarmed, for a moment. Then she flared up again.

     She was about to soften again, but his closing remark made her bring her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_66260">
     foot down with smart vexation, and she cried out:

     He cast about in his mind for a defence of some kind or other--hesitated
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_66350">
     a little, and then said, with difficulty and diffidence:

     The young girl scanned his face narrowly while he spoke; and there was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_66470">
     something about his simplicity of manner and statement which touched her
    </p>

     --touched her almost to the danger point; but she set her grip on the

     This was a hard blow, and staggered him. He said, dejectedly:

     He was gone; and none too soon; her lips were already quivering, and now

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67110">
     she broke down. Through her sobbings her words broke from time to time.

     of himself than he was the day before, and made Sally fully twenty-four

     hours more certain than ever that he not only hadn't any father
    </p>

     These were hard days for Barrow and the art firm. All these had their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67470">
     hands full, trying to comfort Tracy. Barrow's task was particularly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67480">
     hard, because he was made a confidant in full, and therefore had to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67490">
     humor Tracy's delusion that he had a father, and that the father was an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67500">
     earl, and that he was going to send a cablegram. Barrow early gave up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67510">
     the idea of trying to convince Tracy that he hadn't any father, because
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67520">
     this had such a bad effect on the patient, and worked up his temper to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67530">
     such an alarming degree. He had tried, as an experiment, letting Tracy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67540">
     think he had a father; the result was so good that he went further, with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67550">
     proper caution, and tried letting him think his father was an earl; this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67560">
     wrought so well, that he grew bold, and tried letting him think he had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67570">
     two fathers, if he wanted to, but he didn't want to, so Barrow withdrew
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67580">
     one of them and substituted letting him think he was going to get a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67590">
     cablegram--which Barrow judged he wouldn't, and was right; but Barrow
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67600">
     worked the cablegram daily for all it was worth, and it was the one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67610">
     thing that kept Tracy alive; that was Barrow's opinion.

     And these were bitter hard days for poor Sally, and mainly delivered

     up to private crying. She kept her furniture pretty damp, and so caught
    </p>

     cold, and the dampness and the cold and the sorrow together undermined

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67740">
     and that the business of the country had now come to a standstill
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67750">
     by consequence; that judges, lawyers, burglars, parsons, thieves,

     merchants, mechanics, murderers, women, children, babies--everybody,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67770">
     indeed, could be seen from morning till midnight, absorbed in one deep
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67780">
     project and purpose, and only one--to pen those pigs, work out that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67790">
     puzzle successfully; that all gayety, all cheerfulness had departed from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67800">
     the nation, and in its place care, preoccupation and anxiety sat upon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67810">
     every countenance, and all faces were drawn, distressed, and furrowed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67820">
     with the signs of age and trouble, and marked with the still sadder
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67830">
     signs of mental decay and incipient madness; that factories were at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67840">
     work night and day in eight cities, and yet to supply the demand for the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67850">
     puzzle was thus far impossible. Hawkins was wild with joy, but Sellers
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67860">
     was calm. Small matters could not disturb his serenity. He said--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67880">
     “That's just the way things go. A man invents a thing which could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67890">
     revolutionize the arts, produce mountains of money, and bless the earth,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67900">
     and who will bother with it or show any interest in it?--and so you are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67910">
     just as poor as you were before. But you invent some worthless thing to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67920">
     amuse yourself with, and would throw it away if let alone, and all of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67930">
     a sudden the whole world makes a snatch for it and out crops a fortune.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67940">
     Hunt up that Yankee and collect, Hawkins--half is yours, you know. Leave
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67950">
     me to potter at my lecture.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67970">
     This was a temperance lecture. Sellers was head chief in the Temperance
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67980">
     camp, and had lectured, now and then in that interest, but had been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_67990">
     dissatisfied with his efforts; wherefore he was now about to try a new
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68000">
     plan. After much thought he had concluded that a main reason why his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68010">
     lectures lacked fire or something, was that they were too transparently
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68020">
     amateurish; that is to say, it was probably too plainly perceptible
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68030">
     that the lecturer was trying to tell people about the horrid effects of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68040">
     liquor when he didn't really know anything about those effects except
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68050">
     from hearsay, since he had hardly ever tasted an intoxicant in his life.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68060">
     His scheme, now, was to prepare himself to speak from bitter experience.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68070">
     Hawkins was to stand by with the bottle, calculate the doses, watch the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68080">
     effects, make notes of results, and otherwise assist in the preparation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68090">
     Time was short, for the ladies would be along about noon--that is to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68100">
     say, the temperance organization called the Daughters of Siloam--and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68110">
     Sellers must be ready to head the procession.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68130">
     The time kept slipping along--Hawkins did not return--Sellers could not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68140">
     venture to wait longer; so he attacked the bottle himself, and proceeded
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68150">
     to note the effects. Hawkins got back at last; took one comprehensive
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68160">
     glance at the lecturer, and went down and headed off the procession. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68170">
     ladies were grieved to hear that the champion had been taken suddenly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68180">
     ill and violently so, but glad to hear that it was hoped he would be out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68190">
     again in a few days.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68210">
     As it turned out, the old gentleman didn't turn over or show any signs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68220">
     of life worth speaking of for twenty-four hours. Then he asked after the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68230">
     procession, and learned what had happened about it. He was sorry; said
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68240">
     he had been “fixed” for it. He remained abed several days, and his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68250">
     wife and daughter took turns in sitting with him and ministering to his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68260">
     wants. Often he patted Sally's head and tried to comfort her.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68280">
     “Don't cry, my child, don't cry so; you know your old father did it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68290">
     by mistake and didn't mean a bit of harm; you know he wouldn't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68300">
     intentionally do anything to make you ashamed for the world; you know he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68310">
     was trying to do good and only made the mistake through ignorance, not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68320">
     knowing the right doses and Washington not there to help. Don't cry so,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68330">
     dear, it breaks my old heart to see you, and think I've brought this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68340">
     humiliation on you and you so dear to me and so good. I won't ever do it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68350">
     again, indeed I won't; now be comforted, honey, that's a good child.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68370">
     But when she wasn't on duty at the bedside the crying went on just the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68380">
     same; then the mother would try to comfort her, and say:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68400">
     “Don't cry, dear, he never meant any harm; it was all one of those
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68410">
     happens that you can't guard against when you are trying experiments,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68420">
     that way. You see I don't cry. It's because I know him so well. I could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68430">
     never look anybody in the face again if he had got into such an amazing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68440">
     condition as that a-purpose; but bless you his intention was pure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68450">
     and high, and that makes the act pure, though it was higher than was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68460">
     necessary. We're not humiliated, dear, he did it under a noble impulse
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68470">
     and we don't need to be ashamed. There, don't cry any more, honey.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68490">
     Thus, the old gentleman was useful to Sally, during several days, as an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68500">
     explanation of her tearfulness. She felt thankful to him for the shelter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68510">
     he was affording her, but often said to herself, “It's a shame to let
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68520">
     him see in my crying a reproach--as if he could ever do anything that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68530">
     could make me reproach him! But I can't confess; I've got to go on using
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68540">
     him for a pretext, he's the only one I've got in the world, and I do
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68550">
     need one so much.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68570">
     As soon as Sellers was out again, and found that stacks of money had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68580">
     been placed in bank for him and Hawkins by the Yankee, he said, “Now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68590">
     we'll soon see who's the Claimant and who's the Authentic. I'll just go
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68600">
     over there and warm up that House of Lords.” During the next few days
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68610">
     he and his wife were so busy with preparations for the voyage that Sally
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68620">
     had all the privacy she needed, and all the chance to cry that was good
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68630">
     for her. Then the old pair left for New York--and England.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68650">
     Sally had also had a chance to do another thing. That was, to make up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68660">
     her mind that life was not worth living upon the present terms. If she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68670">
     must give up her impostor and die, doubtless she must submit; but might
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68680">
     she not lay her whole case before some disinterested person, first,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68690">
     and see if there wasn't perhaps some saving way out of the matter? She
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68700">
     turned this idea over in her mind a good deal. In her first visit with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68710">
     Hawkins after her parents were gone, the talk fell upon Tracy, and she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68720">
     was impelled to set her case before the statesman and take his counsel.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68730">
     So she poured out her heart, and he listened with painful solicitude.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68740">
     She concluded, pleadingly, with--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68760">
     “Don't tell me he is an impostor. I suppose he is, but doesn't it look
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68770">
     to you as if he isn't? You are cool, you know, and outside; and so,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68780">
     maybe it can look to you as if he isn't one, when it can't to me.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68790">
     Doesn't it look to you as if he isn't? Couldn't you--can't it look to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68800">
     you that way--for--for my sake?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68820">
     The poor man was troubled, but he felt obliged to keep in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68830">
     neighborhood of the truth. He fought around the present detail a little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68840">
     while, then gave it up and said he couldn't really see his way to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68850">
     clearing Tracy.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68870">
     “No,” he said, “the truth is, he's an impostor.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68890">
     “That is, you--you feel a little certain, but not entirely--oh, not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68900">
     entirely, Mr. Hawkins!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68920">
     “It's a pity to have to say it--I do hate to say it, but I don't think
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68930">
     anything about it, I know he's an impostor.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68950">
     “Oh, now, Mr. Hawkins, you can't go that far. A body can't really know
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68960">
     it, you know. It isn't proved that he's not what he says he is.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68980">
     Should he come out and make a clean breast of the whole wretched
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_68990">
     business? Yes--at least the most of it--it ought to be done. So he set
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69000">
     his teeth and went at the matter with determination, but purposing to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69010">
     spare the girl one pain--that of knowing that Tracy was a criminal.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69030">
     “Now I am going to tell you a plain tale; one not pleasant for me to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69040">
     tell or for you to hear, but we've got to stand it. I know all about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69050">
     that fellow; and I know he is no earl's son.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69070">
     The girl's eyes flashed, and she said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69090">
     “I don't care a snap for that--go on!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69110">
     This was so wholly unexpected that it at once obstructed the narrative;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69120">
     Hawkins was not even sure that he had heard aright. He said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69140">
     “I don't know that I quite understand. Do you mean to say that if he was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69150">
     all right and proper otherwise you'd be indifferent about the earl part
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69160">
     of the business?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69180">
     “Absolutely.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69200">
     “You'd be entirely satisfied with him and wouldn't care for his not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69210">
     being an earl's son,--that being an earl's son wouldn't add any value to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69220">
     him?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69240">
     “Not the least value that I would care for. Why, Mr. Hawkins, I've
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69250">
     gotten over all that day-dreaming about earldoms and aristocracies and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69260">
     all such nonsense and am become just a plain ordinary nobody and content
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69270">
     with it; and it is to him I owe my cure. And as to anything being able
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69280">
     to add a value to him, nothing can do that. He is the whole world to me,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69290">
     just as he is; he comprehends all the values there are--then how can you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69300">
     add one?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69320">
     “She's pretty far gone.” He said that to himself. He continued, still to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69330">
     himself, “I must change my plan again; I can't seem to strike one that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69340">
     will stand the requirements of this most variegated emergency five
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69350">
     minutes on a stretch. Without making this fellow a criminal, I believe I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69360">
     will invent a name and a character for him calculated to disenchant her.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69370">
     If it fails to do it, then I'll know that the next rightest thing to do
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69380">
     will be to help her to her fate, poor thing, not hinder her.” Then he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69390">
     said aloud:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69410">
     “Well, Gwendolen--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_69430">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71570">
     not come. Had his father really flung him away? It looked so. It was not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71580">
     like his father, but it surely looked so. His father was a rather
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71590">
     tough nut, in truth, but had never been so with his son--still, this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71600">
     implacable silence had a calamitous look. Anyway, Tracy would go to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71610">
     the Towers and --then what? He didn't know; his head was tired out with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71620">
     thinking--he wouldn't think about what he must do or say--let it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71630">
     all take care of itself. So that he saw Sally once more, he would be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71640">
     satisfied, happen what might; he wouldn't care.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71660">
     He hardly knew how he got to the Towers, or when. He knew and cared for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71670">
     only one thing--he was alone with Sally. She was kind, she was gentle,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71680">
     there was moisture in her eyes, and a yearning something in her face and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71690">
     manner which she could not wholly hide--but she kept her distance. They
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71700">
     talked. Bye and bye she said--watching his downcast countenance out of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71710">
     the corner of her eye--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71730">
     “It's so lonesome--with papa and mamma gone. I try to read, but I can't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71740">
     seem to get interested in any book. I try the newspapers, but they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71750">
     do put such rubbish in them. You take up a paper and start to read
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71760">
     something you thinks interesting, and it goes on and on and on about how
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71770">
     somebody--well, Dr. Snodgrass, for instance--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71790">
     Not a movement from Tracy, not the quiver of a muscle. Sally was amazed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71800">
     --what command of himself he must have! Being disconcerted, she paused
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71810">
     so long that Tracy presently looked up wearily and said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71830">
     “Well?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71850">
     “Oh, I thought you were not listening. Yes, it goes on and on about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71860">
     this Doctor Snodgrass, till you are so tired, and then about his younger

     son--the favorite son--Zylobalsamum Snodgrass--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71890">
     Not a sign from Tracy, whose head was drooping again. What supernatural
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71900">
     self-possession! Sally fixed her eye on him and began again, resolved
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71910">
     to blast him out of his serenity this time if she knew how to apply the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71920">
     dynamite that is concealed in certain forms of words when those words
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71930">
     are properly loaded with unexpected meanings.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71950">
     “And next it goes on and on and on about the eldest son--not the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71960">
     favorite, this one--and how he is neglected in his poor barren boyhood,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71970">
     and allowed to grow up unschooled, ignorant, coarse, vulgar, the comrade
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71980">
     of the community's scum, and become in his completed manhood a rude,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_71990">
     profane, dissipated ruffian--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72010">
     That head still drooped! Sally rose, moved softly and solemnly a step or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72020">
     two, and stood before Tracy--his head came slowly up, his meek eyes met
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72030">
     her intense ones--then she finished with deep impressiveness--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72050">
     “--named Spinal Meningitis Snodgrass!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72070">
     Tracy merely exhibited signs of increased fatigue. The girl was outraged
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72080">
     by this iron indifference and callousness, and cried out--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72100">
     “What are you made of?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72120">
     “I? Why?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72140">
     “Haven't you any sensitiveness? Don't these things touch any poor

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72170">
     “N--no,” he said wonderingly, “they don't seem to. Why should they?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72190">
     “O, dear me, how can you look so innocent, and foolish, and good, and
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72370">
     “What? Say it again!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72390">
     “I have never--never in my life till now.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72410">
     “Oh, you do look so honest when you say that! It must be true--surely

    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72600">
     “My father!” The young man released the girl and hung his head.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72620">
     The old gentleman stood surveying the couple--the one with a strongly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72630">
     complimentary right eye, the other with a mixed expression done with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72640">
     left. This is difficult, and not often resorted to. Presently his face
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72650">
     relaxed into a kind of constructive gentleness, and he said to his son:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72670">
     “Don't you think you could embrace me, too?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72690">
     The young man did it with alacrity. “Then you are the son of an earl,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72700">
     after all,” said Sally, reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72720">
     “Yes, I--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72740">
     “Then I won't have you!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72760">
     “O, but you know--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72780">
     “No, I will not. You've told me another fib.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72800">
     “She's right. Go away and leave us. I want to talk with her.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72820">
     Berkeley was obliged to go. But he did not go far. He remained on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72830">
     premises. At midnight the conference between the old gentleman and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72840">
     the young girl was still going blithely on, but it presently drew to a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72850">
     close, and the former said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72870">
     “I came all the way over here to inspect you, my dear, with the general
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72880">
     idea of breaking off this match if there were two fools of you, but as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72890">
     there's only one, you can have him if you'll take him.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72910">
     “Indeed I will, then! May I kiss you?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72930">
     “You may. Thank you. Now you shall have that privilege whenever you are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72940">
     good.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72960">
     Meantime Hawkins had long ago returned and slipped up into the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72970">
     laboratory. He was rather disconcerted to find his late invention,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72980">
     Snodgrass, there. The news was told him that the English Rossmore was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_72990">
     come.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73010">
     --“And I'm his son, Viscount Berkeley, not Howard Tracy any more.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73030">
     Hawkins was aghast. He said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73050">
     “Good gracious, then you're dead!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73070">
     “Dead?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73090">
     “Yes you are--we've got your ashes.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73110">
     “Hang those ashes, I'm tired of them; I'll give them to my father.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73130">
     Slowly and painfully the statesman worked the truth into his head that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73140">
     this was really a flesh and blood young man, and not the insubstantial
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73150">
     resurrection he and Sellers had so long supposed him to be. Then he said
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73160">
     with feeling--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73180">
     “I'm so glad; so glad on Sally's account, poor thing. We took you for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73190">
     a departed materialized bank thief from Tahlequah. This will be a heavy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73200">
     blow to Sellers.” Then he explained the whole matter to Berkeley, who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73210">
     said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73230">
     “Well, the Claimant must manage to stand the blow, severe as it is. But
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73240">
     he'll get over the disappointment.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73260">
     “Who--the colonel? He'll get over it the minute he invents a new
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73270">
     miracle to take its place. And he's already at it by this time. But look
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73280">
     here--what do you suppose became of the man you've been representing all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73290">
     this time?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73310">
     “I don't know. I saved his clothes--it was all I could do. I am afraid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73320">
     he lost his life.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73340">
     “Well, you must have found twenty or thirty thousand dollars in those
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73350">
     clothes, in money or certificates of deposit.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73370">
     “No, I found only five hundred and a trifle. I borrowed the trifle and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73380">
     banked the five hundred.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73400">
     “What'll we do about it?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73420">
     “Return it to the owner.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73440">
     “It's easy said, but not easy to manage. Let's leave it alone till we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73450">
     get Sellers's advice. And that reminds me. I've got to run and meet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73460">
     Sellers and explain who you are not and who you are, or he'll come
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73470">
     thundering in here to stop his daughter from marrying a phantom.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73480">
     But--suppose your father came over here to break off the match?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73500">
     “Well, isn't he down stairs getting acquainted with Sally? That's all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73510">
     safe.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73530">
     So Hawkins departed to meet and prepare the Sellerses.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73550">
     Rossmore Towers saw great times and late hours during the succeeding
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73560">
     week. The two earls were such opposites in nature that they fraternized
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73570">
     at once. Sellers said privately that Rossmore was the most extraordinary
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73580">
     character he had ever met--a man just made out of the condensed milk of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73590">
     human kindness, yet with the ability to totally hide the fact from any

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73600">
     but the most practised character-reader; a man whose whole being was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73610">
     sweetness, patience and charity, yet with a cunning so profound, an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73620">
     ability so marvelous in the acting of a double part, that many a person
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73630">
     of considerable intelligence might live with him for centuries and never
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73640">
     suspect the presence in him of these characteristics.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73660">
     Finally there was a quiet wedding at the Towers, instead of a big one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73670">
     at the British embassy, with the militia and the fire brigades and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73680">
     temperance organizations on hand in torchlight procession, as at first
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73690">
     proposed by one of the earls. The art-firm and Barrow were present at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73700">
     the wedding, and the tinner and Puss had been invited, but the tinner
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73710">
     was ill and Puss was nursing him--for they were engaged.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73730">
     The Sellerses were to go to England with their new allies for a brief
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73740">
     visit, but when it was time to take the train from Washington, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73750">
     colonel was missing.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73770">
     Hawkins was going as far as New York with the party, and said he would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73780">
     explain the matter on the road.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73800">
     The explanation was in a letter left by the colonel in Hawkins's hands.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73810">
     In it he promised to join Mrs. Sellers later, in England, and then went
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73820">
     on to say:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73840">
     The truth is, my dear Hawkins, a mighty idea has been born to me within
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73850">
     the hour, and I must not even stop to say goodbye to my dear ones.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73860">
     A man's highest duty takes precedence of all minor ones, and must be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73870">
     attended to with his best promptness and energy, at whatsoever cost to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73880">
     his affections or his convenience. And first of all a man's duties
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73890">
     is his duty to his own honor--he must keep that spotless. Mine is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73900">
     threatened. When I was feeling sure of my imminent future solidity, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73910">
     forwarded to the Czar of Russia--perhaps prematurely--an offer for the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73920">
     purchase of Siberia, naming a vast sum. Since then an episode has
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73930">
     warned me that the method by which I was expecting to acquire this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73940">
     money--materialization upon a scale of limitless magnitude--is marred
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73950">
     by a taint of temporary uncertainty. His imperial majesty may accept
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73960">
     my offer at any moment. If this should occur now, I should find myself
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73970">
     painfully embarrassed, in fact financially inadequate. I could not take
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_73980">
     Siberia. This would become known, and my credit would suffer.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74000">
     Recently my private hours have been dark indeed, but the sun shines
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74010">
     again now; I see my way; I shall be able to meet my obligation, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74020">
     without having to ask an extension of the stipulated time, I think. This
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74030">
     grand new idea of mine--the sublimest I have ever conceived, will save
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74040">
     me whole, I am sure. I am leaving for San Francisco this moment, to test
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74050">
     it, by the help of the great Lick telescope. Like all of my more notable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74060">
     discoveries and inventions, it is based upon hard, practical scientific
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74070">
     laws; all other bases are unsound and hence untrustworthy. In brief,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74080">
     then, I have conceived the stupendous idea of reorganizing the climates
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74090">
     of the earth according to the desire of the populations interested.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74100">
     That is to say, I will furnish climates to order, for cash or negotiable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74110">
     paper, taking the old climates in part payment, of course, at a fair
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74120">
     discount, where they are in condition to be repaired at small cost and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74130">
     let out for hire to poor and remote communities not able to afford a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74140">
     good climate and not caring for an expensive one for mere display.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74150">
     My studies have convinced me that the regulation of climates and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74160">
     breeding of new varieties at will from the old stock is a feasible
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74170">
     thing. Indeed I am convinced that it has been done before; done in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74180">
     prehistoric times by now forgotten and unrecorded civilizations.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74190">
     Everywhere I find hoary evidences of artificial manipulation of climates
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74200">
     in bygone times. Take the glacial period. Was that produced by accident?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74210">
     Not at all; it was done for money. I have a thousand proofs of it, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74220">
     will some day reveal them.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74240">
     I will confide to you an outline of my idea. It is to utilize the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74250">
     spots on the sun--get control of them, you understand, and apply the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74260">
     stupendous energies which they wield to beneficent purposes in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74270">
     reorganizing of our climates. At present they merely make trouble and do
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74280">
     harm in the evoking of cyclones and other kinds of electric storms; but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74290">
     once under humane and intelligent control this will cease and they will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74300">
     become a boon to man.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74320">
     I have my plan all mapped out, whereby I hope and expect to acquire
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74330">
     complete and perfect control of the sun-spots, also details of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74340">
     method whereby I shall employ the same commercially; but I will not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74350">
     venture to go into particulars before the patents shall have been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74360">
     issued. I shall hope and expect to sell shop-rights to the minor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74370">
     countries at a reasonable figure and supply a good business article
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74380">
     of climate to the great empires at special rates, together with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74390">
     fancy brands for coronations, battles and other great and particular
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74400">
     occasions. There are billions of money in this enterprise, no expensive
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74410">
     plant is required, and I shall begin to realize in a few days--in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74420">
     few weeks at furthest. I shall stand ready to pay cash for Siberia
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74430">
     the moment it is delivered, and thus save my honor and my credit. I am
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74440">
     confident of this.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74460">
     I would like you to provide a proper outfit and start north as soon as

     I telegraph you, be it night or be it day. I wish you to take up all

     the country stretching away from the north pole on all sides for many

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000013_74500">
     can get now while they are cheap. It is my intention to move one of the

     have the entire Arctic Circle in the market as a summer resort next
    </p>

     what can be utilized on the equator, to reduce the temperature of

     the prodigious nature of my scheme and the feasible and enormously

     as soon as I shall have sold out some of my principal climates and
