     CHAPTER I.
    </head>
    <p>
     It is a matchless morning in rural England. On a fair hill we see a
    </p>
    <p>
     majestic pile, the ivied walls and towers of Cholmondeley Castle, huge
    </p>
    <p>
     relic and witness of the baronial grandeurs of the Middle Ages. This is
    </p>
    <p>
     one of the seats of the Earl of Rossmore, K. G. G. C. B. K. C. M. G.,
    </p>
    <p>
     etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., who possesses twenty-two thousand acres
    </p>
    <p>
     of English land, owns a parish in London with two thousand houses on its
    </p>
    <p>
     lease-roll, and struggles comfortably along on an income of two hundred
    </p>
    <p>
     thousand pounds a year. The father and founder of this proud old line
    </p>
    <p>
     was William the Conqueror his very self; the mother of it was not
    </p>
    <p>
     inventoried in history by name, she being merely a random episode and
    </p>
    <p>
     inconsequential, like the tanner's daughter of Falaise.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a breakfast room of the castle on this breezy fine morning there are
    </p>
    <p>
     two persons and the cooling remains of a deserted meal. One of these
    </p>
    <p>
     persons is the old lord, tall, erect, square-shouldered, white-haired,
    </p>
    <p>
     stern-browed, a man who shows character in every feature, attitude,
    </p>
    <p>
     and movement, and carries his seventy years as easily as most men carry
    </p>
    <p>
     fifty. The other person is his only son and heir, a dreamy-eyed young
    </p>
    <p>
     fellow, who looks about twenty-six but is nearer thirty. Candor,
    </p>
    <p>
     kindliness, honesty, sincerity, simplicity, modesty--it is easy to see
    </p>
    <p>
     that these are cardinal traits of his character; and so when you have
    </p>
    <p>
     clothed him in the formidable components of his name, you somehow
    </p>
    <p>
     seem to be contemplating a lamb in armor: his name and style being
    </p>
    <p>
     the Honourable Kirkcudbright Llanover Marjoribanks Sellers
    </p>
    <p>
     Viscount-Berkeley, of Cholmondeley Castle, Warwickshire. (Pronounced
    </p>
    <p>
     K'koobry Thlanover Marshbanks Sellers Vycount Barkly, of Chumly Castle,
    </p>
    <p>
     Warrikshr.) He is standing by a great window, in an attitude suggestive
    </p>
    <p>
     of respectful attention to what his father is saying and equally
    </p>
    <p>
     respectful dissent from the positions and arguments offered. The father
    </p>
    <p>
     walks the floor as he talks, and his talk shows that his temper is away
    </p>
    <p>
     up toward summer heat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Soft-spirited as you are, Berkeley, I am quite aware that when you
    </p>
    <p>
     have once made up your mind to do a thing which your ideas of honor and
    </p>
    <p>
     justice require you to do, argument and reason are (for the time being,)
    </p>
    <p>
     wasted upon you--yes, and ridicule; persuasion, supplication, and
    </p>
    <p>
     command as well. To my mind--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Father, if you will look at it without prejudice, without passion, you
    </p>
    <p>
     must concede that I am not doing a rash thing, a thoughtless, wilful
    </p>
    <p>
     thing, with nothing substantial behind it to justify it. I did not
    </p>
    <p>
     create the American claimant to the earldom of Rossmore; I did not hunt
    </p>
    <p>
     for him, did not find him, did not obtrude him upon your notice. He
    </p>
    <p>
     found himself, he injected himself into our lives--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And has made mine a purgatory for ten years with his tiresome letters,
    </p>
    <p>
     his wordy reasonings, his acres of tedious evidence,--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Which you would never read, would never consent to read. Yet in common
    </p>
    <p>
     fairness he was entitled to a hearing. That hearing would either prove
    </p>
    <p>
     he was the rightful earl--in which case our course would be plain--or
    </p>
    <p>
     it would prove that he wasn't--in which case our course would be equally
    </p>
    <p>
     plain. I have read his evidences, my lord. I have conned them well,
    </p>
    <p>
     studied them patiently and thoroughly. The chain seems to be complete,
    </p>
    <p>
     no important link wanting. I believe he is the rightful earl.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And I a usurper--a--nameless pauper, a tramp! Consider what you are
    </p>
    <p>
     saying, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Father, if he is the rightful earl, would you, could you--that fact
    </p>
    <p>
     being established--consent to keep his titles and his properties from
    </p>
    <p>
     him a day, an hour, a minute?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You are talking nonsense--nonsense--lurid idiocy! Now, listen to me. I
    </p>
    <p>
     will make a confession--if you wish to call it by that name. I did not
    </p>
    <p>
     read those evidences because I had no occasion to--I was made familiar
    </p>
    <p>
     with them in the time of this claimant's father and of my own father
    </p>
    <p>
     forty years ago. This fellow's predecessors have kept mine more or less
    </p>
    <p>
     familiar with them for close upon a hundred and fifty years. The truth
    </p>
    <p>
     is, the rightful heir did go to America, with the Fairfax heir or about
    </p>
    <p>
     the same time--but disappeared--somewhere in the wilds of Virginia, got
    </p>
    <p>
     married, and began to breed savages for the Claimant market; wrote no
    </p>
    <p>
     letters home; was supposed to be dead; his younger brother softly took
    </p>
    <p>
     possession; presently the American did die, and straightway his eldest
    </p>
    <p>
     product put in his claim--by letter--letter still in existence--and
    </p>
    <p>
     died before the uncle in-possession found time--or maybe
    </p>
    <p>
     inclination--to--answer. The infant son of that eldest product
    </p>
    <p>
     grew up--long interval, you see--and he took to writing letters and
    </p>
    <p>
     furnishing evidences. Well, successor after successor has done the same,
    </p>
    <p>
     down to the present idiot. It was a succession of paupers; not one of
    </p>
    <p>
     them was ever able to pay his passage to England or institute suit. The
    </p>
    <p>
     Fairfaxes kept their lordship alive, and so they have never lost it to
    </p>
    <p>
     this day, although they live in Maryland; their friend lost his by his
    </p>
    <p>
     own neglect. You perceive now, that the facts in this case bring us to
    </p>
    <p>
     precisely this result: morally the American tramp is rightful earl of
    </p>
    <p>
     Rossmore; legally he has no more right than his dog. There now--are you
    </p>
    <p>
     satisfied?”
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a pause, then the son glanced at the crest carved in the great
    </p>
    <p>
     oaken mantel and said, with a regretful note in his voice:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Since the introduction of heraldic symbols,--the motto of this house
    </p>
    <p>
     has been 'Suum cuique'--to every man his own. By your own intrepidly
    </p>
    <p>
     frank confession, my lord, it is become a sarcasm: If Simon Lathers--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Keep that exasperating name to yourself! For ten years it has pestered
    </p>
    <p>
     my eye--and tortured my ear; till at last my very footfalls time
    </p>
    <p>
     themselves to the brain-racking rhythm of Simon Lathers!--Simon Lathers!
    </p>
    <p>
     --Simon Lathers! And now, to make its presence in my soul eternal,
    </p>
    <p>
     immortal, imperishable, you have resolved to--to--what is it you have
    </p>
    <p>
     resolved to do?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “To go to Simon Lathers, in America, and change places with him.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? Deliver the reversion of the earldom into his hands?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That is my purpose.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Make this tremendous surrender without even trying the fantastic case
    </p>
    <p>
     in the Lords?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ye--s--” with hesitation and some embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
     “By all that is amazing, I believe you are insane, my son. See here
    </p>
    <p>
     --have you been training with that ass again--that radical, if you
    </p>
    <p>
     prefer the term, though the words are synonymous--Lord Tanzy, of
    </p>
    <p>
     Tollmache?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The son did not reply, and the old lord continued:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, you confess. That puppy, that shame to his birth and caste, who
    </p>
    <p>
     holds all hereditary lordships and privilege to be usurpation, all
    </p>
    <p>
     nobility a tinsel sham, all aristocratic institutions a fraud, all
    </p>
    <p>
     inequalities in rank a legalized crime and an infamy, and no bread
    </p>
    <p>
     honest bread that a man doesn't earn by his own work--work, pah!”--and
    </p>
    <p>
     the old patrician brushed imaginary labor-dirt from his white hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You have come to hold just those opinions yourself, I suppose,”--he added
    </p>
    <p>
     with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
     A faint flush in the younger man's cheek told that the shot had hit and
    </p>
    <p>
     hurt; but he answered with dignity:
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have. I say it without shame--I feel none. And now my reason for
    </p>
    <p>
     resolving to renounce my heirship without resistance is explained. I
    </p>
    <p>
     wish to retire from what to me is a false existence, a false position,
    </p>
    <p>
     and begin my life over again--begin it right--begin it on the level of
    </p>
    <p>
     mere manhood, unassisted by factitious aids, and succeed or fail by pure
    </p>
    <p>
     merit or the want of it. I will go to America, where all men are equal
    </p>
    <p>
     and all have an equal chance; I will live or die, sink or swim, win or
    </p>
    <p>
     lose as just a man--that alone, and not a single helping gaud or fiction
    </p>
    <p>
     back of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hear, hear!” The two men looked each other steadily in the eye a
    </p>
    <p>
     moment or two, then the elder one added, musingly, “Ab-so-lutely
    </p>
    <p>
     cra-zy--ab-solutely!” After another silence, he said, as one who, long
    </p>
    <p>
     troubled by clouds, detects a ray of sunshine, “Well, there will be one
    </p>
    <p>
     satisfaction--Simon Lathers will come here to enter into his own, and I
    </p>
    <p>
     will drown him in the horsepond. The poor devil--always so humble in
    </p>
    <p>
     his letters, so pitiful, so deferential; so steeped in reverence for our
    </p>
    <p>
     great line and lofty-station; so anxious to placate us, so prayerful
    </p>
    <p>
     for recognition as a relative, a bearer in his veins of our sacred
    </p>
    <p>
     blood--and withal so poor, so needy, so threadbare and pauper-shod as
    </p>
    <p>
     to raiment, so despised, so laughed at for his silly claimantship by the
    </p>
    <p>
     lewd American scum around him--ah, the vulgar, crawling, insufferable
    </p>
    <p>
     tramp! To read one of his cringing, nauseating letters--well?”
    </p>
    <p>
     This to a splendid flunkey, all in inflamed plush and buttons and
    </p>
    <p>
     knee-breeches as to his trunk, and a glinting white frost-work of
    </p>
    <p>
     ground-glass paste as to his head, who stood with his heels together and
    </p>
    <p>
     the upper half of him bent forward, a salver in his hands:
    </p>
    <p>
     “The letters, my lord.”
    </p>
    <p>
     My lord took them, and the servant disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Among the rest, an American letter. From the tramp, of course. Jove,
    </p>
    <p>
     but here's a change! No brown paper envelope this time, filched from
    </p>
    <p>
     a shop, and carrying the shop's advertisement in the corner. Oh, no,
    </p>
    <p>
     a proper enough envelope--with a most ostentatiously broad mourning
    </p>
    <p>
     border--for his cat, perhaps, since he was a bachelor--and fastened with
    </p>
    <p>
     red wax--a batch of it as big as a half-crown--and--and--our crest for
    </p>
    <p>
     a seal!--motto and all. And the ignorant, sprawling hand is gone; he
    </p>
    <p>
     sports a secretary, evidently--a secretary with a most confident swing
    </p>
    <p>
     and flourish to his pen. Oh indeed, our fortunes are improving over
    </p>
    <p>
     there--our meek tramp has undergone a metamorphosis.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Read it, my lord, please.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, this time I will. For the sake of the cat:”
    </p>
    <p>
     14,042 SIXTEENTH. STREET, WASHINGTON, May 2.
    </p>
    <p>
     My Lord--It is my painful duty to announce to you that the head of our
    </p>
    <p>
     illustrious house is no more--The Right Honourable, The Most Noble,
    </p>
    <p>
     The Most Puissant Simon Lathers Lord Rossmore having departed this life
    </p>
    <p>
     (“Gone at last--this is unspeakably precious news, my son,”) at his seat
    </p>
    <p>
     in the environs of the hamlet of Duffy's Corners in the grand old State
    </p>
    <p>
     of Arkansas,--and his twin brother with him, both being crushed by a
    </p>
    <p>
     log at a smoke-house-raising, owing to carelessness on the part of all
    </p>
    <p>
     present, referable to over-confidence and gaiety induced by overplus of
    </p>
    <p>
     sour-mash--(“Extolled be sour-mash, whatever that may be, eh Berkeley?”)
    </p>
    <p>
     five days ago, with no scion of our ancient race present to close his
    </p>
    <p>
     eyes and inter him with the honors due his historic name and lofty rank-
    </p>
    <p>
     -in fact, he is on the ice yet, him and his brother--friends took up
    </p>
    <p>
     a collection for it. But I shall take immediate occasion to have their
    </p>
    <p>
     noble remains shipped to you (“Great heavens!”) for interment, with
    </p>
    <p>
     due ceremonies and solemnities, in the family vault or mausoleum of our
    </p>
    <p>
     house. Meantime I shall put up a pair of hatchments on my house-front,
    </p>
    <p>
     and you will of course do the same at your several seats.
    </p>
    <p>
     I have also to remind you that by this sad disaster I as sole heir,
    </p>
    <p>
     inherit and become seized of all the titles, honors, lands, and goods
    </p>
    <p>
     of our lamented relative, and must of necessity, painful as the duty is,
    </p>
    <p>
     shortly require at the bar of the Lords restitution of these dignities
    </p>
    <p>
     and properties, now illegally enjoyed by your titular lordship.
    </p>
    <p>
     With assurance of my distinguished consideration and warm cousinly
    </p>
    <p>
     regard, I remain Your titular lordship's
    </p>
    <p>
     Most obedient servant,
    </p>
    <p>
     Mulberry Sellers Earl Rossmore.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Immense! Come, this one's interesting. Why, Berkeley, his breezy
    </p>
    <p>
     impudence is--is--why, it's colossal, it's sublime.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, this one doesn't seem to cringe much.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Cringe--why, he doesn't know the meaning of the word. Hatchments! To
    </p>
    <p>
     commemorate that sniveling tramp and his, fraternal duplicate. And he is
    </p>
    <p>
     going to send me the remains. The late Claimant was a fool, but plainly
    </p>
    <p>
     this new one's a maniac. What a name! Mulberry Sellers--there's music
    </p>
    <p>
     for you, Simon Lathers--Mulberry Sellers--Mulberry Sellers--Simon
    </p>
    <p>
     Lathers. Sounds like machinery working and churning. Simon Lathers,
    </p>
    <p>
     Mulberry Sel--Are you going?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “If I have your leave, father.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The old gentleman stood musing some time, after his son was gone. This
    </p>
    <p>
     was his thought:
    </p>
    <p>
     “He is a good boy, and lovable. Let him take his own course--as it would
    </p>

     CHAPTER II.
    </head>
    <p>
     COLONEL MULBERRY SELLERS--this was some days before he wrote his letter
    </p>
    <p>
     to Lord Rossmore--was seated in his “library,” which was also his
    </p>
    <p>
     “drawing-room” and was also his “picture gallery” and likewise his
    </p>
    <p>
     “work-shop.” Sometimes he called it by one of these names, sometimes
    </p>
    <p>
     by another, according to occasion and circumstance. He was constructing
    </p>
    <p>
     what seemed to be some kind of a frail mechanical toy; and was
    </p>
    <p>
     apparently very much interested in his work. He was a white-headed
    </p>
    <p>
     man, now, but otherwise he was as young, alert, buoyant, visionary
    </p>
    <p>
     and enterprising as ever. His loving old wife sat near by, contentedly
    </p>
    <p>
     knitting and thinking, with a cat asleep in her lap. The room was large,
    </p>
    <p>
     light, and had a comfortable look, in fact a home-like look, though
    </p>
    <p>
     the furniture was of a humble sort and not over abundant, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     knickknacks and things that go to adorn a living-room not plenty and not
    </p>
    <p>
     costly. But there were natural flowers, and there was an abstract and
    </p>
    <p>
     unclassifiable something about the place which betrayed the presence in
    </p>
    <p>
     the house of somebody with a happy taste and an effective touch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even the deadly chromos on the walls were somehow without offence; in
    </p>
    <p>
     fact they seemed to belong there and to add an attraction to the room--a
    </p>
    <p>
     fascination, anyway; for whoever got his eye on one of them was like to
    </p>
    <p>
     gaze and suffer till he died--you have seen that kind of pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some of these terrors were landscapes, some libeled the sea, some
    </p>
    <p>
     were ostensible portraits, all were crimes. All the portraits were
    </p>
    <p>
     recognizable as dead Americans of distinction, and yet, through labeling
    </p>
    <p>
     added, by a daring hand, they were all doing duty here as “Earls of
    </p>
    <p>
     Rossmore.” The newest one had left the works as Andrew Jackson, but was
    </p>
    <p>
     doing its best now, as “Simon Lathers Lord Rossmore, Present Earl.” On
    </p>
    <p>
     one wall was a cheap old railroad map of Warwickshire. This had been
    </p>
    <p>
     newly labeled “The Rossmore Estates.” On the opposite wall was another
    </p>
    <p>
     map, and this was the most imposing decoration of the establishment and
    </p>
    <p>
     the first to catch a stranger's attention, because of its great size. It
    </p>
    <p>
     had once borne simply the title SIBERIA; but now the word “FUTURE” had
    </p>
    <p>
     been written in front of that word. There were other additions, in red
    </p>
    <p>
     ink--many cities, with great populations set down, scattered over
    </p>
    <p>
     the vast-country at points where neither cities nor populations exist
    </p>
    <p>
     to-day. One of these cities, with population placed at 1,500,000,
    </p>
    <p>
     bore the name “Libertyorloffskoizalinski,” and there was a still more
    </p>
    <p>
     populous one, centrally located and marked “Capital,” which bore the
    </p>
    <p>
     name “Freedomolovnaivanovich.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The “mansion”--the Colonel's usual name for the house--was a rickety old
    </p>
    <p>
     two-story frame of considerable size, which had been painted, some time
    </p>
    <p>
     or other, but had nearly forgotten it. It was away out in the ragged
    </p>
    <p>
     edge of Washington and had once been somebody's country place. It had
    </p>
    <p>
     a neglected yard around it, with paling fence that needed straightening
    </p>
    <p>
     up, in places, and a gate that would stay shut. By the door-post were
    </p>
    <p>
     several modest tin signs. “Col. Mulberry Sellers, Attorney at Law and
    </p>
    <p>
     Claim Agent,” was the principal one. One learned from the others that
    </p>
    <p>
     the Colonel was a Materializer, a Hypnotizer, a Mind-Cure dabbler; and
    </p>
    <p>
     so on. For he was a man who could always find things to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     A white-headed negro man, with spectacles and damaged white cotton
    </p>
    <p>
     gloves appeared in the presence, made a stately obeisance and announced:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Marse Washington Hawkins, suh.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Great Scott! Show him in, Dan'l, show him in.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The Colonel and his wife were on their feet in a moment, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     next moment were joyfully wringing the hands of a stoutish,
    </p>
    <p>
     discouraged-looking man whose general aspect suggested that he was fifty
    </p>
    <p>
     years old, but whose hair swore to a hundred.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, well, well, Washington, my boy, it is good to look at you again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sit down, sit down, and make yourself at home. There, now--why, you look
    </p>
    <p>
     perfectly natural; aging a little, just a little, but you'd have known
    </p>
    <p>
     him anywhere, wouldn't you, Polly?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, yes, Berry, he's just like his pa would have looked if he'd lived.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dear, dear, where have you dropped from? Let me see, how long is it
    </p>
    <p>
     since--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I should say it's all of fifteen years, Mrs. Sellers.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, well, how time does get away with us. Yes, and oh, the changes
    </p>
    <p>
     that--”
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a sudden catch of her voice and a trembling of the lip, the
    </p>
    <p>
     men waiting reverently for her to get command of herself and go on; but
    </p>
    <p>
     after a little struggle she turned away, with her apron to her eyes, and
    </p>
    <p>
     softly disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Seeing you made her think of the children, poor thing--dear, dear,
    </p>
    <p>
     they're all dead but the youngest.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But banish care, it's no time for it now--on with the dance, let joy be
    </p>
    <p>
     unconfined is my motto, whether there's any dance to dance; or any joy
    </p>
    <p>
     to unconfine--you'll be the healthier for it every time,--every time,
    </p>
    <p>
     Washington--it's my experience, and I've seen a good deal of this world.
    </p>
    <p>
     Come--where have you disappeared to all these years, and are you from
    </p>
    <p>
     there, now, or where are you from?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't quite think you would ever guess, Colonel. Cherokee Strip.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “My land!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sure as you live.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can't mean it. Actually living out there?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, yes, if a body may call it that; though it's a pretty strong
    </p>
    <p>
     term for 'dobies and jackass rabbits, boiled beans and slap-jacks,
    </p>
    <p>
     depression, withered hopes, poverty in all its varieties--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Louise out there?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, and the children.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Out there now?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, I couldn't afford to bring them with me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, I see,--you had to come--claim against the government. Make
    </p>
    <p>
     yourself perfectly easy--I'll take care of that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But it isn't a claim against the government.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No? Want to be postmaster? That's all right. Leave it to me. I'll fix
    </p>
    <p>
     it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But it isn't postmaster--you're all astray yet.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, good gracious, Washington, why don't you come out and tell me
    </p>
    <p>
     what it is? What, do you want to be so reserved and distrustful with an
    </p>
    <p>
     old friend like me for? Don't you reckon I can keep a se--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “There's no secret about it--you merely don't give me a chance to--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now look here, old friend, I know the human race; and I know that when
    </p>
    <p>
     a man comes to Washington, I don't care if it's from heaven, let alone
    </p>
    <p>
     Cherokee-Strip, it's because he wants something. And I know that as
    </p>
    <p>
     a rule he's not going to get it; that he'll stay and try--for another
    </p>
    <p>
     thing and won't get that; the same luck with the next and the next
    </p>
    <p>
     and the next; and keeps on till he strikes bottom, and is too poor
    </p>
    <p>
     and ashamed to go back, even to Cherokee Strip; and at last his heart
    </p>
    <p>
     breaks--and they take up a collection and bury him. There--don't
    </p>
    <p>
     interrupt me, I know what I'm talking about. Happy and prosperous in the
    </p>
    <p>
     Far West wasn't I? You know that. Principal citizen of Hawkeye, looked
    </p>
    <p>
     up to by everybody, kind of an autocrat, actually a kind of an autocrat,
    </p>
    <p>
     Washington. Well, nothing would do but I must go Minister to St.
    </p>
    <p>
     James, the Governor and everybody insisting, you know, and so at last I
    </p>
    <p>
     consented--no getting out of it, had to do it, so here I came. A day too
    </p>
    <p>
     late, Washington. Think of that--what little things change the world's
    </p>
    <p>
     history--yes, sir, the place had been filled. Well, there I was, you
    </p>
    <p>
     see. I offered to compromise and go to Paris. The President was very
    </p>
    <p>
     sorry and all that, but that place, you see, didn't belong to the West,
    </p>
    <p>
     so there I was again. There was no help for it, so I had to stoop a
    </p>
    <p>
     little--we all reach the day some time or other when we've got to do
    </p>
    <p>
     that, Washington, and it's not a bad thing for us, either, take it by
    </p>
    <p>
     and large and all around--I had to stoop a little and offer to
    </p>
    <p>
     take Constantinople. Washington, consider this--for it's perfectly
    </p>
    <p>
     true--within a month I asked for China; within another month I begged
    </p>
    <p>
     for Japan; one year later I was away down, down, down, supplicating with
    </p>
    <p>
     tears and anguish for the bottom office in the gift of the government
    </p>
    <p>
     of the United States--Flint-Picker in the cellars of the War Department.
    </p>
    <p>
     And by George I didn't get it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Flint-Picker?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes. Office established in the time of the Revolution, last century.
    </p>
    <p>
     The musket-flints for the military posts were supplied from the capitol.
    </p>
    <p>
     They do it yet; for although the flint-arm has gone out and the forts
    </p>
    <p>
     have tumbled down, the decree hasn't been repealed--been overlooked
    </p>
    <p>
     and forgotten, you see--and so the vacancies where old Ticonderoga and
    </p>
    <p>
     others used to stand, still get their six quarts of gun-flints a year
    </p>
    <p>
     just the same.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Washington said musingly after a pause:
    </p>
    <p>
     “How strange it seems--to start for Minister to England at twenty
    </p>
    <p>
     thousand a year and fail for flintpicker at--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Three dollars a week. It's human life, Washington--just an epitome of
    </p>
    <p>
     human ambition, and struggle, and the outcome: you aim for the palace
    </p>
    <p>
     and get drowned in the sewer.”
    </p>
    <p>
     There was another meditative silence. Then Washington said, with earnest
    </p>
    <p>
     compassion in his voice--
    </p>
    <p>
     “And so, after coming here, against your inclination, to satisfy your
    </p>
    <p>
     sense of patriotic duty and appease a selfish public clamor, you get
    </p>
    <p>
     absolutely nothing for it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nothing?” The Colonel had to get up and stand, to get room for his
    </p>
    <p>
     amazement to expand. “Nothing, Washington? I ask you this: to be a
    </p>
    <p>
     perpetual Member and the only Perpetual Member of a Diplomatic Body
    </p>
    <p>
     accredited to the greatest country on earth do you call that nothing?”
    </p>
    <p>
     It was Washington's turn to be amazed. He was stricken dumb; but the
    </p>
    <p>
     wide-eyed wonder, the reverent admiration expressed in his face were
    </p>
    <p>
     more eloquent than any words could have been. The Colonel's wounded
    </p>
    <p>
     spirit was healed and he resumed his seat pleased and content. He leaned
    </p>
    <p>
     forward and said impressively:
    </p>
    <p>
     “What was due to a man who had become forever conspicuous by an
    </p>
    <p>
     experience without precedent in the history of the world?--a man made
    </p>
    <p>
     permanently and diplomatically sacred, so to speak, by having been
    </p>
    <p>
     connected, temporarily, through solicitation, with every single
    </p>
    <p>
     diplomatic post in the roster of this government, from Envoy
    </p>
    <p>
     Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of St. James all
    </p>
    <p>
     the way down to Consul to a guano rock in the Strait of Sunda--salary
    </p>
    <p>
     payable in guano--which disappeared by volcanic convulsion the day
    </p>
    <p>
     before they got down to my name in the list of applicants. Certainly
    </p>
    <p>
     something august enough to be answerable to the size of this unique and
    </p>
    <p>
     memorable experience was my due, and I got it. By the common voice of
    </p>
    <p>
     this community, by acclamation of the people, that mighty utterance
    </p>
    <p>
     which brushes aside laws and legislation, and from whose decrees there
    </p>
    <p>
     is no appeal, I was named Perpetual Member of the Diplomatic Body
    </p>
    <p>
     representing the multifarious sovereignties and civilizations of the
    </p>
    <p>
     globe near the republican court of the United States of America. And
    </p>
    <p>
     they brought me home with a torchlight procession.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It is wonderful, Colonel, simply wonderful.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's the loftiest official position in the whole earth.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I should think so--and the most commanding.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You have named the word. Think of it. I frown, and there is war; I
    </p>
    <p>
     smile, and contending nations lay down their arms.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It is awful. The responsibility, I mean.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It is nothing. Responsibility is no burden to me; I am used to it; have
    </p>
    <p>
     always been used to it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And the work--the work! Do you have to attend all the sittings?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who, I? Does the Emperor of Russia attend the conclaves of the
    </p>
    <p>
     governors of the provinces? He sits at home, and indicates his
    </p>
    <p>
     pleasure.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Washington was silent a moment, then a deep sigh escaped him.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How proud I was an hour ago; how paltry seems my little promotion
    </p>
    <p>
     now! Colonel, the reason I came to Washington is,--I am Congressional
    </p>
    <p>
     Delegate from Cherokee Strip!”
    </p>
    <p>
     The Colonel sprang to his feet and broke out with prodigious enthusiasm:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Give me your hand, my boy--this is immense news! I congratulate you
    </p>
    <p>
     with all my heart. My prophecies stand confirmed. I always said it
    </p>
    <p>
     was in you. I always said you were born for high distinction and would
    </p>
    <p>
     achieve it. You ask Polly if I didn't.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Washington was dazed by this most unexpected demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why, Colonel, there's nothing to it. That little narrow, desolate,
    </p>
    <p>
     unpeopled, oblong streak of grass and gravel, lost in the remote wastes
    </p>
    <p>
     of the vast continent--why, it's like representing a billiard table--a
    </p>
    <p>
     discarded one.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tut-tut, it's a great, it's a staving preferment, and just opulent with
    </p>
    <p>
     influence here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shucks, Colonel, I haven't even a vote.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's nothing; you can make speeches.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I can't. The population's only two hundred--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's all right, that's all right--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And they hadn't any right to elect me; we're not even a territory,
    </p>
    <p>
     there's no Organic Act, the government hasn't any official knowledge of
    </p>
    <p>
     us whatever.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Never mind about that; I'll fix that. I'll rush the thing through, I'll
    </p>
    <p>
     get you organized in no time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Will you, Colonel?--it's too good of you; but it's just your old
    </p>
    <p>
     sterling self, the same old ever-faithful friend,” and the grateful
    </p>
    <p>
     tears welled up in Washington's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's just as good as done, my boy, just as good as done. Shake hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     We'll hitch teams together, you and I, and we'll make things hum!”

     Mrs. Sellers returned, now, with her composure restored, and began to
    </p>
    <p>
     ask after Hawkins's wife, and about his children, and the number of
    </p>

     them, and so on, and her examination of the witness resulted in a

    <p>
     and fro in the far West during the previous fifteen years. There was
    </p>
    <p>
     a message, now, from out back, and Colonel Sellers went out there in
    </p>
    <p>
     answer to it. Hawkins took this opportunity to ask how the world had
    </p>
    <p>
     been using the Colonel during the past half-generation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, it's been using him just the same; it couldn't change its way of
    </p>
    <p>
     using him if it wanted to, for he wouldn't let it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can easily believe that, Mrs. Sellers.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, you see, he doesn't change, himself--not the least little bit in
    </p>
    <p>
     the world--he's always Mulberry Sellers.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can see that plain enough.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just the same old scheming, generous, good-hearted, moonshiny, hopeful,
    </p>
    <p>
     no-account failure he always was, and still everybody likes him just as
    </p>
    <p>
     well as if he was the shiningest success.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “They always did: and it was natural, because he was so obliging and
    </p>
    <p>
     accommodating, and had something about him that made it kind of easy to
    </p>
    <p>
     ask help of him, or favors--you didn't feel shy, you know, or have
    </p>
    <p>
     that wish--you--didn't--have--to--try feeling that you have with other
    </p>
    <p>
     people.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's just so, yet; and a body wonders at it, too, because he's been
    </p>
    <p>
     shamefully treated, many times, by people that had used him for a ladder
    </p>
    <p>
     to climb up by, and then kicked him down when they didn't need him any
    </p>
    <p>
     more. For a time you can see he's hurt, his pride's wounded, because he
    </p>
    <p>
     shrinks away from that thing and don't want to talk about it--and so
    </p>
    <p>
     I used to think now he's learned something and he'll be more careful
    </p>
    <p>
     hereafter--but laws! in a couple of weeks he's forgotten all about it,
    </p>
    <p>
     and any selfish tramp out of nobody knows where can come and put up a
    </p>
    <p>
     poor mouth and walk right into his heart with his boots on.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It must try your patience pretty sharply sometimes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, no, I'm used to it; and I'd rather have him so than the other way.
    </p>
    <p>
     When I call him a failure, I mean to the world he's a failure; he isn't
    </p>
    <p>
     to me. I don't know as I want him different much different, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     I have to scold him some, snarl at him, you might even call it, but I
    </p>
    <p>
     reckon I'd do that just the same, if he was different--it's my make. But
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm a good deal less snarly and more contented when he's a failure than
    </p>
    <p>
     I am when he isn't.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then he isn't always a failure,” said Hawking, brightening.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Him? Oh, bless you, no. He makes a strike, as he calls it, from time to
    </p>
    <p>
     time. Then's my time to fret and fuss. For the money just flies--first
    </p>
    <p>
     come first served. Straight off, he loads up the house with cripples and
    </p>
    <p>
     idiots and stray cats and all the different kinds of poor wrecks that
    </p>
    <p>
     other people don't want and he does, and then when the poverty comes
    </p>
    <p>
     again I've got to clear the most of them out or we'd starve; and that
    </p>
    <p>
     distresses him, and me the same, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Here's old Dan'l and old Jinny, that the sheriff sold south one of the
    </p>
    <p>
     times that we got bankrupted before the war--they came wandering
    </p>
    <p>
     back after the peace, worn out and used up on the cotton plantations,
    </p>
    <p>
     helpless, and not another lick of work left in their old hides for the
    </p>
    <p>
     rest of this earthly pilgrimage--and we so pinched, oh so pinched for
    </p>
    <p>
     the very crumbs to keep life in us, and he just flung the door wide, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the way he received them you'd have thought they had come straight down
    </p>
    <p>
     from heaven in answer to prayer. I took him one side and said, 'Mulberry
    </p>
    <p>
     we can't have them--we've nothing for ourselves--we can't feed them.' He
    </p>
    <p>
     looked at me kind of hurt, and said, 'Turn them out?--and they've come
    </p>
    <p>
     to me just as confident and trusting as--as--why Polly, I must have
    </p>
    <p>
     bought that confidence sometime or other a long time ago, and given my
    </p>
    <p>
     note, so to speak--you don't get such things as a gift--and how am I
    </p>
    <p>
     going to go back on a debt like that? And you see, they're so poor, and
    </p>
    <p>
     old, and friendless, and--' But I was ashamed by that time, and shut him
    </p>
    <p>
     off, and somehow felt a new courage in me, and so I said, softly, 'We'll
    </p>
    <p>
     keep them--the Lord will provide.' He was glad, and started to blurt
    </p>
    <p>
     out one of those over-confident speeches of his, but checked himself
    </p>
    <p>
     in time, and said humbly, 'I will, anyway.' It was years and years and
    </p>
    <p>
     years ago. Well, you see those old wrecks are here yet.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But don't they do your housework?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Laws! The idea. They would if they could, poor old things, and perhaps
    </p>
    <p>
     they think they do do some of it. But it's a superstition. Dan'l waits
    </p>
    <p>
     on the front door, and sometimes goes on an errand; and sometimes you'll
    </p>
    <p>
     see one or both of them letting on to dust around in here--but that's
    </p>
    <p>
     because there's something they want to hear about and mix their gabble
    </p>
    <p>
     into. And they're always around at meals, for the same reason. But the
    </p>
    <p>
     fact is, we have to keep a young negro girl just to take care of them,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a negro woman to do the housework and help take care of them.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, they ought to be tolerably happy, I should think.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's no name for it. They quarrel together pretty much all the
    </p>
    <p>
     time--most always about religion, because Dan'l's a Dunker Baptist and
    </p>
    <p>
     Jinny's a shouting Methodist, and Jinny believes in special Providences
    </p>
    <p>
     and Dan'l don't, because he thinks he's a kind of a free-thinker--and
    </p>
    <p>
     they play and sing plantation hymns together, and talk and chatter just
    </p>
    <p>
     eternally and forever, and are sincerely fond of each other and think
    </p>
    <p>
     the world of Mulberry, and he puts up patiently with all their spoiled
    </p>
    <p>
     ways and foolishness, and so--ah, well, they're happy enough if it
    </p>
    <p>
     comes to that. And I don't mind--I've got used to it. I can get used to
    </p>
    <p>
     anything, with Mulberry to help; and the fact is, I don't much care what
    </p>
    <p>
     happens, so long as he's spared to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, here's to him, and hoping he'll make another strike soon.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And rake in the lame, the halt and the blind, and turn the house into
    </p>
    <p>
     a hospital again? It's what he would do. I've seen aplenty of that and
    </p>
    <p>
     more. No, Washington, I want his strikes to be mighty moderate ones the
    </p>
    <p>
     rest of the way down the vale.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, then, big strike or little strike, or no strike at all, here's
    </p>
    <p>
     hoping he'll never lack for friends--and I don't reckon he ever will
    </p>
    <p>
     while there's people around who know enough to--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Him lack for friends!” and she tilted her head up with a frank
    </p>
    <p>
     pride--“why, Washington, you can't name a man that's anybody that isn't
    </p>
    <p>
     fond of him. I'll tell you privately, that I've had Satan's own time to
    </p>
    <p>
     keep them from appointing him to some office or other. They knew he'd no
    </p>
    <p>
     business with an office, just as well as I did, but he's the hardest man
    </p>
    <p>
     to refuse anything to a body ever saw. Mulberry Sellers with an office!
    </p>
    <p>
     laws goodness, you know what that would be like. Why, they'd come from
    </p>
    <p>
     the ends of the earth to see a circus like that. I'd just as lieves be
    </p>
    <p>
     married to Niagara Falls, and done with it.” After a reflective pause
    </p>
    <p>
     she added--having wandered back, in the interval, to the remark that
    </p>
    <p>
     had been her text: “Friends?--oh, indeed, no man ever had more; and such
    </p>
    <p>
     friends: Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, Johnston, Longstreet, Lee--many's the
    </p>
    <p>
     time they've sat in that chair you're sitting in--” Hawkins was out of
    </p>
    <p>
     it instantly, and contemplating it with a reverential surprise, and with
    </p>
    <p>
     the awed sense of having trodden shod upon holy ground--
    </p>
    <p>
     “They!” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, indeed, yes, a many and a many a time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He continued to gaze at the chair fascinated, magnetized; and for once
    </p>
    <p>
     in his life that continental stretch of dry prairie which stood for his
    </p>
    <p>
     imagination was afire, and across it was marching a slanting flamefront
    </p>
    <p>
     that joined its wide horizons together and smothered the skies with
    </p>
    <p>
     smoke. He was experiencing what one or another drowsing, geographically
    </p>
    <p>
     ignorant alien experiences every day in the year when he turns a dull
    </p>
    <p>
     and indifferent eye out of the car window and it falls upon a certain
    </p>
    <p>
     station-sign which reads “Stratford-on-Avon!” Mrs. Sellers went
    </p>
    <p>
     gossiping comfortably along:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, they like to hear him talk, especially if their load is getting
    </p>
    <p>
     rather heavy on one shoulder and they want to shift it. He's all air,
    </p>
    <p>
     you know,--breeze, you may say--and he freshens them up; it's a trip to
    </p>
    <p>
     the country, they say. Many a time he's made General Grant laugh--and
    </p>
    <p>
     that's a tidy job, I can tell you, and as for Sheridan, his eye lights
    </p>
    <p>
     up and he listens to Mulberry Sellers the same as if he was artillery.
    </p>
    <p>
     You see, the charm about Mulberry is, he is so catholic and unprejudiced
    </p>
    <p>
     that he fits in anywhere and everywhere. It makes him powerful good
    </p>
    <p>
     company, and as popular as scandal. You go to the White House when the
    </p>
    <p>
     President's holding a general reception--sometime when Mulberry's there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why, dear me, you can't tell which of them it is that's holding that
    </p>
    <p>
     reception.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, he certainly is a remarkable man--and he always was. Is he
    </p>
    <p>
     religious?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Clear to his marrow--does more thinking and reading on that subject
    </p>
    <p>
     than any other except Russia and Siberia: thrashes around over the whole
    </p>
    <p>
     field, too; nothing bigoted about him.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is his religion?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “He--” She stopped, and was lost for a moment or two in thinking, then
    </p>
    <p>
     she said, with simplicity, “I think he was a Mohammedan or something
    </p>
    <p>
     last week.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Washington started down town, now, to bring his trunk, for the
    </p>
    <p>
     hospitable Sellerses would listen to no excuses; their house must be his
    </p>
    <p>
     home during the session. The Colonel returned presently and resumed work
    </p>
    <p>
     upon his plaything. It was finished when Washington got back.
    </p>
    <p>
     “There it is,” said the Colonel, “all finished.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is it for, Colonel?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, it's just a trifle. Toy to amuse the children.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Washington examined it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It seems to be a puzzle.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, that's what it is. I call it Pigs in the Clover. Put them in--see
    </p>
    <p>
     if you can put them in the pen.”
    </p>
    <p>
     After many failures Washington succeeded, and was as pleased as a child.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's wonderfully ingenious, Colonel, it's ever so clever and
    </p>
    <p>
     interesting--why, I could play with it all day. What are you going to do
    </p>
    <p>
     with it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, nothing. Patent it and throw it aside.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't you do anything of the kind. There's money in that thing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A compassionate look traveled over the Colonel's countenance, and he
    </p>
    <p>
     said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Money--yes; pin money: a couple of hundred thousand, perhaps. Not
    </p>
    <p>
     more.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Washington's eyes blazed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “A couple of hundred thousand dollars! do you call that pin money?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The colonel rose and tip-toed his way across the room, closed a door
    </p>
    <p>
     that was slightly ajar, tip-toed his way to his seat again, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
     under his breath:
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can keep a secret?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Washington nodded his affirmative, he was too awed to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You have heard of materialization--materialization of departed
    </p>
    <p>
     spirits?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Washington had heard of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And probably didn't believe in it; and quite right, too. The thing
    </p>
    <p>
     as practised by ignorant charlatans is unworthy of attention or
    </p>
    <p>
     respect--where there's a dim light and a dark cabinet, and a parcel of
    </p>
    <p>
     sentimental gulls gathered together, with their faith and their shudders
    </p>
    <p>
     and their tears all ready, and one and the same fatty degeneration of
    </p>
    <p>
     protoplasm and humbug comes out and materializes himself into anybody
    </p>
    <p>
     you want, grandmother, grandchild, brother-in-law, Witch of Endor,
    </p>
    <p>
     John Milton, Siamese twins, Peter the Great, and all such frantic
    </p>
    <p>
     nonsense--no, that is all foolish and pitiful. But when a man that is
    </p>
    <p>
     competent brings the vast powers of science to bear, it's a different
    </p>
    <p>
     matter, a totally different matter, you see. The spectre that answers
    </p>
    <p>
     that call has come to stay. Do you note the commercial value of that
    </p>
    <p>
     detail?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I--the--the truth is, that I don't quite know that I do. Do you
    </p>
    <p>
     mean that such, being permanent, not transitory, would give more general
    </p>
    <p>
     satisfaction, and so enhance the price--of tickets to the show--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Show? Folly--listen to me; and get a good grip on your breath, for
    </p>
    <p>
     you are going to need it. Within three days I shall have completed my
    </p>
    <p>
     method, and then--let the world stand aghast, for it shall see marvels.
    </p>
    <p>
     Washington, within three days--ten at the outside--you shall see me call
    </p>
    <p>
     the dead of any century, and they will arise and walk. Walk?--they shall
    </p>
    <p>
     walk forever, and never die again. Walk with all the muscle and spring
    </p>
    <p>
     of their pristine vigor.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Colonel! Indeed it does take one's breath away.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now do you see the money that's in it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm--well, I'm--not really sure that I do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Great Scott, look here. I shall have a monopoly; they'll all belong to
    </p>
    <p>
     me, won't they? Two thousand policemen in the city of New York. Wages,
    </p>
    <p>
     four dollars a day. I'll replace them with dead ones at half the money.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, prodigious! I never thought of that. F-o-u-r thousand dollars a
    </p>
    <p>
     day. Now I do begin to see! But will dead policemen answer?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Haven't they--up to this time?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, if you put it that way--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Put it any way you want to. Modify it to suit yourself, and my lads
    </p>
    <p>
     shall still be superior. They won't eat, they won't drink--don't need
    </p>
    <p>
     those things; they won't wink for cash at gambling dens and unlicensed
    </p>
    <p>
     rum-holes, they won't spark the scullery maids; and moreover the bands
    </p>
    <p>
     of toughs that ambuscade them on lonely beats, and cowardly shoot and
    </p>
    <p>
     knife them will only damage the uniforms and not live long enough to get
    </p>
    <p>
     more than a momentary satisfaction out of that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why, Colonel, if you can furnish policemen, then of course--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Certainly--I can furnish any line of goods that's wanted. Take the
    </p>
    <p>
     army, for instance--now twenty-five thousand men; expense, twenty-two
    </p>
    <p>
     millions a year. I will dig up the Romans, I will resurrect the Greeks,
    </p>
    <p>
     I will furnish the government, for ten millions a year, ten thousand
    </p>
    <p>
     veterans drawn from the victorious legions of all the ages--soldiers
    </p>
    <p>
     that will chase Indians year in and year out on materialized horses, and
    </p>
    <p>
     cost never a cent for rations or repairs. The armies of Europe cost two
    </p>
    <p>
     billions a year now--I will replace them all for a billion. I will dig
    </p>
    <p>
     up the trained statesmen of all ages and all climes, and furnish this
    </p>
    <p>
     country with a Congress that knows enough to come in out of the rain--a
    </p>
    <p>
     thing that's never happened yet, since the Declaration of Independence,
    </p>
    <p>
     and never will happen till these practically dead people are replaced
    </p>
    <p>
     with the genuine article. I will restock the thrones of Europe with the
    </p>
    <p>
     best brains and the best morals that all the royal sepulchres of all the
    </p>
    <p>
     centuries can furnish--which isn't promising very much--and I'll divide
    </p>
    <p>
     the wages and the civil list, fair and square, merely taking my half
    </p>
    <p>
     and--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Colonel, if the half of this is true, there's millions in
    </p>
    <p>
     it--millions.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Billions in it--billions; that's what you mean. Why, look here; the
    </p>
    <p>
     thing is so close at hand, so imminent, so absolutely immediate, that if
    </p>
    <p>
     a man were to come to me now and say, Colonel, I am a little short, and
    </p>
    <p>
     if you could lend me a couple of billion dollars for--come in!”
    </p>
    <p>
     This in answer to a knock. An energetic looking man bustled in with a
    </p>
    <p>
     big pocket-book in his hand, took a paper from it and presented it, with
    </p>
    <p>
     the curt remark:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Seventeenth and last call--you want to out with that three dollars and
    </p>
    <p>
     forty cents this time without fail, Colonel Mulberry Sellers.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The Colonel began to slap this pocket and that one, and feel here and
    </p>
    <p>
     there and everywhere, muttering:
    </p>
    <p>
     “What have I done with that wallet?--let me see--um--not here, not there
    </p>
    <p>
     --Oh, I must have left it in the kitchen; I'll just run and--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No you won't--you'll stay right where you are. And you're going to
    </p>
    <p>
     disgorge, too--this time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Washington innocently offered to go and look. When he was gone the
    </p>
    <p>
     Colonel said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “The fact is, I've got to throw myself on your indulgence just this once
    </p>
    <p>
     more, Suggs; you see the remittances I was expecting--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hang the remittances--it's too stale--it won't answer. Come!”
    </p>
    <p>
     The Colonel glanced about him in despair. Then his face lighted; he ran
    </p>
    <p>
     to the wall and began to dust off a peculiarly atrocious chromo with
    </p>
    <p>
     his handkerchief. Then he brought it reverently, offered it to the
    </p>
    <p>
     collector, averted his face and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Take it, but don't let me see it go. It's the sole remaining Rembrandt
    </p>
    <p>
     that--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rembrandt be damned, it's a chromo.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, don't speak of it so, I beg you. It's the only really great
    </p>
    <p>
     original, the only supreme example of that mighty school of art which--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Art! It's the sickest looking thing I--”
    </p>
    <p>
     The colonel was already bringing another horror and tenderly dusting it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Take this one too--the gem of my collection--the only genuine Fra
    </p>
    <p>
     Angelico that--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Illuminated liver-pad, that's what it is. Give it here--good
    </p>
    <p>
     day--people will think I've robbed a' nigger barber-shop.”
    </p>
    <p>
     As he slammed the door behind him the Colonel shouted with an anguished
    </p>
    <p>
     accent--
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do please cover them up--don't let the damp get at them. The delicate
    </p>
    <p>
     tints in the Angelico--”
    </p>
    <p>
     But the man was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Washington re-appeared and said he had looked everywhere, and so had
    </p>
    <p>
     Mrs. Sellers and the servants, but in vain; and went on to say he wished
    </p>
    <p>
     he could get his eye on a certain man about this time--no need to hunt
    </p>
    <p>
     up that pocket-book then. The Colonel's interest was awake at once.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What man?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “One-armed Pete they call him out there--out in the Cherokee country I
    </p>
    <p>
     mean. Robbed the bank in Tahlequah.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do they have banks in Tahlequah?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes--a bank, anyway. He was suspected of robbing it. Whoever did it got
    </p>
    <p>
     away with more than twenty thousand dollars. They offered a reward of
    </p>
    <p>
     five thousand. I believe I saw that very man, on my way east.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No--is that so?
    </p>
    <p>
     “I certainly saw a man on the train, the first day I struck the
    </p>
    <p>
     railroad, that answered the description pretty exactly--at least as to
    </p>
    <p>
     clothes and a lacking arm.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why din't you get him arrested and claim the reward?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I couldn't. I had to get a requisition, of course. But I meant to stay
    </p>
    <p>
     by him till I got my chance.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, he left the train during the night some time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, hang it, that's too bad.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not so very bad, either.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because he came down to Baltimore in the very train I was in, though I
    </p>
    <p>
     didn't know it in time. As we moved out of the station I saw him going
    </p>
    <p>
     toward the iron gate with a satchel in his hand.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good; we'll catch him. Let's lay a plan.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Send description to the Baltimore police?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why, what are you talking about? No. Do you want them to get the
    </p>
    <p>
     reward?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What shall we do, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The Colonel reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll tell you. Put a personal in the Baltimore Sun. Word it like this:
    </p>
    <p>
     “A. DROP ME A LINE, PETE.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hold on. Which arm has he lost?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “The right.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good. Now then--
    </p>
    <p>
     “A. DROP ME A LINE, PETE, EVEN IF YOU HAVE to write with your left hand. Address X. Y. Z., General Postoffice, Washington. From YOU KNOW WHO.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “There--that'll fetch him.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But he won't know who--will he?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, but he'll want to know, won't he?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why, certainly--I didn't think of that. What made you think of it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Knowledge of human curiosity. Strong trait, very strong trait.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now I'll go to my room and write it out and enclose a dollar and tell
    </p>
    <p>
     them to print it to the worth of that.”
    </p>

     CHAPTER IV.

    <p>
     The day wore itself out. After dinner the two friends put in a long and
    </p>
    <p>
     harassing evening trying to decide what to do with the five thousand
    </p>
    <p>
     dollars reward which they were going to get when they should find
    </p>
    <p>
     One-Armed Pete, and catch him, and prove him to be the right person, and
    </p>
    <p>
     extradite him, and ship him to Tahlequah in the Indian Territory. But
    </p>
    <p>
     there were so many dazzling openings for ready cash that they found it
    </p>
    <p>
     impossible to make up their minds and keep them made up. Finally, Mrs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sellers grew very weary of it all, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is the sense in cooking a rabbit before it's caught?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Then the matter was dropped, for the time being, and all went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Next morning, being persuaded by Hawkins, the colonel made drawings
    </p>
    <p>
     and specifications and went down and applied for a patent for his toy
    </p>
    <p>
     puzzle, and Hawkins took the toy itself and started out to see what
    </p>
    <p>
     chance there might be to do something with it commercially. He did
    </p>
    <p>
     not have to go far. In a small old wooden shanty which had once been
    </p>
    <p>
     occupied as a dwelling by some humble negro family he found a keen-eyed
    </p>
    <p>
     Yankee engaged in repairing cheap chairs and other second-hand
    </p>
    <p>
     furniture. This man examined the toy indifferently; attempted to do the
    </p>
    <p>
     puzzle; found it not so easy as he had expected; grew more interested,
    </p>
    <p>
     and finally emphatically so; achieved a success at last, and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is it patented?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Patent applied for.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That will answer. What do you want for it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What will it retail for?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, twenty-five cents, I should think.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What will you give for the exclusive right?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I couldn't give twenty dollars, if I had to pay cash down; but I'll
    </p>
    <p>
     tell you what I'll do. I'll make it and market it, and pay you five
    </p>
    <p>
     cents royalty on each one.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Washington sighed. Another dream disappeared; no money in the thing. So
    </p>
    <p>
     he said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “All right, take it at that. Draw me a paper.” He went his way with the
    </p>
    <p>
     paper, and dropped the matter out of his mind dropped it out to make
    </p>
    <p>
     room for further attempts to think out the most promising way to invest
    </p>
    <p>
     his half of the reward, in case a partnership investment satisfactory to
    </p>
    <p>
     both beneficiaries could not be hit upon.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had not been very long at home when Sellers arrived sodden with
    </p>
    <p>
     grief and booming with glad excitement--working both these emotions
    </p>
    <p>
     successfully, sometimes separately, sometimes together. He fell on
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins's neck sobbing, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, mourn with me my friend, mourn for my desolate house: death has
    </p>
    <p>
     smitten my last kinsman and I am Earl of Rossmore--congratulate me!”
    </p>
    <p>
     He turned to his wife, who had entered while this was going on, put his
    </p>
    <p>
     arms about her and said--“You will bear up, for my sake, my lady--it had
    </p>
    <p>
     to happen, it was decreed.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She bore up very well, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's no great loss. Simon Lathers was a poor well-meaning useless thing
    </p>
    <p>
     and no account, and his brother never was worth shucks.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The rightful earl continued:
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am too much prostrated by these conflicting griefs and joys to be
    </p>
    <p>
     able to concentrate my mind upon affairs; I will ask our good friend
    </p>
    <p>
     here to break the news by wire or post to the Lady Gwendolen and
    </p>
    <p>
     instruct her to--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What Lady Gwendolen?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Our poor daughter, who, alas!--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sally Sellers? Mulberry Sellers, are you losing your mind?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “There--please do not forget who you are, and who I am; remember your
    </p>
    <p>
     own dignity, be considerate also of mine. It were best to cease from
    </p>
    <p>
     using my family name, now, Lady Rossmore.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Goodness gracious, well, I never! What am I to call you then?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “In private, the ordinary terms of endearment will still be admissible,
    </p>
    <p>
     to some degree; but in public it will be more becoming if your ladyship
    </p>
    <p>
     will speak to me as my lord, or your lordship, and of me as Rossmore, or
    </p>
    <p>
     the Earl, or his Lordship, and--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, scat! I can't ever do it, Berry.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But indeed you must, my love--we must live up to our altered position
    </p>
    <p>
     and submit with what grace we may to its requirements.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, all right, have it your own way; I've never set my wishes against
    </p>
    <p>
     your commands yet, Mul--my lord, and it's late to begin now, though to
    </p>
    <p>
     my mind it's the rottenest foolishness that ever was.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Spoken like my own true wife! There, kiss and be friends again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But--Gwendolen! I don't know how I am ever going to stand that name.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why, a body wouldn't know Sally Sellers in it. It's too large for her;
    </p>
    <p>
     kind of like a cherub in an ulster, and it's a most outlandish sort of a
    </p>
    <p>
     name, anyway, to my mind.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You'll not hear her find fault with it, my lady.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's a true word. She takes to any kind of romantic rubbish like she
    </p>
    <p>
     was born to it. She never got it from me, that's sure. And sending her
    </p>
    <p>
     to that silly college hasn't helped the matter any--just the other way.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now hear her, Hawkins! Rowena-Ivanhoe College is the selectest and most
    </p>
    <p>
     aristocratic seat of learning for young ladies in our country. Under no
    </p>
    <p>
     circumstances can a girl get in there unless she is either very rich and
    </p>
    <p>
     fashionable or can prove four generations of what may be called American
    </p>
    <p>
     nobility. Castellated college-buildings--towers and turrets and an
    </p>
    <p>
     imitation moat--and everything about the place named out of Sir Walter
    </p>
    <p>
     Scott's books and redolent of royalty and state and style; and all the
    </p>
    <p>
     richest girls keep phaetons, and coachmen in livery, and riding-horses,
    </p>
    <p>
     with English grooms in plug hats and tight-buttoned coats, and
    </p>
    <p>
     top-boots, and a whip-handle without any whip to it, to ride sixty-three
    </p>
    <p>
     feet behind them--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And they don't learn a blessed thing, Washington Hawkins, not a single
    </p>
    <p>
     blessed thing but showy rubbish and un-american pretentiousness. But
    </p>
    <p>
     send for the Lady Gwendolen--do; for I reckon the peerage regulations
    </p>
    <p>
     require that she must come home and let on to go into seclusion and
    </p>
    <p>
     mourn for those Arkansas blatherskites she's lost.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “My darling! Blatherskites? Remember--noblesse oblige.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “There, there--talk to me in your own tongue, Ross--you don't know any
    </p>
    <p>
     other, and you only botch it when you try. Oh, don't stare--it was a
    </p>
    <p>
     slip, and no crime; customs of a life-time can't be dropped in a second.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rossmore--there, now, be appeased, and go along with you and attend to
    </p>
    <p>
     Gwendolen. Are you going to write, Washington?--or telegraph?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “He will telegraph, dear.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I thought as much,” my lady muttered, as she left the room. “Wants it
    </p>
    <p>
     so the address will have to appear on the envelop. It will just make a
    </p>
    <p>
     fool of that child. She'll get it, of course, for if there are any other
    </p>
    <p>
     Sellerses there they'll not be able to claim it. And just leave her
    </p>
    <p>
     alone to show it around and make the most of it. Well, maybe she's
    </p>
    <p>
     forgivable for that. She's so poor and they're so rich, of course she's
    </p>
    <p>
     had her share of snubs from the livery-flunkey sort, and I reckon it's
    </p>
    <p>
     only human to want to get even.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Uncle Dan'l was sent with the telegram; for although a conspicuous
    </p>
    <p>
     object in a corner of the drawing-room was a telephone hanging on a
    </p>
    <p>
     transmitter, Washington found all attempts to raise the central office
    </p>
    <p>
     vain. The Colonel grumbled something about its being “always out of
    </p>
    <p>
     order when you've got particular and especial use for it,” but he didn't
    </p>
    <p>
     explain that one of the reasons for this was that the thing was only a
    </p>
    <p>
     dummy and hadn't any wire attached to it. And yet the Colonel often used
    </p>
    <p>
     it--when visitors were present--and seemed to get messages through it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mourning paper and a seal were ordered, then the friends took a rest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Next afternoon, while Hawkins, by request, draped Andrew Jackson's
    </p>
    <p>
     portrait with crape, the rightful earl, wrote off the family bereavement
    </p>
    <p>
     to the usurper in England--a letter which we have already read. He also,
    </p>
    <p>
     by letter to the village authorities at Duffy's Corners, Arkansas, gave
    </p>
    <p>
     order that the remains of the late twins be embalmed by some St. Louis
    </p>
    <p>
     expert and shipped at once to the usurper--with bill. Then he drafted
    </p>
    <p>
     out the Rossmore arms and motto on a great sheet of brown paper, and he
    </p>
    <p>
     and Hawkins took it to Hawkins's Yankee furniture-mender and at the end
    </p>
    <p>
     of an hour came back with a couple of stunning hatchments, which they
    </p>
    <p>
     nailed up on the front of the house--attractions calculated to draw, and
    </p>
    <p>
     they did; for it was mainly an idle and shiftless negro neighborhood,
    </p>
    <p>
     with plenty of ragged children and indolent dogs to spare for a point
    </p>
    <p>
     of interest like that, and keep on sparing them for it, days and days
    </p>
    <p>
     together.
    </p>
    <p>
     The new earl found--without surprise--this society item in the evening
    </p>
    <p>
     paper, and cut it out and scrapbooked it:
    </p>
    <p>
     By a recent bereavement our esteemed fellow citizen, Colonel
    </p>
    <p>
     Mulberry Sellers, Perpetual Member-at-large of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Diplomatic Body, succeeds, as rightful lord, to the great
    </p>
    <p>
     earldom of Rossmore, third by order of precedence in the
    </p>
    <p>
     earldoms of Great Britain, and will take early measures, by
    </p>
    <p>
     suit in the House of Lords, to wrest the title and estates
    </p>
    <p>
     from the present usurping holder of them. Until the season
    </p>
    <p>
     of mourning is past, the usual Thursday evening receptions
    </p>
    <p>
     at Rossmore Towers will be discontinued.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lady Rossmore's comment--to herself:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Receptions! People who don't rightly know him may think he is
    </p>
    <p>
     commonplace, but to my mind he is one of the most unusual men I ever
    </p>
    <p>
     saw. As for suddenness and capacity in imagining things, his beat don't
    </p>
    <p>
     exist, I reckon. As like as not it wouldn't have occurred to anybody
    </p>
    <p>
     else to name this poor old rat-trap Rossmore Towers, but it just
    </p>
    <p>
     comes natural to him. Well, no doubt it's a blessed thing to have an
    </p>
    <p>
     imagination that can always make you satisfied, no matter how you are
    </p>
    <p>
     fixed. Uncle Dave Hopkins used to always say, 'Turn me into John Calvin,
    </p>
    <p>
     and I want to know which place I'm going to; turn me into Mulberry
    </p>
    <p>
     Sellers and I don't care.'”
    </p>
    <p>
     The rightful earl's comment--to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's a beautiful name, beautiful. Pity I didn't think of it before I
    </p>
    <p>
     wrote the usurper. But I'll be ready for him when he answers.”

    <p>
     No answer to that telegram; no arriving daughter. Yet nobody showed any
    </p>
    <p>
     uneasiness or seemed surprised; that is, nobody but Washington. After
    </p>
    <p>
     three days of waiting, he asked Lady Rossmore what she supposed the
    </p>
    <p>
     trouble was. She answered, tranquilly:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, it's some notion of hers, you never can tell. She's a Sellers,
    </p>
    <p>
     all through--at least in some of her ways; and a Sellers can't tell you
    </p>
    <p>
     beforehand what he's going to do, because he don't know himself till
    </p>
    <p>
     he's done it. She's all right; no occasion to worry about her. When
    </p>
    <p>
     she's ready she'll come or she'll write, and you can't tell which, till
    </p>
    <p>
     it's happened.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It turned out to be a letter. It was handed in at that moment, and was
    </p>
    <p>
     received by the mother without trembling hands or feverish eagerness,
    </p>
    <p>
     or any other of the manifestations common in the case of long delayed
    </p>
    <p>
     answers to imperative telegrams. She polished her glasses with
    </p>
    <p>
     tranquility and thoroughness, pleasantly gossiping along, the while,
    </p>
    <p>
     then opened the letter and began to read aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
     KENILWORTH KEEP, REDGAUNTLET HALL,
    </p>
    <p>
     ROWENA-IVANHOE COLLEGE, THURSDAY.
    </p>
    <p>
     DEAR PRECIOUS MAMMA ROSSMORE:
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, the joy of it!--you can't think. They had always turned up their
    </p>
    <p>
     noses at our pretentions, you know; and I had fought back as well as I
    </p>
    <p>
     could by turning up mine at theirs. They always said it might be
    </p>
    <p>
     something great and fine to be the rightful Shadow of an earldom, but to
    </p>
    <p>
     merely be shadow of a shadow, and two or three times removed at that--
    </p>
    <p>
     pooh-pooh! And I always retorted that not to be able to show four
    </p>
    <p>
     generations of American-Colonial-Dutch Peddler-and-Salt-Cod-McAllister-
    </p>
    <p>
     Nobility might be endurable, but to have to confess such an origin--
    </p>
    <p>
     pfew-few! Well, the telegram, it was just a cyclone! The messenger came
    </p>
    <p>
     right into the great Rob Roy Hall of Audience, as excited as he could
    </p>
    <p>
     be, singing out, “Dispatch for Lady Gwendolen Sellers!” and you ought to
    </p>
    <p>
     have seen that simpering chattering assemblage of pinchbeck aristocrats,
    </p>
    <p>
     turn to stone! I was off in the corner, of course, by myself--it's where
    </p>
    <p>
     Cinderella belongs. I took the telegram and read it, and tried to faint-
    </p>
    <p>
     -and I could have done it if I had had any preparation, but it was all
    </p>
    <p>
     so sudden, you know--but no matter, I did the next best thing: I put my
    </p>
    <p>
     handkerchief to my eyes and fled sobbing to my room, dropping the
    </p>
    <p>
     telegram as I started. I released one corner of my eye a moment--just
    </p>
    <p>
     enough to see the herd swarm for the telegram--and then continued my
    </p>
    <p>
     broken-hearted flight just as happy as a bird.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then the visits of condolence began, and I had to accept the loan of
    </p>
    <p>
     Miss Augusta-Templeton-Ashmore Hamilton's quarters because the press was
    </p>
    <p>
     so great and there isn't room for three and a cat in mine. And I've been
    </p>
    <p>
     holding a Lodge of Sorrow ever since and defending myself against
    </p>
    <p>
     people's attempts to claim kin. And do you know, the very first girl to
    </p>
    <p>
     fetch her tears and sympathy to my market was that foolish Skimperton
    </p>
    <p>
     girl who has always snubbed me so shamefully and claimed lordship and
    </p>
    <p>
     precedence of the whole college because some ancestor of hers, some time
    </p>
    <p>
     or other, was a McAllister. Why it was like the bottom bird in the
    </p>
    <p>
     menagerie putting on airs because its head ancestor was a pterodactyl.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the ger-reatest triumph of all was--guess. But you'll never. This is
    </p>
    <p>
     it. That little fool and two others have always been fussing and
    </p>
    <p>
     fretting over which was entitled to precedence--by rank, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
     They've nearly starved themselves at it; for each claimed the right to
    </p>
    <p>
     take precedence of all the college in leaving the table, and so neither
    </p>
    <p>
     of them ever finished her dinner, but broke off in the middle and tried
    </p>
    <p>
     to get out ahead of the others. Well, after my first day's grief and
    </p>
    <p>
     seclusion--I was fixing up a mourning dress you see--I appeared at the
    </p>
    <p>
     public table again, and then--what do you think? Those three fluffy
    </p>
    <p>
     goslings sat there contentedly, and squared up the long famine--lapped
    </p>
    <p>
     and lapped, munched and munched, ate and ate, till the gravy appeared in
    </p>
    <p>
     their eyes--humbly waiting for the Lady Gwendolen to take precedence and
    </p>
    <p>
     move out first, you see!
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, yes, I've been having a darling good time. And do you know, not one
    </p>
    <p>
     of these collegians has had the cruelty to ask me how I came by my new
    </p>
    <p>
     name. With some, this is due to charity, but with the others it isn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     They refrain, not from native kindness but from educated discretion. I
    </p>
    <p>
     educated them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, as soon as I shall have settled up what's left of the old scores
    </p>
    <p>
     and snuffed up a few more of those pleasantly intoxicating clouds of
    </p>
    <p>
     incense, I shall pack and depart homeward. Tell papa I am as fond of him
    </p>
    <p>
     as I am of my new name. I couldn't put it stronger than that. What an
    </p>
    <p>
     inspiration it was! But inspirations come easy to him.
    </p>
    <p>
     These, from your loving daughter,
    </p>
    <p>
     GWENDOLEN.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins reached for the letter and glanced over it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good hand,” he said, “and full of confidence and animation, and goes
    </p>
    <p>
     racing right along. She's bright--that's plain.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, they're all bright--the Sellerses. Anyway, they would be, if there
    </p>
    <p>
     were any. Even those poor Latherses would have been bright if they had
    </p>
    <p>
     been Sellerses; I mean full blood. Of course they had a Sellers strain
    </p>
    <p>
     in them--a big strain of it, too--but being a Bland dollar don't make it
    </p>
    <p>
     a dollar just the same.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The seventh day after the date of the telegram Washington came dreaming
    </p>
    <p>
     down to breakfast and was set wide awake by an electrical spasm of
    </p>
    <p>
     pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here was the most beautiful young creature he had ever seen in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was Sally Sellers Lady Gwendolen; she had come in the night. And it
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to him that her clothes were the prettiest and the daintiest he
    </p>
    <p>
     had ever looked upon, and the most exquisitely contrived and fashioned
    </p>
    <p>
     and combined, as to decorative trimmings, and fixings, and melting
    </p>
    <p>
     harmonies of color. It was only a morning dress, and inexpensive, but he
    </p>
    <p>
     confessed to himself, in the English common to Cherokee Strip, that it
    </p>
    <p>
     was a “corker.” And now, as he perceived, the reason why the Sellers
    </p>
    <p>
     household poverties and sterilities had been made to blossom like the
    </p>
    <p>
     rose, and charm the eye and satisfy the spirit, stood explained; here
    </p>
    <p>
     was the magician; here in the midst of her works, and furnishing in her
    </p>
    <p>
     own person the proper accent and climaxing finish of the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My daughter, Major Hawkins--come home to mourn; flown home at the
    </p>
    <p>
     call of affliction to help the authors of her being bear the burden
    </p>
    <p>
     of bereavement. She was very fond of the late earl--idolized him, sir,
    </p>
    <p>
     idolized him--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why, father, I've never seen him.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “True--she's right, I was thinking of another--er--of her mother--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I idolized that smoked haddock?--that sentimental, spiritless--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was thinking of myself! Poor noble fellow, we were inseparable com--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hear the man! Mulberry Sel--Mul--Rossmore--hang the troublesome name
    </p>
    <p>
     I can never--if I've heard you say once, I've heard you say a thousand
    </p>
    <p>
     times that if that poor sheep--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was thinking of--of--I don't know who I was thinking of, and it
    </p>
    <p>
     doesn't make any difference anyway; somebody idolized him, I recollect
    </p>
    <p>
     it as if it were yesterday; and--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Father, I am going to shake hands with Major Hawkins, and let the
    </p>
    <p>
     introduction work along and catch up at its leisure. I remember you very
    </p>
    <p>
     well in deed, Major Hawkins, although I was a little child when I saw
    </p>
    <p>
     you last; and I am very, very glad indeed to see you again and have you
    </p>
    <p>
     in our house as one of us;” and beaming in his face she finished her
    </p>
    <p>
     cordial shake with the hope that he had not forgotten her.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was prodigiously pleased by her outspoken heartiness, and wanted to
    </p>
    <p>
     repay her by assuring her that he remembered her, and not only that but
    </p>
    <p>
     better even than he remembered his own children, but the facts would not
    </p>
    <p>
     quite warrant this; still, he stumbled through a tangled sentence
    </p>
    <p>
     which answered just as well, since the purport of it was an awkward and
    </p>
    <p>
     unintentional confession that her extraordinary beauty had so stupefied
    </p>
    <p>
     him that he hadn't got back to his bearings, yet, and therefore couldn't
    </p>
    <p>
     be certain as to whether he remembered her at all or not. The speech
    </p>
    <p>
     made him her friend; it couldn't well help it.
    </p>
    <p>
     In truth the beauty of this fair creature was of a rare type, and may
    </p>
    <p>
     well excuse a moment of our time spent in its consideration. It did not
    </p>
    <p>
     consist in the fact that she had eyes, nose, mouth, chin, hair, ears, it
    </p>
    <p>
     consisted in their arrangement. In true beauty, more depends upon right
    </p>
    <p>
     location and judicious distribution of feature than upon multiplicity of
    </p>
    <p>
     them. So also as regards color. The very combination of colors which
    </p>
    <p>
     in a volcanic irruption would add beauty to a landscape might detach it
    </p>
    <p>
     from a girl. Such was Gwendolen Sellers.
    </p>
    <p>
     The family circle being completed by Gwendolen's arrival, it was decreed
    </p>
    <p>
     that the official mourning should now begin; that it should begin at six
    </p>
    <p>
     o'clock every evening, (the dinner hour,) and end with the dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's a grand old line, major, a sublime old line, and deserves to be
    </p>
    <p>
     mourned for, almost royally; almost imperially, I may say. Er--Lady
    </p>
    <p>
     Gwendolen--but she's gone; never mind; I wanted my Peerage; I'll fetch
    </p>
    <p>
     it myself, presently, and show you a thing or two that will give you a
    </p>
    <p>
     realizing idea of what our house is. I've been glancing through Burke,
    </p>
    <p>
     and I find that of William the Conqueror's sixty-four natural ch--my
    </p>
    <p>
     dear, would you mind getting me that book? It's on the escritoire in our
    </p>
    <p>
     boudoir. Yes, as I was saying, there's only St. Albans, Buccleugh and
    </p>
    <p>
     Grafton ahead of us on the list--all the rest of the British nobility
    </p>
    <p>
     are in procession behind us. Ah, thanks, my lady. Now then, we turn to
    </p>
    <p>
     William, and we find--letter for XYZ? Oh, splendid--when'd you get it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Last night; but I was asleep before you came, you were out so late; and
    </p>
    <p>
     when I came to breakfast Miss Gwendolen--well, she knocked everything
    </p>
    <p>
     out of me, you know--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wonderful girl, wonderful; her great origin is detectable in her
    </p>
    <p>
     step, her carriage, her features--but what does he say? Come, this is
    </p>
    <p>
     exciting.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I haven't read it--er--Rossm--Mr. Rossm--er--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “M'lord! Just cut it short like that. It's the English way. I'll open
    </p>
    <p>
     it. Ah, now let's see.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A. TO YOU KNOW WHO. Think I know you. Wait ten days. Coming to
    </p>
    <p>
     Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
     The excitement died out of both men's faces. There was a brooding
    </p>
    <p>
     silence for a while, then the younger one said with a sigh:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why, we can't wait ten days for the money.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No--the man's unreasonable; we are down to the bed rock, financially
    </p>
    <p>
     speaking.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “If we could explain to him in some way, that we are so situated that
    </p>
    <p>
     time is of the utmost importance to us--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes--yes, that's it--and so if it would be as convenient for him to
    </p>
    <p>
     come at once it would be a great accommodation to us, and one
    </p>
    <p>
     which we--which we--which we--wh--well, which we should sincerely
    </p>
    <p>
     appreciate--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's it--and most gladly reciprocate--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Certainly--that'll fetch him. Worded right, if he's a man--got any of
    </p>
    <p>
     the feelings of a man, sympathies and all that, he'll be here inside of
    </p>
    <p>
     twenty-four hours. Pen and paper--come, we'll get right at it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Between them they framed twenty-two different advertisements, but none
    </p>
    <p>
     was satisfactory. A main fault in all of them was urgency. That feature
    </p>
    <p>
     was very troublesome: if made prominent, it was calculated to excite
    </p>
    <p>
     Pete's suspicion; if modified below the suspicion-point it was flat and
    </p>
    <p>
     meaningless. Finally the Colonel resigned, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have noticed, in such literary experiences as I have had, that one
    </p>
    <p>
     of the most taking things to do is to conceal your meaning when you
    </p>
    <p>
     are trying to conceal it. Whereas, if you go at literature with a free
    </p>
    <p>
     conscience and nothing to conceal, you can turn out a book, every time,
    </p>
    <p>
     that the very elect can't understand. They all do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Hawkins resigned also, and the two agreed that they must manage to
    </p>
    <p>
     wait the ten days some how or other. Next, they caught a ray of cheer:
    </p>
    <p>
     since they had something definite to go upon, now, they could probably
    </p>
    <p>
     borrow money on the reward--enough, at any rate, to tide them over till
    </p>
    <p>
     they got it; and meantime the materializing recipe would be perfected,
    </p>
    <p>
     and then good bye to trouble for good and all.
    </p>
    <p>
     The next day, May the tenth, a couple of things happened--among others.
    </p>
    <p>
     The remains of the noble Arkansas twins left our shores for England,
    </p>
    <p>
     consigned to Lord Rossmore, and Lord Rossmore's son, Kirkcudbright
    </p>
    <p>
     Llanover Marjoribanks Sellers Viscount Berkeley, sailed from Liverpool
    </p>
    <p>
     for America to place the reversion of the earldom in the hands of the
    </p>
    <p>
     rightful peer, Mulberry Sellers, of Rossmore Towers in the District of
    </p>
    <p>
     Columbia, U. S. A.
    </p>
    <p>
     These two impressive shipments would meet and part in mid-Atlantic, five
    </p>
    <p>
     days later, and give no sign.

     CHAPTER VI.
    </head>
    <p>
     In the course of time the twins arrived and were delivered to their
    </p>
    <p>
     great kinsman. To try to describe the rage of that old man would profit
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing, the attempt would fall so far short of the purpose. However
    </p>
    <p>
     when he had worn himself out and got quiet again, he looked the matter
    </p>
    <p>
     over and decided that the twins had some moral rights, although they had
    </p>
    <p>
     no legal ones; they were of his blood, and it could not be decorous to
    </p>
    <p>
     treat them as common clay. So he laid them with their majestic kin in
    </p>
    <p>
     the Cholmondeley church, with imposing state and ceremony, and added the
    </p>
    <p>
     supreme touch by officiating as chief mourner himself. But he drew the
    </p>
    <p>
     line at hatchments.
    </p>
    <p>
     Our friends in Washington watched the weary days go by, while they
    </p>
    <p>
     waited for Pete and covered his name with reproaches because of his
    </p>
    <p>
     calamitous procrastinations. Meantime, Sally Sellers, who was as
    </p>
    <p>
     practical and democratic as the Lady Gwendolen Sellers was romantic and
    </p>
    <p>
     aristocratic, was leading a life of intense interest and activity and
    </p>
    <p>
     getting the most she could out of her double personality. All day long
    </p>
    <p>
     in the privacy of her work-room, Sally Sellers earned bread for the
    </p>
    <p>
     Sellers family; and all the evening Lady Gwendolen Sellers supported the
    </p>
    <p>
     Rossmore dignity. All day she was American, practically, and proud
    </p>
    <p>
     of the work of her head and hands and its commercial result; all the
    </p>
    <p>
     evening she took holiday and dwelt in a rich shadow-land peopled with
    </p>
    <p>
     titled and coroneted fictions. By day, to her, the place was a plain,
    </p>
    <p>
     unaffected, ramshackle old trap-- just that, and nothing more; by night
    </p>
    <p>
     it was Rossmore Towers. At college she had learned a trade without
    </p>
    <p>
     knowing it. The girls had found out that she was the designer of her
    </p>
    <p>
     own gowns. She had no idle moments after that, and wanted none; for the
    </p>
    <p>
     exercise of an extraordinary gift is the supremest pleasure in life, and
    </p>
    <p>
     it was manifest that Sally Sellers possessed a gift of that sort in the
    </p>
    <p>
     matter of costume-designing. Within three days after reaching home she
    </p>
    <p>
     had hunted up some work; before Pete was yet due in Washington, and
    </p>
    <p>
     before the twins were fairly asleep in English soil, she was already
    </p>
    <p>
     nearly swamped with work, and the sacrificing of the family chromos for
    </p>
    <p>
     debt had got an effective check.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She's a brick,” said Rossmore to the Major; “just her father all over:
    </p>
    <p>
     prompt to labor with head or hands, and not ashamed of it; capable,
    </p>
    <p>
     always capable, let the enterprise be what it may; successful by
    </p>
    <p>
     nature--don't know what defeat is; thus, intensely and practically
    </p>
    <p>
     American by inhaled nationalism, and at the same time intensely and
    </p>
    <p>
     aristocratically European by inherited nobility of blood. Just me,
    </p>
    <p>
     exactly: Mulberry Sellers in matter of finance and invention; after
    </p>
    <p>
     office hours, what do you find? The same clothes, yes, but what's in
    </p>
    <p>
     them? Rossmore of the peerage.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The two friends had haunted the general post-office daily. At last they
    </p>
    <p>
     had their reward. Toward evening on the 20th of May, they got a letter
    </p>
    <p>
     for XYZ. It bore the Washington postmark; the note itself was not dated.
    </p>
    <p>
     It said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ash barrel back of lamp post Black horse Alley. If you are playing
    </p>
    <p>
     square go and set on it to-morrow morning 21st 10.22 not sooner not
    </p>
    <p>
     later wait till I come.” The friends cogitated over the note profoundly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Presently the earl said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't you reckon he's afraid we are a sheriff with a requisition?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why, m'lord?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because that's no place for a seance. Nothing friendly, nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     sociable about it. And at the same time, a body that wanted to know who
    </p>
    <p>
     was roosting on that ash-barrel without exposing himself by going near
    </p>
    <p>
     it, or seeming to be interested in it, could just stand on the street
    </p>
    <p>
     corner and take a glance down the alley and satisfy himself, don't you
    </p>
    <p>
     see?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, his idea is plain, now. He seems to be a man that can't be candid
    </p>
    <p>
     and straightforward. He acts as if he thought we--shucks, I wish he had
    </p>
    <p>
     come out like a man and told us what hotel he--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now you've struck it! you've struck it sure, Washington; he has told
    </p>
    <p>
     us.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Has he?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, he has; but he didn't mean to. That alley is a lonesome little
    </p>
    <p>
     pocket that runs along one side of the New Gadsby. That's his hotel.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What makes' you think that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why, I just know it. He's got a room that's just across from that lamp
    </p>
    <p>
     post. He's going to sit there perfectly comfortable behind his shutters
    </p>
    <p>
     at 10.22 to-morrow, and when he sees us sitting on the ash-barrel, he'll
    </p>
    <p>
     say to himself, 'I saw one of those fellows on the train'--and then
    </p>
    <p>
     he'll pack his satchel in half a minute and ship for the ends of the
    </p>
    <p>
     earth.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins turned sick with disappointment:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, dear, it's all up, Colonel--it's exactly what he'll do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Indeed he won't!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Won't he? Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because you won't be holding the ash barrel down, it'll be me. You'll
    </p>
    <p>
     be coming in with an officer and a requisition in plain clothes--the
    </p>
    <p>
     officer, I mean--the minute you see him arrive and open up a talk with
    </p>
    <p>
     me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, what a head you have got, Colonel Sellers! I never should have
    </p>
    <p>
     thought of that in the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Neither would any earl of Rossmore, betwixt William's contribution and
    </p>
    <p>
     Mulberry--as earl; but it's office hours, now, you see, and the earl in
    </p>
    <p>
     me sleeps. Come--I'll show you his very room.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They reached the neighborhood of the New Gadsby about nine in the
    </p>
    <p>
     evening, and passed down the alley to the lamp post.
    </p>
    <p>
     “There you are,” said the colonel, triumphantly, with a wave of his hand
    </p>
    <p>
     which took in the whole side of the hotel. “There it is--what did I tell
    </p>
    <p>
     you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, but--why, Colonel, it's six stories high. I don't quite make out
    </p>
    <p>
     which window you--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “All the windows, all of them. Let him have his choice--I'm indifferent,
    </p>
    <p>
     now that I have located him. You go and stand on the corner and wait;
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll prospect the hotel.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The earl drifted here and there through the swarming lobby, and finally
    </p>
    <p>
     took a waiting position in the neighborhood of the elevator. During an
    </p>
    <p>
     hour crowds went up and crowds came down; and all complete as to
    </p>
    <p>
     limbs; but at last the watcher got a glimpse of a figure that was
    </p>
    <p>
     satisfactory--got a glimpse of the back of it, though he had missed
    </p>
    <p>
     his chance at the face through waning alertness. The glimpse revealed a
    </p>
    <p>
     cowboy hat, and below it a plaided sack of rather loud pattern, and an
    </p>
    <p>
     empty sleeve pinned up to the shoulder. Then the elevator snatched
    </p>
    <p>
     the vision aloft and the watcher fled away in joyful excitement, and
    </p>
    <p>
     rejoined the fellow-conspirator.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We've got him, Major--got him sure! I've seen him--seen him good; and
    </p>
    <p>
     I don't care where or when that man approaches me backwards, I'll
    </p>
    <p>
     recognize him every time. We're all right. Now for the requisition.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They got it, after the delays usual in such cases. By half past eleven
    </p>
    <p>
     they were at home and happy, and went to bed full of dreams of the
    </p>
    <p>
     morrow's great promise.
    </p>
    <p>
     Among the elevator load which had the suspect for fellow-passenger was a
    </p>
    <p>
     young kinsman of Mulberry Sellers, but Mulberry was not aware of it and
    </p>
    <p>
     didn't see him. It was Viscount Berkeley.

     CHAPTER VII.
    </head>
    <p>
     Arrived in his room Lord Berkeley made preparations for that first and
    </p>
    <p>
     last and all-the-time duty of the visiting Englishman--the jotting down
    </p>
    <p>
     in his diary of his “impressions” to date. His preparations consisted in
    </p>
    <p>
     ransacking his “box” for a pen. There was a plenty of steel pens on
    </p>
    <p>
     his table with the ink bottle, but he was English. The English people
    </p>
    <p>
     manufacture steel pens for nineteen-twentieths of the globe, but they
    </p>
    <p>
     never use any themselves. They use exclusively the pre-historic quill.
    </p>
    <p>
     My lord not only found a quill pen, but the best one he had seen in
    </p>
    <p>
     several years--and after writing diligently for some time, closed with
    </p>
    <p>
     the following entry:
    </p>
    <p>
     BUT IN ONE THING I HAVE MADE AN IMMENSE MISTAKE, I OUGHT TO HAVE SHUCKED
    </p>
    <p>
     MY TITLE AND CHANGED MY NAME BEFORE I STARTED.
    </p>
    <p>
     He sat admiring that pen a while, and then went on:
    </p>
    <p>
     “All attempts to mingle with the common people and become permanently
    </p>
    <p>
     one of them are going to fail, unless I can get rid of it, disappear
    </p>
    <p>
     from it, and re-appear with the solid protection of a new name. I am
    </p>
    <p>
     astonished and pained to see how eager the most of these Americans are
    </p>
    <p>
     to get acquainted with a lord, and how diligent they are in pushing
    </p>
    <p>
     attentions upon him. They lack English servility, it is true--but they
    </p>
    <p>
     could acquire it, with practice. My quality travels ahead of me in the
    </p>
    <p>
     most mysterious way. I write my family name without additions, on the
    </p>
    <p>
     register of this hotel, and imagine that I am going to pass for an
    </p>
    <p>
     obscure and unknown wanderer, but the clerk promptly calls out, 'Front!
    </p>
    <p>
     show his lordship to four-eighty-two!' and before I can get to the lift
    </p>
    <p>
     there is a reporter trying to interview me as they call it. This sort
    </p>
    <p>
     of thing shall cease at once. I will hunt up the American Claimant
    </p>
    <p>
     the first thing in the morning, accomplish my mission, then change my
    </p>
    <p>
     lodging and vanish from scrutiny under a fictitious name.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He left his diary on the table, where it would be handy in case any new
    </p>
    <p>
     “impressions” should wake him up in the night, then he went to bed and
    </p>
    <p>
     presently fell asleep. An hour or two passed, and then he came slowly
    </p>
    <p>
     to consciousness with a confusion of mysterious and augmenting sounds
    </p>
    <p>
     hammering at the gates of his brain for admission; the next moment he
    </p>
    <p>
     was sharply awake, and those sounds burst with the rush and roar and
    </p>
    <p>
     boom of an undammed freshet into his ears. Banging and slamming of
    </p>
    <p>
     shutters; smashing of windows and the ringing clash of falling glass;
    </p>
    <p>
     clatter of flying feet along the halls; shrieks, supplications,
    </p>
    <p>
     dumb moanings of despair, within, hoarse shouts of command outside;
    </p>
    <p>
     cracklings and snappings, and the windy roar of victorious flames!
    </p>
    <p>
     Bang, bang, bang! on the door, and a cry:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Turn out--the house is on fire!”
    </p>
    <p>
     The cry passed on, and the banging. Lord Berkeley sprang out of bed and
    </p>
    <p>
     moved with all possible speed toward the clothes-press in the darkness
    </p>
    <p>
     and the gathering smoke, but fell over a chair and lost his bearings.
    </p>
    <p>
     He groped desperately about on his hands, and presently struck his head
    </p>
    <p>
     against the table and was deeply grateful, for it gave him his bearings
    </p>
    <p>
     again, since it stood close by the door. He seized his most precious
    </p>
    <p>
     possession; his journaled Impressions of America, and darted from the
    </p>
    <p>
     room.
    </p>
    <p>
     He ran down the deserted hall toward the red lamp which he knew
    </p>
    <p>
     indicated the place of a fire-escape. The door of the room beside it was
    </p>
    <p>
     open. In the room the gas was burning full head; on a chair was a pile
    </p>
    <p>
     of clothing. He ran to the window, could not get it up, but smashed it
    </p>
    <p>
     with a chair, and stepped out on the landing of the fire-escape; below
    </p>
    <p>
     him was a crowd of men, with a sprinkling of women and youth, massed
    </p>
    <p>
     in a ruddy light. Must he go down in his spectral night dress? No--this
    </p>
    <p>
     side of the house was not yet on fire except at the further end; he
    </p>
    <p>
     would snatch on those clothes. Which he did. They fitted well enough,
    </p>
    <p>
     though a trifle loosely, and they were just a shade loud as to pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
     Also as to hat--which was of a new breed to him, Buffalo Bill not having
    </p>
    <p>
     been to England yet. One side of the coat went on, but the other side
    </p>
    <p>
     refused; one of its sleeves was turned up and stitched to the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     He started down without waiting to get it loose, made the trip
    </p>
    <p>
     successfully, and was promptly hustled outside the limit-rope by the
    </p>
    <p>
     police.
    </p>
    <p>
     The cowboy hat and the coat but half on made him too much of a centre
    </p>
    <p>
     of attraction for comfort, although nothing could be more profoundly
    </p>
    <p>
     respectful, not to say deferential, than was the manner of the crowd
    </p>
    <p>
     toward him. In his mind he framed a discouraged remark for early entry
    </p>
    <p>
     in his diary: “It is of no use; they know a lord through any disguise,
    </p>
    <p>
     and show awe of him--even something very like fear, indeed.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Presently one of the gaping and adoring half-circle of boys ventured
    </p>
    <p>
     a timid question. My lord answered it. The boys glanced wonderingly at
    </p>
    <p>
     each other and from somewhere fell the comment:
    </p>
    <p>
     “English cowboy! Well, if that ain't curious.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Another mental note to be preserved for the diary: “Cowboy. Now what
    </p>
    <p>
     might a cowboy be? Perhaps--” But the viscount perceived that some more
    </p>
    <p>
     questions were about to be asked; so he worked his way out of the crowd,
    </p>
    <p>
     released the sleeve, put on the coat and wandered away to seek a humble
    </p>
    <p>
     and obscure lodging. He found it and went to bed and was soon asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the morning, he examined his clothes. They were rather assertive,
    </p>
    <p>
     it seemed to him, but they were new and clean, at any rate. There was
    </p>
    <p>
     considerable property in the pockets. Item, five one-hundred dollar
    </p>
    <p>
     bills. Item, near fifty dollars in small bills and silver. Plug of
    </p>
    <p>
     tobacco. Hymn-book, which refuses to open; found to contain whiskey.
    </p>
    <p>
     Memorandum book bearing no name. Scattering entries in it, recording in
    </p>
    <p>
     a sprawling, ignorant hand, appointments, bets, horse-trades, and so
    </p>
    <p>
     on, with people of strange, hyphenated name--Six-Fingered Jake,
    </p>
    <p>
     Young-Man-afraid-of-his-Shadow, and the like. No letters, no documents.
    </p>
    <p>
     The young man muses--maps out his course. His letter of credit is
    </p>
    <p>
     burned; he will borrow the small bills and the silver in these pockets,
    </p>
    <p>
     apply part of it to advertising for the owner, and use the rest for
    </p>
    <p>
     sustenance while he seeks work. He sends out for the morning paper,
    </p>
    <p>
     next, and proceeds to read about the fire. The biggest line in the
    </p>
    <p>
     display-head announces his own death! The body of the account furnishes
    </p>
    <p>
     all the particulars; and tells how, with the inherited heroism of his
    </p>
    <p>
     caste, he went on saving women and children until escape for himself was
    </p>
    <p>
     impossible; then with the eyes of weeping multitudes upon him, he stood
    </p>
    <p>
     with folded arms and sternly awaited the approach of the devouring
    </p>
    <p>
     fiend; “and so standing, amid a tossing sea of flame and on-rushing
    </p>
    <p>
     billows of smoke, the noble young heir of the great house of Rossmore
    </p>
    <p>
     was caught up in a whirlwind of fiery glory, and disappeared forever
    </p>
    <p>
     from the vision of men.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The thing was so fine and generous and knightly that it brought the
    </p>
    <p>
     moisture to his eyes. Presently he said to himself: “What to do is
    </p>
    <p>
     as plain as day, now. My Lord Berkeley is dead--let him stay so. Died
    </p>
    <p>
     creditably, too; that will make the calamity the easier for my father.
    </p>
    <p>
     And I don't have to report to the American Claimant, now. Yes, nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     could be better than the way matters have turned out. I have only to
    </p>
    <p>
     furnish myself with a new name, and take my new start in life totally
    </p>
    <p>
     untrammeled. Now I breathe my first breath of real freedom; and how
    </p>
    <p>
     fresh and breezy and inspiring it is! At last I am a man! a man on equal
    </p>
    <p>
     terms with my neighbor; and by my manhood, and by it alone, I shall rise
    </p>
    <p>
     and be seen of the world, or I shall sink from sight and deserve it.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is the gladdest day, and the proudest, that ever poured it's sun
    </p>
    <p>
     upon my head!”

     CHAPTER VIII.
    </head>
    <p>
     “GOD bless my soul, Hawkins!”
    </p>
    <p>
     The morning paper dropped from the Colonel's nerveless-grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “He's gone!--the bright, the young, the gifted, the noblest of his
    </p>
    <p>
     illustrious race--gone! gone up in flames and unimaginable glory!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “My precious, precious young kinsman--Kirkcudbright Llanover
    </p>
    <p>
     Marjoribanks Sellers Viscount Berkeley, son and heir of usurping
    </p>
    <p>
     Rossmore.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's true--too true.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “When?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Last night.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Right here in Washington; where he arrived from England last night, the
    </p>
    <p>
     papers say.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don't say!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hotel burned down.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What hotel?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “The New Gadsby!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, my goodness! And have we lost both of them?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Both who?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “One-Arm Pete.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, great guns, I forgot all about him. Oh, I hope not.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hope! Well, I should say! Oh, we can't spare him! We can better afford
    </p>
    <p>
     to lose a million viscounts than our only support and stay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They searched the paper diligently, and were appalled to find that a
    </p>
    <p>
     one-armed man had been seen flying along one of the halls of the hotel
    </p>
    <p>
     in his underclothing and apparently out of his head with fright, and as
    </p>
    <p>
     he would listen to no one and persisted in making for a stairway which
    </p>
    <p>
     would carry him to certain death, his case was given over as a hopeless
    </p>
    <p>
     one.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Poor fellow,” sighed Hawkins; “and he had friends so near. I wish we
    </p>
    <p>
     hadn't come away from there--maybe we could have saved him.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The earl looked up and said calmly:
    </p>
    <p>
     “His being dead doesn't matter. He was uncertain before. We've got him
    </p>
    <p>
     sure, this time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Got him? How?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I will materialize him.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rossmore, don't--don't trifle with me. Do you mean that? Can you do
    </p>
    <p>
     it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can do it, just as sure as you are sitting there. And I will.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Give me your hand, and let me have the comfort of shaking it. I was
    </p>
    <p>
     perishing, and you have put new life into me. Get at it, oh, get at it
    </p>
    <p>
     right away.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It will take a little time, Hawkins, but there's no hurry, none in the
    </p>
    <p>
     world--in the circumstances. And of course certain duties have devolved
    </p>
    <p>
     upon me now, which necessarily claim my first attention. This poor young
    </p>
    <p>
     nobleman--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why, yes, I am sorry for my heartlessness, and you smitten with this
    </p>
    <p>
     new family affliction. Of course you must materialize him first--I quite
    </p>
    <p>
     understand that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I--I--well, I wasn't meaning just that, but,--why, what am I thinking
    </p>
    <p>
     of! Of course I must materialize him. Oh, Hawkins, selfishness is the
    </p>
    <p>
     bottom trait in human nature; I was only thinking that now, with
    </p>
    <p>
     the usurper's heir out of the way. But you'll forgive that momentary
    </p>
    <p>
     weakness, and forget it. Don't ever remember it against me that Mulberry
    </p>
    <p>
     Sellers was once mean enough to think the thought that I was thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll materialise him--I will, on my honor--and I'd do it were he a
    </p>
    <p>
     thousand heirs jammed into one and stretching in a solid rank from here
    </p>
    <p>
     to the stolen estates of Rossmore, and barring the road forever to the
    </p>
    <p>
     rightful earl!
    </p>
    <p>
     “There spoke the real Sellers--the other had a false ring, old friend.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hawkins, my boy, it just occurs to me--a thing I keep forgetting to
    </p>
    <p>
     mention--a matter that we've got to be mighty careful about.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We must keep absolutely still about these materializations. Mind, not a
    </p>
    <p>
     hint of them must escape--not a hint. To say nothing of how my wife and
    </p>
    <p>
     daughter--high-strung, sensitive organizations--might feel about them,
    </p>
    <p>
     the negroes wouldn't stay on the place a minute.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's true, they wouldn't. It's well you spoke, for I'm not naturally
    </p>
    <p>
     discreet with my tongue when I'm not warned.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Sellers reached out and touched a bell-button in the wall; set his eye
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the rear door and waited; touched it again and waited; and just
    </p>
    <p>
     as Hawkins was remarking admiringly that the Colonel was the most
    </p>
    <p>
     progressive and most alert man he had ever seen, in the matter of
    </p>
    <p>
     impressing into his service every modern convenience the moment it was
    </p>
    <p>
     invented, and always keeping breast to breast with the drum major in the
    </p>
    <p>
     great work of material civilization, he forsook the button (which hadn't
    </p>
    <p>
     any wire attached to it,) rang a vast dinner bell which stood on the
    </p>
    <p>
     table, and remarked that he had tried that new-fangled dry battery, now,
    </p>
    <p>
     to his entire satisfaction, and had got enough of it; and added:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nothing would do Graham Bell but I must try it; said the mere fact of
    </p>
    <p>
     my trying it would secure public confidence, and get it a chance to show
    </p>
    <p>
     what it could do. I told him that in theory a dry battery was just a
    </p>
    <p>
     curled darling and no mistake, but when it come to practice, sho!--and
    </p>
    <p>
     here's the result. Was I right? What should you say, Washington Hawkins?
    </p>
    <p>
     You've seen me try that button twice. Was I right?--that's the idea. Did
    </p>
    <p>
     I know what I was talking about, or didn't I?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, you know how I feel about you, Colonel Sellers, and always have
    </p>
    <p>
     felt. It seems to me that you always know everything about everything.
    </p>
    <p>
     If that man had known you as I know you he would have taken your
    </p>
    <p>
     judgment at the start, and dropped his dry battery where it was.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did you ring, Marse Sellers?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, Marse Sellers didn't.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Den it was you, Marse Washington. I's heah, suh.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, it wasn't Marse Washington, either.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “De good lan'! who did ring her, den?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Lord Rossmore rang it!”
    </p>
    <p>
     The old negro flung up his hands and exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Blame my skin if I hain't gone en forgit dat name agin! Come heah,
    </p>
    <p>
     Jinny--run heah, honey.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jinny arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You take dish-yer order de lord gwine to give you I's gwine down suller
    </p>
    <p>
     and study dat name tell I git it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I take de order! Who's yo' nigger las' year? De bell rung for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Dat don't make no diffunce. When a bell ring for anybody, en old
    </p>
    <p>
     marster tell me to--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Clear out, and settle it in the kitchen!”
    </p>
    <p>
     The noise of the quarreling presently sank to a murmur in the distance,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the earl added: “That's a trouble with old house servants that were
    </p>
    <p>
     your slaves once and have been your personal friends always.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, and members of the family.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Members of the family is just what they become--THE members of the
    </p>
    <p>
     family, in fact. And sometimes master and mistress of the household.
    </p>
    <p>
     These two are mighty good and loving and faithful and honest, but hang
    </p>
    <p>
     it, they do just about as they please, they chip into a conversation
    </p>
    <p>
     whenever they want to, and the plain fact is, they ought to be killed.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a random remark, but it gave him an idea--however, nothing could
    </p>
    <p>
     happen without that result.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What I wanted, Hawkins, was to send for the family and break the news
    </p>
    <p>
     to them.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “O, never mind bothering with the servants, then. I will go and bring
    </p>
    <p>
     them down.”
    </p>
    <p>
     While he was gone, the earl worked his idea.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes,” he said to himself, “when I've got the materializing down to a
    </p>
    <p>
     certainty, I will get Hawkins to kill them, and after that they will be
    </p>
    <p>
     under better control. Without doubt a materialized negro could easily
    </p>
    <p>
     be hypnotized into a state resembling silence. And this could be made
    </p>
    <p>
     permanent--yes, and also modifiable, at will--sometimes very silent,
    </p>
    <p>
     sometimes turn on more talk, more action, more emotion, according to
    </p>
    <p>
     what you want. It's a prime good idea. Make it adjustable--with a screw
    </p>
    <p>
     or something.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The two ladies entered, now, with Hawkins, and the two negroes followed,
    </p>
    <p>
     uninvited, and fell to brushing and dusting around, for they perceived
    </p>
    <p>
     that there was matter of interest to the fore, and were willing to find
    </p>
    <p>
     out what it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sellers broke the news with stateliness and ceremony, first warning the
    </p>
    <p>
     ladies, with gentle art, that a pang of peculiar sharpness was about
    </p>
    <p>
     to be inflicted upon their hearts--hearts still sore from a like hurt,
    </p>
    <p>
     still lamenting a like loss--then he took the paper, and with trembling
    </p>
    <p>
     lips and with tears in his voice he gave them that heroic death-picture.
    </p>
    <p>
     The result was a very genuine outbreak of sorrow and sympathy from all
    </p>
    <p>
     the hearers. The elder lady cried, thinking how proud that great-hearted
    </p>
    <p>
     young hero's mother would be, if she were living, and how unappeasable
    </p>
    <p>
     her grief; and the two old servants cried with her, and spoke out their
    </p>
    <p>
     applauses and their pitying lamentations with the eloquent sincerity and
    </p>
    <p>
     simplicity native to their race. Gwendolen was touched, and the romantic
    </p>
    <p>
     side of her nature was strongly wrought upon. She said that such a
    </p>
    <p>
     nature as that young man's was rarely and truly noble, and nearly
    </p>
    <p>
     perfect; and that with nobility of birth added it was entirely perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
     For such a man she could endure all things, suffer all things, even to
    </p>
    <p>
     the sacrificing of her life. She wished she could have seen him; the
    </p>
    <p>
     slightest, the most momentary contact with such a spirit would have
    </p>
    <p>
     ennobled her whole character and made ignoble thoughts and ignoble acts
    </p>
    <p>
     thereafter impossible to her forever.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Have they found the body, Rossmore?” asked the wife.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, that is, they've found several. It must be one of them, but none
    </p>
    <p>
     of them are recognizable.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you going to do?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am going down there and identify one of them and send it home to the
    </p>
    <p>
     stricken father.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But papa, did you ever see the young man?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, Gwendolen-why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How will you identify it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I--well, you know it says none of them are recognizable. I'll send his
    </p>
    <p>
     father one of them--there's probably no choice.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Gwendolen knew it was not worth while to argue the matter further, since
    </p>
    <p>
     her father's mind was made up and there was a chance for him to appear
    </p>
    <p>
     upon that sad scene down yonder in an authentic and official way. So she
    </p>
    <p>
     said no more--till he asked for a basket.
    </p>
    <p>
     “A basket, papa? What for?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It might be ashes.”

     CHAPTER IX.
    </head>
    <p>
     The earl and Washington started on the sorrowful errand, talking as they
    </p>
    <p>
     walked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And as usual!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What, Colonel?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Seven of them in that hotel. Actresses. And all burnt out, of course.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Any of them burnt up?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, no they escaped; they always do; but there's never a one of them
    </p>
    <p>
     that knows enough to fetch out her jewelry with her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's strange.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Strange--it's the most unaccountable thing in the world. Experience
    </p>
    <p>
     teaches them nothing; they can't seem to learn anything except out of
    </p>
    <p>
     a book. In some cases there's manifestly a fatality about it. For
    </p>
    <p>
     instance, take What's-her-name, that plays those sensational thunder and
    </p>
    <p>
     lightning parts. She's got a perfectly immense reputation--draws like a
    </p>
    <p>
     dog-fight--and it all came from getting burnt out in hotels.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why, how could that give her a reputation as an actress?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It didn't--it only made her name familiar. People want to see her play
    </p>
    <p>
     because her name is familiar, but they don't know what made it familiar,
    </p>
    <p>
     because they don't remember. First, she was at the bottom of the ladder,
    </p>
    <p>
     and absolutely obscure--wages thirteen dollars a week and find her own
    </p>
    <p>
     pads.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Pads?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes--things to fat up her spindles with so as to be plump and
    </p>
    <p>
     attractive. Well, she got burnt out in a hotel and lost $30,000 worth of
    </p>
    <p>
     diamonds.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She? Where'd she get them?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Goodness knows--given to her, no doubt, by spoony young flats and sappy
    </p>
    <p>
     old bald-heads in the front row. All the papers were full of it. She
    </p>
    <p>
     struck for higher pay and got it. Well, she got burnt out again and lost
    </p>
    <p>
     all her diamonds, and it gave her such a lift that she went starring.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, if hotel fires are all she's got to depend on to keep up her
    </p>
    <p>
     name, it's a pretty precarious kind of a reputation I should think.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not with her. No, anything but that. Because she's so lucky; born
    </p>
    <p>
     lucky, I reckon. Every time there's a hotel fire she's in it. She's
    </p>
    <p>
     always there--and if she can't be there herself, her diamonds are. Now
    </p>
    <p>
     you can't make anything out of that but just sheer luck.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I never heard of such a thing. She must have lost quarts of diamonds.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Quarts, she's lost bushels of them. It's got so that the hotels are
    </p>
    <p>
     superstitious about her. They won't let her in. They think there will be
    </p>
    <p>
     a fire; and besides, if she's there it cancels the insurance. She's been
    </p>
    <p>
     waning a little lately, but this fire will set her up. She lost $60,000
    </p>
    <p>
     worth last night.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think she's a fool. If I had $60,000 worth of diamonds I wouldn't
    </p>
    <p>
     trust them in a hotel.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wouldn't either; but you can't teach an actress that. This one's
    </p>
    <p>
     been burnt out thirty-five times. And yet if there's a hotel fire in San
    </p>
    <p>
     Francisco to-night she's got to bleed again, you mark my words. Perfect
    </p>
    <p>
     ass; they say she's got diamonds in every hotel in the country.”
    </p>
    <p>
     When they arrived at the scene of the fire the poor old earl took one
    </p>
    <p>
     glimpse at the melancholy morgue and turned away his face overcome by
    </p>
    <p>
     the spectacle. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “It is too true, Hawkins--recognition is impossible, not one of the five
    </p>
    <p>
     could be identified by its nearest friend. You make the selection, I
    </p>
    <p>
     can't bear it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Which one had I better--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, take any of them. Pick out the best one.”
    </p>
    <p>
     However, the officers assured the earl--for they knew him, everybody in
    </p>
    <p>
     Washington knew him--that the position in which these bodies were found
    </p>
    <p>
     made it impossible that any one of them could be that of his noble young
    </p>
    <p>
     kinsman. They pointed out the spot where, if the newspaper account was
    </p>
    <p>
     correct, he must have sunk down to destruction; and at a wide distance
    </p>
    <p>
     from this spot they showed him where the young man must have gone down
    </p>
    <p>
     in case he was suffocated in his room; and they showed still a third
    </p>
    <p>
     place, quite remote, where he might possibly have found his death if
    </p>
    <p>
     perchance he tried to escape by the side exit toward the rear. The old
    </p>
    <p>
     Colonel brushed away a tear and said to Hawkins:
    </p>
    <p>
     “As it turns out there was something prophetic in my fears. Yes, it's
    </p>
    <p>
     a matter of ashes. Will you kindly step to a grocery and fetch a couple
    </p>
    <p>
     more baskets?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Reverently they got a basket of ashes from each of those now hallowed
    </p>
    <p>
     spots, and carried them home to consult as to the best manner of
    </p>
    <p>
     forwarding them to England, and also to give them an opportunity to
    </p>
    <p>
     “lie in state,”--a mark of respect which the colonel deemed obligatory,
    </p>
    <p>
     considering the high rank of the deceased.
    </p>
    <p>
     They set the baskets on the table in what was formerly the library,
    </p>
    <p>
     drawing-room and workshop--now the Hall of Audience--and went up stairs
    </p>
    <p>
     to the lumber room to see if they could find a British flag to use as
    </p>
    <p>
     a part of the outfit proper to the lying in state. A moment later, Lady
    </p>
    <p>
     Rossmore came in from the street and caught sight of the baskets just as
    </p>
    <p>
     old Jinny crossed her field of vision. She quite lost her patience and
    </p>
    <p>
     said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, what will you do next? What in the world possessed you to clutter
    </p>
    <p>
     up the parlor table with these baskets of ashes?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ashes?” And she came to look. She put up her hands in pathetic
    </p>
    <p>
     astonishment. “Well, I never see de like!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Didn't you do it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who, me? Clah to goodness it's de fust time I've sot eyes on 'em, Miss
    </p>
    <p>
     Polly. Dat's Dan'l. Dat ole moke is losin' his mine.”
    </p>
    <p>
     But it wasn't Dan'l, for he was called, and denied it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Dey ain't no way to 'splain dat. Wen hit's one er dese-yer common
    </p>
    <p>
     'currences, a body kin reckon maybe de cat--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh!” and a shudder shook Lady Rossmore to her foundations. “I see it
    </p>
    <p>
     all. Keep away from them--they're his.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “His, m' lady?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes--your young Marse Sellers from England that's burnt up.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She was alone with the ashes--alone before she could take half a breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she went after Mulberry Sellers, purposing to make short work
    </p>
    <p>
     of his program, whatever it might be; “for,” said she, “when his
    </p>
    <p>
     sentimentals are up, he's a numskull, and there's no knowing what
    </p>
    <p>
     extravagance he'll contrive, if you let him alone.” She found him. He
    </p>
    <p>
     had found the flag and was bringing it. When she heard that his idea
    </p>
    <p>
     was to have the remains “lie in state, and invite the government and the
    </p>
    <p>
     public,” she broke it up. She said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your intentions are all right--they always are--you want to do honour
    </p>
    <p>
     to the remains, and surely nobody can find any fault with that, for he
    </p>
    <p>
     was your kin; but you are going the wrong way about it, and you will
    </p>
    <p>
     see it yourself if you stop and think. You can't file around a basket
    </p>
    <p>
     of ashes trying to look sorry for it and make a sight that is really
    </p>
    <p>
     solemn, because the solemner it is, the more it isn't--anybody can see
    </p>
    <p>
     that. It would be so with one basket; it would be three times so with
    </p>
    <p>
     three. Well, it stands to reason that if it wouldn't be solemn with
    </p>
    <p>
     one mourner, it wouldn't be with a procession--and there would be
    </p>
    <p>
     five thousand people here. I don't know but it would be pretty near
    </p>
    <p>
     ridiculous; I think it would. No, Mulberry, they can't lie in state--it
    </p>
    <p>
     would be a mistake. Give that up and think of something else.”
    </p>
    <p>
     So he gave it up; and not reluctantly, when he had thought it over and
    </p>
    <p>
     realized how right her instinct was. He concluded to merely sit up
    </p>
    <p>
     with the remains just himself and Hawkins. Even this seemed a doubtful
    </p>
    <p>
     attention, to his wife, but she offered no objection, for it was plain
    </p>
    <p>
     that he had a quite honest and simple-hearted desire to do the friendly
    </p>
    <p>
     and honourable thing by these forlorn poor relics which could command
    </p>
    <p>
     no hospitality in this far off land of strangers but his. He draped the
    </p>
    <p>
     flag about the baskets, put some crape on the door-knob, and said with
    </p>
    <p>
     satisfaction:
    </p>
    <p>
     “There--he is as comfortable, now, as we can make him in the
    </p>
    <p>
     circumstances. Except--yes, we must strain a point there--one must do as
    </p>
    <p>
     one would wish to be done by--he must have it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Have what, dear?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hatchment.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The wife felt that the house-front was standing about all it could well
    </p>
    <p>
     stand, in that way; the prospect of another stunning decoration of that
    </p>
    <p>
     nature distressed her, and she wished the thing had not occurred to him.
    </p>
    <p>
     She said, hesitatingly:
    </p>
    <p>
     “But I thought such an honour as that wasn't allowed to any but very
    </p>
    <p>
     very near relations, who--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Right, you are quite right, my lady, perfectly right; but there aren't
    </p>
    <p>
     any nearer relatives than relatives by usurpation. We cannot avoid it;
    </p>
    <p>
     we are slaves of aristocratic custom and must submit.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The hatchments were unnecessarily generous, each being as large as a
    </p>
    <p>
     blanket, and they were unnecessarily volcanic, too, as to variety and
    </p>
    <p>
     violence of color, but they pleased the earl's barbaric eye, and they
    </p>
    <p>
     satisfied his taste for symmetry and completeness, too, for they left no
    </p>
    <p>
     waste room to speak of on the house-front.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lady Rossmore and her daughter assisted at the sitting-up till near
    </p>
    <p>
     midnight, and helped the gentlemen to consider what ought to be done
    </p>
    <p>
     next with the remains. Rossmore thought they ought to be sent home with
    </p>
    <p>
     a committee and resolutions,--at once. But the wife was doubtful. She
    </p>
    <p>
     said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Would you send all of the baskets?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, yes, all.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “All at once?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “To his father? Oh, no--by no means. Think of the shock. No--one at a
    </p>
    <p>
     time; break it to him by degrees.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Would that have that effect, father?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, my daughter. Remember, you are young and elastic, but he is old.
    </p>
    <p>
     To send him the whole at once might well be more than he could bear.
    </p>
    <p>
     But mitigated--one basket at a time, with restful intervals between, he
    </p>
    <p>
     would be used to it by the time he got all of him. And sending him in
    </p>
    <p>
     three ships is safer anyway. On account of wrecks and storms.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't like the idea, father. If I were his father it would be
    </p>
    <p>
     dreadful to have him coming in that--in that--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “On the installment plan,” suggested Hawkins, gravely, and proud of
    </p>
    <p>
     being able to help.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes--dreadful to have him coming in that incoherent way. There would
    </p>
    <p>
     be the strain of suspense upon me all the time. To have so depressing a
    </p>
    <p>
     thing as a funeral impending, delayed, waiting, unaccomplished--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, no, my child,” said the earl reassuringly, “there would be nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     of that kind; so old a gentleman could not endure a long-drawn suspense
    </p>
    <p>
     like that. There will be three funerals.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lady Rossmore looked up surprised, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “How is that going to make it easier for him? It's a total mistake, to
    </p>
    <p>
     my mind. He ought to be buried all at once; I'm sure of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I should think so, too,” said Hawkins.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And certainly I should,” said the daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You are all wrong,” said the earl. “You will see it yourselves, if you
    </p>
    <p>
     think. Only one of these baskets has got him in it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Very well, then,” said Lady Rossmore, “the thing is perfectly
    </p>
    <p>
     simple--bury that one.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Certainly,” said Lady Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But it is not simple,” said the earl, “because we do not know which
    </p>
    <p>
     basket he is in. We know he is in one of them, but that is all we do
    </p>
    <p>
     know. You see now, I reckon, that I was right; it takes three funerals,
    </p>
    <p>
     there is no other way.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And three graves and three monuments and three inscriptions?” asked the
    </p>
    <p>
     daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well--yes--to do it right. That is what I should do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It could not be done so, father. Each of the inscriptions would give
    </p>
    <p>
     the same name and the same facts and say he was under each and all of
    </p>
    <p>
     these monuments, and that would not answer at all.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The earl nestled uncomfortably in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” he said, “that is an objection. That is a serious objection. I see
    </p>
    <p>
     no way out.”
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a general silence for a while. Then Hawkins said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “It seems to me that if we mixed the three ramifications together--”
    </p>
    <p>
     The earl grasped him by the hand and shook it gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It solves the whole problem,” he said. “One ship, one funeral, one
    </p>
    <p>
     grave, one monument--it is admirably conceived. It does you honor,
    </p>
    <p>
     Major Hawkins, it has relieved me of a most painful embarrassment and
    </p>
    <p>
     distress, and it will save that poor stricken old father much suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, he shall go over in one basket.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “When?” asked the wife.
    </p>
    <p>
     “To-morrow-immediately, of course.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I would wait, Mulberry.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait? Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don't want to break that childless old man's heart.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “God knows I don't!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then wait till he sends for his son's remains. If you do that, you will
    </p>
    <p>
     never have to give him the last and sharpest pain a parent can know--I
    </p>
    <p>
     mean, the certainty that his son is dead. For he will never send.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why won't he?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because to send--and find out the truth--would rob him of the one
    </p>
    <p>
     precious thing left him, the uncertainty, the dim hope that maybe, after
    </p>
    <p>
     all, his boy escaped, and he will see him again some day.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why Polly, he'll know by the papers that he was burnt up.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “He won't let himself believe the papers; he'll argue against anything
    </p>
    <p>
     and everything that proves his son is dead; and he will keep that up and
    </p>
    <p>
     live on it, and on nothing else till he dies. But if the remains should
    </p>
    <p>
     actually come, and be put before that poor old dim-hoping soul--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, my God, they never shall! Polly, you've saved me from a crime, and
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll bless you for it always. Now we know what to do. We'll place them
    </p>
    <p>
     reverently away, and he shall never know.”

     CHAPTER X.
    </head>
    <p>
     The young Lord Berkeley, with the fresh air of freedom in his nostrils,
    </p>
    <p>
     was feeling invincibly strong for his new career; and yet--and yet--if
    </p>
    <p>
     the fight should prove a very hard one at first, very discouraging, very
    </p>
    <p>
     taxing on untoughened moral sinews, he might in some weak moment want to
    </p>
    <p>
     retreat. Not likely, of course, but possibly that might happen. And so
    </p>
    <p>
     on the whole it might be pardonable caution to burn his bridges behind
    </p>
    <p>
     him. Oh, without doubt. He must not stop with advertising for the
    </p>
    <p>
     owner of that money, but must put it where he could not borrow from it
    </p>
    <p>
     himself, meantime, under stress of circumstances. So he went down town,
    </p>
    <p>
     and put in his advertisement, then went to a bank and handed in $500 for
    </p>
    <p>
     deposit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What name?”
    </p>
    <p>
     He hesitated and colored a little; he had forgotten to make a selection.
    </p>
    <p>
     He now brought out the first one that suggested itself:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Howard Tracy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     When he was gone the clerks, marveling, said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “The cowboy blushed.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The first step was accomplished. The money was still under his command
    </p>
    <p>
     and at his disposal, but the next step would dispose of that difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
     He went to another bank and drew upon the first bank for the $500 by
    </p>
    <p>
     check. The money was collected and deposited a second time to the credit
    </p>
    <p>
     of Howard Tracy. He was asked to leave a few samples of his signature,
    </p>
    <p>
     which he did. Then he went away, once more proud and of perfect courage,
    </p>
    <p>
     saying:
    </p>
    <p>
     “No help for me now, for henceforth I couldn't draw that money without
    </p>
    <p>
     identification, and that is become legally impossible. No resources to
    </p>
    <p>
     fall back on. It is work or starve from now to the end. I am ready--and
    </p>
    <p>
     not afraid!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Then he sent this cablegram to his father:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Escaped unhurt from burning hotel. Have taken fictitious name.
    </p>
    <p>
     Goodbye.”
    </p>
    <p>
     During the evening while he was wandering about in one of the outlying
    </p>
    <p>
     districts of the city, he came across a small brick church, with a bill
    </p>
    <p>
     posted there with these words printed on it: “MECHANICS' CLUB DEBATE.
    </p>
    <p>
     ALL INVITED.” He saw people, apparently mainly of the working class,
    </p>
    <p>
     entering the place, and he followed and took his seat. It was a humble
    </p>
    <p>
     little church, quite bare as to ornamentation. It had painted pews
    </p>
    <p>
     without cushions, and no pulpit, properly speaking, but it had a
    </p>
    <p>
     platform. On the platform sat the chairman, and by his side sat a man
    </p>
    <p>
     who held a manuscript in his hand and had the waiting look of one who is
    </p>
    <p>
     going to perform the principal part. The church was soon filled with a
    </p>
    <p>
     quiet and orderly congregation of decently dressed and modest people.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is what the chairman said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “The essayist for this evening is an old member of our club whom you all
    </p>
    <p>
     know, Mr. Parker, assistant editor of the Daily Democrat. The subject of
    </p>
    <p>
     his essay is the American Press, and he will use as his text a couple of
    </p>
    <p>
     paragraphs taken from Mr. Matthew Arnold's new book. He asks me to read
    </p>
    <p>
     these texts for him. The first is as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
     “'Goethe says somewhere that “the thrill of awe,” that is to say,
    </p>
    <p>
     REVERENCE, is the best thing humanity has.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mr. Arnold's other paragraph is as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
     “'I should say that if one were searching for the best means to efface
    </p>
    <p>
     and kill in a whole nation the discipline of respect, one could not do
    </p>
    <p>
     better than take the American newspapers.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Parker rose and bowed, and was received with warm applause. He then
    </p>
    <p>
     began to read in a good round resonant voice, with clear enunciation and
    </p>
    <p>
     careful attention to his pauses and emphases. His points were received
    </p>
    <p>
     with approval as he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
     The essayist took the position that the most important function of a
    </p>
    <p>
     public journal in any country was the propagating of national feeling
    </p>
    <p>
     and pride in the national name--the keeping the people “in love with
    </p>
    <p>
     their country and its institutions, and shielded from the allurements
    </p>
    <p>
     of alien and inimical systems.” He sketched the manner in which the
    </p>
    <p>
     reverent Turkish or Russian journalist fulfilled this function--the one
    </p>
    <p>
     assisted by the prevalent “discipline of respect” for the bastinado, the
    </p>
    <p>
     other for Siberia. Continuing, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
     The chief function of an English journal is that of all other journals
    </p>
    <p>
     the world over: it must keep the public eye fixed admiringly upon
    </p>
    <p>
     certain things, and keep it diligently diverted from certain others. For
    </p>
    <p>
     instance, it must keep the public eye fixed admiringly upon the glories
    </p>
    <p>
     of England, a processional splendor stretching its receding line down
    </p>
    <p>
     the hazy vistas of time, with the mellowed lights of a thousand years
    </p>
    <p>
     glinting from its banners; and it must keep it diligently diverted from
    </p>
    <p>
     the fact that all these glories were for the enrichment and
    </p>
    <p>
     aggrandizement of the petted and privileged few, at cost of the blood
    </p>
    <p>
     and sweat and poverty of the unconsidered masses who achieved them but
    </p>
    <p>
     might not enter in and partake of them. It must keep the public eye
    </p>
    <p>
     fixed in loving and awful reverence upon the throne as a sacred thing,
    </p>
    <p>
     and diligently divert it from the fact that no throne was ever set up by
    </p>
    <p>
     the unhampered vote of a majority of any nation; and that hence no
    </p>
    <p>
     throne exists that has a right to exist, and no symbol of it, flying
    </p>
    <p>
     from any flagstaff, is righteously entitled to wear any device but the
    </p>
    <p>
     skull and crossbones of that kindred industry which differs from royalty
    </p>
    <p>
     only business-wise--merely as retail differs from wholesale. It must
    </p>
    <p>
     keep the citizen's eye fixed in reverent docility upon that curious
    </p>
    <p>
     invention of machine politics, an Established Church, and upon that bald
    </p>
    <p>
     contradiction of common justice, a hereditary nobility; and diligently
    </p>
    <p>
     divert it from the fact that the one damns him if he doesn't wear its
    </p>
    <p>
     collar, and robs him under the gentle name of taxation whether he wears
    </p>
    <p>
     it or not, and the other gets all the honors while he does all the work.
    </p>
    <p>
     The essayist thought that Mr. Arnold, with his trained eye and
    </p>
    <p>
     intelligent observation, ought to have perceived that the very quality
    </p>
    <p>
     which he so regretfully missed from our press--respectfulness, reverence
    </p>
    <p>
     --was exactly the thing which would make our press useless to us if it
    </p>
    <p>
     had it--rob it of the very thing which differentiates it from all
    </p>
    <p>
     other journalism in the world and makes it distinctively and preciously
    </p>
    <p>
     American, its frank and cheerful irreverence being by all odds the
    </p>
    <p>
     most valuable of all its qualities. “For its mission--overlooked by Mr.
    </p>
    <p>
     Arnold--is to stand guard over a nation's liberties, not its humbugs and
    </p>
    <p>
     shams.” He thought that if during fifty years the institutions of the
    </p>
    <p>
     old world could be exposed to the fire of a flouting and scoffing press
    </p>
    <p>
     like ours, “monarchy and its attendant crimes would disappear from
    </p>
    <p>
     Christendom.” Monarchists might doubt this; then “why not persuade the
    </p>
    <p>
     Czar to give it a trial in Russia?” Concluding, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, the charge is, that our press has but little of that old world
    </p>
    <p>
     quality, reverence. Let us be candidly grateful that it is so. With its
    </p>
    <p>
     limited reverence it at least reveres the things which this nation
    </p>
    <p>
     reveres, as a rule, and that is sufficient: what other people revere is
    </p>
    <p>
     fairly and properly matter of light importance to us. Our press does not
    </p>
    <p>
     reverence kings, it does not reverence so called nobilities, it does not
    </p>
    <p>
     reverence established ecclesiastical slaveries, it does not reverence
    </p>
    <p>
     laws which rob a younger son to fatten an elder one, it does not
    </p>
    <p>
     reverence any fraud or sham or infamy, howsoever old or rotten or holy,
    </p>
    <p>
     which sets one citizen above his neighbor by accident of birth: it does
    </p>
    <p>
     not reverence any law or custom, howsoever old or decayed or sacred,
    </p>
    <p>
     which shuts against the best man in the land the best place in the land
    </p>
    <p>
     and the divine right to prove property and go up and occupy it. In the
    </p>
    <p>
     sense of the poet Goethe--that meek idolater of provincial three carat
    </p>
    <p>
     royalty and nobility--our press is certainly bankrupt in the “thrill of
    </p>
    <p>
     awe”--otherwise reverence; reverence for nickel plate and brummagem. Let
    </p>
    <p>
     us sincerely hope that this fact will remain a fact forever: for to my
    </p>
    <p>
     mind a discriminating irreverence is the creator and protector of human
    </p>
    <p>
     liberty--even as the other thing is the creator, nurse, and steadfast
    </p>
    <p>
     protector of all forms of human slavery, bodily and mental.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy said to himself, almost shouted to himself, “I'm glad I came to
    </p>
    <p>
     this country. I was right. I was right to seek out a land where such
    </p>
    <p>
     healthy principles and theories are in men's hearts and minds. Think of
    </p>
    <p>
     the innumerable slaveries imposed by misplaced reverence! How well he
    </p>
    <p>
     brought that out, and how true it is. There's manifestly prodigious
    </p>
    <p>
     force in reverence. If you can get a man to reverence your ideals, he's
    </p>
    <p>
     your slave. Oh, yes, in all the ages the peoples of Europe have been
    </p>
    <p>
     diligently taught to avoid reasoning about the shams of monarchy and
    </p>
    <p>
     nobility, been taught to avoid examining them, been taught to reverence
    </p>
    <p>
     them; and now, as a natural result, to reverence them is second nature.
    </p>
    <p>
     In order to shock them it is sufficient to inject a thought of the
    </p>
    <p>
     opposite kind into their dull minds. For ages, any expression of
    </p>
    <p>
     so-called irreverence from their lips has been sin and crime. The sham
    </p>
    <p>
     and swindle of all this is apparent the moment one reflects that he is
    </p>
    <p>
     himself the only legitimately qualified judge of what is entitled to
    </p>
    <p>
     reverence and what is not. Come, I hadn't thought of that before, but it
    </p>
    <p>
     is true, absolutely true. What right has Goethe, what right has Arnold,
    </p>
    <p>
     what right has any dictionary, to define the word Irreverence for me?
    </p>
    <p>
     What their ideals are is nothing to me. So long as I reverence my own
    </p>
    <p>
     ideals my whole duty is done, and I commit no profanation if I laugh at
    </p>
    <p>
     theirs. I may scoff at other people's ideals as much as I want to. It is
    </p>
    <p>
     my right and my privilege. No man has any right to deny it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy was expecting to hear the essay debated, but this did not happen.
    </p>
    <p>
     The chairman said, by way of explanation:
    </p>
    <p>
     “I would say, for the information of the strangers present here, that in
    </p>
    <p>
     accordance with our custom the subject of this meeting will be debated
    </p>
    <p>
     at the next meeting of the club. This is in order to enable our members
    </p>
    <p>
     to prepare what they may wish to say upon the subject with pen and
    </p>
    <p>
     paper, for we are mainly mechanics and unaccustomed to speaking. We are
    </p>
    <p>
     obliged to write down what we desire to say.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Many brief papers were now read, and several offhand speeches made in
    </p>
    <p>
     discussion of the essay read at the last meeting of the club, which had
    </p>
    <p>
     been a laudation, by some visiting professor, of college culture, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the grand results flowing from it to the nation. One of the papers was
    </p>
    <p>
     read by a man approaching middle age, who said he hadn't had a college
    </p>
    <p>
     education, that he had got his education in a printing office, and had
    </p>
    <p>
     graduated from there into the patent office, where he had been a clerk
    </p>
    <p>
     now for a great many years. Then he continued to this effect:
    </p>
    <p>
     The essayist contrasted the America of to-day with the America of bygone
    </p>
    <p>
     times, and certainly the result is the exhibition of a mighty progress.
    </p>
    <p>
     But I think he a little overrated the college-culture share in the
    </p>
    <p>
     production of that result. It can no doubt be easily shown that the
    </p>
    <p>
     colleges have contributed the intellectual part of this progress, and
    </p>
    <p>
     that that part is vast; but that the material progress has been
    </p>
    <p>
     immeasurably vaster, I think you will concede. Now I have been looking
    </p>
    <p>
     over a list of inventors--the creators of this amazing material
    </p>
    <p>
     development--and I find that they were not college-bred men. Of course
    </p>
    <p>
     there are exceptions--like Professor Henry of Princeton, the inventor of
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Morse's system of telegraphy--but these exceptions are few. It is
    </p>
    <p>
     not overstatement to say that the imagination-stunning material
    </p>
    <p>
     development of this century, the only century worth living in since time
    </p>
    <p>
     itself was invented, is the creation of men not college-bred. We think
    </p>
    <p>
     we see what these inventors have done: no, we see only the visible vast
    </p>
    <p>
     frontage of their work; behind it is their far vaster work, and it is
    </p>
    <p>
     invisible to the careless glance. They have reconstructed this nation--
    </p>
    <p>
     made it over, that is--and metaphorically speaking, have multiplied its
    </p>
    <p>
     numbers almost beyond the power of figures to express. I will explain
    </p>
    <p>
     what I mean. What constitutes the population of a land? Merely the
    </p>
    <p>
     numberable packages of meat and bones in it called by courtesy men and
    </p>
    <p>
     women? Shall a million ounces of brass and a million ounces of gold be
    </p>
    <p>
     held to be of the same value? Take a truer standard: the measure of a
    </p>
    <p>
     man's contributing capacity to his time and his people--the work he can
    </p>
    <p>
     do--and then number the population of this country to-day, as multiplied
    </p>
    <p>
     by what a man can now do, more than his grandfather could do. By this
    </p>
    <p>
     standard of measurement, this nation, two or three generations ago,
    </p>
    <p>
     consisted of mere cripples, paralytics, dead men, as compared with the
    </p>
    <p>
     men of to-day. In 1840 our population was 17,000,000. By way of rude but
    </p>
    <p>
     striking illustration, let us consider, for argument's sake, that four
    </p>
    <p>
     of these millions consisted of aged people, little children, and other
    </p>
    <p>
     incapables, and that the remaining 13,000,000 were divided and employed
    </p>
    <p>
     as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
     2,000,000     as ginners of cotton.
    </p>
    <p>
     6,000,000  (women) as stocking-knitters.
    </p>
    <p>
     2,000,000  (women) as thread-spinners.
    </p>
    <p>
     500,000   as screw makers.
    </p>
    <p>
     400,000   as reapers, binders, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     1,000,000   as corn-shellers.
    </p>
    <p>
     40,000  as weavers.
    </p>
    <p>
     1,000  as stitchers of shoe soles.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now the deductions which I am going to append to these figures may sound
    </p>
    <p>
     extravagant, but they are not. I take them from Miscellaneous Documents
    </p>
    <p>
     No. 50, second session 45th Congress, and they are official and
    </p>
    <p>
     trustworthy. To-day, the work of those 2,000,000 cotton-ginners is done
    </p>
    <p>
     by 2,000 men; that of the 6,000,000 stocking-knitters is done by 3,000
    </p>
    <p>
     boys; that of the 2,000,000 thread-spinners is done by 1,000 girls; that
    </p>
    <p>
     of the 500,000 screw makers is done by 500 girls; that of the 400,000
    </p>
    <p>
     reapers, binders, etc., is done by 4,000 boys; that of the 1,000,000
    </p>
    <p>
     corn-shellers is done by 7,500 men; that of the 40,000 weavers is done
    </p>
    <p>
     by 1,200 men; and that of the 1,000 stitchers of shoe soles is done by 6
    </p>
    <p>
     men. To bunch the figures, 17,900 persons to-day do the above-work,
    </p>
    <p>
     whereas fifty years ago it would have taken thirteen millions of persons
    </p>
    <p>
     to do it. Now then, how many of that ignorant race--our fathers and
    </p>
    <p>
     grandfathers--with their ignorant methods, would it take to do our work
    </p>
    <p>
     to-day? It would take forty thousand millions--a hundred times the
    </p>
    <p>
     swarming population of China--twenty times the present population of the
    </p>
    <p>
     globe. You look around you and you see a nation of sixty millions--
    </p>
    <p>
     apparently; but secreted in their hands and brains, and invisible to
    </p>
    <p>
     your eyes, is the true population of this Republic, and it numbers forty
    </p>
    <p>
     billions! It is the stupendous creation of those humble unlettered, un-
    </p>
    <p>
     college-bred inventors--all honor to their name.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How grand that is!” said Tracy, as he wended homeward. “What a
    </p>
    <p>
     civilization it is, and what prodigious results these are! and brought
    </p>
    <p>
     about almost wholly by common men; not by Oxford-trained aristocrats,
    </p>
    <p>
     but men who stand shoulder to shoulder in the humble ranks of life and
    </p>
    <p>
     earn the bread that they eat. Again, I'm glad I came. I have found a
    </p>
    <p>
     country at last where one may start fair, and breast to breast with his
    </p>
    <p>
     fellow man, rise by his own efforts, and be something in the world and
    </p>
    <p>
     be proud of that something; not be something created by an ancestor
    </p>
    <p>
     three hundred years ago.”

     CHAPTER XI.
    </head>
    <p>
     During the first few days he kept the fact diligently before his mind
    </p>
    <p>
     that he was in a land where there was “work and bread for all.” In fact,
    </p>
    <p>
     for convenience' sake he fitted it to a little tune and hummed it to
    </p>
    <p>
     himself; but as time wore on the fact itself began to take on a doubtful
    </p>
    <p>
     look, and next the tune got fatigued and presently ran down and
    </p>
    <p>
     stopped. His first effort was to get an upper clerkship in one of the
    </p>
    <p>
     departments, where his Oxford education could come into play and do
    </p>
    <p>
     him service. But he stood no chance whatever. There, competency was no
    </p>
    <p>
     recommendation; political backing, without competency, was worth six of
    </p>
    <p>
     it. He was glaringly English, and that was necessarily against him in
    </p>
    <p>
     the political centre of a nation where both parties prayed for the Irish
    </p>
    <p>
     cause on the house-top and blasphemed it in the cellar. By his dress he
    </p>
    <p>
     was a cowboy; that won him respect--when his back was not turned--but
    </p>
    <p>
     it couldn't get a clerkship for him. But he had said, in a rash moment,
    </p>
    <p>
     that he would wear those clothes till the owner or the owner's friends
    </p>
    <p>
     caught sight of them and asked for that money, and his conscience would
    </p>
    <p>
     not let him retire from that engagement now.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the end of a week things were beginning to wear rather a startling
    </p>
    <p>
     look. He had hunted everywhere for work, descending gradually the scale
    </p>
    <p>
     of quality, until apparently he had sued for all the various kinds of
    </p>
    <p>
     work a man without a special calling might hope to be able to do, except
    </p>
    <p>
     ditching and the other coarse manual sorts--and had got neither work nor
    </p>
    <p>
     the promise of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was mechanically turning over the leaves of his diary, meanwhile, and
    </p>
    <p>
     now his eye fell upon the first record made after he was burnt out:
    </p>
    <p>
     “I myself did not doubt my stamina before, nobody could doubt it now, if
    </p>
    <p>
     they could see how I am housed, and realise that I feel absolutely no
    </p>
    <p>
     disgust with these quarters, but am as serenely content with them as any
    </p>
    <p>
     dog would be in a similar kennel. Terms, twenty-five dollars a week. I
    </p>
    <p>
     said I would start at the bottom. I have kept my word.” A shudder went
    </p>
    <p>
     quaking through him, and he exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
     “What have I been thinking of! THIS the bottom! Mooning along a whole
    </p>
    <p>
     week, and these terrific expenses climbing and climbing all the time! I
    </p>
    <p>
     must end this folly straightway.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He settled up at once and went forth to find less sumptuous lodgings. He
    </p>
    <p>
     had to wander far and seek with diligence, but he succeeded. They made
    </p>
    <p>
     him pay in advance--four dollars and a half; this secured both bed and
    </p>
    <p>
     food for a week. The good-natured, hardworked landlady took him up three
    </p>
    <p>
     flights of narrow, uncarpeted stairs and delivered him into his room.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were two double-bedsteads in it, and one single one. He would be
    </p>
    <p>
     allowed to sleep alone in one of the double beds until some new boarder
    </p>
    <p>
     should come, but he wouldn't be charged extra.
    </p>
    <p>
     So he would presently be required to sleep with some stranger! The
    </p>
    <p>
     thought of it made him sick. Mrs. Marsh, the landlady, was very friendly
    </p>
    <p>
     and hoped he would like her house--they all liked it, she said.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And they're a very nice set of boys. They carry on a good deal, but
    </p>
    <p>
     that's their fun. You see, this room opens right into this back one, and
    </p>
    <p>
     sometimes they're all in one and sometimes in the other; and hot nights
    </p>
    <p>
     they all sleep on the roof when it don't rain. They get out there the
    </p>
    <p>
     minute it's hot enough. The season's so early that they've already had a
    </p>
    <p>
     night or two up there. If you'd like to go up and pick out a place, you
    </p>
    <p>
     can. You'll find chalk in the side of the chimney where there's a brick
    </p>
    <p>
     wanting. You just take the chalk and--but of course you've done it
    </p>
    <p>
     before.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, no, I haven't.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why, of course you haven't--what am I thinking of? Plenty of room on
    </p>
    <p>
     the Plains without chalking, I'll be bound. Well, you just chalk out
    </p>
    <p>
     a place the size of a blanket anywhere on the tin that ain't already
    </p>
    <p>
     marked off, you know, and that's your property. You and your bed-mate
    </p>
    <p>
     take turnabout carrying up the blanket and pillows and fetching them
    </p>
    <p>
     down again; or one carries them up and the other fetches them down,
    </p>
    <p>
     you fix it the way you like, you know. You'll like the boys, they're
    </p>
    <p>
     everlasting sociable--except the printer. He's the one that sleeps in
    </p>
    <p>
     that single bed--the strangest creature; why, I don't believe you could
    </p>
    <p>
     get that man to sleep with another man, not if the house was afire. Mind
    </p>
    <p>
     you, I'm not just talking, I know. The boys tried him, to see. They
    </p>
    <p>
     took his bed out one night, and so when he got home about three in the
    </p>
    <p>
     morning--he was on a morning paper then, but he's on an evening one
    </p>
    <p>
     now--there wasn't any place for him but with the iron-moulder; and if
    </p>
    <p>
     you'll believe me, he just set up the rest of the night--he did, honest.
    </p>
    <p>
     They say he's cracked, but it ain't so, he's English--they're awful
    </p>
    <p>
     particular. You won't mind my saying that. You--you're English?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I thought so. I could tell it by the way you mispronounce the words
    </p>
    <p>
     that's got a's in them, you know; such as saying loff when you mean laff
    </p>
    <p>
     --but you'll get over that. He's a right down good fellow, and a little
    </p>
    <p>
     sociable with the photographer's boy and the caulker and the blacksmith
    </p>
    <p>
     that work in the navy yard, but not so much with the others. The fact
    </p>
    <p>
     is, though it's private, and the others don't know it, he's a kind of
    </p>
    <p>
     an aristocrat, his father being a doctor, and you know what style that
    </p>
    <p>
     is--in England, I mean, because in this country a doctor ain't so very
    </p>
    <p>
     much, even if he's that. But over there of course it's different. So
    </p>
    <p>
     this chap had a falling out with his father, and was pretty high strung,
    </p>
    <p>
     and just cut for this country, and the first he knew he had to get to
    </p>
    <p>
     work or starve. Well, he'd been to college, you see, and so he judged he
    </p>
    <p>
     was all right--did you say anything?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No--I only sighed.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And there's where he was mistaken. Why, he mighty near starved. And I
    </p>
    <p>
     reckon he would have starved sure enough, if some jour' printer or other
    </p>
    <p>
     hadn't took pity on him and got him a place as apprentice. So he learnt
    </p>
    <p>
     the trade, and then he was all right--but it was a close call. Once
    </p>
    <p>
     he thought he had got to haul in his pride and holler for his father
    </p>
    <p>
     and--why, you're sighing again. Is anything the matter with you?--does
    </p>
    <p>
     my clatter--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, dear--no. Pray go on--I like it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, you see, he's been over here ten years; he's twenty-eight, now,
    </p>
    <p>
     and he ain't pretty well satisfied in his mind, because he can't get
    </p>
    <p>
     reconciled to being a mechanic and associating with mechanics, he being,
    </p>
    <p>
     as he says to me, a gentleman, which is a pretty plain letting-on that
    </p>
    <p>
     the boys ain't, but of course I know enough not to let that cat out of
    </p>
    <p>
     the bag.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why--would there be any harm in it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Harm in it? They'd lick him, wouldn't they? Wouldn't you? Of course
    </p>
    <p>
     you would. Don't you ever let a man say you ain't a gentleman in this
    </p>
    <p>
     country. But laws, what am I thinking about? I reckon a body would think
    </p>
    <p>
     twice before he said a cowboy wasn't a gentleman.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A trim, active, slender and very pretty girl of about eighteen walked
    </p>
    <p>
     into the room now, in the most satisfied and unembarrassed way. She
    </p>
    <p>
     was cheaply but smartly and gracefully dressed, and the mother's quick
    </p>
    <p>
     glance at the stranger's face as he rose, was of the kind which inquires
    </p>
    <p>
     what effect has been produced, and expects to find indications of
    </p>
    <p>
     surprise and admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is my daughter Hattie--we call her Puss. It's the new boarder,
    </p>
    <p>
     Puss.” This without rising.
    </p>
    <p>
     The young Englishman made the awkward bow common to his nationality and
    </p>
    <p>
     time of life in circumstances of delicacy and difficulty, and these were
    </p>
    <p>
     of that sort; for, being taken by surprise, his natural, lifelong self
    </p>
    <p>
     sprang to the front, and that self of course would not know just how to
    </p>
    <p>
     act when introduced to a chambermaid, or to the heiress of a mechanics'
    </p>
    <p>
     boarding house. His other self--the self which recognized the equality
    </p>
    <p>
     of all men--would have managed the thing better, if it hadn't been
    </p>
    <p>
     caught off guard and robbed of its chance. The young girl paid no
    </p>
    <p>
     attention to the bow, but put out her hand frankly and gave the stranger
    </p>
    <p>
     a friendly shake and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “How do you do?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she marched to the one washstand in the room, tilted her head this
    </p>
    <p>
     way and that before the wreck of a cheap mirror that hung above it,
    </p>
    <p>
     dampened her fingers with her tongue, perfected the circle of a little
    </p>
    <p>
     lock of hair that was pasted against her forehead, then began to busy
    </p>
    <p>
     herself with the slops.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I must be going--it's getting towards supper time. Make yourself
    </p>
    <p>
     at home, Mr. Tracy, you'll hear the bell when it's ready.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The landlady took her tranquil departure, without commanding either of
    </p>
    <p>
     the young people to vacate the room. The young man wondered a little
    </p>
    <p>
     that a mother who seemed so honest and respectable should be so
    </p>
    <p>
     thoughtless, and was reaching for his hat, intending to disembarrass the
    </p>
    <p>
     girl of his presence; but she said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where are you going?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well--nowhere in particular, but as I am only in the way here--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why, who said you were in the way? Sit down--I'll move you when you are
    </p>
    <p>
     in the way.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She was making the beds, now. He sat down and watched her deft and
    </p>
    <p>
     diligent performance.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What gave you that notion? Do you reckon I need a whole room just to
    </p>
    <p>
     make up a bed or two in?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well no, it wasn't that, exactly. We are away up here in an empty
    </p>
    <p>
     house, and your mother being gone--”
    </p>
    <p>
     The girl interrupted him with an amused laugh, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nobody to protect me? Bless you, I don't need it. I'm not afraid. I
    </p>
    <p>
     might be if I was alone, because I do hate ghosts, and I don't deny it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not that I believe in them, for I don't. I'm only just afraid of them.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How can you be afraid of them if you don't believe in them?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, I don't know the how of it--that's too many for me; I only know
    </p>
    <p>
     it's so. It's the same with Maggie Lee.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who is that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “One of the boarders; young lady that works in the fact'ry.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She works in a factory?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes. Shoe factory.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “In a shoe factory; and you call her a young lady?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why, she's only twenty-two; what should you call her?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wasn't thinking of her age, I was thinking of the title. The fact
    </p>
    <p>
     is, I came away from England to get away from artificial forms--for
    </p>
    <p>
     artificial forms suit artificial people only--and here you've got them
    </p>
    <p>
     too. I'm sorry. I hoped you had only men and women; everybody equal; no
    </p>
    <p>
     differences in rank.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The girl stopped with a pillow in her teeth and the case spread open
    </p>
    <p>
     below it, contemplating him from under her brows with a slightly puzzled
    </p>
    <p>
     expression. She released the pillow and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why, they are all equal. Where's any difference in rank?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you call a factory girl a young lady, what do you call the
    </p>
    <p>
     President's wife?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Call her an old one.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, you make age the only distinction?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “There ain't any other to make as far as I can see.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then all women are ladies?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Certainly they are. All the respectable ones.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, that puts a better face on it. Certainly there is no harm in a
    </p>
    <p>
     title when it is given to everybody. It is only an offense and a wrong
    </p>
    <p>
     when it is restricted to a favored few. But Miss--er--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hattie.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Miss Hattie, be frank; confess that that title isn't accorded by
    </p>
    <p>
     everybody to everybody. The rich American doesn't call her cook a
    </p>
    <p>
     lady--isn't that so?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, it's so. What of it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     He was surprised and a little disappointed, to see that his admirable
    </p>
    <p>
     shot had produced no perceptible effect.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What of it?” he said. “Why this: equality is not conceded here, after
    </p>
    <p>
     all, and the Americans are no better off than the English. In fact
    </p>
    <p>
     there's no difference.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now what an idea. There's nothing in a title except what is put into
    </p>
    <p>
     it--you've said that yourself. Suppose the title is 'clean,' instead of
    </p>
    <p>
     'lady.' You get that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I believe so. Instead of speaking of a woman as a lady, you substitute
    </p>
    <p>
     clean and say she's a clean person.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's it. In England the swell folks don't speak of the working people
    </p>
    <p>
     as gentlemen and ladies?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, no.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And the working people don't call themselves gentlemen and ladies?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Certainly not.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “So if you used the other word there wouldn't be any change. The swell
    </p>
    <p>
     people wouldn't call anybody but themselves 'clean,' and those others
    </p>
    <p>
     would drop sort of meekly into their way of talking and they wouldn't
    </p>
    <p>
     call themselves clean. We don't do that way here. Everybody calls
    </p>
    <p>
     himself a lady or gentleman, and thinks he is, and don't care what
    </p>
    <p>
     anybody else thinks him, so long as he don't say it out loud. You think
    </p>
    <p>
     there's no difference. You knuckle down and we don't. Ain't that a
    </p>
    <p>
     difference?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It is a difference I hadn't thought of; I admit that. Still--calling
    </p>
    <p>
     one's self a lady doesn't--er--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wouldn't go on if I were you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Howard Tracy turned his head to see who it might be that had introduced
    </p>
    <p>
     this remark. It was a short man about forty years old, with sandy hair,
    </p>
    <p>
     no beard, and a pleasant face badly freckled but alive and intelligent,
    </p>
    <p>
     and he wore slop-shop clothing which was neat but showed wear. He had
    </p>
    <p>
     come from the front room beyond the hall, where he had left his hat, and
    </p>
    <p>
     he had a chipped and cracked white wash-bowl in his hand. The girl came
    </p>
    <p>
     and took the bowl.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll get it for you. You go right ahead and give it to him, Mr. Barrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     He's the new boarder--Mr. Tracy--and I'd just got to where it was
    </p>
    <p>
     getting too deep for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Much obliged if you will, Hattie. I was coming to borrow of the boys.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He sat down at his ease on an old trunk, and said, “I've been listening
    </p>
    <p>
     and got interested; and as I was saying, I wouldn't go on, if I were
    </p>
    <p>
     you. You see where you are coming to, don't you? Calling yourself a lady
    </p>
    <p>
     doesn't elect you; that is what you were going to say; and you saw that
    </p>
    <p>
     if you said it you were going to run right up against another difference
    </p>
    <p>
     that you hadn't thought of: to-wit, Whose right is it to do the
    </p>
    <p>
     electing? Over there, twenty thousand people in a million elect
    </p>
    <p>
     themselves gentlemen and ladies, and the nine hundred and eighty
    </p>
    <p>
     thousand accept that decree and swallow the affront which it puts upon
    </p>
    <p>
     them. Why, if they didn't accept it, it wouldn't be an election, it
    </p>
    <p>
     would be a dead letter and have no force at all. Over here the twenty
    </p>
    <p>
     thousand would-be exclusives come up to the polls and vote themselves
    </p>
    <p>
     to be ladies and gentlemen. But the thing doesn't stop there. The nine
    </p>
    <p>
     hundred and eighty thousand come and vote themselves to be ladies and
    </p>
    <p>
     gentlemen too, and that elects the whole nation. Since the whole million
    </p>
    <p>
     vote themselves ladies and gentlemen, there is no question about that
    </p>
    <p>
     election. It does make absolute equality, and there is no fiction about
    </p>
    <p>
     it; while over yonder the inequality, (by decree of the infinitely
    </p>
    <p>
     feeble, and consent of the infinitely strong,) is also absolute--as real
    </p>
    <p>
     and absolute as our equality.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy had shrunk promptly into his English shell when this speech began,
    </p>
    <p>
     notwithstanding he had now been in severe training several weeks for
    </p>
    <p>
     contact and intercourse with the common herd on the common herd's terms;
    </p>
    <p>
     but he lost no time in pulling himself out again, and so by the time the
    </p>
    <p>
     speech was finished his valves were open once more, and he was forcing
    </p>
    <p>
     himself to accept without resentment the common herd's frank fashion of
    </p>
    <p>
     dropping sociably into other people's conversations unembarrassed and
    </p>
    <p>
     uninvited. The process was not very difficult this time, for the man's
    </p>
    <p>
     smile and voice and manner were persuasive and winning. Tracy would
    </p>
    <p>
     even have liked him on the spot, but for the fact--fact which he was not
    </p>
    <p>
     really aware of--that the equality of men was not yet a reality to him,
    </p>
    <p>
     it was only a theory; the mind perceived, but the man failed to feel it.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was Hattie's ghost over again, merely turned around. Theoretically
    </p>
    <p>
     Barrow was his equal, but it was distinctly distasteful to see him
    </p>
    <p>
     exhibit it. He presently said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “I hope in all sincerity that what you have said is true, as regards the
    </p>
    <p>
     Americans, for doubts have crept into my mind several times. It seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     that the equality must be ungenuine where the sign-names of castes were
    </p>
    <p>
     still in vogue; but those sign-names have certainly lost their offence
    </p>
    <p>
     and are wholly neutralized, nullified and harmless if they are the
    </p>
    <p>
     undisputed property of every individual in the nation. I think I realize
    </p>
    <p>
     that caste does not exist and cannot exist except by common consent of
    </p>
    <p>
     the masses outside of its limits. I thought caste created itself and
    </p>
    <p>
     perpetuated itself; but it seems quite true that it only creates itself,
    </p>
    <p>
     and is perpetuated by the people whom it despises, and who can dissolve
    </p>
    <p>
     it at any time by assuming its mere sign-names themselves.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's what I think. There isn't any power on earth that can prevent
    </p>
    <p>
     England's thirty millions from electing themselves dukes and duchesses
    </p>
    <p>
     to-morrow and calling themselves so. And within six months all the
    </p>
    <p>
     former dukes and duchesses would have retired from the business. I
    </p>
    <p>
     wish they'd try that. Royalty itself couldn't survive such a process.
    </p>
    <p>
     A handful of frowners against thirty million laughers in a state of
    </p>
    <p>
     irruption. Why, it's Herculaneum against Vesuvius; it would take another
    </p>
    <p>
     eighteen centuries to find that Herculaneum after the cataclysm. What's
    </p>
    <p>
     a Colonel in our South? He's a nobody; because they're all colonels down
    </p>
    <p>
     there. No, Tracy” (shudder from Tracy) “nobody in England would call you
    </p>
    <p>
     a gentleman and you wouldn't call yourself one; and I tell you it's
    </p>
    <p>
     a state of things that makes a man put himself into most unbecoming
    </p>
    <p>
     attitudes sometimes--the broad and general recognition and acceptance of
    </p>
    <p>
     caste as caste does, I mean. Makes him do it unconsciously--being bred
    </p>
    <p>
     in him, you see, and never thought over and reasoned out. You couldn't
    </p>
    <p>
     conceive of the Matterhorn being flattered by the notice of one of your
    </p>
    <p>
     comely little English hills, could you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why, no.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, then, let a man in his right mind try to conceive of Darwin
    </p>
    <p>
     feeling flattered by the notice of a princess. It's so grotesque that
    </p>
    <p>
     it--well, it paralyzes the imagination. Yet that Memnon was flattered
    </p>
    <p>
     by the notice of that statuette; he says so--says so himself. The system
    </p>
    <p>
     that can make a god disown his godship and profane it--oh, well, it's
    </p>
    <p>
     all wrong, it's all wrong and ought to be abolished, I should say.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The mention of Darwin brought on a literary discussion, and this topic
    </p>
    <p>
     roused such enthusiasm in Barrow that he took off his coat and made
    </p>
    <p>
     himself the more free and comfortable for it, and detained him so long
    </p>
    <p>
     that he was still at it when the noisy proprietors of the room came
    </p>
    <p>
     shouting and skylarking in and began to romp, scuffle, wash, and
    </p>
    <p>
     otherwise entertain themselves. He lingered yet a little longer to offer
    </p>
    <p>
     the hospitalities of his room and his book shelf to Tracy and ask him a
    </p>
    <p>
     personal question or two:
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is your trade?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “They--well, they call me a cowboy, but that is a fancy. I'm not that. I
    </p>
    <p>
     haven't any trade.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you work at for your living?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, anything--I mean I would work at, anything I could get to do, but
    </p>
    <p>
     thus far I haven't been able to find an occupation.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Maybe I can help you; I'd like to try.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I shall be very glad. I've tried, myself, to weariness.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, of course where a man hasn't a regular trade he's pretty bad off
    </p>
    <p>
     in this world. What you needed, I reckon, was less book learning and
    </p>
    <p>
     more bread-and-butter learning. I don't know what your father could have
    </p>
    <p>
     been thinking of. You ought to have had a trade, you ought to have had a
    </p>
    <p>
     trade, by all means. But never mind about that; we'll stir up something
    </p>
    <p>
     to do, I guess. And don't you get homesick; that's a bad business. We'll
    </p>
    <p>
     talk the thing over and look around a little. You'll come out all right.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wait for me--I'll go down to supper with you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     By this time Tracy had achieved a very friendly feeling for Barrow and
    </p>
    <p>
     would have called him a friend, maybe, if not taken too suddenly on a
    </p>
    <p>
     straight-out requirement to realize on his theories. He was glad of his
    </p>
    <p>
     society, anyway, and was feeling lighter hearted than before. Also he
    </p>
    <p>
     was pretty curious to know what vocation it might be which had furnished
    </p>
    <p>
     Barrow such a large acquaintanceship with books and allowed him so much
    </p>
    <p>
     time to read.

    <p>
     Presently the supper bell began to ring in the depths of the house, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the sound proceeded steadily upward, growing in intensity all the way up
    </p>
    <p>
     towards the upper floors. The higher it came the more maddening was the
    </p>
    <p>
     noise, until at last what it lacked of being absolutely deafening, was
    </p>
    <p>
     made up of the sudden crash and clatter of an avalanche of boarders
    </p>
    <p>
     down the uncarpeted stairway. The peerage did not go to meals in this
    </p>
    <p>
     fashion; Tracy's training had not fitted him to enjoy this hilarious
    </p>
    <p>
     zoological clamor and enthusiasm. He had to confess that there was
    </p>
    <p>
     something about this extraordinary outpouring of animal spirits which he
    </p>
    <p>
     would have to get inured to before he could accept it. No doubt in time
    </p>
    <p>
     he would prefer it; but he wished the process might be modified and made
    </p>
    <p>
     just a little more gradual, and not quite so pronounced and violent.
    </p>
    <p>
     Barrow and Tracy followed the avalanche down through an ever increasing
    </p>
    <p>
     and ever more and more aggressive stench of bygone cabbage and kindred
    </p>
    <p>
     smells; smells which are to be found nowhere but in a cheap private
    </p>
    <p>
     boarding house; smells which once encountered can never be forgotten;
    </p>
    <p>
     smells which encountered generations later are instantly recognizable,
    </p>
    <p>
     but never recognizable with pleasure. To Tracy these odors were
    </p>
    <p>
     suffocating, horrible, almost unendurable; but he held his peace and
    </p>
    <p>
     said nothing. Arrived in the basement, they entered a large dining-room
    </p>
    <p>
     where thirty-five or forty people sat at a long table. They took their
    </p>
    <p>
     places. The feast had already begun and the conversation was going on
    </p>
    <p>
     in the liveliest way from one end of the table to the other. The table
    </p>
    <p>
     cloth was of very coarse material and was liberally spotted with coffee
    </p>
    <p>
     stains and grease. The knives and forks were iron, with bone handles,
    </p>
    <p>
     the spoons appeared to be iron or sheet iron or something of the sort.
    </p>
    <p>
     The tea and coffee cups were of the commonest and heaviest and most
    </p>
    <p>
     durable stone ware. All the furniture of the table was of the commonest
    </p>
    <p>
     and cheapest sort. There was a single large thick slice of bread by each
    </p>
    <p>
     boarder's plate, and it was observable that he economized it as if
    </p>
    <p>
     he were not expecting it to be duplicated. Dishes of butter were
    </p>
    <p>
     distributed along the table within reach of people's arms, if they
    </p>
    <p>
     had long ones, but there were no private butter plates. The butter was
    </p>
    <p>
     perhaps good enough, and was quiet and well behaved; but it had more
    </p>
    <p>
     bouquet than was necessary, though nobody commented upon that fact or
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed in any way disturbed by it. The main feature of the feast was
    </p>
    <p>
     a piping hot Irish stew made of the potatoes and meat left over from a
    </p>
    <p>
     procession of previous meals. Everybody was liberally supplied with
    </p>
    <p>
     this dish. On the table were a couple of great dishes of sliced ham, and
    </p>
    <p>
     there were some other eatables of minor importance--preserves and New
    </p>
    <p>
     Orleans molasses and such things. There was also plenty of tea and
    </p>
    <p>
     coffee of an infernal sort, with brown sugar and condensed milk, but the
    </p>
    <p>
     milk and sugar supply was not left at the discretion of the boarders,
    </p>
    <p>
     but was rationed out at headquarters--one spoonful of sugar and one of
    </p>
    <p>
     condensed milk to each cup and no more. The table was waited upon by two
    </p>
    <p>
     stalwart negro women who raced back and forth from the bases of
    </p>
    <p>
     supplies with splendid dash and clatter and energy. Their labors were
    </p>
    <p>
     supplemented after a fashion by the young girl Puss. She carried
    </p>
    <p>
     coffee and tea back and forth among the boarders, but she made pleasure
    </p>
    <p>
     excursions rather than business ones in this way, to speak strictly. She
    </p>
    <p>
     made jokes with various people. She chaffed the young men pleasantly
    </p>
    <p>
     and wittily, as she supposed, and as the rest also supposed, apparently,
    </p>
    <p>
     judging by the applause and laughter which she got by her efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Manifestly she was a favorite with most of the young fellows and
    </p>
    <p>
     sweetheart of the rest of them. Where she conferred notice she conferred
    </p>
    <p>
     happiness, as was seen by the face of the recipient; and at the same
    </p>
    <p>
     time she conferred unhappiness--one could see it fall and dim the faces
    </p>
    <p>
     of the other young fellows like a shadow. She never “Mistered” these
    </p>
    <p>
     friends of hers, but called them “Billy,” “Tom,” “John,” and they called
    </p>
    <p>
     her “Puss” or “Hattie.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Marsh sat at the head of the table, his wife sat at the foot. Marsh
    </p>
    <p>
     was a man of sixty, and was an American; but if he had been born a
    </p>
    <p>
     month earlier he would have been a Spaniard. He was plenty good enough
    </p>
    <p>
     Spaniard as it was; his face was very dark, his hair very black, and his
    </p>
    <p>
     eyes were not only exceedingly black but were very intense, and there
    </p>
    <p>
     was something about them that indicated that they could burn with
    </p>
    <p>
     passion upon occasion. He was stoop-shouldered and lean-faced, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     general aspect of him was disagreeable; he was evidently not a very
    </p>
    <p>
     companionable person. If looks went for anything, he was the very
    </p>
    <p>
     opposite of his wife, who was all motherliness and charity, good
    </p>
    <p>
     will and good nature. All the young men and the women called her Aunt
    </p>
    <p>
     Rachael, which was another sign. Tracy's wandering and interested
    </p>
    <p>
     eye presently fell upon one boarder who had been overlooked in the
    </p>
    <p>
     distribution of the stew. He was very pale and looked as if he had but
    </p>
    <p>
     lately come out of a sick bed, and also as if he ought to get back into
    </p>
    <p>
     it again as soon as possible. His face was very melancholy. The waves
    </p>
    <p>
     of laughter and conversation broke upon it without affecting it any more
    </p>
    <p>
     than if it had been a rock in the sea and the words and the laughter
    </p>
    <p>
     veritable waters. He held his head down and looked ashamed. Some of the
    </p>
    <p>
     women cast glances of pity toward him from time to time in a furtive
    </p>
    <p>
     and half afraid way, and some of the youngest of the men plainly had
    </p>
    <p>
     compassion on the young fellow--a compassion exhibited in their faces
    </p>
    <p>
     but not in any more active or compromising way. But the great majority
    </p>
    <p>
     of the people present showed entire indifference to the youth and his
    </p>
    <p>
     sorrows. Marsh sat with his head down, but one could catch the malicious
    </p>
    <p>
     gleam of his eyes through his shaggy brows. He was watching that
    </p>
    <p>
     young fellow with evident relish. He had not neglected him through
    </p>
    <p>
     carelessness, and apparently the table understood that fact. The
    </p>
    <p>
     spectacle was making Mrs. Marsh very uncomfortable. She had the look of
    </p>
    <p>
     one who hopes against hope that the impossible may happen. But as the
    </p>
    <p>
     impossible did not happen, she finally ventured to speak up and remind
    </p>
    <p>
     her husband that Nat Brady hadn't been helped to the Irish stew.
    </p>
    <p>
     Marsh lifted his head and gasped out with mock courtliness, “Oh, he
    </p>
    <p>
     hasn't, hasn't he? What a pity that is. I don't know how I came
    </p>
    <p>
     to overlook him. Ah, he must pardon me. You must indeed
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr--er--Baxter--Barker, you must pardon me. I--er--my attention was
    </p>
    <p>
     directed to some other matter, I don't know what. The thing that grieves
    </p>
    <p>
     me mainly is, that it happens every meal now. But you must try to
    </p>
    <p>
     overlook these little things, Mr. Bunker, these little neglects on my
    </p>
    <p>
     part. They're always likely to happen with me in any case, and they are
    </p>
    <p>
     especially likely to happen where a person has--er--well, where a
    </p>
    <p>
     person is, say, about three weeks in arrears for his board. You get my
    </p>
    <p>
     meaning?--you get my idea? Here is your Irish stew, and--er--it gives me
    </p>
    <p>
     the greatest pleasure to send it to you, and I hope that you will enjoy
    </p>
    <p>
     the charity as much as I enjoy conferring it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A blush rose in Brady's white cheeks and flowed slowly backward to his
    </p>
    <p>
     ears and upward toward his forehead, but he said nothing and began to
    </p>
    <p>
     eat his food under the embarrassment of a general silence and the sense
    </p>
    <p>
     that all eyes were fastened upon him. Barrow whispered to Tracy:
    </p>
    <p>
     “The old man's been waiting for that. He wouldn't have missed that
    </p>
    <p>
     chance for anything.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's a brutal business,” said Tracy. Then he said to himself, purposing
    </p>
    <p>
     to set the thought down in his diary later:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, here in this very house is a republic where all are free and
    </p>
    <p>
     equal, if men are free and equal anywhere in the earth, therefore I have
    </p>
    <p>
     arrived at the place I started to find, and I am a man among men, and
    </p>
    <p>
     on the strictest equality possible to men, no doubt. Yet here on the
    </p>
    <p>
     threshold I find an inequality. There are people at this table who are
    </p>
    <p>
     looked up to for some reason or another, and here is a poor devil of a
    </p>
    <p>
     boy who is looked down upon, treated with indifference, and shamed by
    </p>
    <p>
     humiliations, when he has committed no crime but that common one of
    </p>
    <p>
     being poor. Equality ought to make men noble-minded. In fact I had
    </p>
    <p>
     supposed it did do that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     After supper, Barrow proposed a walk, and they started. Barrow had a
    </p>
    <p>
     purpose. He wanted Tracy to get rid of that cowboy hat. He didn't see
    </p>
    <p>
     his way to finding mechanical or manual employment for a person rigged
    </p>
    <p>
     in that fashion. Barrow presently said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “As I understand it, you're not a cowboy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I'm not.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, now if you will not think me too curious, how did you come to
    </p>
    <p>
     mount that hat? Where'd you get it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy didn't know quite how to reply to this, but presently said,
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, without going into particulars, I exchanged clothes with a
    </p>
    <p>
     stranger under stress of weather, and I would like to find him and
    </p>
    <p>
     re-exchange.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, why don't you find him? Where is he?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know. I supposed the best way to find him would be to continue
    </p>
    <p>
     to wear his clothes, which are conspicuous enough to attract his
    </p>
    <p>
     attention if I should meet him on the street.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, very well,” said Barrow, “the rest of the outfit, is well enough,
    </p>
    <p>
     and while it's not too conspicuous, it isn't quite like the clothes
    </p>
    <p>
     that anybody else wears. Suppress the hat. When you meet your man he'll
    </p>
    <p>
     recognize the rest of his suit. That's a mighty embarrassing hat, you
    </p>
    <p>
     know, in a centre of civilization like this. I don't believe an angel
    </p>
    <p>
     could get employment in Washington in a halo like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy agreed to replace the hat with something of a modester form, and
    </p>
    <p>
     they stepped aboard a crowded car and stood with others on the rear
    </p>
    <p>
     platform. Presently, as the car moved swiftly along the rails, two men
    </p>
    <p>
     crossing the street caught sight of the backs of Barrow and Tracy, and
    </p>
    <p>
     both exclaimed at once, “There he is!” It was Sellers and Hawkins.
    </p>
    <p>
     Both were so paralyzed with joy that before they could pull themselves
    </p>
    <p>
     together and make an effort to stop the car, it was gone too far, and
    </p>
    <p>
     they decided to wait for the next one. They waited a while; then
    </p>
    <p>
     it occurred to Washington that there could be no use in chasing one
    </p>
    <p>
     horse-car with another, and he wanted to hunt up a hack. But the Colonel
    </p>
    <p>
     said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “When you come to think of it, there's no occasion for that at all. Now
    </p>
    <p>
     that I've got him materialized, I can command his motions. I'll have him
    </p>
    <p>
     at the house by the time we get there.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Then they hurried off home in a state of great and joyful excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hat exchange accomplished, the two new friends started to walk back
    </p>
    <p>
     leisurely to the boarding house. Barrow's mind was full of curiosity
    </p>
    <p>
     about this young fellow. He said,
    </p>
    <p>
     “You've never been to the Rocky Mountains?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You've never been out on the plains?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How long have you been in this country?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Only a few days.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You've never been in America before?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Barrow communed with himself. “Now what odd shapes the notions of
    </p>
    <p>
     romantic people take. Here's a young fellow who's read in England about
    </p>
    <p>
     cowboys and adventures on the plains. He comes here and buys a
    </p>
    <p>
     cowboy's suit. Thinks he can play himself on folks for a cowboy, all
    </p>
    <p>
     inexperienced as he is. Now the minute he's caught in this poor little
    </p>
    <p>
     game, he's ashamed of it and ready to retire from it. It is that
    </p>
    <p>
     exchange that he has put up as an explanation. It's rather thin, too
    </p>
    <p>
     thin altogether. Well, he's young, never been anywhere, knows nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     about the world, sentimental, no doubt. Perhaps it was the natural
    </p>
    <p>
     thing for him to do, but it was a most singular choice, curious freak,
    </p>
    <p>
     altogether.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Both men were busy with their thoughts for a time, then Tracy heaved a
    </p>
    <p>
     sigh and said,
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mr. Barrow, the case of that young fellow troubles me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You mean Nat Brady?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, Brady, or Baxter, or whatever it was. The old landlord called him
    </p>
    <p>
     by several different names.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, yes, he has been very liberal with names for Brady, since Brady
    </p>
    <p>
     fell into arrears for his board. Well, that's one of his sarcasms--the
    </p>
    <p>
     old man thinks he's great on sarcasm.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, what is Brady's difficulty? What is Brady--who is he?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Brady is a tinner. He's a young journeyman tinner who was getting along
    </p>
    <p>
     all right till he fell sick and lost his job. He was very popular before
    </p>
    <p>
     he lost his job; everybody in the house liked Brady. The old man was
    </p>
    <p>
     rather especially fond of him, but you know that when a man loses his
    </p>
    <p>
     job and loses his ability to support himself and to pay his way as he
    </p>
    <p>
     goes, it makes a great difference in the way people look at him and feel
    </p>
    <p>
     about him.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is that so! Is it so?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Barrow looked at Tracy in a puzzled way. “Why of course it's so.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wouldn't you know that, naturally. Don't you know that the wounded deer
    </p>
    <p>
     is always attacked and killed by its companions and friends?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy said to himself, while a chilly and boding discomfort spread
    </p>
    <p>
     itself through his system, “In a republic of deer and men where all
    </p>
    <p>
     are free and equal, misfortune is a crime, and the prosperous gore the
    </p>
    <p>
     unfortunate to death.” Then he said aloud, “Here in the boarding house,
    </p>
    <p>
     if one would have friends and be popular instead of having the cold
    </p>
    <p>
     shoulder turned upon him, he must be prosperous.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes,” Barrow said, “that is so. It's their human nature. They do turn
    </p>
    <p>
     against Brady, now that he's unfortunate, and they don't like him as
    </p>
    <p>
     well as they did before; but it isn't because of any lack in Brady--he's
    </p>
    <p>
     just as he was before, has the same nature and the same impulses, but
    </p>
    <p>
     they--well, Brady is a thorn in their consciences, you see. They know
    </p>
    <p>
     they ought to help him and they're too stingy to do it, and they're
    </p>
    <p>
     ashamed of themselves for that, and they ought also to hate themselves
    </p>
    <p>
     on that account, but instead of that they hate Brady because he makes
    </p>
    <p>
     them ashamed of themselves. I say that's human nature; that occurs
    </p>
    <p>
     everywhere; this boarding house is merely the world in little, it's
    </p>
    <p>
     the case all over--they're all alike. In prosperity we are popular;
    </p>
    <p>
     popularity comes easy in that case, but when the other thing comes our
    </p>
    <p>
     friends are pretty likely to turn against us.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy's noble theories and high purposes were beginning to feel pretty
    </p>
    <p>
     damp and clammy. He wondered if by any possibility he had made a mistake
    </p>
    <p>
     in throwing his own prosperity to the winds and taking up the cross
    </p>
    <p>
     of other people's unprosperity. But he wouldn't listen to that sort of
    </p>
    <p>
     thing; he cast it out of his mind and resolved to go ahead resolutely
    </p>
    <p>
     along the course he had mapped out for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Extracts from his diary:
    </p>
    <p>
     Have now spent several days in this singular hive. I don't know quite
    </p>
    <p>
     what to make out of these people. They have merits and virtues, but they
    </p>
    <p>
     have some other qualities, and some ways that are hard to get along
    </p>
    <p>
     with. I can't enjoy them. The moment I appeared in a hat of the period,
    </p>
    <p>
     I noticed a change. The respect which had been paid me before, passed
    </p>
    <p>
     suddenly away, and the people became friendly--more than that--they
    </p>
    <p>
     became familiar, and I'm not used to familiarity, and can't take to it
    </p>
    <p>
     right off; I find that out. These people's familiarity amounts to
    </p>
    <p>
     impudence, sometimes. I suppose it's all right; no doubt I can get used
    </p>
    <p>
     to it, but it's not a satisfactory process at all. I have accomplished
    </p>
    <p>
     my dearest wish, I am a man among men, on an equal footing with Tom,
    </p>
    <p>
     Dick and Harry, and yet it isn't just exactly what I thought it was
    </p>
    <p>
     going to be. I--I miss home. Am obliged to say I am homesick. Another
    </p>
    <p>
     thing--and this is a confession--a reluctant one, but I will make it:
    </p>
    <p>
     The thing I miss most and most severely, is the respect, the deference,
    </p>
    <p>
     with which I was treated all my life in England, and which seems to be
    </p>
    <p>
     somehow necessary to me. I get along very well without the luxury and
    </p>
    <p>
     the wealth and the sort of society I've been accustomed to, but I do
    </p>
    <p>
     miss the respect and can't seem to get reconciled to the absence of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is respect, there is deference here, but it doesn't fall to my
    </p>
    <p>
     share. It is lavished on two men. One of them is a portly man of middle
    </p>
    <p>
     age who is a retired plumber. Everybody is pleased to have that man's
    </p>
    <p>
     notice. He's full of pomp and circumstance and self complacency and bad
    </p>
    <p>
     grammar, and at table he is Sir Oracle and when he opens his mouth not
    </p>
    <p>
     any dog in the kennel barks. The other person is a policeman at the
    </p>
    <p>
     capitol-building. He represents the government. The deference paid to
    </p>
    <p>
     these two men is not so very far short of that paid to an earl in
    </p>
    <p>
     England, though the method of it differs. Not so much courtliness, but
    </p>
    <p>
     the deference is all there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, and there is obsequiousness, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     It does rather look as if in a republic where all are free and equal,
    </p>
    <p>
     prosperity and position constitute rank.

    <p>
     The days drifted by, and they grew ever more dreary. For Barrow's
    </p>
    <p>
     efforts to find work for Tracy were unavailing. Always the first
    </p>
    <p>
     question asked was, “What Union do you belong to?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy was obliged to reply that he didn't belong to any trade-union.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Very well, then, it's impossible to employ you. My men wouldn't stay
    </p>
    <p>
     with me if I should employ a 'scab,' or 'rat,'” or whatever the phrase
    </p>
    <p>
     was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, Tracy had a happy thought. He said, “Why the thing for me to
    </p>
    <p>
     do, of course, is to join a trade-union.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes,” Barrow said, “that is the thing for you to do--if you can.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “If I can? Is it difficult?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, Yes,” Barrow said, “it's sometimes difficult--in fact, very
    </p>
    <p>
     difficult. But you can try, and of course it will be best to try.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Therefore Tracy tried; but he did not succeed. He was refused admission
    </p>
    <p>
     with a good deal of promptness, and was advised to go back home, where
    </p>
    <p>
     he belonged, not come here taking honest men's bread out of their
    </p>
    <p>
     mouths. Tracy began to realize that the situation was desperate, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     thought made him cold to the marrow. He said to himself, “So there is
    </p>
    <p>
     an aristocracy of position here, and an aristocracy of prosperity, and
    </p>
    <p>
     apparently there is also an aristocracy of the ins as opposed to the
    </p>
    <p>
     outs, and I am with the outs. So the ranks grow daily, here. Plainly
    </p>
    <p>
     there are all kinds of castes here and only one that I belong to, the
    </p>
    <p>
     outcasts.” But he couldn't even smile at his small joke, although he
    </p>
    <p>
     was obliged to confess that he had a rather good opinion of it. He was
    </p>
    <p>
     feeling so defeated and miserable by this time that he could no longer
    </p>
    <p>
     look with philosophical complacency on the horseplay of the young
    </p>
    <p>
     fellows in the upper rooms at night. At first it had been pleasant to
    </p>
    <p>
     see them unbend and have a good time after having so well earned it by
    </p>
    <p>
     the labors of the day, but now it all rasped upon his feelings and his
    </p>
    <p>
     dignity. He lost patience with the spectacle. When they were feeling
    </p>
    <p>
     good, they shouted, they scuffled, they sang songs, they romped about
    </p>
    <p>
     the place like cattle, and they generally wound up with a pillow fight,
    </p>
    <p>
     in which they banged each other over the head, and threw the pillows in
    </p>
    <p>
     all directions, and every now and then he got a buffet himself; and they
    </p>
    <p>
     were always inviting him to join in. They called him “Johnny Bull,” and
    </p>
    <p>
     invited him with excessive familiarity to take a hand. At first he had
    </p>
    <p>
     endured all this with good nature, but latterly he had shown by his
    </p>
    <p>
     manner that it was distinctly distasteful to him, and very soon he saw a
    </p>
    <p>
     change in the manner of these young people toward him. They were souring
    </p>
    <p>
     on him as they would have expressed it in their language. He had never
    </p>
    <p>
     been what might be called popular. That was hardly the phrase for it; he
    </p>
    <p>
     had merely been liked, but now dislike for him was growing. His case
    </p>
    <p>
     was not helped by the fact that he was out of luck, couldn't get work,
    </p>
    <p>
     didn't belong to a union, and couldn't gain admission to one. He got a
    </p>
    <p>
     good many slights of that small ill-defined sort that you can't quite
    </p>
    <p>
     put your finger on, and it was manifest that there was only one thing
    </p>
    <p>
     which protected him from open insult, and that was his muscle. These
    </p>
    <p>
     young people had seen him exercising, mornings, after his cold sponge
    </p>
    <p>
     bath, and they had perceived by his performance and the build of his
    </p>
    <p>
     body, that he was athletic, and also versed in boxing. He felt pretty
    </p>
    <p>
     naked now, recognizing that he was shorn of all respect except respect
    </p>
    <p>
     for his fists. One night when he entered his room he found about a
    </p>
    <p>
     dozen of the young fellows there carrying on a very lively conversation
    </p>
    <p>
     punctuated with horse-laughter. The talking ceased instantly, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     frank affront of a dead silence followed. He said,
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good evening gentlemen,” and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was no response. He flushed to the temples but forced himself
    </p>
    <p>
     to maintain silence. He sat there in this uncomfortable stillness some
    </p>
    <p>
     time, then got up and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment he had disappeared he heard a prodigious shout of laughter
    </p>
    <p>
     break forth. He saw that their plain purpose had been to insult him.
    </p>
    <p>
     He ascended to the flat roof, hoping to be able to cool down his spirit
    </p>
    <p>
     there and get back his tranquility. He found the young tinner up there,
    </p>
    <p>
     alone and brooding, and entered into conversation with him. They were
    </p>
    <p>
     pretty fairly matched, now, in unpopularity and general ill-luck and
    </p>
    <p>
     misery, and they had no trouble in meeting upon this common ground with
    </p>
    <p>
     advantage and something of comfort to both. But Tracy's movements had
    </p>
    <p>
     been watched, and in a few minutes the tormentors came straggling one
    </p>
    <p>
     after another to the roof, where they began to stroll up and down in an
    </p>
    <p>
     apparently purposeless way. But presently they fell to dropping remarks
    </p>
    <p>
     that were evidently aimed at Tracy, and some of them at the tinner.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ringleader of this little mob was a short-haired bully and amateur
    </p>
    <p>
     prize-fighter named Allen, who was accustomed to lording it over the
    </p>
    <p>
     upper floor, and had more than once shown a disposition to make trouble
    </p>
    <p>
     with Tracy. Now there was an occasional cat-call, and hootings, and
    </p>
    <p>
     whistlings, and finally the diversion of an exchange of connected
    </p>
    <p>
     remarks was introduced:
    </p>
    <p>
     “How many does it take to make a pair?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, two generally makes a pair, but sometimes there ain't stuff
    </p>
    <p>
     enough in them to make a whole pair.” General laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What were you saying about the English a while ago?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, nothing, the English are all right, only--I--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What was it you said about them?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, I only said they swallow well.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Swallow better than other people?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, yes, the English swallow a good deal better than other people.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is it they swallow best?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, insults.” Another general laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Pretty hard to make 'em fight, ain't it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, taint hard to make 'em fight.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ain't it, really?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, taint hard. It's impossible.” Another laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This one's kind of spiritless, that's certain.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Couldn't be the other way--in his case.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't you know the secret of his birth?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No! has he got a secret of his birth?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You bet he has.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “His father was a wax-figger.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Allen came strolling by where the pair were sitting; stopped, and said
    </p>
    <p>
     to the tinner;
    </p>
    <p>
     “How are you off for friends, these days?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well enough off.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Got a good many?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, as many as I need.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “A friend is valuable, sometimes--as a protector, you know. What do you
    </p>
    <p>
     reckon would happen if I was to snatch your cap off and slap you in the
    </p>
    <p>
     face with it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please don't trouble me, Mr. Allen, I ain't doing anything to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You answer me! What do you reckon would happen?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I don't know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy spoke up with a good deal of deliberation and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't trouble the young fellow, I can tell you what would happen.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, you can, can you? Boys, Johnny Bull can tell us what would happen
    </p>
    <p>
     if I was to snatch this chump's cap off and slap him in the face with
    </p>
    <p>
     it. Now you'll see.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He snatched the cap and struck the youth in the face, and before he
    </p>
    <p>
     could inquire what was going to happen, it had already happened, and he
    </p>
    <p>
     was warming the tin with the broad of his back. Instantly there was a
    </p>
    <p>
     rush, and shouts of:
    </p>
    <p>
     “A ring, a ring, make a ring! Fair play all round! Johnny's grit; give
    </p>
    <p>
     him a chance.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The ring was quickly chalked on the tin, and Tracy found himself as
    </p>
    <p>
     eager to begin as he could have been if his antagonist had been a prince
    </p>
    <p>
     instead of a mechanic. At bottom he was a little surprised at this,
    </p>
    <p>
     because although his theories had been all in that direction for some
    </p>
    <p>
     time, he was not prepared to find himself actually eager to measure
    </p>
    <p>
     strength with quite so common a man as this ruffian. In a moment all the
    </p>
    <p>
     windows in the neighborhood were filled with people, and the roofs also.
    </p>
    <p>
     The men squared off, and the fight began. But Allen stood no chance
    </p>
    <p>
     whatever, against the young Englishman. Neither in muscle nor in science
    </p>
    <p>
     was he his equal. He measured his length on the tin time and again; in
    </p>
    <p>
     fact, as fast as he could get up he went down again, and the applause
    </p>
    <p>
     was kept up in liberal fashion from all the neighborhood around.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, Allen had to be helped up. Then Tracy declined to punish him
    </p>
    <p>
     further and the fight was at an end. Allen was carried off by some of
    </p>
    <p>
     his friends in a very much humbled condition, his face black and blue
    </p>
    <p>
     and bleeding, and Tracy was at once surrounded by the young fellows,
    </p>
    <p>
     who congratulated him, and told him that he had done the whole house
    </p>
    <p>
     a service, and that from this out Mr. Allen would be a little more
    </p>
    <p>
     particular about how he handled slights and insults and maltreatment
    </p>
    <p>
     around amongst the boarders.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy was a hero now, and exceedingly popular. Perhaps nobody had
    </p>
    <p>
     ever been quite so popular on that upper floor before. But if being
    </p>
    <p>
     discountenanced by these young fellows had been hard to bear, their
    </p>
    <p>
     lavish commendations and approval and hero-worship were harder still to
    </p>
    <p>
     endure. He felt degraded, but he did not allow himself to analyze the
    </p>
    <p>
     reasons why, too closely. He was content to satisfy himself with
    </p>
    <p>
     the suggestion that he looked upon himself as degraded by the public
    </p>
    <p>
     spectacle which he had made of himself, fighting on a tin roof, for the
    </p>
    <p>
     delectation of everybody a block or two around. But he wasn't entirely
    </p>
    <p>
     satisfied with that explanation of it. Once he went a little too far
    </p>
    <p>
     and wrote in his diary that his case was worse than that of the prodigal
    </p>
    <p>
     son. He said the prodigal son merely fed swine, he didn't have to chum
    </p>
    <p>
     with them. But he struck that out, and said “All men are equal. I will
    </p>
    <p>
     not disown my principles. These men are as good as I am.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy was become popular on the lower floors also. Everybody was
    </p>
    <p>
     grateful for Allen's reduction to the ranks, and for his transformation
    </p>
    <p>
     from a doer of outrages to a mere threatener of them. The young girls,
    </p>
    <p>
     of whom there were half a dozen, showed many attentions to Tracy,
    </p>
    <p>
     particularly that boarding house pet Hattie, the landlady's daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
     She said to him, very sweetly,
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think you're ever so nice.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And when he said, “I'm glad you think so, Miss Hattie,” she said, still
    </p>
    <p>
     more sweetly,
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't call me Miss Hattie--call me Puss.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Ah, here was promotion! He had struck the summit. There were no higher
    </p>
    <p>
     heights to climb in that boarding house. His popularity was complete.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the presence of people, Tracy showed a tranquil outside, but his
    </p>
    <p>
     heart was being eaten out of him by distress and despair.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a little while he should be out of money, and then what should he do?
    </p>
    <p>
     He wished, now, that he had borrowed a little more liberally from that
    </p>
    <p>
     stranger's store. He found it impossible to sleep. A single torturing,
    </p>
    <p>
     terrifying thought went racking round and round in his head, wearing a
    </p>
    <p>
     groove in his brain: What should he do--What was to become of him? And
    </p>
    <p>
     along with it began to intrude a something presently which was very like
    </p>
    <p>
     a wish that he had not joined the great and noble ranks of martyrdom,
    </p>
    <p>
     but had stayed at home and been content to be merely an earl and nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     better, with nothing more to do in this world of a useful sort than an
    </p>
    <p>
     earl finds to do. But he smothered that part of his thought as well as
    </p>
    <p>
     he could; he made every effort to drive it away, and with fair success,
    </p>
    <p>
     but he couldn't keep it from intruding a little now and then, and when
    </p>
    <p>
     it intruded it came suddenly and nipped him like a bite, a sting, a
    </p>
    <p>
     burn. He recognized that thought by the peculiar sharpness of its pang.
    </p>
    <p>
     The others were painful enough, but that one cut to the quick when
    </p>
    <p>
     it came. Night after night he lay tossing to the music of the hideous
    </p>
    <p>
     snoring of the honest bread-winners until two and three o'clock in the
    </p>
    <p>
     morning, then got up and took refuge on the roof, where he sometimes got
    </p>
    <p>
     a nap and sometimes failed entirely. His appetite was leaving him and
    </p>
    <p>
     the zest of life was going along with it. Finally, one day, being near
    </p>
    <p>
     the imminent verge of total discouragement, he said to himself--and took
    </p>
    <p>
     occasion to blush privately when he said it, “If my father knew what my
    </p>
    <p>
     American name is,--he--well, my duty to my father rather requires that
    </p>
    <p>
     I furnish him my name. I have no right to make his days and nights
    </p>
    <p>
     unhappy, I can do enough unhappiness for the family all by myself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Really he ought to know what my American name is.” He thought over it a
    </p>
    <p>
     while and framed a cablegram in his mind to this effect:
    </p>
    <p>
     “My American name is Howard Tracy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     That wouldn't be suggesting anything. His father could understand that
    </p>
    <p>
     as he chose, and doubtless he would understand it as it was meant, as
    </p>
    <p>
     a dutiful and affectionate desire on the part of a son to make his old
    </p>
    <p>
     father happy for a moment. Continuing his train of thought, Tracy said
    </p>
    <p>
     to himself, “Ah, but if he should cable me to come home! I--I--couldn't
    </p>
    <p>
     do that--I mustn't do that. I've started out on a mission, and I
    </p>
    <p>
     mustn't turn my back on it in cowardice. No, no, I couldn't go home,
    </p>
    <p>
     at--at--least I shouldn't want to go home.” After a reflective pause:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, maybe--perhaps--it would be my duty to go in the circumstances;
    </p>
    <p>
     he's very old and he does need me by him to stay his footsteps down the
    </p>
    <p>
     long hill that inclines westward toward the sunset of his life. Well,
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll think about that. Yes, of course it wouldn't be right to stay here.
    </p>
    <p>
     If I--well, perhaps I could just drop him a line and put it off a little
    </p>
    <p>
     while and satisfy him in that way. It would be--well, it would mar
    </p>
    <p>
     everything to have him require me to come instantly.” Another reflective
    </p>
    <p>
     pause--then: “And yet if he should do that I don't know but--oh, dear
    </p>
    <p>
     me--home! how good it sounds! and a body is excusable for wanting to see
    </p>
    <p>
     his home again, now and then, anyway.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He went to one of the telegraph offices in the avenue and got the first
    </p>
    <p>
     end of what Barrow called the “usual Washington courtesy,” where “they
    </p>
    <p>
     treat you as a tramp until they find out you're a congressman, and then
    </p>
    <p>
     they slobber all over you.” There was a boy of seventeen on duty there,
    </p>
    <p>
     tying his shoe. He had his foot on a chair and his back turned toward
    </p>
    <p>
     the wicket. He glanced over his shoulder, took Tracy's measure, turned
    </p>
    <p>
     back, and went on tying his shoe. Tracy finished writing his telegram
    </p>
    <p>
     and waited, still waited, and still waited, for that performance to
    </p>
    <p>
     finish, but there didn't seem to be any finish to it; so finally Tracy
    </p>
    <p>
     said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can't you take my telegram?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The youth looked over his shoulder and said, by his manner, not his
    </p>
    <p>
     words:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't you think you could wait a minute, if you tried?”
    </p>
    <p>
     However, he got the shoe tied at last, and came and took the telegram,
    </p>
    <p>
     glanced over it, then looked up surprised, at Tracy. There was something
    </p>
    <p>
     in his look that bordered upon respect, almost reverence, it seemed to
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy, although he had been so long without anything of this kind he was
    </p>
    <p>
     not sure that he knew the signs of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The boy read the address aloud, with pleased expression in face and
    </p>
    <p>
     voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The Earl of Rossmore! Cracky! Do you know him?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is that so! Does he know you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well--yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I swear! Will he answer you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think he will.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Will he though? Where'll you have it sent?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, nowhere. I'll call here and get it. When shall I call?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, I don't know--I'll send it to you. Where shall I send it? Give me
    </p>
    <p>
     your address; I'll send it to you soon's it comes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     But Tracy didn't propose to do this. He had acquired the boy's
    </p>
    <p>
     admiration and deferential respect, and he wasn't willing to throw these
    </p>
    <p>
     precious things away, a result sure to follow if he should give the
    </p>
    <p>
     address of that boarding house. So he said again that he would call and
    </p>
    <p>
     get the telegram, and went his way.
    </p>
    <p>
     He idled along, reflecting. He said to himself, “There is something
    </p>
    <p>
     pleasant about being respected. I have acquired the respect of Mr. Allen
    </p>
    <p>
     and some of those others, and almost the deference of some of them on
    </p>
    <p>
     pure merit, for having thrashed Allen. While their respect and their
    </p>
    <p>
     deference--if it is deference--is pleasant, a deference based upon a
    </p>
    <p>
     sham, a shadow, does really seem pleasanter still. It's no real merit to
    </p>
    <p>
     be in correspondence with an earl, and yet after all, that boy makes me
    </p>
    <p>
     feel as if there was.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The cablegram was actually gone home! the thought of it gave him an
    </p>
    <p>
     immense uplift. He walked with a lighter tread. His heart was full of
    </p>
    <p>
     happiness. He threw aside all hesitances and confessed to himself
    </p>
    <p>
     that he was glad through and through that he was going to give up this
    </p>
    <p>
     experiment and go back to his home again. His eagerness to get his
    </p>
    <p>
     father's answer began to grow, now, and it grew with marvelous celerity,
    </p>
    <p>
     after it began. He waited an hour, walking about, putting in his time as
    </p>
    <p>
     well as he could, but interested in nothing that came under his eye, and
    </p>
    <p>
     at last he presented himself at the office again and asked if any answer
    </p>
    <p>
     had come yet. The boy said,
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, no answer yet,” then glanced at the clock and added, “I don't think
    </p>
    <p>
     it's likely you'll get one to-day.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why not?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, you see it's getting pretty late. You can't always tell where
    </p>
    <p>
     'bouts a man is when he's on the other side, and you can't always find
    </p>
    <p>
     him just the minute you want him, and you see it's getting about six
    </p>
    <p>
     o'clock now, and over there it's pretty late at night.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why yes,” said Tracy, “I hadn't thought of that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, pretty late, now, half past ten or eleven. Oh yes, you probably
    </p>
    <p>
     won't get any answer to-night.”
    </p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>
     CHAPTER XIV.
    </head>
    <p>
     So Tracy went home to supper. The odors in that supper room seemed more
    </p>
    <p>
     strenuous and more horrible than ever before, and he was happy in the
    </p>
    <p>
     thought that he was so soon to be free from them again. When the supper
    </p>
    <p>
     was over he hardly knew whether he had eaten any of it or not, and
    </p>
    <p>
     he certainly hadn't heard any of the conversation. His heart had been
    </p>
    <p>
     dancing all the time, his thoughts had been faraway from these things,
    </p>
    <p>
     and in the visions of his mind the sumptuous appointments of his
    </p>
    <p>
     father's castle had risen before him without rebuke. Even the plushed
    </p>
    <p>
     flunkey, that walking symbol of a sham inequality, had not been
    </p>
    <p>
     unpleasant to his dreaming view. After the meal Barrow said,
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come with me. I'll give you a jolly evening.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Very good. Where are you going?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “To my club.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What club is that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mechanics' Debating Club.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy shuddered, slightly. He didn't say anything about having visited
    </p>
    <p>
     that place himself. Somehow he didn't quite relish the memory of that
    </p>
    <p>
     time. The sentiments which had made his former visit there so enjoyable,
    </p>
    <p>
     and filled him with such enthusiasm, had undergone a gradual change,
    </p>
    <p>
     and they had rotted away to such a degree that he couldn't contemplate
    </p>
    <p>
     another visit there with anything strongly resembling delight. In fact
    </p>
    <p>
     he was a little ashamed to go; he didn't want to go there and find out
    </p>
    <p>
     by the rude impact of the thought of those people upon his reorganized
    </p>
    <p>
     condition of mind, how sharp the change had been. He would have
    </p>
    <p>
     preferred to stay away. He expected that now he should hear nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     except sentiments which would be a reproach to him in his changed mental
    </p>
    <p>
     attitude, and he rather wished he might be excused. And yet he didn't
    </p>
    <p>
     quite want to say that, he didn't want to show how he did feel, or show
    </p>
    <p>
     any disinclination to go, and so he forced himself to go along with
    </p>
    <p>
     Barrow, privately purposing to take an early opportunity to get away.
    </p>
    <p>
     After the essayist of the evening had read his paper, the chairman
    </p>
    <p>
     announced that the debate would now be upon the subject of the previous
    </p>
    <p>
     meeting, “The American Press.” It saddened the backsliding disciple to
    </p>
    <p>
     hear this announcement. It brought up too many reminiscences. He wished
    </p>
    <p>
     he had happened upon some other subject. But the debate began, and he
    </p>
    <p>
     sat still and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the course of the discussion one of the speakers--a blacksmith named
    </p>
    <p>
     Tompkins arraigned all monarchs and all lords in the earth for their
    </p>
    <p>
     cold selfishness in retaining their unearned dignities. He said that no
    </p>
    <p>
     monarch and no son of a monarch, no lord and no son of a lord ought
    </p>
    <p>
     to be able to look his fellow man in the face without shame. Shame for
    </p>
    <p>
     consenting to keep his unearned titles, property, and privileges--at the
    </p>
    <p>
     expense of other people; shame for consenting to remain, on any terms,
    </p>
    <p>
     in dishonourable possession of these things, which represented bygone
    </p>
    <p>
     robberies and wrongs inflicted upon the general people of the nation. He
    </p>
    <p>
     said, “if there were a lord or the son of a lord here, I would like
    </p>
    <p>
     to reason with him, and try to show him how unfair and how selfish his
    </p>
    <p>
     position is. I would try to persuade him to relinquish it, take his
    </p>
    <p>
     place among men on equal terms, earn the bread he eats, and hold of
    </p>
    <p>
     slight value all deference paid him because of artificial position, all
    </p>
    <p>
     reverence not the just due of his own personal merits.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy seemed to be listening to utterances of his own made in talks
    </p>
    <p>
     with his radical friends in England. It was as if some eavesdropping
    </p>
    <p>
     phonograph had treasured up his words and brought them across the
    </p>
    <p>
     Atlantic to accuse him with them in the hour of his defection and
    </p>
    <p>
     retreat. Every word spoken by this stranger seemed to leave a blister on
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy's conscience, and by the time the speech was finished he felt that
    </p>
    <p>
     he was all conscience and one blister. This man's deep compassion for
    </p>
    <p>
     the enslaved and oppressed millions in Europe who had to bear with the
    </p>
    <p>
     contempt of that small class above them, throned upon shining heights
    </p>
    <p>
     whose paths were shut against them, was the very thing he had often
    </p>
    <p>
     uttered himself. The pity in this man's voice and words was the very
    </p>
    <p>
     twin of the pity that used to reside in his own heart and come from his
    </p>
    <p>
     own lips when he thought of these oppressed peoples.
    </p>
    <p>
     The homeward tramp was accomplished in brooding silence. It was a
    </p>
    <p>
     silence most grateful to Tracy's feelings. He wouldn't have broken it
    </p>
    <p>
     for anything; for he was ashamed of himself all the way through to his
    </p>
    <p>
     spine. He kept saying to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
     “How unanswerable it all is--how absolutely unanswerable! It is basely,
    </p>
    <p>
     degradingly selfish to keep those unearned honors, and--and--oh, hang
    </p>
    <p>
     it, nobody but a cur--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What an idiotic damned speech that Tompkins made!”
    </p>
    <p>
     This outburst was from Barrow. It flooded Tracy's demoralized soul
    </p>
    <p>
     with waters of refreshment. These were the darlingest words the poor
    </p>
    <p>
     vacillating young apostate had ever heard--for they whitewashed his
    </p>
    <p>
     shame for him, and that is a good service to have when you can't get the
    </p>
    <p>
     best of all verdicts, self-acquittal.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come up to my room and smoke a pipe, Tracy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy had been expecting this invitation, and had had his declination
    </p>
    <p>
     all ready: but he was glad enough to accept, now. Was it possible that a
    </p>
    <p>
     reasonable argument could be made against that man's desolating speech?
    </p>
    <p>
     He was burning to hear Barrow try it. He knew how to start him, and keep
    </p>
    <p>
     him going: it was to seem to combat his positions--a process effective
    </p>
    <p>
     with most people.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is it you object to in Tompkins's speech, Barrow?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, the leaving out of the factor of human nature; requiring another
    </p>
    <p>
     man to do what you wouldn't do yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you mean--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why here's what I mean; it's very simple. Tompkins is a blacksmith; has
    </p>
    <p>
     a family; works for wages; and hard, too--fooling around won't furnish
    </p>
    <p>
     the bread. Suppose it should turn out that by the death of somebody in
    </p>
    <p>
     England he is suddenly an earl--income, half a million dollars a year.
    </p>
    <p>
     What would he do?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I--I suppose he would have to decline to--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Man, he would grab it in a second!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you really think he would?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Think?--I don't think anything about it, I know it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why? Because he's not a fool.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “So you think that if he were a fool, he--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I don't. Fool or no fool, he would grab it. Anybody would. Anybody
    </p>
    <p>
     that's alive. And I've seen dead people that would get up and go for it.
    </p>
    <p>
     I would myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
     This was balm, this was healing, this was rest and peace and comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But I thought you were opposed to nobilities.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Transmissible ones, yes. But that's nothing. I'm opposed to
    </p>
    <p>
     millionaires, but it would be dangerous to offer me the position.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You'd take it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I would leave the funeral of my dearest enemy to go and assume its
    </p>
    <p>
     burdens and responsibilities.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy thought a while, then said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know that I quite get the bearings of your position. You say
    </p>
    <p>
     you are opposed to hereditary nobilities, and yet if you had the chance
    </p>
    <p>
     you would--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Take one? In a minute I would. And there isn't a mechanic in that
    </p>
    <p>
     entire club that wouldn't. There isn't a lawyer, doctor, editor, author,
    </p>
    <p>
     tinker, loafer, railroad president, saint--land, there isn't a human
    </p>
    <p>
     being in the United States that wouldn't jump at the chance!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Except me,” said Tracy softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Except you!” Barrow could hardly get the words out, his scorn so choked
    </p>
    <p>
     him. And he couldn't get any further than that form of words; it seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     to dam his flow, utterly. He got up and came and glared upon Tracy in a
    </p>
    <p>
     kind of outraged and unappeasable way, and said again, “Except you!”
    </p>
    <p>
     He walked around him--inspecting him from one point of view and then
    </p>
    <p>
     another, and relieving his soul now and then by exploding that formula
    </p>
    <p>
     at him; “Except you!” Finally he slumped down into his chair with the
    </p>
    <p>
     air of one who gives it up, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “He's straining his viscera and he's breaking his heart trying to get
    </p>
    <p>
     some low-down job that a good dog wouldn't have, and yet wants to let
    </p>
    <p>
     on that if he had a chance to scoop an earldom he wouldn't do it. Tracy,
    </p>
    <p>
     don't put this kind of a strain on me. Lately I'm not as strong as I
    </p>
    <p>
     was.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I wasn't meaning to put--a strain on you, Barrow, I was only
    </p>
    <p>
     meaning to intimate that if an earldom ever does fall in my way--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “There--I wouldn't give myself any worry about that, if I was you. And
    </p>
    <p>
     besides, I can settle what you would do. Are you any different from me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well--no.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you any better than me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “O,--er--why, certainly not.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you as good? Come!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Indeed, I--the fact is you take me so suddenly--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Suddenly? What is there sudden about it? It isn't a difficult question
    </p>
    <p>
     is it? Or doubtful? Just measure us on the only fair lines--the lines
    </p>
    <p>
     of merit--and of course you'll admit that a journeyman chairmaker
    </p>
    <p>
     that earns his twenty dollars a week, and has had the good and genuine
    </p>
    <p>
     culture of contact with men, and care, and hardship, and failure, and
    </p>
    <p>
     success, and downs and ups and ups and downs, is just a trifle the
    </p>
    <p>
     superior of a young fellow like you, who doesn't know how to do anything
    </p>
    <p>
     that's valuable, can't earn his living in any secure and steady way,
    </p>
    <p>
     hasn't had any experience of life and its seriousness, hasn't any
    </p>
    <p>
     culture but the artificial culture of books, which adorns but doesn't
    </p>
    <p>
     really educate--come! if I wouldn't scorn an earldom, what the devil
    </p>
    <p>
     right have you to do it!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy dissembled his joy, though he wanted to thank the chair-maker
    </p>
    <p>
     for that last remark. Presently a thought struck him, and he spoke up
    </p>
    <p>
     briskly and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “But look here, I really can't quite get the hang of your notions--your
    </p>
    <p>
     principles, if they are principles. You are inconsistent. You are
    </p>
    <p>
     opposed to aristocracies, yet you'd take an earldom if you could. Am I
    </p>
    <p>
     to understand that you don't blame an earl for being and remaining an
    </p>
    <p>
     earl?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I certainly don't.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And you wouldn't blame Tompkins, or yourself, or me, or anybody, for
    </p>
    <p>
     accepting an earldom if it was offered?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Indeed I wouldn't.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, then, whom would you blame?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “The whole nation--any bulk and mass of population anywhere, in any
    </p>
    <p>
     country, that will put up with the infamy, the outrage, the insult of
    </p>
    <p>
     a hereditary aristocracy which they can't enter--and on absolutely free
    </p>
    <p>
     and equal terms.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come, aren't you beclouding yourself with distinctions that are not
    </p>
    <p>
     differences?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Indeed I am not. I am entirely clear-headed about this thing. If I
    </p>
    <p>
     could extirpate an aristocratic system by declining its honors, then I
    </p>
    <p>
     should be a rascal to accept them. And if enough of the mass would join
    </p>
    <p>
     me to make the extirpation possible, then I should be a rascal to do
    </p>
    <p>
     otherwise than help in the attempt.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I believe I understand--yes, I think I get the idea. You have no blame
    </p>
    <p>
     for the lucky few who naturally decline to vacate the pleasant nest they
    </p>
    <p>
     were born into, you only despise the all-powerful and stupid mass of the
    </p>
    <p>
     nation for allowing the nest to exist.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's it, that's it! You can get a simple thing through your head if
    </p>
    <p>
     you work at it long enough.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thanks.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't mention it. And I'll give you some sound advice: when you
    </p>
    <p>
     go back; if you find your nation up and ready to abolish that hoary
    </p>
    <p>
     affront, lend a hand; but if that isn't the state of things and you get
    </p>
    <p>
     a chance at an earldom, don't you be a fool--you take it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy responded with earnestness and enthusiasm:
    </p>
    <p>
     “As I live, I'll do it!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Barrow laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I never saw such a fellow. I begin to think you've got a good deal
    </p>
    <p>
     of imagination. With you, the idlest fancy freezes into a reality at a
    </p>
    <p>
     breath. Why, you looked, then, as if it wouldn't astonish you if you did
    </p>
    <p>
     tumble into an earldom.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy blushed. Barrow added: “Earldom! Oh, yes, take it, if it offers;
    </p>
    <p>
     but meantime we'll go on looking around, in a modest way, and if you
    </p>
    <p>
     get a chance to superintend a sausage-stuffer at six or eight dollars a
    </p>
    <p>
     week, you just trade off the earldom for a last year's almanac and stick
    </p>
    <p>
     to the sausage-stuffing.”

    <p>
     Tracy went to bed happy once more, at rest in his mind once more. He had
    </p>
    <p>
     started out on a high emprise--that was to his credit, he argued; he had
    </p>
    <p>
     fought the best fight he could, considering the odds against him--that
    </p>
    <p>
     was to his credit; he had been defeated--certainly there was nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     discreditable in that. Being defeated, he had a right to retire with
    </p>
    <p>
     the honors of war and go back without prejudice to the position in
    </p>
    <p>
     the world's society to which he had been born. Why not? even the
    </p>
    <p>
     rabid republican chair-maker would do that. Yes, his conscience was
    </p>
    <p>
     comfortable once more.
    </p>
    <p>
     He woke refreshed, happy, and eager for his cablegram. He had been
    </p>
    <p>
     born an aristocrat, he had been a democrat for a time, he was now an
    </p>
    <p>
     aristocrat again. He marveled to find that this final change was not
    </p>
    <p>
     merely intellectual, it had invaded his feeling; and he also marveled
    </p>
    <p>
     to note that this feeling seemed a good deal less artificial than any he
    </p>
    <p>
     had entertained in his system for a long time. He could also have noted,
    </p>
    <p>
     if he had thought of it, that his bearing had stiffened, over night, and
    </p>
    <p>
     that his chin had lifted itself a shade. Arrived in the basement, he was
    </p>
    <p>
     about to enter the breakfast room when he saw old Marsh in the dim light
    </p>
    <p>
     of a corner of the hall, beckoning him with his finger to approach. The
    </p>
    <p>
     blood welled slowly up in Tracy's cheek, and he said with a grade of
    </p>
    <p>
     injured dignity almost ducal:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is that for me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is the purpose of it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want to speak to you--in private.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “This spot is private enough for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Marsh was surprised; and not particularly pleased. He approached and
    </p>
    <p>
     said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, in public, then, if you prefer. Though it hasn't been my way.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The boarders gathered to the spot, interested.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Speak out,” said Tracy. “What is it you want?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, haven't you--er--forgot something?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I? I'm not aware of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, you're not? Now you stop and think, a minute.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I refuse to stop and think. It doesn't interest me. If it interests
    </p>
    <p>
     you, speak out.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, then,” said Marsh, raising his voice to a slightly angry pitch,
    </p>
    <p>
     “You forgot to pay your board yesterday--if you're bound to have it
    </p>
    <p>
     public.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, yes, this heir to an annual million or so had been dreaming and
    </p>
    <p>
     soaring, and had forgotten that pitiful three or four dollars. For
    </p>
    <p>
     penalty he must have it coarsely flung in his face in the presence of
    </p>
    <p>
     these people--people in whose countenances was already beginning to dawn
    </p>
    <p>
     an uncharitable enjoyment of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is that all! Take your money and give your terrors a rest.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy's hand went down into his pocket with angry decision. But--it
    </p>
    <p>
     didn't come out. The color began to ebb out of his face. The
    </p>
    <p>
     countenances about him showed a growing interest; and some of them
    </p>
    <p>
     a heightened satisfaction. There was an uncomfortable pause--then he
    </p>
    <p>
     forced out, with difficulty, the words:
    </p>
    <p>
     “I've--been robbed!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Old Marsh's eyes flamed up with Spanish fire, and he exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Robbed, is it? That's your tune? It's too old--been played in this
    </p>
    <p>
     house too often; everybody plays it that can't get work when he wants
    </p>
    <p>
     it, and won't work when he can get it. Trot out Mr. Allen, somebody,
    </p>
    <p>
     and let him take a toot at it. It's his turn next, he forgot, too, last
    </p>
    <p>
     night. I'm laying for him.”
    </p>
    <p>
     One of the negro women came scrambling down stairs as pale as a sorrel
    </p>
    <p>
     horse with consternation and excitement:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Misto Marsh, Misto Allen's skipped out!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes-sah, and cleaned out his room clean; tuck bofe towels en de soap!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You lie, you hussy!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's jes' so, jes' as I tells you--en Misto Summer's socks is gone, en
    </p>
    <p>
     Misto Naylor's yuther shirt.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Marsh was at boiling point by this time. He turned upon Tracy:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Answer up now--when are you going to settle?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “To-day--since you seem to be in a hurry.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “To-day is it? Sunday--and you out of work? I like that. Come--where are
    </p>
    <p>
     you going to get the money?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy's spirit was rising again. He proposed to impress these people:
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am expecting a cablegram from home.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Old Marsh was caught out, with the surprise of it. The idea was so
    </p>
    <p>
     immense, so extravagant, that he couldn't get his breath at first. When
    </p>
    <p>
     he did get it, it came rancid with sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
     “A cablegram--think of it, ladies and gents, he's expecting a cablegram!
    </p>
    <p>
     He's expecting a cablegram--this duffer, this scrub, this bilk! From
    </p>
    <p>
     his father--eh? Yes--without a doubt. A dollar or two a word--oh, that's
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing--they don't mind a little thing like that--this kind's fathers
    </p>
    <p>
     don't. Now his father is--er--well, I reckon his father--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “My father is an English earl!”
    </p>
    <p>
     The crowd fell back aghast-aghast at the sublimity of the young loafer's
    </p>
    <p>
     “cheek.” Then they burst into a laugh that made the windows rattle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy was too angry to realize that he had done a foolish thing. He
    </p>
    <p>
     said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Stand aside, please. I--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait a minute, your lordship,” said Marsh, bowing low, “where is your
    </p>
    <p>
     lordship going?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “For the cablegram. Let me pass.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Excuse me, your lordship, you'll stay right where you are.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you mean by that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I mean that I didn't begin to keep boarding-house yesterday. It means
    </p>
    <p>
     that I am not the kind that can be taken in by every hack-driver's son
    </p>
    <p>
     that comes loafing over here because he can't bum a living at home. It
    </p>
    <p>
     means that you can't skip out on any such--”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy made a step toward the old man, but Mrs. Marsh sprang between, and
    </p>
    <p>
     said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't, Mr. Tracy, please.” She turned to her husband and said, “Do
    </p>
    <p>
     bridle your tongue. What has he done to be treated so? Can't you see he
    </p>
    <p>
     has lost his mind, with trouble and distress? He's not responsible.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank your kind heart, madam, but I've not lost my mind; and if I can
    </p>
    <p>
     have the mere privilege of stepping to the telegraph office--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, you can't,” cried Marsh.
    </p>
    <p>
     “--or sending--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sending! That beats everything. If there's anybody that's fool enough
    </p>
    <p>
     to go on such a chuckle-headed errand--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Here comes Mr. Barrow--he will go for me. Barrow--”
    </p>
    <p>
     A brisk fire of exclamations broke out--
    </p>
    <p>
     “Say, Barrow, he's expecting a cablegram!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Cablegram from his father, you know!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes--cablegram from the wax-figger!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And say, Barrow, this fellow's an earl--take off your hat, pull down
    </p>
    <p>
     your vest!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, he's come off and forgot his crown, that he wears Sundays. He's
    </p>
    <p>
     cabled over to his pappy to send it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You step out and get that cablegram, Barrow; his majesty's a little
    </p>
    <p>
     lame to-day.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh stop,” cried Barrow; “give the man a chance.” He turned, and said
    </p>
    <p>
     with some severity, “Tracy, what's the matter with you? What kind of
    </p>
    <p>
     foolishness is this you've been talking. You ought to have more sense.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I've not been talking foolishness; and if you'll go to the telegraph
    </p>
    <p>
     office--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh; don't talk so. I'm your friend in trouble and out of it, before
    </p>
    <p>
     your face and behind your back, for anything in reason; but you've lost
    </p>
    <p>
     your head, you see, and this moonshine about a cablegram--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll go there and ask for it!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you from the bottom of my heart, Brady. Here, I'll give you a
    </p>
    <p>
     Written order for it. Fly, now, and fetch it. We'll soon see!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Brady flew. Immediately the sort of quiet began to steal over the crowd
    </p>
    <p>
     which means dawning doubt, misgiving; and might be translated into the
    </p>
    <p>
     words, “Maybe he is expecting a cablegram--maybe he has got a father
    </p>
    <p>
     somewhere--maybe we've been just a little too fresh, just a shade too
    </p>
    <p>
     'previous'!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Loud talk ceased; then the mutterings and low murmurings and whisperings
    </p>
    <p>
     died out. The crowd began to crumble apart. By ones and twos the
    </p>
    <p>
     fragments drifted to the breakfast table. Barrow tried to bring Tracy
    </p>
    <p>
     in; but he said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not yet, Barrow--presently.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Mrs. Marsh and Hattie tried, offering gentle and kindly persuasions; but
    </p>
    <p>
     he said;
    </p>
    <p>
     “I would rather wait--till he comes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Even old Marsh began to have suspicions that maybe he had been a trifle
    </p>
    <p>
     too “brash,” as he called it in the privacy of his soul, and he pulled
    </p>
    <p>
     himself together and started toward Tracy with invitation in his eyes;
    </p>
    <p>
     but Tracy warned him off with a gesture which was quite positive and
    </p>
    <p>
     eloquent. Then followed the stillest quarter of an hour which had ever
    </p>
    <p>
     been known in that house at that time of day. It was so still, and so
    </p>
    <p>
     solemn withal, that when somebody's cup slipped from his fingers and
    </p>
    <p>
     landed in his plate the shock made people start, and the sharp sound
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed as indecorous there and as out of place as if a coffin and
    </p>
    <p>
     mourners were imminent and being waited for. And at last when Brady's
    </p>
    <p>
     feet came clattering down the stairs the sacrilege seemed unbearable.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everybody rose softly and turned toward the door, where stood Tracy;
    </p>
    <p>
     then with a common impulse, moved a step or two in that direction, and
    </p>
    <p>
     stopped. While they gazed, young Brady arrived, panting, and put
    </p>
    <p>
     into Tracy's hand,--sure enough--an envelope. Tracy fastened a bland
    </p>
    <p>
     victorious eye upon the gazers, and kept it there till one by one they
    </p>
    <p>
     dropped their eyes, vanquished and embarrassed. Then he tore open the
    </p>
    <p>
     telegram and glanced at its message. The yellow paper fell from his
    </p>
    <p>
     fingers and fluttered to the floor, and his face turned white. There was
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing there but one word--
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thanks.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The humorist of the house, the tall, raw-boned Billy Nash, caulker from
    </p>
    <p>
     the navy yard, was standing in the rear of the crowd. In the midst of
    </p>
    <p>
     the pathetic silence that was now brooding over the place and moving
    </p>
    <p>
     some few hearts there toward compassion, he began to whimper, then he
    </p>
    <p>
     put his handkerchief to his eyes and buried his face in the neck of the
    </p>
    <p>
     bashfulest young fellow in the company, a navy-yard blacksmith, shrieked
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, pappy, how could you!” and began to bawl like a teething baby, if
    </p>
    <p>
     one may imagine a baby with the energy and the devastating voice of a
    </p>
    <p>
     jackass.
    </p>
    <p>
     So perfect was that imitation of a child's cry, and so vast the scale of
    </p>
    <p>
     it and so ridiculous the aspect of the performer, that all gravity was
    </p>
    <p>
     swept from the place as if by a hurricane, and almost everybody there
    </p>
    <p>
     joined in the crash of laughter provoked by the exhibition. Then the
    </p>
    <p>
     small mob began to take its revenge--revenge for the discomfort and
    </p>
    <p>
     apprehension it had brought upon itself by its own too rash freshness
    </p>
    <p>
     of a little while before. It guyed its poor victim, baited him, worried
    </p>
    <p>
     him, as dogs do with a cornered cat. The victim answered back with
    </p>
    <p>
     defiances and challenges which included everybody, and which only gave
    </p>
    <p>
     the sport new spirit and variety; but when he changed his tactics and
    </p>
    <p>
     began to single out individuals and invite them by name, the fun lost
    </p>
    <p>
     its funniness and the interest of the show died out, along with the
    </p>
    <p>
     noise.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally Marsh was about to take an innings, but Barrow said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Never mind, now--leave him alone. You've no account with him but a
    </p>
    <p>
     money account. I'll take care of that myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The distressed and worried landlady gave Barrow a fervently grateful
    </p>
    <p>
     look for his championship of the abused stranger; and the pet of the
    </p>
    <p>
     house, a very prism in her cheap but ravishing Sunday rig, blew him a
    </p>
    <p>
     kiss from the tips of her fingers and said, with the darlingest smile
    </p>
    <p>
     and a sweet little toss of her head:
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're the only man here, and I'm going to set my cap for you, you dear
    </p>
    <p>
     old thing!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “For shame, Puss! How you talk! I never saw such a child!”
    </p>
    <p>
     It took a good deal of argument and persuasion--that is to say, petting,
    </p>
    <p>
     under these disguises--to get Tracy to entertain the idea of breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
     He at first said he would never eat again in that house; and added that
    </p>
    <p>
     he had enough firmness of character, he trusted, to enable him to starve
    </p>
    <p>
     like a man when the alternative was to eat insult with his bread.
    </p>
    <p>
     When he had finished his breakfast, Barrow took him to his room,
    </p>
    <p>
     furnished him a pipe, and said cheerily:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now, old fellow, take in your battle-flag out of the wet, you're not in
    </p>
    <p>
     the hostile camp any more. You're a little upset by your troubles, and
    </p>
    <p>
     that's natural enough, but don't let your mind run on them anymore than
    </p>
    <p>
     you can help; drag your thoughts away from your troubles by the ears, by
    </p>
    <p>
     the heels, or any other way, so you manage it; it's the healthiest thing
    </p>
    <p>
     a body can do; dwelling on troubles is deadly, just deadly--and that's
    </p>
    <p>
     the softest name there is for it. You must keep your mind amused--you
    </p>
    <p>
     must, indeed.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, miserable me!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't! There's just pure heart-break in that tone. It's just as I say;
    </p>
    <p>
     you've got to get right down to it and amuse your mind, as if it was
    </p>
    <p>
     salvation.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “They're easy words to say, Barrow, but how am I going to amuse,
    </p>
    <p>
     entertain, divert a mind that finds itself suddenly assaulted and
    </p>
    <p>
     overwhelmed by disasters of a sort not dreamed of and not provided for?
    </p>
    <p>
     No--no, the bare idea of amusement is repulsive to my feelings: Let us
    </p>
    <p>
     talk of death and funerals.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No--not yet. That would be giving up the ship. We'll not give up the
    </p>
    <p>
     ship yet. I'm going to amuse you; I sent Brady out for the wherewithal
    </p>
    <p>
     before you finished breakfast.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You did? What is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come, this is a good sign--curiosity. Oh, there's hope for you yet.”
    </p>

     CHAPTER XVI.
    </head>
    <p>
     Brady arrived with a box, and departed, after saying, “They're finishing
    </p>
    <p>
     one up, but they'll be along as soon as it's done.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Barrow took a frameless oil portrait a foot square from the box, set it
    </p>
    <p>
     up in a good light, without comment, and reached for another, taking a
    </p>
    <p>
     furtive glance at Tracy, meantime. The stony solemnity in Tracy's face
    </p>
    <p>
     remained as it was, and gave out no sign of interest. Barrow placed
    </p>
    <p>
     the second portrait beside the first, and stole another glance while
    </p>
    <p>
     reaching for a third. The stone image softened, a shade. No. 3 forced
    </p>
    <p>
     the ghost of a smile, No. 4 swept indifference wholly away, and No. 5
    </p>
    <p>
     started a laugh which was still in good and hearty condition when No. 14
    </p>
    <p>
     took its place in the row.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, you're all right, yet,” said Barrow. “You see you're not past
    </p>
    <p>
     amusement.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The pictures were fearful, as to color, and atrocious as to drawing
    </p>
    <p>
     and expression; but the feature which squelched animosity and made them
    </p>
    <p>
     funny was a feature which could not achieve its full force in a single
    </p>
    <p>
     picture, but required the wonder-working assistance of repetition. One
    </p>
    <p>
     loudly dressed mechanic in stately attitude, with his hand on a cannon,
    </p>
    <p>
     ashore, and a ship riding at anchor in the offing,--this is merely odd;
    </p>
    <p>
     but when one sees the same cannon and the same ship in fourteen pictures
    </p>
    <p>
     in a row, and a different mechanic standing watch in each, the thing
    </p>
    <p>
     gets to be funny.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Explain--explain these aberrations,” said Tracy.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, they are not the achievement of a single intellect, a single
    </p>
    <p>
     talent--it takes two to do these miracles. They are collaborations; the
    </p>
    <p>
     one artist does the figure, the other the accessories. The figure-artist
    </p>
    <p>
     is a German shoemaker with an untaught passion for art, the other is a
    </p>
    <p>
     simple hearted old Yankee sailor-man whose possibilities are strictly
    </p>
    <p>
     limited to his ship, his cannon and his patch of petrified sea. They
    </p>
    <p>
     work these things up from twenty-five-cent tintypes; they get six
    </p>
    <p>
     dollars apiece for them, and they can grind out a couple a day when they
    </p>
    <p>
     strike what they call a boost--that is, an inspiration.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “People actually pay money for these calumnies?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “They actually do--and quite willingly, too. And these abortionists
    </p>
    <p>
     could double their trade and work the women in, if Capt. Saltmarsh could
    </p>
    <p>
     whirl a horse in, or a piano, or a guitar, in place of his cannon. The
    </p>
    <p>
     fact is, he fatigues the market with that cannon. Even the male market,
    </p>
    <p>
     I mean. These fourteen in the procession are not all satisfied. One is
    </p>
    <p>
     an old 'independent' fireman, and he wants an engine in place of the
    </p>
    <p>
     cannon; another is a mate of a tug, and wants a tug in place of the
    </p>
    <p>
     ship --and so on, and so on. But the captain can't make a tug that is
    </p>
    <p>
     deceptive, and a fire engine is many flights beyond his power.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is a most extraordinary form of robbery, I never have heard of
    </p>
    <p>
     anything like it. It's interesting.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, and so are the artists. They are perfectly honest men, and
    </p>
    <p>
     sincere. And the old sailor-man is full of sound religion, and is as
    </p>
    <p>
     devoted a student of the Bible and misquoter of it as you can find
    </p>
    <p>
     anywhere. I don't know a better man or kinder hearted old soul than
    </p>
    <p>
     Saltmarsh, although he does swear a little, sometimes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “He seems to be perfect. I want to know him, Barrow.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You'll have the chance. I guess I hear them coming, now. We'll draw
    </p>
    <p>
     them out on their art, if you like.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The artists arrived and shook hands with great heartiness. The German
    </p>
    <p>
     was forty and a little fleshy, with a shiny bald head and a kindly
    </p>
    <p>
     face and deferential manner. Capt. Saltmarsh was sixty, tall, erect,
    </p>
    <p>
     powerfully built, with coal-black hair and whiskers, and he had a well
    </p>
    <p>
     tanned complexion, and a gait and countenance that were full of command,
    </p>
    <p>
     confidence and decision. His horny hands and wrists were covered with
    </p>
    <p>
     tattoo-marks, and when his lips parted, his teeth showed up white and
    </p>
    <p>
     blemishless. His voice was the effortless deep bass of a church organ,
    </p>
    <p>
     and would disturb the tranquility of a gas flame fifty yards away.
    </p>
    <p>
     “They're wonderful pictures,” said Barrow. “We've been examining them.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It is very bleasant dot you like dem,” said Handel, the German,
    </p>
    <p>
     greatly pleased. “Und you, Herr Tracy, you haf peen bleased mit dem too,
    </p>
    <p>
     alretty?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can honestly say I have never seen anything just like them before.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Schon!” cried the German, delighted. “You hear, Gaptain? Here is a
    </p>
    <p>
     chentleman, yes, vot abbreviate unser aart.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The captain was charmed, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, sir, we're thankful for a compliment yet, though they're not as
    </p>
    <p>
     scarce now as they used to be before we made a reputation.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Getting the reputation is the up-hill time in most things, captain.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's so. It ain't enough to know how to reef a gasket, you got to make
    </p>
    <p>
     the mate know you know it. That's reputation. The good word, said at the
    </p>
    <p>
     right time, that's the word that makes us; and evil be to him that evil
    </p>
    <p>
     thinks, as Isaiah says.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's very relevant, and hits the point exactly,” said Tracy.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where did you study art, Captain?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I haven't studied; it's a natural gift.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “He is born mit dose cannon in him. He tondt haf to do noding, his
    </p>
    <p>
     chenius do all de vork. Of he is asleep, and take a pencil in his hand,
    </p>
    <p>
     out come a cannon. Py crashus, of he could do a clavier, of he could do
    </p>
    <p>
     a guitar, of he could do a vashtub, it is a fortune, heiliger Yohanniss
    </p>
    <p>
     it is yoost a fortune!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, it is an immense pity that the business is hindered and limited
    </p>
    <p>
     in this unfortunate way.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The captain grew a trifle excited, himself, now:
    </p>
    <p>
     “You've said it, Mr. Tracy!--Hindered? well, I should say so. Why, look
    </p>
    <p>
     here. This fellow here, No. 11, he's a hackman,--a flourishing hackman,
    </p>
    <p>
     I may say. He wants his hack in this picture. Wants it where the cannon
    </p>
    <p>
     is. I got around that difficulty, by telling him the cannon's our
    </p>
    <p>
     trademark, so to speak--proves that the picture's our work, and I was
    </p>
    <p>
     afraid if we left it out people wouldn't know for certain if it was a
    </p>
    <p>
     Saltmarsh--Handel--now you wouldn't yourself--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What, Captain? You wrong yourself, indeed you do. Anyone who has once
    </p>
    <p>
     seen a genuine Saltmarsh-Handel is safe from imposture forever.
    </p>
    <p>
     Strip it, flay it, skin it out of every detail but the bare color
    </p>
    <p>
     and expression, and that man will still recognize it--still stop to
    </p>
    <p>
     worship--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, how it makes me feel to hear dose oxpressions!--”
    </p>
    <p>
     --“still say to himself again as he had, said a hundred times before,
    </p>
    <p>
     the art of the Saltmarsh-Handel is an art apart, there is nothing in the
    </p>
    <p>
     heavens above or in the earth beneath that resembles it,--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Py chiminy, nur horen Sie einmal! In my life day haf I never heard so
    </p>
    <p>
     brecious worts.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “So I talked him out of the hack, Mr. Tracy, and he let up on that,
    </p>
    <p>
     and said put in a hearse, then--because he's chief mate of a hearse
    </p>
    <p>
     but don't own it--stands a watch for wages, you know. But I can't do a
    </p>
    <p>
     hearse any more than I can a hack; so here we are--becalmed, you see.
    </p>
    <p>
     And it's the same with women and such. They come and they want a little
    </p>
    <p>
     johnry picture--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's the accessories that make it a 'genre?'”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes--cannon, or cat, or any little thing like that, that you heave in
    </p>
    <p>
     to whoop up the effect. We could do a prodigious trade with the women if
    </p>
    <p>
     we could foreground the things they like, but they don't give a damn for
    </p>
    <p>
     artillery. Mine's the lack,” continued the captain with a sigh, “Andy's
    </p>
    <p>
     end of the business is all right I tell you he's an artist from way
    </p>
    <p>
     back!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yoost hear dot old man! He always talk 'poud me like dot,” purred the
    </p>
    <p>
     pleased German.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Look at his work yourself! Fourteen portraits in a row. And no two of
    </p>
    <p>
     them alike.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now that you speak of it, it is true; I hadn't noticed it before. It is
    </p>
    <p>
     very remarkable. Unique, I suppose.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I should say so. That's the very thing about Andy--he discriminates.
    </p>
    <p>
     Discrimination's the thief of time--forty-ninth Psalm; but that ain't
    </p>
    <p>
     any matter, it's the honest thing, and it pays in the end.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, he certainly is great in that feature, one is obliged to admit it;
    </p>
    <p>
     but--now mind, I'm not really criticising--don't you think he is just a
    </p>
    <p>
     trifle overstrong in technique?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The captain's face was knocked expressionless by this remark.
    </p>
    <p>
     It remained quite vacant while he muttered to himself--
    </p>
    <p>
     “Technique--technique--polytechnique--pyro-technique; that's it,
    </p>
    <p>
     likely--fireworks too much color.” Then he spoke up with serenity and
    </p>
    <p>
     confidence, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, yes, he does pile it on pretty loud; but they all like it, you
    </p>
    <p>
     know--fact is, it's the life of the business. Take that No. 9, there,
    </p>
    <p>
     Evans the butcher. He drops into the stoodio as sober-colored as
    </p>
    <p>
     anything you ever see: now look at him. You can't tell him from scarlet
    </p>
    <p>
     fever. Well, it pleases that butcher to death. I'm making a study of a
    </p>
    <p>
     sausage-wreath to hang on the cannon, and I don't really reckon I can do
    </p>
    <p>
     it right, but if I can, we can break the butcher.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Unquestionably your confederate--I mean your--your fellow-craftsman--is
    </p>
    <p>
     a great colorist--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, danke schon!--”
    </p>
    <p>
     --“in fact a quite extraordinary colorist; a colorist, I make bold to
    </p>
    <p>
     say, without imitator here or abroad--and with a most bold and effective
    </p>
    <p>
     touch, a touch like a battering ram; and a manner so peculiar and
    </p>
    <p>
     romantic, and extraneous, and ad libitum, and heart-searching,
    </p>
    <p>
     that--that--he--he is an impressionist, I presume?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” said the captain simply, “he is a Presbyterian.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It accounts for it all--all--there's something divine about his
    </p>
    <p>
     art,--soulful, unsatisfactory, yearning, dim hearkening on the void
    </p>
    <p>
     horizon, vague--murmuring to the spirit out of ultra-marine distances
    </p>
    <p>
     and far-sounding cataclysms of uncreated space--oh, if he--if, he--has
    </p>
    <p>
     he ever tried distemper?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The captain answered up with energy:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not if he knows himself! But his dog has, and--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, no, it vas not my dog.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why, you said it was your dog.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, no, gaptain, I--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It was a white dog, wasn't it, with his tail docked, and one ear gone,
    </p>
    <p>
     and--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Dot's him, dot's him!--der fery dog. Wy, py Chorge, dot dog he would
    </p>
    <p>
     eat baint yoost de same like--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, never mind that, now--'vast heaving--I never saw such a man. You
    </p>
    <p>
     start him on that dog and he'll dispute a year. Blamed if I haven't seen
    </p>
    <p>
     him keep it up a level two hours and a half.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why captain!” said Barrow. “I guess that must be hearsay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, sir, no hearsay about it--he disputed with me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't see how you stood it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, you've got to--if you run with Andy. But it's the only fault he's
    </p>
    <p>
     got.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ain't you afraid of acquiring it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, no,” said the captain, tranquilly, “no danger of that, I reckon.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The artists presently took their leave. Then Barrow put his hands on
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy's shoulders and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Look me in the eye, my boy. Steady, steady. There--it's just as I
    </p>
    <p>
     thought--hoped, anyway; you're all right, thank goodness. Nothing the
    </p>
    <p>
     matter with your mind. But don't do that again--even for fun. It isn't
    </p>
    <p>
     wise. They wouldn't have believed you if you'd been an earl's son. Why,
    </p>
    <p>
     they couldn't--don't you know that? What ever possessed you to take
    </p>
    <p>
     such a freak? But never mind about that; let's not talk of it. It was a
    </p>
    <p>
     mistake; you see that yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes--it was a mistake.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, just drop it out of your mind; it's no harm; we all make them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pull your courage together, and don't brood, and don't give up. I'm at
    </p>
    <p>
     your back, and we'll pull through, don't you be afraid.”
    </p>
    <p>
     When he was gone, Barrow walked the floor a good while, uneasy in his
    </p>
    <p>
     mind. He said to himself, “I'm troubled about him. He never would have
    </p>
    <p>
     made a break like that if he hadn't been a little off his balance. But
    </p>
    <p>
     I know what being out of work and no prospect ahead can do for a man.
    </p>
    <p>
     First it knocks the pluck out of him and drags his pride in the dirt;
    </p>
    <p>
     worry does the rest, and his mind gets shaky. I must talk to these
    </p>
    <p>
     people. No--if there's any humanity in them--and there is, at
    </p>
    <p>
     bottom--they'll be easier on him if they think his troubles have
    </p>
    <p>
     disturbed his reason. But I've got to find him some work; work's the
    </p>
    <p>
     only medicine for his disease. Poor devil! away off here, and not a
    </p>
    <p>
     friend.”

     CHAPTER XVII.
    </head>
    <p>
     The moment Tracy was alone his spirits vanished away, and all the misery
    </p>
    <p>
     of his situation was manifest to him. To be moneyless and an object
    </p>
    <p>
     of the chairmaker's charity--this was bad enough, but his folly in
    </p>
    <p>
     proclaiming himself an earl's son to that scoffing and unbelieving crew,
    </p>
    <p>
     and, on top of that, the humiliating result--the recollection of these
    </p>
    <p>
     things was a sharper torture still. He made up his mind that he would
    </p>
    <p>
     never play earl's son again before a doubtful audience.
    </p>
    <p>
     His father's answer was a blow he could not understand. At times he
    </p>
    <p>
     thought his father imagined he could get work to do in America without
    </p>
    <p>
     any trouble, and was minded to let him try it and cure himself of his
    </p>
    <p>
     radicalism by hard, cold, disenchanting experience. That seemed the most
    </p>
    <p>
     plausible theory, yet he could not content himself with it. A theory
    </p>
    <p>
     that pleased him better was, that this cablegram would be followed by
    </p>
    <p>
     another, of a gentler sort, requiring him to come home. Should he write
    </p>
    <p>
     and strike his flag, and ask for a ticket home? Oh, no, that he couldn't
    </p>
    <p>
     ever do. At least, not yet. That cablegram would come, it certainly
    </p>
    <p>
     would. So he went from one telegraph office to another every day for
    </p>
    <p>
     nearly a week, and asked if there was a cablegram for Howard Tracy. No,
    </p>
    <p>
     there wasn't any. So they answered him at first. Later, they said it
    </p>
    <p>
     before he had a chance to ask. Later still they merely shook their heads
    </p>
    <p>
     impatiently as soon as he came in sight. After that he was ashamed to go
    </p>
    <p>
     any more.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was down in the lowest depths of despair, now; for the harder Barrow
    </p>
    <p>
     tried to find work for him the more hopeless the possibilities seemed to
    </p>
    <p>
     grow. At last he said to Barrow:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Look here. I want to make a confession. I have got down, now, to
    </p>
    <p>
     where I am not only willing to acknowledge to myself that I am a shabby
    </p>
    <p>
     creature and full of false pride, but am willing to acknowledge it to
    </p>
    <p>
     you. Well, I've been allowing you to wear yourself out hunting for work
    </p>
    <p>
     for me when there's been a chance open to me all the time. Forgive
    </p>
    <p>
     my pride--what was left of it. It is all gone, now, and I've come to
    </p>
    <p>
     confess that if those ghastly artists want another confederate, I'm
    </p>
    <p>
     their man--for at last I am dead to shame.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No? Really, can you paint?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not as badly as they. No, I don't claim that, for I am not a genius;
    </p>
    <p>
     in fact, I am a very indifferent amateur, a slouchy dabster, a mere
    </p>
    <p>
     artistic sarcasm; but drunk or asleep I can beat those buccaneers.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shake! I want to shout! Oh, I tell you, I am immensely delighted
    </p>
    <p>
     and relieved. Oh, just to work--that is life! No matter what the work
    </p>
    <p>
     is--that's of no consequence. Just work itself is bliss when a man's
    </p>
    <p>
     been starving for it. I've been there! Come right along; we'll hunt the
    </p>
    <p>
     old boys up. Don't you feel good? I tell you I do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The freebooters were not at home. But their “works” were, displayed
    </p>
    <p>
     in profusion all about the little ratty studio. Cannon to the right of
    </p>
    <p>
     them, cannon to the left of them, cannon in front--it was Balaclava come
    </p>
    <p>
     again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Here's the uncontented hackman, Tracy. Buckle to--deepen the sea-green
    </p>
    <p>
     to turf, turn the ship into a hearse. Let the boys have a taste of your
    </p>
    <p>
     quality.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The artists arrived just as the last touch was put on. They stood
    </p>
    <p>
     transfixed with admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My souls but she's a stunner, that hearse! The hackman will just go all
    </p>
    <p>
     to pieces when he sees that won't he Andy?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, it is sphlennid, sphlennid! Herr Tracy, why haf you not said you
    </p>
    <p>
     vas a so sublime aartist? Lob' Gott, of you had lif'd in Paris you would
    </p>
    <p>
     be a Pree de Rome, dot's votes de matter!”
    </p>
    <p>
     The arrangements were soon made. Tracy was taken into full and equal
    </p>
    <p>
     partnership, and he went straight to work, with dash and energy, to
    </p>
    <p>
     reconstructing gems of art whose accessories had failed to satisfy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Under his hand, on that and succeeding days, artillery disappeared and
    </p>
    <p>
     the emblems of peace and commerce took its place--cats, hacks, sausages,
    </p>
    <p>
     tugs, fire engines, pianos, guitars, rocks, gardens, flower-pots,
    </p>
    <p>
     landscapes--whatever was wanted, he flung it in; and the more out of
    </p>
    <p>
     place and absurd the required object was, the more joy he got out of
    </p>
    <p>
     fabricating it. The pirates were delighted, the customers applauded, the
    </p>
    <p>
     sex began to flock in, great was the prosperity of the firm. Tracy was
    </p>
    <p>
     obliged to confess to himself that there was something about work,--even
    </p>
    <p>
     such grotesque and humble work as this--which most pleasantly satisfied
    </p>
    <p>
     a something in his nature which had never been satisfied before, and
    </p>
    <p>
     also gave him a strange new dignity in his own private view of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     .......................
    </p>
    <p>
     The Unqualified Member from Cherokee Strip was in a state of deep
    </p>
    <p>
     dejection. For a good while, now, he had been leading a sort of
    </p>
    <p>
     life which was calculated to kill; for it had consisted in regularly
    </p>
    <p>
     alternating days of brilliant hope and black disappointment. The
    </p>
    <p>
     brilliant hopes were created by the magician Sellers, and they always
    </p>
    <p>
     promised that now he had got the trick, sure, and would effectively
    </p>
    <p>
     influence that materialized cowboy to call at the Towers before night.
    </p>
    <p>
     The black disappointments consisted in the persistent and monotonous
    </p>
    <p>
     failure of these prophecies.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the date which this history has now reached, Sellers was appalled
    </p>
    <p>
     to find that the usual remedy was inoperative, and that Hawkins's
    </p>
    <p>
     low spirits refused absolutely to lift. Something must be done, he
    </p>
    <p>
     reflected; it was heart-breaking, this woe, this smileless misery, this
    </p>
    <p>
     dull despair that looked out from his poor friend's face. Yes, he must
    </p>
    <p>
     be cheered up. He mused a while, then he saw his way. He said in his
    </p>
    <p>
     most conspicuously casual vein:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Er--uh--by the way, Hawkins, we are feeling disappointed about this
    </p>
    <p>
     thing--the way the materializee is acting, I mean--we are disappointed;
    </p>
    <p>
     you concede that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Concede it? Why, yes, if you like the term.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Very well; so far, so good. Now for the basis of the feeling. It is not
    </p>
    <p>
     that your heart, your affections are concerned; that is to say, it is
    </p>
    <p>
     not that you want the materializee Itself. You concede that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, I concede that, too--cordially.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Very well, again; we are making progress. To sum up: The feeling, it is
    </p>
    <p>
     conceded, is not engendered by the mere conduct of the materializee; it
    </p>
    <p>
     is conceded that it does not arise from any pang which the personality
    </p>
    <p>
     of the materializee could assuage. Now then,” said the earl, with the
    </p>
    <p>
     light of triumph in his eye, “the inexorable logic of the situation
    </p>
    <p>
     narrows us down to this: our feeling has its source in the money-loss
    </p>
    <p>
     involved. Come--isn't that so?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Goodness knows I concede that, with all my heart.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Very well. When you've found out the source of a disease, you've also
    </p>
    <p>
     found out what remedy is required--just as in this case. In this case
    </p>
    <p>
     money is required. And only money.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The old, old seduction was in that airy, confident tone and those
    </p>
    <p>
     significant words--usually called pregnant words in books. The old
    </p>
    <p>
     answering signs of faith and hope showed up in Hawkins's countenance,
    </p>
    <p>
     and he said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Only money? Do you mean that you know a way to--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Washington, have you the impression that I have no resources but those
    </p>
    <p>
     I allow the public and my intimate friends to know about?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I--er--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is it likely, do you think, that a man moved by nature and taught by
    </p>
    <p>
     experience to keep his affairs to himself and a cautious and reluctant
    </p>
    <p>
     tongue in his head, wouldn't be thoughtful enough to keep a few
    </p>
    <p>
     resources in reserve for a rainy day, when he's got as many as I have to
    </p>
    <p>
     select from?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, you make me feel so much better already, Colonel!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Have you ever been in my laboratory?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why, no.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's it. You see you didn't even know that I had one. Come along.
    </p>
    <p>
     I've got a little trick there that I want to show you. I've kept it
    </p>
    <p>
     perfectly quiet, not fifty people know anything about it. But that's my
    </p>
    <p>
     way, always been my way. Wait till you're ready, that's the idea; and
    </p>
    <p>
     when you're ready, zzip!--let her go!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, Colonel, I've never seen a man that I've had such unbounded
    </p>
    <p>
     confidence in as you. When you say a thing right out, I always feel
    </p>
    <p>
     as if that ends it; as if that is evidence, and proof, and everything
    </p>
    <p>
     else.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The old earl was profoundly pleased and touched.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm glad you believe in me, Washington; not everybody is so just.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I always have believed in you; and I always shall as long as I live.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you, my boy. You shan't repent it. And you can't.” Arrived in
    </p>
    <p>
     the “laboratory,” the earl continued, “Now, cast your eye around this
    </p>
    <p>
     room--what do you see? Apparently a junk-shop; apparently a hospital
    </p>
    <p>
     connected with a patent office--in reality, the mines of Golconda in
    </p>
    <p>
     disguise! Look at that thing there. Now what would you take that thing
    </p>
    <p>
     to be?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't believe I could ever imagine.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Of course you couldn't. It's my grand adaptation of the phonograph to
    </p>
    <p>
     the marine service. You store up profanity in it for use at sea. You
    </p>
    <p>
     know that sailors don't fly around worth a cent unless you swear at
    </p>
    <p>
     them--so the mate that can do the best job of swearing is the most
    </p>
    <p>
     valuable man. In great emergencies his talent saves the ship. But a ship
    </p>
    <p>
     is a large thing, and he can't be everywhere at once; so there have been
    </p>
    <p>
     times when one mate has lost a ship which could have been saved if
    </p>
    <p>
     they had had a hundred. Prodigious storms, you know. Well, a ship
    </p>
    <p>
     can't afford a hundred mates; but she can afford a hundred Cursing
    </p>
    <p>
     Phonographs, and distribute them all over the vessel--and there, you
    </p>
    <p>
     see, she's armed at every point. Imagine a big storm, and a hundred of
    </p>
    <p>
     my machines all cursing away at once--splendid spectacle, splendid!--you
    </p>
    <p>
     couldn't hear yourself think. Ship goes through that storm perfectly
    </p>
    <p>
     serene--she's just as safe as she'd be on shore.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's a wonderful idea. How do you prepare the thing?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Load it--simply load it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why you just stand over it and swear into it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That loads it, does it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes--because every word it collars, it keeps--keeps it forever. Never
    </p>
    <p>
     wears out. Any time you turn the crank, out it'll come. In times of
    </p>
    <p>
     great peril, you can reverse it, and it'll swear backwards. That makes a
    </p>
    <p>
     sailor hump himself!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “O, I see. Who loads them?--the mate?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, if he chooses. Or I'll furnish them already loaded. I can hire an
    </p>
    <p>
     expert for $75 a month who will load a hundred and fifty phonographs in
    </p>
    <p>
     150 hours, and do it easy. And an expert can furnish a stronger article,
    </p>
    <p>
     of course, than the mere average uncultivated mate could. Then you see,
    </p>
    <p>
     all the ships of the world will buy them ready loaded--for I shall have
    </p>
    <p>
     them loaded in any language a customer wants. Hawkins, it will work the
    </p>
    <p>
     grandest moral reform of the 19th century. Five years from now, all the
    </p>
    <p>
     swearing will be done by machinery--you won't ever hear a profane word
    </p>
    <p>
     come from human lips on a ship. Millions of dollars have been spent
    </p>
    <p>
     by the churches, in the effort to abolish profanity in the commercial
    </p>
    <p>
     marine. Think of it--my name will live forever in the affections of good
    </p>
    <p>
     men as the man, who, solitary and alone, accomplished this noble and
    </p>
    <p>
     elevating reform.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “O, it is grand and beneficent and beautiful. How did you ever come to
    </p>
    <p>
     think of it? You have a wonderful mind. How did you say you loaded the
    </p>
    <p>
     machine?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “O, it's no trouble--perfectly simple. If you want to load it up loud
    </p>
    <p>
     and strong, you stand right over it and shout. But if you leave it open
    </p>
    <p>
     and all set, it'll eavesdrop, so to speak--that is to say, it will load
    </p>
    <p>
     itself up with any sounds that are made within six feet of it. Now
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll show you how it works. I had an expert come and load this one up
    </p>
    <p>
     yesterday. Hello, it's been left open--it's too bad--still I reckon it
    </p>
    <p>
     hasn't had much chance to collect irrelevant stuff. All you do is to
    </p>
    <p>
     press this button in the floor--so.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The phonograph began to sing in a plaintive voice:
    </p>
    <p>
     There is a boarding-house, far far away, Where they have ham and eggs,
    </p>
    <p>
     3 times a day. “Hang it, that ain't it. Somebody's been singing around
    </p>
    <p>
     here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The plaintive song began again, mingled with a low, gradually rising
    </p>
    <p>
     wail of cats slowly warming up toward a fight;
    </p>
    <p>
     O, how the boarders yell, When they hear that dinner bell They give that
    </p>
    <p>
     landlord-- (momentary outburst of terrific catfight which drowns out one
    </p>
    <p>
     word.)
    </p>
    <p>
     Three times a day. (Renewal of furious catfight for a moment. The
    </p>
    <p>
     plaintive voice on a high fierce key, “Scat, you devils”--and a racket
    </p>
    <p>
     as of flying missiles.)
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, never mind--let it go. I've got some sailor-profanity down in
    </p>
    <p>
     there somewhere, if I could get to it. But it isn't any matter; you see
    </p>
    <p>
     how the machine works.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins responded with enthusiasm:
    </p>
    <p>
     “O, it works admirably! I know there's a hundred fortunes in it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And mind, the Hawkins family get their share, Washington.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “O, thanks, thanks; you are just as generous as ever. Ah, it's the
    </p>
    <p>
     grandest invention of the age!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ah, well; we live in wonderful times. The elements are crowded full of
    </p>
    <p>
     beneficent forces--always have been--and ours is the first generation to
    </p>
    <p>
     turn them to account and make them work for us. Why Hawkins, everything
    </p>
    <p>
     is useful--nothing ought ever to be wasted. Now look at sewer gas, for
    </p>
    <p>
     instance. Sewer gas has always been wasted, heretofore; nobody tried
    </p>
    <p>
     to save up sewer-gas--you can't name me a man. Ain't that so? you know
    </p>
    <p>
     perfectly well it's so.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes it is so--but I never--er--I don't quite see why a body--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Should want to save it up? Well, I'll tell you. Do you see this little
    </p>
    <p>
     invention here?--it's a decomposer--I call it a decomposer. I give
    </p>
    <p>
     you my word of honor that if you show me a house that produces a given
    </p>
    <p>
     quantity of sewer-gas in a day, I'll engage to set up my decomposer
    </p>
    <p>
     there and make that house produce a hundred times that quantity of
    </p>
    <p>
     sewer-gas in less than half an hour.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Dear me, but why should you want to?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Want to? Listen, and you'll see. My boy, for illuminating purposes
    </p>
    <p>
     and economy combined, there's nothing in the world that begins with
    </p>
    <p>
     sewer-gas. And really, it don't cost a cent. You put in a good
    </p>
    <p>
     inferior article of plumbing,--such as you find everywhere--and add
    </p>
    <p>
     my decomposer, and there you are. Just use the ordinary gas pipes--and
    </p>
    <p>
     there your expense ends. Think of it. Why, Major, in five years from
    </p>
    <p>
     now you won't see a house lighted with anything but sewer-gas. Every
    </p>
    <p>
     physician I talk to, recommends it; and every plumber.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But isn't it dangerous?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “O, yes, more or less, but everything is--coal gas, candles, electricity
    </p>
    <p>
     --there isn't anything that ain't.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It lights up well, does it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “O, magnificently.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Have you given it a good trial?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, no, not a first rate one. Polly's prejudiced, and she won't let
    </p>
    <p>
     me put it in here; but I'm playing my cards to get it adopted in the
    </p>
    <p>
     President's house, and then it'll go--don't you doubt it. I shall not
    </p>
    <p>
     need this one for the present, Washington; you may take it down to some
    </p>
    <p>
     boarding-house and give it a trial if you like.”

    <p>
     Washington shuddered slightly at the suggestion, then his face took on
    </p>
    <p>
     a dreamy look and he dropped into a trance of thought. After a little,
    </p>
    <p>
     Sellers asked him what he was grinding in his mental mill.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, this. Have you got some secret project in your head which
    </p>
    <p>
     requires a Bank of England back of it to make it succeed?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The Colonel showed lively astonishment, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why, Hawkins, are you a mind-reader?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I? I never thought of such a thing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, then how did you happen to drop onto that idea in this curious
    </p>
    <p>
     fashion? It's just mind-reading, that's what it is, though you may not
    </p>
    <p>
     know it. Because I have got a private project that requires a Bank of
    </p>
    <p>
     England at its back. How could you divine that? What was the process?
    </p>
    <p>
     This is interesting.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “There wasn't any process. A thought like this happened to slip through
    </p>
    <p>
     my head by accident: How much would make you or me comfortable?
    </p>
    <p>
     A hundred thousand. Yet you are expecting two or three of--these
    </p>
    <p>
     inventions of yours to turn out some billions of money--and you are
    </p>
    <p>
     wanting them to do that. If you wanted ten millions, I could understand
    </p>
    <p>
     that--it's inside the human limits. But billions! That's clear outside
    </p>
    <p>
     the limits. There must be a definite project back of that somewhere.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The earl's interest and surprise augmented with every word, and when
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins finished, he said with strong admiration:
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's wonderfully reasoned out, Washington, it certainly is. It shows
    </p>
    <p>
     what I think is quite extraordinary penetration. For you've hit it;
    </p>
    <p>
     you've driven the centre, you've plugged the bulls-eye of my dream. Now
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll tell you the whole thing, and you'll understand it. I don't need to
    </p>
    <p>
     ask you to keep it to yourself, because you'll see that the project will
    </p>
    <p>
     prosper all the better for being kept in the background till the right
    </p>
    <p>
     time. Have you noticed how many pamphlets and books I've got lying
    </p>
    <p>
     around relating to Russia?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, I think most anybody would notice that--anybody who wasn't dead.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I've been posting myself a good while. That's a great and,
    </p>
    <p>
     splendid nation, and deserves to be set free.” He paused, then added in
    </p>
    <p>
     a quite matter-of-fact way, “When I get this money I'm going to set it
    </p>
    <p>
     free.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Great guns!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why, what makes you jump like that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Dear me, when you are going to drop a remark under a man's chair that
    </p>
    <p>
     is likely to blow him out through the roof, why don't you put some
    </p>
    <p>
     expression, some force, some noise into it that will prepare him? You
    </p>
    <p>
     shouldn't flip out such a gigantic thing as this in that colorless kind
    </p>
    <p>
     of a way. You do jolt a person up, so. Go on, now, I am all right again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tell me all about it. I'm all interest--yes, and sympathy, too.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I've looked the ground over, and concluded that the methods of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Russian patriots, while good enough considering the way the boys are
    </p>
    <p>
     hampered, are not the best; at least not the quickest. They are trying
    </p>
    <p>
     to revolutionize Russia from within; that's pretty slow, you know,
    </p>
    <p>
     and liable to interruption all the time, and is full of perils for the
    </p>
    <p>
     workers. Do you know how Peter the Great started his army? He didn't
    </p>
    <p>
     start it on the family premises under the noses of the Strelitzes; no,
    </p>
    <p>
     he started it away off yonder, privately,--only just one regiment, you
    </p>
    <p>
     know, and he built to that. The first thing the Strelitzes knew, the
    </p>
    <p>
     regiment was an army, their position was turned, and they had to take
    </p>
    <p>
     a walk. Just that little idea made the biggest and worst of all the
    </p>
    <p>
     despotisms the world has seen. The same idea can unmake it. I'm going
    </p>
    <p>
     to prove it. I'm going to get out to one side and work my scheme the way
    </p>
    <p>
     Peter did.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is mighty interesting, Rossmore. What is it you are going to do?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am going to buy Siberia and start a republic.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “There,--bang you go again, without giving any notice! Going to buy it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, as soon as I get the money. I don't care what the price is, I
    </p>
    <p>
     shall take it. I can afford it, and I will. Now then, consider this--and
    </p>
    <p>
     you've never thought of it, I'll warrant. Where is the place where there
    </p>
    <p>
     is twenty-five times more manhood, pluck, true heroism, unselfishness,
    </p>
    <p>
     devotion to high and noble ideals, adoration of liberty, wide education,
    </p>
    <p>
     and brains, per thousand of population, than any other domain in the
    </p>
    <p>
     whole world can show?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Siberia!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Right.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It is true; it certainly is true, but I never thought of it before.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nobody ever thinks of it. But it's so, just the same. In those mines
    </p>
    <p>
     and prisons are gathered together the very finest and noblest and
    </p>
    <p>
     capablest multitude of human beings that God is able to create. Now
    </p>
    <p>
     if you had that kind of a population to sell, would you offer it to a
    </p>
    <p>
     despotism? No, the despotism has no use for it; you would lose money. A
    </p>
    <p>
     despotism has no use for anything but human cattle. But suppose you want
    </p>
    <p>
     to start a republic?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, I see. It's just the material for it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I should say so! There's Siberia with just the very finest and
    </p>
    <p>
     choicest material on the globe for a republic, and more coming--more
    </p>
    <p>
     coming all the time, don't you see! It is being daily, weekly, monthly
    </p>
    <p>
     recruited by the most perfectly devised system that has ever been
    </p>
    <p>
     invented, perhaps. By this system the whole of the hundred millions of
    </p>
    <p>
     Russia are being constantly and patiently sifted, sifted, sifted, by
    </p>
    <p>
     myriads of trained experts, spies appointed by the Emperor personally;
    </p>
    <p>
     and whenever they catch a man, woman or child that has got any brains or
    </p>
    <p>
     education or character, they ship that person straight to Siberia. It is
    </p>
    <p>
     admirable, it is wonderful. It is so searching and so effective that it
    </p>
    <p>
     keeps the general level of Russian intellect and education down to that
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Czar.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come, that sounds like exaggeration.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, it's what they say anyway. But I think, myself, it's a lie. And
    </p>
    <p>
     it doesn't seem right to slander a whole nation that way, anyhow. Now,
    </p>
    <p>
     then, you see what the material is, there in Siberia, for a republic.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He paused, and his breast began to heave and his eye to burn, under the
    </p>
    <p>
     impulse of strong emotion. Then his words began to stream forth, with
    </p>
    <p>
     constantly increasing energy and fire, and he rose to his feet as if to
    </p>
    <p>
     give himself larger freedom. “The minute I organize that republic, the
    </p>
    <p>
     light of liberty, intelligence, justice, humanity, bursting from it,
    </p>
    <p>
     flooding from it, flaming from it, will concentrate the gaze of the
    </p>
    <p>
     whole astonished world as upon the miracle of a new sun; Russia's
    </p>
    <p>
     countless multitudes of slaves will rise up and march, march!--eastward,
    </p>
    <p>
     with that great light transfiguring their faces as they come, and far
    </p>
    <p>
     back of them you will see-what will you see?--a vacant throne in an
    </p>
    <p>
     empty land! It can be done, and by God I will do it!”
    </p>
    <p>
     He stood a moment bereft of earthly consciousness by his exaltation;
    </p>
    <p>
     then consciousness returned, bringing him a slight shock, and he said
    </p>
    <p>
     with grave earnestness:
    </p>
    <p>
     “I must ask you to pardon me, Major Hawkins. I have never used that
    </p>
    <p>
     expression before, and I beg you will forgive it this time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins was quite willing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You see, Washington, it is an error which I am by nature not liable
    </p>
    <p>
     to. Only excitable people, impulsive people, are exposed to it. But
    </p>
    <p>
     the circumstances of the present case--I being a democrat by birth and
    </p>
    <p>
     preference, and an aristocrat by inheritance and relish--”
    </p>
    <p>
     The earl stopped suddenly, his frame stiffened, and he began to stare
    </p>
    <p>
     speechless through the curtainless window. Then he pointed, and gasped
    </p>
    <p>
     out a single rapturous word:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Look!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is it, Colonel?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “IT!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sure as you're born. Keep perfectly still. I'll apply the
    </p>
    <p>
     influence--I'll turn on all my force. I've brought It thus far--I'll
    </p>
    <p>
     fetch It right into the house. You'll see.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He was making all sorts of passes in the air with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     “There! Look at that. I've made It smile! See?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Quite true. Tracy, out for an afternoon stroll, had come unexpectantly
    </p>
    <p>
     upon his family arms displayed upon this shabby house-front. The
    </p>
    <p>
     hatchments made him smile; which was nothing, they had made the
    </p>
    <p>
     neighborhood cats do that.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Look, Hawkins, look! I'm drawing It over!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're drawing it sure, Rossmore. If I ever had any doubts about
    </p>
    <p>
     materialization, they're gone, now, and gone for good. Oh, this is a
    </p>
    <p>
     joyful day!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy was sauntering over to read the door-plate. Before he was half way
    </p>
    <p>
     over he was saying to himself, “Why, manifestly these are the American
    </p>
    <p>
     Claimant's quarters.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's coming--coming right along. I'll slide, down and pull It in. You
    </p>
    <p>
     follow after me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Sellers, pale and a good deal agitated, opened the door and confronted
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy. The old man could not at once get his voice: then he pumped out a
    </p>
    <p>
     scattering and hardly coherent salutation, and followed it with--
    </p>
    <p>
     “Walk in, walk right in, Mr.--er--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tracy--Howard Tracy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tracy--thanks--walk right in, you're expected.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy entered, considerably puzzled, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Expected? I think there must be some mistake.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, I judge not,” said Sellers, who--noticing that Hawkins had arrived,
    </p>
    <p>
     gave him a sidewise glance intended to call his close attention to a
    </p>
    <p>
     dramatic effect which he was proposing to produce by his next remark.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then he said, slowly and impressively--“I am--YOU KNOW WHO.”
    </p>
    <p>
     To the astonishment of both conspirators the remark produced no dramatic
    </p>
    <p>
     effect at all; for the new-comer responded with a quite innocent and
    </p>
    <p>
     unembarrassed air--
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, pardon me. I don't know who you are. I only suppose--but no doubt
    </p>
    <p>
     correctly--that you are the gentleman whose title is on the doorplate.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Right, quite right--sit down, pray sit down.” The earl was rattled,
    </p>
    <p>
     thrown off his bearings, his head was in a whirl. Then he noticed
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins standing apart and staring idiotically at what to him was the
    </p>
    <p>
     apparition of a defunct man, and a new idea was born to him. He said to
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy briskly:
    </p>
    <p>
     “But a thousand pardons, dear sir, I am forgetting courtesies due to a
    </p>
    <p>
     guest and stranger. Let me introduce my friend General Hawkins--General
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins, our new Senator--Senator from the latest and grandest addition
    </p>
    <p>
     to the radiant galaxy of sovereign States, Cherokee Strip”--(to himself,
    </p>
    <p>
     “that name will shrivel him up!”--but it didn't, in the least, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the Colonel resumed the introduction piteously disheartened and
    </p>
    <p>
     amazed),--“Senator Hawkins, Mr. Howard Tracy, of--er--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “England.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “England!--Why that's im--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “England, yes, native of England.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Recently from there?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, quite recently.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Said the Colonel to himself, “This phantom lies like an expert.
    </p>
    <p>
     Purifying this kind by fire don't work. I'll sound him a little further,
    </p>
    <p>
     give him another chance or two to work his gift.” Then aloud--with deep
    </p>
    <p>
     irony--
    </p>
    <p>
     “Visiting our great country for recreation and amusement, no doubt. I
    </p>
    <p>
     suppose you find that traveling in the majestic expanses of our Far West
    </p>
    <p>
     is--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I haven't been West, and haven't been devoting myself to amusement with
    </p>
    <p>
     any sort of exclusiveness, I assure you. In fact, to merely live, an
    </p>
    <p>
     artist has got to work, not play.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Artist!” said Hawkins to himself, thinking of the rifled bank; “that is
    </p>
    <p>
     a name for it!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you an artist?” asked the colonel; and added to himself, “now I'm
    </p>
    <p>
     going to catch him.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “In a humble way, yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What line?” pursued the sly veteran.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oils.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I've got him!” said Sellers to himself. Then aloud, “This is fortunate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Could I engage you to restore some of my paintings that need that
    </p>
    <p>
     attention?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I shall be very glad. Pray let me see them.”
    </p>
    <p>
     No shuffling, no evasion, no embarrassment, even under this crucial
    </p>
    <p>
     test. The Colonel was nonplussed. He led Tracy to a chromo which had
    </p>
    <p>
     suffered damage in a former owner's hands through being used as a lamp
    </p>
    <p>
     mat, and said, with a flourish of his hand toward the picture--
    </p>
    <p>
     “This del Sarto--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is that a del Sarto?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The colonel bent a look of reproach upon Tracy, allowed it to sink home,
    </p>
    <p>
     then resumed as if there had been no interruption--
    </p>
    <p>
     “This del Sarto is perhaps the only original of that sublime master
    </p>
    <p>
     in our country. You see, yourself, that the work is of such exceeding
    </p>
    <p>
     delicacy that the risk--could--er--would you mind giving me a little
    </p>
    <p>
     example of what you can do before we--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Cheerfully, cheerfully. I will copy one of these marvels.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Water-color materials--relics of Miss Sally's college life--were
    </p>
    <p>
     brought. Tracy said he was better in oils, but would take a chance with
    </p>
    <p>
     these. So he was left alone. He began his work, but the attractions
    </p>
    <p>
     of the place were too strong for him, and he got up and went drifting
    </p>
    <p>
     about, fascinated; also amazed.

    <p>
     Meantime the earl and Hawkins were holding a troubled and anxious
    </p>
    <p>
     private consultation. The earl said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “The mystery that bothers me, is, where did It get its other arm?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes--it worries me, too. And another thing troubles me--the apparition
    </p>
    <p>
     is English. How do you account for that, Colonel?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Honestly, I don't know, Hawkins, I don't really know. It is very
    </p>
    <p>
     confusing and awful.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't you think maybe we've waked up the wrong one?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “The wrong one? How do you account for the clothes?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “The clothes are right, there's no getting around it. What are we
    </p>
    <p>
     going to do? We can't collect, as I see. The reward is for a one-armed
    </p>
    <p>
     American. This is a two-armed Englishman.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, it may be that that is not objectionable. You see it isn't less
    </p>
    <p>
     than is called for, it is more, and so,--”
    </p>
    <p>
     But he saw that this argument was weak, and dropped it. The friends
    </p>
    <p>
     sat brooding over their perplexities some time in silence. Finally
    </p>
    <p>
     the earl's face began to glow with an inspiration, and he said,
    </p>
    <p>
     impressively:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hawkins, this materialization is a grander and nobler science than we
    </p>
    <p>
     have dreamed of. We have little imagined what a solemn and stupendous
    </p>
    <p>
     thing we have done. The whole secret is perfectly clear to me, now,
    </p>
    <p>
     clear as day. Every man is made up of heredities, long-descended
    </p>
    <p>
     atoms and particles of his ancestors. This present materialization is
    </p>
    <p>
     incomplete. We have only brought it down to perhaps the beginning of
    </p>
    <p>
     this century.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you mean, Colonel!” cried Hawkins, filled with vague alarms by
    </p>
    <p>
     the old man's awe-compelling words and manner.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This. We've materialized this burglar's ancestor!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, don't--don't say that. It's hideous.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But it's true, Hawkins, I know it. Look at the facts. This apparition
    </p>
    <p>
     is distinctly English--note that. It uses good grammar--note that. It
    </p>
    <p>
     is an Artist--note that. It has the manners and carriage of a
    </p>
    <p>
     gentleman--note that. Where's your cow-boy? Answer me that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rossmore, this is dreadful--it's too dreadful to think of!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Never resurrected a rag of that burglar but the clothes, not a solitary
    </p>
    <p>
     rag of him but the clothes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Colonel, do you really mean--”
    </p>
    <p>
     The Colonel brought his fist down with emphasis and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “I mean exactly this. This materialization was immature, the burglar has
    </p>
    <p>
     evaded us, this is nothing but a damned ancestor!”
    </p>
    <p>
     He rose and walked the floor in great excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins said plaintively:
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's a bitter disappointment--bitter.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know it. I know it, Senator; I feel it as deeply as anybody could.
    </p>
    <p>
     But we've got to submit--on moral grounds. I need money, but God knows I
    </p>
    <p>
     am not poor enough or shabby enough to be an accessory to the punishing
    </p>
    <p>
     of a man's ancestor for crimes committed by that ancestor's posterity.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But Colonel!” implored Hawkins; “stop and think; don't be rash; you
    </p>
    <p>
     know it's the only chance we've got to get the money; and besides, the
    </p>
    <p>
     Bible itself says posterity to the fourth generation shall be punished
    </p>
    <p>
     for the sins and crimes committed by ancestors four generations back
    </p>
    <p>
     that hadn't anything to do with them; and so it's only fair to turn the
    </p>
    <p>
     rule around and make it work both ways.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The Colonel was struck with the strong logic of this position. He strode
    </p>
    <p>
     up and down, and thought it painfully over. Finally he said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “There's reason in it; yes, there's reason in it. And so, although it
    </p>
    <p>
     seems a piteous thing to sweat this poor ancient devil for a burglary he
    </p>
    <p>
     hadn't the least hand in, still if duty commands I suppose we must give
    </p>
    <p>
     him up to the authorities.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I would,” said Hawkins, cheered and relieved, “I'd give him up if he
    </p>
    <p>
     was a thousand ancestors compacted into one.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Lord bless me, that's just what he is,” said Sellers, with something
    </p>
    <p>
     like a groan, “it's exactly what he is; there's a contribution in
    </p>
    <p>
     him from every ancestor he ever had. In him there's atoms of priests,
    </p>
    <p>
     soldiers, crusaders, poets, and sweet and gracious women--all kinds
    </p>
    <p>
     and conditions of folk who trod this earth in old, old centuries, and
    </p>
    <p>
     vanished out of it ages ago, and now by act of ours they are summoned
    </p>
    <p>
     from their holy peace to answer for gutting a one-horse bank away out on
    </p>
    <p>
     the borders of Cherokee Strip, and it's just a howling outrage!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, don't talk like that, Colonel; it takes the heart all out of me,
    </p>
    <p>
     and makes me ashamed of the part I am proposing to--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait--I've got it!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “A saving hope? Shout it out, I am perishing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's perfectly simple; a child would have thought of it. He is all
    </p>
    <p>
     right, not a flaw in him, as far as I have carried the work. If I've
    </p>
    <p>
     been able to bring him as far as the beginning of this century, what's
    </p>
    <p>
     to stop me now? I'll go on and materialize him down to date.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Land, I never thought of that!” said Hawkins all ablaze with joy again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's the very thing. What a brain you have got! And will he shed the
    </p>
    <p>
     superfluous arm?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “He will.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And lose his English accent?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It will wholly disappear. He will speak Cherokee Strip--and other forms
    </p>
    <p>
     of profanity.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Colonel, maybe he'll confess!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Confess? Merely that bank robbery?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Merely? Yes, but why 'merely'?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The Colonel said in his most impressive manner: “Hawkins, he will be
    </p>
    <p>
     wholly under my command. I will make him confess every crime he ever
    </p>
    <p>
     committed. There must be a thousand. Do you get the idea?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well--not quite.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “The rewards will come to us.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Prodigious conception! I never saw such a head for seeing with a
    </p>
    <p>
     lightning glance all the outlying ramifications and possibilities of a
    </p>
    <p>
     central idea.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It is nothing; it comes natural to me. When his time is out in one jail
    </p>
    <p>
     he goes to the next and the next, and we shall have nothing to do but
    </p>
    <p>
     collect the rewards as he goes along. It is a perfectly steady income
    </p>
    <p>
     as long as we live, Hawkins. And much better than other kinds of
    </p>
    <p>
     investments, because he is indestructible.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It looks--it really does look the way you say; it does indeed.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Look?--why it is. It will not be denied that I have had a pretty wide
    </p>
    <p>
     and comprehensive financial experience, and I do not hesitate to say
    </p>
    <p>
     that I consider this one of the most valuable properties I have ever
    </p>
    <p>
     controlled.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you really think so?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I do, indeed.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “O, Colonel, the wasting grind and grief of poverty! If we could realize
    </p>
    <p>
     immediately. I don't mean sell it all, but sell part--enough, you know,
    </p>
    <p>
     to--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “See how you tremble with excitement. That comes of lack of experience.
    </p>
    <p>
     My boy, when you have been familiar with vast operations as long as I
    </p>
    <p>
     have, you'll be different. Look at me; is my eye dilated? do you notice
    </p>
    <p>
     a quiver anywhere? Feel my pulse: plunk-plunk-plunk--same as if I were
    </p>
    <p>
     asleep. And yet, what is passing through my calm cold mind? A procession
    </p>
    <p>
     of figures which would make a financial novice drunk just the sight of
    </p>
    <p>
     them. Now it is by keeping cool, and looking at a thing all around,
    </p>
    <p>
     that a man sees what's really in it, and saves himself from the novice's
    </p>
    <p>
     unfailing mistake--the one you've just suggested--eagerness to realize.
    </p>
    <p>
     Listen to me. Your idea is to sell a part of him for ready cash. Now
    </p>
    <p>
     mine is--guess.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I haven't an idea. What is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Stock him--of course.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I should never have thought of that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because you are not a financier. Say he has committed a thousand
    </p>
    <p>
     crimes. Certainly that's a low estimate. By the look of him, even in
    </p>
    <p>
     his unfinished condition, he has committed all of a million. But call it
    </p>
    <p>
     only a thousand to be perfectly safe; five thousand reward, multiplied
    </p>
    <p>
     by a thousand, gives us a dead sure cash basis of--what? Five million
    </p>
    <p>
     dollars!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait--let me get my breath.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And the property indestructible. Perpetually fruitful--perpetually; for
    </p>
    <p>
     a property with his disposition will go on committing crimes and winning
    </p>
    <p>
     rewards.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You daze me, you make my head whirl!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let it whirl, it won't do it any harm. Now that matter is all
    </p>
    <p>
     fixed--leave it alone. I'll get up the company and issue the stock,
    </p>
    <p>
     all in good time. Just leave it in my hands. I judge you don't doubt my
    </p>
    <p>
     ability to work it up for all it is worth.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Indeed I don't. I can say that with truth.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “All right, then. That's disposed of. Everything in its turn. We old
    </p>
    <p>
     operators, go by order and system--no helter-skelter business with
    </p>
    <p>
     us. What's the next thing on the docket? The carrying on of the
    </p>
    <p>
     materialization--the bringing it down to date. I will begin on that at
    </p>
    <p>
     once. I think--
    </p>
    <p>
     “Look here, Rossmore. You didn't lock It in. A hundred to one it has
    </p>
    <p>
     escaped!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Calm yourself, as to that; don't give yourself any uneasiness.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But why shouldn't it escape?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let it, if it wants to. What of it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I should consider it a pretty serious calamity.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why, my dear boy, once in my power, always in my power. It may go
    </p>
    <p>
     and come freely. I can produce it here whenever I want it, just by the
    </p>
    <p>
     exercise of my will.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I am truly glad to hear that, I do assure you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, I shall give it all the painting it wants to do, and we and the
    </p>
    <p>
     family will make it as comfortable and contented as we can. No occasion
    </p>
    <p>
     to restrain its movements. I hope to persuade it to remain pretty
    </p>
    <p>
     quiet, though, because a materialization which is in a state of
    </p>
    <p>
     arrested development must of necessity be pretty soft and flabby and
    </p>
    <p>
     substanceless, and--er--by the way, I wonder where It comes from?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How? What do you mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The earl pointed significantly--and interrogatively toward the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins started; then settled into deep reflection; finally shook his
    </p>
    <p>
     head sorrowfully and pointed downwards.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What makes you think so, Washington?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I hardly know, but really you can see, yourself, that he doesn't
    </p>
    <p>
     seem to be pining for his last place.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's well thought! Soundly deduced. We've done that Thing a favor. But
    </p>
    <p>
     I believe I will pump it a little, in a quiet way, and find out if we
    </p>
    <p>
     are right.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How long is it going to take to finish him off and fetch him down to
    </p>
    <p>
     date, Colonel?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wish I knew, but I don't. I am clear knocked out by this new
    </p>
    <p>
     detail--this unforeseen necessity of working a subject down gradually
    </p>
    <p>
     from his condition of ancestor to his ultimate result as posterity. But
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll make him hump himself, anyway.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rossmore!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, dear. We're in the laboratory. Come--Hawkins is here. Mind, now
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins--he's a sound, living, human being to all the family--don't
    </p>
    <p>
     forget that. Here she comes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Keep your seats, I'm not coming in. I just wanted to ask, who is it
    </p>
    <p>
     that's painting down there?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That? Oh, that's a young artist; young Englishman, named Tracy; very
    </p>
    <p>
     promising--favorite pupil of Hans Christian Andersen or one of the other
    </p>
    <p>
     old masters--Andersen I'm pretty sure it is; he's going to half-sole
    </p>
    <p>
     some of our old Italian masterpieces. Been talking to him?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, only a word. I stumbled right in on him without expecting anybody
    </p>
    <p>
     was there. I tried to be polite to him; offered him a snack”--(Sellers
    </p>
    <p>
     delivered a large wink to Hawkins from behind his hand), “but he
    </p>
    <p>
     declined, and said he wasn't hungry” (another sarcastic wink); “so I
    </p>
    <p>
     brought some apples” (doublewink), “and he ate a couple of--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What!” and the colonel sprang some yards toward the ceiling and came
    </p>
    <p>
     down quaking with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lady Rossmore was smitten dumb with amazement. She gazed at the sheepish
    </p>
    <p>
     relic of Cherokee Strip, then at her husband, and then at the guest
    </p>
    <p>
     again. Finally she said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is the matter with you, Mulberry?”
    </p>
    <p>
     He did not answer immediately. His back was turned; he was bending over
    </p>
    <p>
     his chair, feeling the seat of it. But he answered next moment, and
    </p>
    <p>
     said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ah, there it is; it was a tack.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The lady contemplated him doubtfully a moment, then said, pretty
    </p>
    <p>
     snappishly:
    </p>
    <p>
     “All that for a tack! Praise goodness it wasn't a shingle nail, it would
    </p>
    <p>
     have landed you in the Milky Way. I do hate to have my nerves shook up
    </p>
    <p>
     so.” And she turned on her heel and went her way.
    </p>
    <p>
     As soon as she was safely out, the Colonel said, in a suppressed voice:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come--we must see for ourselves. It must be a mistake.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They hurried softly down and peeped in. Sellers whispered, in a sort of
    </p>
    <p>
     despair--
    </p>
    <p>
     It is eating! What a grisly spectacle! Hawkins it's horrible! Take me
    </p>
    <p>
     away--I can't stand it.
    </p>
    <p>
     They tottered back to the laboratory.

     CHAPTER XX.
    </head>
    <p>
     Tracy made slow progress with his work, for his mind wandered a good
    </p>
    <p>
     deal. Many things were puzzling him. Finally a light burst upon him all
    </p>
    <p>
     of a sudden--seemed to, at any rate--and he said to himself, “I've got
    </p>
    <p>
     the clew at last--this man's mind is off its balance; I don't know how
    </p>
    <p>
     much, but it's off a point or two, sure; off enough to explain this mess
    </p>
    <p>
     of perplexities, anyway. These dreadful chromos which he takes for old
    </p>
    <p>
     masters; these villainous portraits--which to his frantic mind represent
    </p>
    <p>
     Rossmores; the hatchments; the pompous name of this ramshackle old
    </p>
    <p>
     crib--Rossmore Towers; and that odd assertion of his, that I was
    </p>
    <p>
     expected. How could I be expected? that is, Lord Berkeley. He knows by
    </p>
    <p>
     the papers that that person was burned up in the New Gadsby. Why, hang
    </p>
    <p>
     it, he really doesn't know who he was expecting; for his talk showed
    </p>
    <p>
     that he was not expecting an Englishman, or yet an artist, yet I answer
    </p>
    <p>
     his requirements notwithstanding. He seems sufficiently satisfied with
    </p>
    <p>
     me. Yes, he is a little off; in fact I am afraid he is a good deal
    </p>
    <p>
     off, poor old gentleman. But he's interesting--all people in about his
    </p>
    <p>
     condition are, I suppose. I hope he'll like my work; I would like to
    </p>
    <p>
     come every day and study him. And when I write my father--ah, that
    </p>
    <p>
     hurts! I mustn't get on that subject; it isn't good for my spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
     Somebody coming--I must get to work. It's the old gentleman again. He
    </p>
    <p>
     looks bothered. Maybe my clothes are suspicious; and they are--for an
    </p>
    <p>
     artist. If my conscience would allow me to make a change, but that is
    </p>
    <p>
     out of the question. I wonder what he's making those passes in the air
    </p>
    <p>
     for, with his hands. I seem to be the object of them. Can he be trying
    </p>
    <p>
     to mesmerize me? I don't quite like it. There's something uncanny about
    </p>
    <p>
     it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The colonel muttered to himself, “It has an effect on him, I can see it
    </p>
    <p>
     myself. That's enough for one time, I reckon. He's not very solid, yet,
    </p>
    <p>
     I suppose, and I might disintegrate him. I'll just put a sly question
    </p>
    <p>
     or two at him, now, and see if I can find out what his condition is, and
    </p>
    <p>
     where he's from.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He approached and said affably:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't let me disturb you, Mr. Tracy; I only want to take a little
    </p>
    <p>
     glimpse of your work. Ah, that's fine--that's very fine indeed. You are
    </p>
    <p>
     doing it elegantly. My daughter will be charmed with this. May I sit
    </p>
    <p>
     down by you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, do; I shall be glad.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It won't disturb you? I mean, won't dissipate your inspirations?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy laughed and said they were not ethereal enough to be very easily
    </p>
    <p>
     discommoded.
    </p>
    <p>
     The colonel asked a number of cautious and well-considered
    </p>
    <p>
     questions--questions which seemed pretty odd and flighty to Tracy--but
    </p>
    <p>
     the answers conveyed the information desired, apparently, for the
    </p>
    <p>
     colonel said to himself, with mixed pride and gratification:
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's a good job as far as I've got with it. He's solid. Solid and going
    </p>
    <p>
     to last, solid as the real thing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's wonderful--wonderful. I believe I could--petrify him.” After a
    </p>
    <p>
     little he asked, warily “Do you prefer being here, or--or there?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “There? Where?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why--er--where you've been?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy's thought flew to his boarding-house, and he answered with
    </p>
    <p>
     decision.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, here, much!”
    </p>
    <p>
     The colonel was startled, and said to himself, “There's no uncertain
    </p>
    <p>
     ring about that. It indicates where he's been to, poor fellow. Well, I
    </p>
    <p>
     am satisfied, now. I'm glad I got him out.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He sat thinking, and thinking, and watching the brush go. At length he
    </p>
    <p>
     said to himself, “Yes, it certainly seems to account for the failure of
    </p>
    <p>
     my endeavors in poor Berkeley's case. He went in the other direction.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, it's all right. He's better off.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Sally Sellers entered from the street, now, looking her divinest, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the artist was introduced to her. It was a violent case of mutual love
    </p>
    <p>
     at first sight, though neither party was entirely aware of the fact,
    </p>
    <p>
     perhaps. The Englishman made this irrelevant remark to himself, “Perhaps
    </p>
    <p>
     he is not insane, after all.” Sally sat down, and showed an interest in
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy's work which greatly pleased him, and a benevolent forgiveness of
    </p>
    <p>
     it which convinced him that the girl's nature was cast in a large mould.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sellers was anxious to report his discoveries to Hawkins; so he took
    </p>
    <p>
     his leave, saying that if the two “young devotees of the colored Muse”
    </p>
    <p>
     thought they could manage without him, he would go and look after his
    </p>
    <p>
     affairs. The artist said to himself, “I think he is a little eccentric,
    </p>
    <p>
     perhaps, but that is all.” He reproached himself for having injuriously
    </p>
    <p>
     judged a man without giving him any fair chance to show what he really
    </p>
    <p>
     was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course the stranger was very soon at his ease and chatting along
    </p>
    <p>
     comfortably. The average American girl possesses the valuable qualities
    </p>
    <p>
     of naturalness, honesty, and inoffensive straightforwardness; she
    </p>
    <p>
     is nearly barren of troublesome conventions and artificialities,
    </p>
    <p>
     consequently her presence and her ways are unembarrassing, and one is
    </p>
    <p>
     acquainted with her and on the pleasantest terms with her before
    </p>
    <p>
     he knows how it came about. This new acquaintanceship--friendship,
    </p>
    <p>
     indeed--progressed swiftly; and the unusual swiftness of it, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     thoroughness of it are sufficiently evidenced and established by one
    </p>
    <p>
     noteworthy fact--that within the first half hour both parties had
    </p>
    <p>
     ceased to be conscious of Tracy's clothes. Later this consciousness
    </p>
    <p>
     was re-awakened; it was then apparent to Gwendolen that she was almost
    </p>
    <p>
     reconciled to them, and it was apparent to Tracy that he wasn't. The
    </p>
    <p>
     re-awakening was brought about by Gwendolen's inviting the artist to
    </p>
    <p>
     stay to dinner. He had to decline, because he wanted to live, now--that
    </p>
    <p>
     is, now that there was something to live for--and he could not survive
    </p>
    <p>
     in those clothes at a gentleman's table. He thought he knew that. But he
    </p>
    <p>
     went away happy, for he saw that Gwendolen was disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
     And whither did he go? He went straight to a slopshop and bought as neat
    </p>
    <p>
     and reasonably well-fitting a suit of clothes as an Englishman could be
    </p>
    <p>
     persuaded to wear. He said--to himself, but at his conscience--“I know
    </p>
    <p>
     it's wrong; but it would be wrong not to do it; and two wrongs do not
    </p>
    <p>
     make a right.”
    </p>
    <p>
     This satisfied him, and made his heart light. Perhaps it will also
    </p>
    <p>
     satisfy the reader--if he can make out what it means.
    </p>
    <p>
     The old people were troubled about Gwendolen at dinner, because she was
    </p>
    <p>
     so distraught and silent. If they had noticed, they would have found
    </p>
    <p>
     that she was sufficiently alert and interested whenever the talk
    </p>
    <p>
     stumbled upon the artist and his work; but they didn't notice, and so
    </p>
    <p>
     the chat would swap around to some other subject, and then somebody
    </p>
    <p>
     would presently be privately worrying about Gwendolen again, and
    </p>
    <p>
     wondering if she were not well, or if something had gone wrong in
    </p>
    <p>
     the millinery line. Her mother offered her various reputable patent
    </p>
    <p>
     medicines, and tonics with iron and other hardware in them, and her
    </p>
    <p>
     father even proposed to send out for wine, relentless prohibitionist
    </p>
    <p>
     and head of the order in the District of Columbia as he was, but these
    </p>
    <p>
     kindnesses were all declined--thankfully, but with decision. At bedtime,
    </p>
    <p>
     when the family were breaking up for the night, she privately looted one
    </p>
    <p>
     of the brushes, saying to herself, “It's the one he has used, the most.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The next morning Tracy went forth wearing his new suit, and equipped
    </p>
    <p>
     with a pink in his button-hole--a daily attention from Puss. His
    </p>
    <p>
     whole soul was full of Gwendolen Sellers, and this condition was an
    </p>
    <p>
     inspiration, art-wise. All the morning his brush pawed nimbly away at
    </p>
    <p>
     the canvases, almost without his awarity--awarity, in this sense being
    </p>
    <p>
     the sense of being aware, though disputed by some authorities--turning
    </p>
    <p>
     out marvel upon marvel, in the way of decorative accessories to the
    </p>
    <p>
     portraits, with a felicity and celerity which amazed the veterans of the
    </p>
    <p>
     firm and fetched out of them continuous explosions of applause.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meantime Gwendolen was losing her morning, and many dollars. She
    </p>
    <p>
     supposed Tracy was coming in the forenoon--a conclusion which she had
    </p>
    <p>
     jumped to without outside help. So she tripped down stairs every little
    </p>
    <p>
     while from her work-parlor to arrange the brushes and things over again,
    </p>
    <p>
     and see if he had arrived. And when she was in her work-parlor it was
    </p>
    <p>
     not profitable, but just the other way--as she found out to her sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had put in her idle moments during the last little while back, in
    </p>
    <p>
     designing a particularly rare and capable gown for herself, and this
    </p>
    <p>
     morning she set about making it up; but she was absent minded, and made
    </p>
    <p>
     an irremediable botch of it. When she saw what she had done, she knew
    </p>
    <p>
     the reason of it and the meaning of it; and she put her work away from
    </p>
    <p>
     her and said she would accept the sign. And from that time forth she
    </p>
    <p>
     came no more away from the Audience Chamber, but remained there and
    </p>
    <p>
     waited. After luncheon she waited again. A whole hour. Then a great
    </p>
    <p>
     joy welled up in her heart, for she saw him coming. So she flew back
    </p>
    <p>
     up stairs thankful, and could hardly wait for him to miss the principal
    </p>
    <p>
     brush, which she had mislaid down there, but knew where she had mislaid
    </p>
    <p>
     it. However, all in good time the others were called in and couldn't
    </p>
    <p>
     find the brush, and then she was sent for, and she couldn't find it
    </p>
    <p>
     herself for some little time; but then she found it when the others had
    </p>
    <p>
     gone away to hunt in the kitchen and down cellar and in the woodshed,
    </p>
    <p>
     and all those other places where people look for things whose ways they
    </p>
    <p>
     are not familiar with. So she gave him the brush, and remarked that
    </p>
    <p>
     she ought to have seen that everything was ready for him, but it hadn't
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed necessary, because it was so early that she wasn't expecting--but
    </p>
    <p>
     she stopped there, surprised at herself for what she was saying; and
    </p>
    <p>
     he felt caught and ashamed, and said to himself, “I knew my impatience
    </p>
    <p>
     would drag me here before I was expected, and betray me, and that is
    </p>
    <p>
     just what it has done; she sees straight through me--and is laughing at
    </p>
    <p>
     me, inside, of course.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Gwendolen was very much pleased, on one account, and a little the other
    </p>
    <p>
     way in another; pleased with the new clothes and the improvement
    </p>
    <p>
     which they had achieved; less pleased by the pink in the buttonhole.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yesterday's pink had hardly interested her; this one was just like it,
    </p>
    <p>
     but somehow it had got her immediate attention, and kept it. She wished
    </p>
    <p>
     she could think of some way of getting at its history in a properly
    </p>
    <p>
     colorless and indifferent way. Presently she made a venture. She said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whatever a man's age may be, he can reduce it several years by putting
    </p>
    <p>
     a bright-colored flower in his button-hole. I have often noticed that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Is that your sex's reason for wearing a boutonniere?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I fancy not, but certainly that reason would be a sufficient one. I've
    </p>
    <p>
     never heard of the idea before.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You seem to prefer pinks. Is it on account of the color, or the form?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh no,” he said, simply, “they are given to me. I don't think I have
    </p>
    <p>
     any preference.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “They are given to him,” she said to herself, and she felt a coldness
    </p>
    <p>
     toward that pink. “I wonder who it is, and what she is like.” The flower
    </p>
    <p>
     began to take up a good deal of room; it obtruded itself everywhere,
    </p>
    <p>
     it intercepted all views, and marred them; it was becoming exceedingly
    </p>
    <p>
     annoying and conspicuous for a little thing. “I wonder if he cares for
    </p>
    <p>
     her.” That thought gave her a quite definite pain.

    <p>
     She had made everything comfortable for the artist; there was no further
    </p>
    <p>
     pretext for staying. So she said she would go, now, and asked him to
    </p>
    <p>
     summon the servants in case he should need anything. She went away
    </p>
    <p>
     unhappy; and she left unhappiness behind her; for she carried away all
    </p>
    <p>
     the sunshine. The time dragged heavily for both, now. He couldn't paint
    </p>
    <p>
     for thinking of her; she couldn't design or millinerize with any heart,
    </p>
    <p>
     for thinking of him. Never before had painting seemed so empty to him,
    </p>
    <p>
     never before had millinerizing seemed so void of interest to her. She
    </p>
    <p>
     had gone without repeating that dinner-invitation--an almost unendurable
    </p>
    <p>
     disappointment to him. On her part-well, she was suffering, too; for she
    </p>
    <p>
     had found she couldn't invite him. It was not hard yesterday, but it was
    </p>
    <p>
     impossible to-day. A thousand innocent privileges seemed to have been
    </p>
    <p>
     filched from her unawares in the past twenty-four hours. To-day she
    </p>
    <p>
     felt strangely hampered, restrained of her liberty. To-day she couldn't
    </p>
    <p>
     propose to herself to do anything or say anything concerning this young
    </p>
    <p>
     man without being instantly paralyzed into non-action by the fear that
    </p>
    <p>
     he might “suspect.” Invite him to dinner to-day? It made her shiver to
    </p>
    <p>
     think of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     And so her afternoon was one long fret. Broken at intervals. Three times
    </p>
    <p>
     she had to go down stairs on errands--that is, she thought she had to go
    </p>
    <p>
     down stairs on errands. Thus, going and coming, she had six glimpses of
    </p>
    <p>
     him, in the aggregate, without seeming to look in his direction; and she
    </p>
    <p>
     tried to endure these electric ecstasies without showing any sign, but
    </p>
    <p>
     they fluttered her up a good deal, and she felt that the naturalness
    </p>
    <p>
     she was putting on was overdone and quite too frantically sober and
    </p>
    <p>
     hysterically calm to deceive.
    </p>
    <p>
     The painter had his share of the rapture; he had his six glimpses, and
    </p>
    <p>
     they smote him with waves of pleasure that assaulted him, beat upon him,
    </p>
    <p>
     washed over him deliciously, and drowned out all consciousness of what
    </p>
    <p>
     he was doing with his brush. So there were six places in his canvas
    </p>
    <p>
     which had to be done over again.
    </p>
    <p>
     At last Gwendolen got some peace of mind by sending word to the
    </p>
    <p>
     Thompsons, in the neighborhood, that she was coming there to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wouldn't be reminded, at that table, that there was an absentee
    </p>
    <p>
     who ought to be a presentee--a word which she meant to look out in the
    </p>
    <p>
     dictionary at a calmer time.
    </p>
    <p>
     About this time the old earl dropped in for a chat with the artist, and
    </p>
    <p>
     invited him to stay to dinner. Tracy cramped down his joy and gratitude
    </p>
    <p>
     by a sudden and powerful exercise of all his forces; and he felt that
    </p>
    <p>
     now that he was going to be close to Gwendolen, and hear her voice and
    </p>
    <p>
     watch her face during several precious hours, earth had nothing valuable
    </p>
    <p>
     to add to his life for the present.
    </p>
    <p>
     The earl said to himself, “This spectre can eat apples, apparently. We
    </p>
    <p>
     shall find out, now, if that is a specialty. I think, myself, it's a
    </p>
    <p>
     specialty. Apples, without doubt, constitute the spectral limit. It was
    </p>
    <p>
     the case with our first parents. No, I am wrong--at least only partly
    </p>
    <p>
     right. The line was drawn at apples, just as in the present case, but
    </p>
    <p>
     it was from the other direction.” The new clothes gave him a thrill of
    </p>
    <p>
     pleasure and pride. He said to himself, “I've got part of him down to
    </p>
    <p>
     date, anyway.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Sellers said he was pleased with Tracy's work; and he went on and
    </p>
    <p>
     engaged him to restore his old masters, and said he should also want him
    </p>
    <p>
     to paint his portrait and his wife's and possibly his daughter's.
    </p>
    <p>
     The tide of the artist's happiness was at flood, now. The chat flowed
    </p>
    <p>
     pleasantly along while Tracy painted and Sellers carefully unpacked a
    </p>
    <p>
     picture which he had brought with him. It was a chromo; a new one,
    </p>
    <p>
     just out. It was the smirking, self-satisfied portrait of a man who was
    </p>
    <p>
     inundating the Union with advertisements inviting everybody to buy his
    </p>
    <p>
     specialty, which was a three-dollar shoe or a dress-suit or something
    </p>
    <p>
     of that kind. The old gentleman rested the chromo flat upon his lap and
    </p>
    <p>
     gazed down tenderly upon it, and became silent and meditative. Presently
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy noticed that he was dripping tears on it. This touched the young
    </p>
    <p>
     fellow's sympathetic nature, and at the same time gave him the painful
    </p>
    <p>
     sense of being an intruder upon a sacred privacy, an observer of
    </p>
    <p>
     emotions which a stranger ought not to witness. But his pity rose
    </p>
    <p>
     superior to other considerations, and compelled him to try to comfort
    </p>
    <p>
     the old mourner with kindly words and a show of friendly interest. He
    </p>
    <p>
     said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am very sorry--is it a friend whom--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ah, more than that, far more than that--a relative, the dearest I had
    </p>
    <p>
     on earth, although I was never permitted to see him. Yes, it is young
    </p>
    <p>
     Lord Berkeley, who perished so heroically in the awful conflagration.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why what is the matter?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, nothing, nothing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It was a little startling to be so suddenly brought face to face, so
    </p>
    <p>
     to speak, with a person one has heard so much talk about. Is it a good
    </p>
    <p>
     likeness?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Without doubt, yes. I never saw him, but you can easily see the
    </p>
    <p>
     resemblance to his father,” said Sellers, holding up the chromo and
    </p>
    <p>
     glancing from it to the chromo misrepresenting the Usurping Earl and
    </p>
    <p>
     back again with an approving eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, no--I am not sure that I make out the likeness. It is plain that
    </p>
    <p>
     the Usurping Earl there has a great deal of character and a long
    </p>
    <p>
     face like a horse's, whereas his heir here is smirky, moon-faced and
    </p>
    <p>
     characterless.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We are all that way in the beginning--all the line,” said Sellers,
    </p>
    <p>
     undisturbed. “We all start as moonfaced fools, then later we tadpole
    </p>
    <p>
     along into horse-faced marvels of intellect and character. It is by that
    </p>
    <p>
     sign and by that fact that I detect the resemblance here and know this
    </p>
    <p>
     portrait to be genuine and perfect. Yes, all our family are fools at
    </p>
    <p>
     first.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “This young man seems to meet the hereditary requirement, certainly.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, yes, he was a fool, without any doubt. Examine the face, the
    </p>
    <p>
     shape of the head, the expression. It's all fool, fool, fool, straight
    </p>
    <p>
     through.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thanks,--” said Tracy, involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thanks?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I mean for explaining it to me. Go on, please.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “As I was saying, fool is printed all over the face. A body can even
    </p>
    <p>
     read the details.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do they say?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, added up, he is a wobbler.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “A which?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wobbler. A person that's always taking a firm stand about something or
    </p>
    <p>
     other--kind of a Gibraltar stand, he thinks, for unshakable fidelity
    </p>
    <p>
     and everlastingness--and then, inside of a little while, he begins to
    </p>
    <p>
     wobble; no more Gibraltar there; no, sir, a mighty ordinary commonplace
    </p>
    <p>
     weakling wobbling around on stilts. That's Lord Berkeley to a dot, you
    </p>
    <p>
     can see it--look at that sheep! But,--why are you blushing like sunset!
    </p>
    <p>
     Dear sir, have I unwittingly offended in some way?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, no indeed, no indeed. Far from it. But it always makes me blush to
    </p>
    <p>
     hear a man revile his own blood.” He said to himself, “How strangely his
    </p>
    <p>
     vagrant and unguided fancies have hit upon the truth. By accident, he
    </p>
    <p>
     has described me. I am that contemptible thing. When I left England I
    </p>
    <p>
     thought I knew myself; I thought I was a very Frederick the Great for
    </p>
    <p>
     resolution and staying capacity; whereas in truth I am just a Wobbler,
    </p>
    <p>
     simply a Wobbler. Well--after all, it is at least creditable to have
    </p>
    <p>
     high ideals and give birth to lofty resolutions; I will allow myself
    </p>
    <p>
     that comfort.” Then he said, aloud, “Could this sheep, as you call him,
    </p>
    <p>
     breed a great and self-sacrificing idea in his head, do you think?
    </p>
    <p>
     Could he meditate such a thing, for instance, as the renunciation of the
    </p>
    <p>
     earldom and its wealth and its glories, and voluntary retirement to
    </p>
    <p>
     the ranks of the commonalty, there to rise by his own merit or remain
    </p>
    <p>
     forever poor and obscure?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Could he? Why, look at him--look at this simpering self-righteous mug!
    </p>
    <p>
     There is your answer. It's the very thing he would think of. And he
    </p>
    <p>
     would start in to do it, too.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And then?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “He'd wobble.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And back down?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Every time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is that to happen with all my--I mean would that happen to all his high
    </p>
    <p>
     resolutions?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh certainly--certainly. It's the Rossmore of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then this creature was fortunate to die! Suppose, for argument's sake,
    </p>
    <p>
     that I was a Rossmore, and--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It can't be done.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because it's not a supposable case. To be a Rossmore at your age,
    </p>
    <p>
     you'd have to be a fool, and you're not a fool. And you'd have to be a
    </p>
    <p>
     Wobbler, whereas anybody that is an expert in reading character can see
    </p>
    <p>
     at a glance that when you set your foot down once, it's there to stay;
    </p>
    <p>
     and earthquake can't wobble it.” He added to himself, “That's enough to
    </p>
    <p>
     say to him, but it isn't half strong enough for the facts. The more I
    </p>
    <p>
     observe him, now, the more remarkable I find him. It is the strongest
    </p>
    <p>
     face I have ever examined. There is almost superhuman firmness here,
    </p>
    <p>
     immovable purpose, iron steadfastness of will. A most extraordinary
    </p>
    <p>
     young man.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He presently said, aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Some time I want to ask your advice about a little matter, Mr. Tracy.
    </p>
    <p>
     You see, I've got that young lord's remains--my goodness, how you jump!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, it's nothing, pray go on. You've got his remains?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you sure they are his, and not somebody else's?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, perfectly sure. Samples, I mean. Not all of him.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Samples?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes--in baskets. Some time you will be going home; and if you wouldn't
    </p>
    <p>
     mind taking them along--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who? I?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes--certainly. I don't mean now; but after a while; after--but look
    </p>
    <p>
     here, would you like to see them?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No! Most certainly not. I don't want to see them.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “O, very well. I only thought--hey, where are you going, dear?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Out to dinner, papa.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy was aghast. The colonel said, in a disappointed voice:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I'm sorry. Sho, I didn't know she was going out, Mr. Tracy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Gwendolen's face began to take on a sort of apprehensive
    </p>
    <p>
     'What-have-I-done expression.'
    </p>
    <p>
     “Three old people to one young one--well, it isn't a good team, that's a
    </p>
    <p>
     fact.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Gwendolen's face betrayed a dawning hopefulness and she said--with a
    </p>
    <p>
     tone of reluctance which hadn't the hall-mark on it:
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you prefer, I will send word to the Thompsons that I--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, is it the Thompsons? That simplifies it--sets everything right. We
    </p>
    <p>
     can fix it without spoiling your arrangements, my child. You've got your
    </p>
    <p>
     heart set on--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But papa, I'd just as soon go there some other--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No--I won't have it. You are a good hard-working darling child, and
    </p>
    <p>
     your father is not the man to disappoint you when you--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But papa, I--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Go along, I won't hear a word. We'll get along, dear.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Gwendolen was ready to cry with vexation. But there was nothing to do
    </p>
    <p>
     but start; which she was about to do when her father hit upon an idea
    </p>
    <p>
     which filled him with delight because it so deftly covered all the
    </p>
    <p>
     difficulties of the situation and made things smooth and satisfactory:
    </p>
    <p>
     “I've got it, my love, so that you won't be robbed of your holiday and
    </p>
    <p>
     at the same time we'll be pretty satisfactorily fixed for a good time
    </p>
    <p>
     here. You send Belle Thompson here--perfectly beautiful creature, Tracy,
    </p>
    <p>
     perfectly beautiful; I want you to see that girl; why, you'll just go
    </p>
    <p>
     mad; you'll go mad inside of a minute; yes, you send her right along,
    </p>
    <p>
     Gwendolen, and tell her--why, she's gone!” He turned--she was already
    </p>
    <p>
     passing out at the gate. He muttered, “I wonder what's the matter;
    </p>
    <p>
     I don't know what her mouth's doing, but I think her shoulders
    </p>
    <p>
     are swearing. Well,” said Sellers blithely to Tracy, “I shall miss
    </p>
    <p>
     her--parents always miss the children as soon as they're out of sight,
    </p>
    <p>
     it's only a natural and wisely ordained partiality--but you'll be all
    </p>
    <p>
     right, because Miss Belle will supply the youthful element for you and
    </p>
    <p>
     to your entire content; and we old people will do our best, too. We
    </p>
    <p>
     shall have a good enough time. And you'll have a chance to get better
    </p>
    <p>
     acquainted with Admiral Hawkins. That's a rare character, Mr. Tracy--one
    </p>
    <p>
     of the rarest and most engaging characters the world has produced.
    </p>
    <p>
     You'll find him worth studying. I've studied him ever since he was a
    </p>
    <p>
     child and have always found him developing. I really consider that one
    </p>
    <p>
     of the main things that have enabled me to master the difficult science
    </p>
    <p>
     of character-reading was the vivid interest I always felt in that boy
    </p>
    <p>
     and the baffling inscrutabilities of his ways and inspirations.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy was not hearing a word. His spirits were gone, he was desolate.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, a most wonderful character. Concealment--that's the basis of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Always the first thing you want to do is to find the keystone a man's
    </p>
    <p>
     character is built on--then you've got it. No misleading and apparently
    </p>
    <p>
     inconsistent peculiarities can fool you then. What do you read on
    </p>
    <p>
     the Senator's surface? Simplicity; a kind of rank and protuberant
    </p>
    <p>
     simplicity; whereas, in fact, that's one of the deepest minds in the
    </p>
    <p>
     world. A perfectly honest man--an absolutely honest and honorable
    </p>
    <p>
     man--and yet without doubt the profoundest master of dissimulation the
    </p>
    <p>
     world has ever seen.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “O, it's devilish!” This was wrung from the unlistening Tracy by
    </p>
    <p>
     the anguished thought of what might have been if only the dinner
    </p>
    <p>
     arrangements hadn't got mixed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I shouldn't call it that,” said Sellers, who was now placidly
    </p>
    <p>
     walking up and down the room with his hands under his coat-tails and
    </p>
    <p>
     listening to himself talk. “One could quite properly call it devilish
    </p>
    <p>
     in another man, but not in the Senator. Your term is right--perfectly
    </p>
    <p>
     right--I grant that--but the application is wrong. It makes a great
    </p>
    <p>
     difference. Yes, he is a marvelous character. I do not suppose that any
    </p>
    <p>
     other statesman ever had such a colossal sense of humor, combined with
    </p>
    <p>
     the ability to totally conceal it. I may except George Washington and
    </p>
    <p>
     Cromwell, and perhaps Robespierre, but I draw the line there. A person
    </p>
    <p>
     not an expert might be in Judge Hawkins's company a lifetime and never
    </p>
    <p>
     find out he had any more sense of humor than a cemetery.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A deep-drawn yard-long sigh from the distraught and dreaming artist,
    </p>
    <p>
     followed by a murmured, “Miserable, oh, miserable!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, no, I shouldn't say that about it, quite. On the contrary, I
    </p>
    <p>
     admire his ability to conceal his humor even more if possible than I
    </p>
    <p>
     admire the gift itself, stupendous as it is. Another thing--General
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins is a thinker; a keen, logical, exhaustive, analytical
    </p>
    <p>
     thinker--perhaps the ablest of modern times. That is, of course, upon
    </p>
    <p>
     themes suited to his size, like the glacial period, and the correlation
    </p>
    <p>
     of forces, and the evolution of the Christian from the caterpillar--any
    </p>
    <p>
     of those things; give him a subject according to his size, and just
    </p>
    <p>
     stand back and watch him think! Why you can see the place rock! Ah, yes,
    </p>
    <p>
     you must know him; you must get on the inside of him. Perhaps the most
    </p>
    <p>
     extraordinary mind since Aristotle.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Dinner was kept waiting for a while for Miss Thompson, but as Gwendolen
    </p>
    <p>
     had not delivered the invitation to her the waiting did no good, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     household presently went to the meal without her. Poor old Sellers tried
    </p>
    <p>
     everything his hospitable soul could devise to make the occasion an
    </p>
    <p>
     enjoyable one for the guest, and the guest tried his honest best to be
    </p>
    <p>
     cheery and chatty and happy for the old gentleman's sake; in fact all
    </p>
    <p>
     hands worked hard in the interest of a mutual good time, but the thing
    </p>
    <p>
     was a failure from the start; Tracy's heart was lead in his bosom, there
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to be only one prominent feature in the landscape and that was a
    </p>
    <p>
     vacant chair, he couldn't drag his mind away from Gwendolen and his hard
    </p>
    <p>
     luck; consequently his distractions allowed deadly pauses to slip in
    </p>
    <p>
     every now and then when it was his turn to say something, and of course
    </p>
    <p>
     this disease spread to the rest of the conversation--wherefore, instead
    </p>
    <p>
     of having a breezy sail in sunny waters, as anticipated, everybody was
    </p>
    <p>
     bailing out and praying for land. What could the matter be? Tracy alone
    </p>
    <p>
     could have told, the others couldn't even invent a theory.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meanwhile they were having a similarly dismal time at the Thompson
    </p>
    <p>
     house; in fact a twin experience. Gwendolen was ashamed of herself for
    </p>
    <p>
     allowing her disappointment to so depress her spirits and make her
    </p>
    <p>
     so strangely and profoundly miserable; but feeling ashamed of herself
    </p>
    <p>
     didn't improve the matter any; it only seemed to aggravate the
    </p>
    <p>
     suffering. She explained that she was not feeling very well, and
    </p>
    <p>
     everybody could see that this was true; so she got sincere sympathy and
    </p>
    <p>
     commiseration; but that didn't help the case. Nothing helps that kind of
    </p>
    <p>
     a case. It is best to just stand off and let it fester. The moment the
    </p>
    <p>
     dinner was over the girl excused herself, and she hurried home feeling
    </p>
    <p>
     unspeakably grateful to get away from that house and that intolerable
    </p>
    <p>
     captivity and suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
     Will he be gone? The thought arose in her brain, but took effect in
    </p>
    <p>
     her heels. She slipped into the house, threw off her things and made
    </p>
    <p>
     straight for the dining room. She stopped and listened. Her father's
    </p>
    <p>
     voice--with no life in it; presently her mother's--no life in that; a
    </p>
    <p>
     considerable vacancy, then a sterile remark from Washington Hawkins.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another silence; then, not Tracy's but her father's voice again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “He's gone,” she said to herself despairingly, and listlessly opened the
    </p>
    <p>
     door and stepped within.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why, my child,” cried the mother, “how white you are! Are you--has
    </p>
    <p>
     anything--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “White?” exclaimed Sellers. “It's gone like a flash; 'twasn't serious.
    </p>
    <p>
     Already she's as red as the soul of a watermelon! Sit down, dear, sit
    </p>
    <p>
     down--goodness knows you're welcome. Did you have a good time? We've had
    </p>
    <p>
     great times here--immense. Why didn't Miss Belle come? Mr. Tracy is not
    </p>
    <p>
     feeling well, and she'd have made him forget it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She was content now; and out from her happy eyes there went a light that
    </p>
    <p>
     told a secret to another pair of eyes there and got a secret in return.
    </p>
    <p>
     In just that infinitely small fraction of a second those two great
    </p>
    <p>
     confessions were made, received, and perfectly understood. All anxiety,
    </p>
    <p>
     apprehension, uncertainty, vanished out of these young people's hearts
    </p>
    <p>
     and left them filled with a great peace.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sellers had had the most confident faith that with the new reinforcement
    </p>
    <p>
     victory would be at this last moment snatched from the jaws of defeat,
    </p>
    <p>
     but it was an error. The talk was as stubbornly disjointed as ever. He
    </p>
    <p>
     was proud of Gwendolen, and liked to show her off, even against Miss
    </p>
    <p>
     Belle Thompson, and here had been a great opportunity, and what had she
    </p>
    <p>
     made of it? He felt a good deal put out. It vexed him to think that
    </p>
    <p>
     this Englishman, with the traveling Briton's everlasting disposition
    </p>
    <p>
     to generalize whole mountain ranges from single sample-grains of
    </p>
    <p>
     sand, would jump to the conclusion that American girls were as dumb as
    </p>
    <p>
     himself--generalizing the whole tribe from this single sample and she at
    </p>
    <p>
     her poorest, there being nothing at that table to inspire her, give her
    </p>
    <p>
     a start, keep her from going to sleep. He made up his mind that for the
    </p>
    <p>
     honor of the country he would bring these two together again over the
    </p>
    <p>
     social board before long. There would be a different result another
    </p>
    <p>
     time, he judged. He said to himself, with a deep sense of injury, “He'll
    </p>
    <p>
     put in his diary--they all keep diaries--he'll put in his diary that she
    </p>
    <p>
     was miraculously uninteresting--dear, dear, but wasn't she! I never saw
    </p>
    <p>
     the like--and yet looking as beautiful as Satan, too--and couldn't seem
    </p>
    <p>
     to do anything but paw bread crumbs, and pick flowers to pieces, and
    </p>
    <p>
     look fidgety. And it isn't any better here in the Hall of Audience. I've
    </p>
    <p>
     had enough; I'll haul down my flag--the others may fight it out if they
    </p>
    <p>
     want to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He shook hands all around and went off to do some work which he said was
    </p>
    <p>
     pressing. The idolaters were the width of the room apart; and apparently
    </p>
    <p>
     unconscious of each other's presence. The distance got shortened a
    </p>
    <p>
     little, now. Very soon the mother withdrew. The distance narrowed again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy stood before a chromo of some Ohio politician which had been
    </p>
    <p>
     retouched and chain-mailed for a crusading Rossmore, and Gwendolen was
    </p>
    <p>
     sitting on the sofa not far from his elbow artificially absorbed in
    </p>
    <p>
     examining a photograph album that hadn't any photographs in it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The “Senator” still lingered. He was sorry for the young people; it had
    </p>
    <p>
     been a dull evening for them. In the goodness of his heart he tried
    </p>
    <p>
     to make it pleasant for them now; tried to remove the ill impression
    </p>
    <p>
     necessarily left by the general defeat; tried to be chatty, even tried
    </p>
    <p>
     to be gay. But the responses were sickly, there was no starting any
    </p>
    <p>
     enthusiasm; he would give it up and quit--it was a day specially picked
    </p>
    <p>
     out and consecrated to failures.
    </p>
    <p>
     But when Gwendolen rose up promptly and smiled a glad smile and said
    </p>
    <p>
     with thankfulness and blessing, “Must you go?” it seemed cruel to
    </p>
    <p>
     desert, and he sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was about to begin a remark when--when he didn't. We have all been
    </p>
    <p>
     there. He didn't know how he knew his concluding to stay longer had been
    </p>
    <p>
     a mistake, he merely knew it; and knew it for dead certain, too. And so
    </p>
    <p>
     he bade goodnight, and went mooning out, wondering what he could have
    </p>
    <p>
     done that changed the atmosphere that way. As the door closed behind him
    </p>
    <p>
     those two were standing side by side, looking at that door--looking at
    </p>
    <p>
     it in a waiting, second-counting, but deeply grateful kind of way. And
    </p>
    <p>
     the instant it closed they flung their arms about each other's necks,
    </p>
    <p>
     and there, heart to heart and lip to lip--
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, my God, she's kissing it!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Nobody heard this remark, because Hawkins, who bred it, only thought it,
    </p>
    <p>
     he didn't utter it. He had turned, the moment he had closed the door,
    </p>
    <p>
     and had pushed it open a little, intending to re-enter and ask what
    </p>
    <p>
     ill-advised thing he had done or said, and apologize for it. But he
    </p>
    <p>
     didn't re-enter; he staggered off stunned, terrified, distressed.
    </p>

     CHAPTER XXII.
    </head>
    <p>
     Five minutes later he was sitting in his room, with his head bowed
    </p>
    <p>
     within the circle of his arms, on the table--final attitude of grief and
    </p>
    <p>
     despair. His tears were flowing fast, and now and then a sob broke upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the stillness. Presently he said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “I knew her when she was a little child and used to climb about my
    </p>
    <p>
     knees; I love her as I love my own, and now--oh, poor thing, poor
    </p>
    <p>
     thing, I cannot bear it!--she's gone and lost her heart to this mangy
    </p>
    <p>
     materializee! Why didn't we see that that might happen? But how could
    </p>
    <p>
     we? Nobody could; nobody could ever have dreamed of such a thing. You
    </p>
    <p>
     couldn't expect a person would fall in love with a wax-work. And this
    </p>
    <p>
     one doesn't even amount to that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He went on grieving to himself, and now and then giving voice to his
    </p>
    <p>
     lamentations.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's done, oh, it's done, and there's no help for it, no undoing
    </p>
    <p>
     the miserable business. If I had the nerve, I would kill it. But
    </p>
    <p>
     that wouldn't do any good. She loves it; she thinks it's genuine and
    </p>
    <p>
     authentic. If she lost it she would grieve for it just as she would
    </p>
    <p>
     for a real person. And who's to break it to the family! Not I--I'll die
    </p>
    <p>
     first. Sellers is the best human being I ever knew and I wouldn't any
    </p>
    <p>
     more think of--oh, dear, why it'll break his heart when he finds it out.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Polly's too. This comes of meddling with such infernal matters!
    </p>
    <p>
     But for this, the creature would still be roasting in Sheol where
    </p>
    <p>
     it belongs. How is it that these people don't smell the brimstone?
    </p>
    <p>
     Sometimes I can't come into the same room with him without nearly
    </p>
    <p>
     suffocating.”
    </p>
    <p>
     After a while he broke out again:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, there's one thing, sure. The materializing has got to stop right
    </p>
    <p>
     where it is. If she's got to marry a spectre, let her marry a decent one
    </p>
    <p>
     out of the Middle Ages, like this one--not a cowboy and a thief such
    </p>
    <p>
     as this protoplasmic tadpole's going to turn into if Sellers keeps on
    </p>
    <p>
     fussing at it. It costs five thousand dollars cash and shuts down on
    </p>
    <p>
     the incorporated company to stop the works at this point, but Sally
    </p>
    <p>
     Sellers's happiness is worth more than that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He heard Sellers coming, and got himself to rights. Sellers took a seat,
    </p>
    <p>
     and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I've got to confess I'm a good deal puzzled. It did certainly
    </p>
    <p>
     eat, there's no getting around it. Not eat, exactly, either, but it
    </p>
    <p>
     nibbled; nibbled in an appetiteless way, but still it nibbled; and
    </p>
    <p>
     that's just a marvel. Now the question is, what does it do with those
    </p>
    <p>
     nibblings? That's it--what does it do with them? My idea is that we
    </p>
    <p>
     don't begin to know all there is to this stupendous discovery yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     But time will show--time and science--give us a chance, and don't get
    </p>
    <p>
     impatient.”
    </p>
    <p>
     But he couldn't get Hawkins interested; couldn't make him talk to amount
    </p>
    <p>
     to anything; couldn't drag him out of his depression. But at last he
    </p>
    <p>
     took a turn that arrested Hawkins's attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm coming to like him, Hawkins. He is a person of stupendous
    </p>
    <p>
     character--absolutely gigantic. Under that placid exterior is concealed
    </p>
    <p>
     the most dare-devil spirit that was ever put into a man--he's just a
    </p>
    <p>
     Clive over again. Yes, I'm all admiration for him, on account of his
    </p>
    <p>
     character, and liking naturally follows admiration, you know. I'm coming
    </p>
    <p>
     to like him immensely. Do you know, I haven't the heart to degrade such
    </p>
    <p>
     a character as that down to the burglar estate for money or for anything
    </p>
    <p>
     else; and I've come to ask if you are willing to let the reward go, and
    </p>
    <p>
     leave this poor fellow--
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where he is?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes--not bring him down to date.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, there's my hand; and my heart's in it, too!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll never forget you for this, Hawkins,” said the old gentleman in
    </p>
    <p>
     a voice which he found it hard to control. “You are making a great
    </p>
    <p>
     sacrifice for me, and one which you can ill afford, but I'll never
    </p>
    <p>
     forget your generosity, and if I live you shall not suffer for it, be
    </p>
    <p>
     sure of that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Sally Sellers immediately and vividly realized that she was become a new
    </p>
    <p>
     being; a being of a far higher and worthier sort than she had been such
    </p>
    <p>
     a little while before; an earnest being, in place of a dreamer; and
    </p>
    <p>
     supplied with a reason for her presence in the world, where merely a
    </p>
    <p>
     wistful and troubled curiosity about it had existed before. So great and
    </p>
    <p>
     so comprehensive was the change which had been wrought, that she seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     to herself to be a real person who had lately been a shadow; a something
    </p>
    <p>
     which had lately been a nothing; a purpose, which had lately been a
    </p>
    <p>
     fancy; a finished temple, with the altar-fires lit and the voice of
    </p>
    <p>
     worship ascending, where before had been but an architect's confusion
    </p>
    <p>
     of arid working plans, unintelligible to the passing eye and prophesying
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Lady” Gwendolen! The pleasantness of that sound was all gone; it was an
    </p>
    <p>
     offense to her ear now. She said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “There--that sham belongs to the past; I will not be called by it any
    </p>
    <p>
     more.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I may call you simply Gwendolen? You will allow me to drop the
    </p>
    <p>
     formalities straightway and name you by your dear first name without
    </p>
    <p>
     additions?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She was dethroning the pink and replacing it with a rosebud.
    </p>
    <p>
     “There--that is better. I hate pinks--some pinks. Indeed yes, you are to
    </p>
    <p>
     call me by my first name without additions--that is,--well, I don't mean
    </p>
    <p>
     without additions entirely, but--”
    </p>
    <p>
     It was as far as she could get. There was a pause; his intellect was
    </p>
    <p>
     struggling to comprehend; presently it did manage to catch the idea in
    </p>
    <p>
     time to save embarrassment all around, and he said gratefully--
    </p>
    <p>
     “Dear Gwendolen! I may say that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes--part of it. But--don't kiss me when I am talking, it makes me
    </p>
    <p>
     forget what I was going to say. You can call me by part of that form,
    </p>
    <p>
     but not the last part. Gwendolen is not my name.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not your name?” This in a tone of wonder and surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
     The girl's soul was suddenly invaded by a creepy apprehension, a quite
    </p>
    <p>
     definite sense of suspicion and alarm. She put his arms away from her,
    </p>
    <p>
     looked him searchingly in the eye, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Answer me truly, on your honor. You are not seeking to marry me on
    </p>
    <p>
     account of my rank?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The shot almost knocked him through the wall, he was so little prepared
    </p>
    <p>
     for it. There was something so finely grotesque about the question and
    </p>
    <p>
     its parent suspicion, that he stopped to wonder and admire, and thus
    </p>
    <p>
     was he saved from laughing. Then, without wasting precious time, he
    </p>
    <p>
     set about the task of convincing her that he had been lured by herself
    </p>
    <p>
     alone, and had fallen in love with her only, not her title and position;
    </p>
    <p>
     that he loved her with all his heart, and could not love her more if she
    </p>
    <p>
     were a duchess, or less if she were without home, name or family. She
    </p>
    <p>
     watched his face wistfully, eagerly, hopefully, translating his words
    </p>
    <p>
     by its expression; and when he had finished there was gladness in her
    </p>
    <p>
     heart--a tumultuous gladness, indeed, though outwardly she was calm,
    </p>
    <p>
     tranquil, even judicially austere. She prepared a surprise for him, now,
    </p>
    <p>
     calculated to put a heavy strain upon those disinterested protestations
    </p>
    <p>
     of his; and thus she delivered it, burning it away word by word as
    </p>
    <p>
     the fuse burns down to a bombshell, and watching to see how far the
    </p>
    <p>
     explosion would lift him:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Listen--and do not doubt me, for I shall speak the exact truth. Howard
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy, I am no more an earl's child than you are!”
    </p>
    <p>
     To her joy--and secret surprise, also--it never phased him. He was
    </p>
    <p>
     ready, this time, and saw his chance. He cried out with enthusiasm,
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank heaven for that!” and gathered her to his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
     To express her happiness was almost beyond her gift of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You make me the proudest girl in all the earth,” she said, with her
    </p>
    <p>
     head pillowed on his shoulder. “I thought it only natural that you
    </p>
    <p>
     should be dazzled by the title--maybe even unconsciously, you being
    </p>
    <p>
     English--and that you might be deceiving yourself in thinking you loved
    </p>
    <p>
     only me, and find you didn't love me when the deception was swept away;
    </p>
    <p>
     so it makes me proud that the revelation stands for nothing and that you
    </p>
    <p>
     do love just me, only me--oh, prouder than any words can tell!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It is only you, sweetheart, I never gave one envying glance toward your
    </p>
    <p>
     father's earldom. That is utterly true, dear Gwendolen.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “There--you mustn't call me that. I hate that false name. I told you it
    </p>
    <p>
     wasn't mine. My name is Sally Sellers--or Sarah, if you like. From this
    </p>
    <p>
     time I banish dreams, visions, imaginings, and will no more of them. I
    </p>
    <p>
     am going to be myself--my genuine self, my honest self, my natural self,
    </p>
    <p>
     clear and clean of sham and folly and fraud, and worthy of you. There is
    </p>
    <p>
     no grain of social inequality between us; I, like you, am poor; I, like
    </p>
    <p>
     you, am without position or distinction; you are a struggling artist, I
    </p>
    <p>
     am that, too, in my humbler way. Our bread is honest bread, we work for
    </p>
    <p>
     our living. Hand in hand we will walk hence to the grave, helping each
    </p>
    <p>
     other in all ways, living for each other, being and remaining one in
    </p>
    <p>
     heart and purpose, one in hope and aspiration, inseparable to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
     And though our place is low, judged by the world's eye, we will make it
    </p>
    <p>
     as high as the highest in the great essentials of honest work for what
    </p>
    <p>
     we eat and wear, and conduct above reproach. We live in a land, let us
    </p>
    <p>
     be thankful, where this is all-sufficient, and no man is better than his
    </p>
    <p>
     neighbor by the grace of God, but only by his own merit.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy tried to break in, but she stopped him and kept the floor herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am not through yet. I am going to purge myself of the last vestiges
    </p>
    <p>
     of artificiality and pretence, and then start fair on your own honest
    </p>
    <p>
     level and be worthy mate to you thenceforth. My father honestly thinks
    </p>
    <p>
     he is an earl. Well, leave him his dream, it pleases him and does no
    </p>
    <p>
     one any harm: It was the dream of his ancestors before him. It has made
    </p>
    <p>
     fools of the house of Sellers for generations, and it made something
    </p>
    <p>
     of a fool of me, but took no deep root. I am done with it now, and for
    </p>
    <p>
     good. Forty-eight hours ago I was privately proud of being the daughter
    </p>
    <p>
     of a pinchbeck earl, and thought the proper mate for me must be a man of
    </p>
    <p>
     like degree; but to-day--oh, how grateful I am for your love which has
    </p>
    <p>
     healed my sick brain and restored my sanity!--I could make oath that no
    </p>
    <p>
     earl's son in all the world--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh,--well, but--but--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why, you look like a person in a panic. What is it? What is the
    </p>
    <p>
     matter?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Matter? Oh, nothing--nothing. I was only going to say”--but in his
    </p>
    <p>
     flurry nothing occurred to him to say, for a moment; then by a lucky
    </p>
    <p>
     inspiration he thought of something entirely sufficient for the
    </p>
    <p>
     occasion, and brought it out with eloquent force: “Oh, how beautiful you
    </p>
    <p>
     are! You take my breath away when you look like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It was well conceived, well timed, and cordially delivered--and it got
    </p>
    <p>
     its reward.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me see. Where was I? Yes, my father's earldom is pure moonshine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Look at those dreadful things on the wall. You have of course supposed
    </p>
    <p>
     them to be portraits of his ancestors, earls of Rossmore. Well, they are
    </p>
    <p>
     not. They are chromos of distinguished Americans--all moderns; but
    </p>
    <p>
     he has carried them back a thousand years by re-labeling them. Andrew
    </p>
    <p>
     Jackson there, is doing what he can to be the late American earl;
    </p>
    <p>
     and the newest treasure in the collection is supposed to be the young
    </p>
    <p>
     English heir--I mean the idiot with the crape; but in truth it's a
    </p>
    <p>
     shoemaker, and not Lord Berkeley at all.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you sure?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why of course I am. He wouldn't look like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because his conduct in his last moments, when the fire was sweeping
    </p>
    <p>
     around him shows that he was a man. It shows that he was a fine,
    </p>
    <p>
     high-souled young creature.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy was strongly moved by these compliments, and it seemed to him
    </p>
    <p>
     that the girl's lovely lips took on a new loveliness when they were
    </p>
    <p>
     delivering them. He said, softly:
    </p>
    <p>
     “It is a pity he could not know what a gracious impression his behavior
    </p>
    <p>
     was going to leave with the dearest and sweetest stranger in the land
    </p>
    <p>
     of--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, I almost loved him! Why, I think of him every day. He is always
    </p>
    <p>
     floating about in my mind.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy felt that this was a little more than was necessary. He was
    </p>
    <p>
     conscious of the sting of jealousy. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “It is quite right to think of him--at least now and then--that is, at
    </p>
    <p>
     intervals--in perhaps an admiring way--but it seems to me that--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Howard Tracy, are you jealous of that dead man?”
    </p>
    <p>
     He was ashamed--and at the same time not ashamed. He was jealous--and at
    </p>
    <p>
     the same time he was not jealous. In a sense the dead man was himself;
    </p>
    <p>
     in that case compliments and affection lavished upon that corpse went
    </p>
    <p>
     into his own till and were clear profit. But in another sense the dead
    </p>
    <p>
     man was not himself; and in that case all compliments and affection
    </p>
    <p>
     lavished there were wasted, and a sufficient basis for jealousy. A tiff
    </p>
    <p>
     was the result of the dispute between the two. Then they made it up,
    </p>
    <p>
     and were more loving than ever. As an affectionate clincher of the
    </p>
    <p>
     reconciliation, Sally declared that she had now banished Lord Berkeley
    </p>
    <p>
     from her mind; and added, “And in order to make sure that he shall never
    </p>
    <p>
     make trouble between us again, I will teach myself to detest that name
    </p>
    <p>
     and all that have ever borne it or ever shall bear it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     This inflicted another pang, and Tracy was minded to ask her to modify
    </p>
    <p>
     that a little just on general principles, and as practice in not
    </p>
    <p>
     overdoing a good thing--perhaps he might better leave things as they
    </p>
    <p>
     were and not risk bringing on another tiff. He got away from that
    </p>
    <p>
     particular, and sought less tender ground for conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I suppose you disapprove wholly of aristocracies and nobilities, now
    </p>
    <p>
     that you have renounced your title and your father's earldom.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Real ones? Oh, dear no--but I've thrown aside our sham one for good.”
    </p>
    <p>
     This answer fell just at the right time and just in the right place, to
    </p>
    <p>
     save the poor unstable young man from changing his political complexion
    </p>
    <p>
     once more. He had been on the point of beginning to totter again,
    </p>
    <p>
     but this prop shored him up and kept him from floundering back into
    </p>
    <p>
     democracy and re-renouncing aristocracy. So he went home glad that he
    </p>
    <p>
     had asked the fortunate question. The girl would accept a little thing
    </p>
    <p>
     like a genuine earldom, she was merely prejudiced against the brummagem
    </p>
    <p>
     article. Yes, he could have his girl and have his earldom, too: that
    </p>
    <p>
     question was a fortunate stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sally went to bed happy, too; and remained happy, deliriously happy, for
    </p>
    <p>
     nearly two hours; but at last, just as she was sinking into a contented
    </p>
    <p>
     and luxurious unconsciousness, the shady devil who lives and lurks and
    </p>
    <p>
     hides and watches inside of human beings and is always waiting for a
    </p>
    <p>
     chance to do the proprietor a malicious damage, whispered to her soul
    </p>
    <p>
     and said, “That question had a harmless look, but what was back of
    </p>
    <p>
     it?--what was the secret motive of it?--what suggested it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The shady devil had knifed her, and could retire, now, and take a rest;
    </p>
    <p>
     the wound would attend to business for him. And it did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why should Howard Tracy ask that question? If he was not trying to marry
    </p>
    <p>
     her for the sake of her rank, what should suggest that question to
    </p>
    <p>
     him? Didn't he plainly look gratified when she said her objections to
    </p>
    <p>
     aristocracy had their limitations? Ah, he is after that earldom, that
    </p>
    <p>
     gilded sham--it isn't poor me he wants.
    </p>
    <p>
     So she argued, in anguish and tears. Then she argued the opposite
    </p>
    <p>
     theory, but made a weak, poor business of it, and lost the case. She
    </p>
    <p>
     kept the arguing up, one side and then the other, the rest of the night,
    </p>
    <p>
     and at last fell asleep at dawn; fell in the fire at dawn, one may say;
    </p>
    <p>
     for that kind of sleep resembles fire, and one comes out of it with his
    </p>
    <p>
     brain baked and his physical forces fried out of him.

     CHAPTER XXIII.
    </head>
    <p>
     Tracy wrote his father before he sought his bed. He wrote a letter which
    </p>
    <p>
     he believed would get better treatment than his cablegram received, for
    </p>
    <p>
     it contained what ought to be welcome news; namely, that he had tried
    </p>
    <p>
     equality and working for a living; had made a fight which he could find
    </p>
    <p>
     no reason to be ashamed of, and in the matter of earning a living had
    </p>
    <p>
     proved that he was able to do it; but that on the whole he had arrived
    </p>
    <p>
     at the conclusion that he could not reform the world single-handed, and
    </p>
    <p>
     was willing to retire from the conflict with the fair degree of honor
    </p>
    <p>
     which he had gained, and was also willing to return home and resume
    </p>
    <p>
     his position and be content with it and thankful for it for the future,
    </p>
    <p>
     leaving further experiment of a missionary sort to other young people
    </p>
    <p>
     needing the chastening and quelling persuasions of experience, the only
    </p>
    <p>
     logic sure to convince a diseased imagination and restore it to rugged
    </p>
    <p>
     health. Then he approached the subject of marriage with the daughter of
    </p>
    <p>
     the American Claimant with a good deal of caution and much painstaking
    </p>
    <p>
     art. He said praiseful and appreciative things about the girl, but
    </p>
    <p>
     didn't dwell upon that detail or make it prominent. The thing which he
    </p>
    <p>
     made prominent was the opportunity now so happily afforded, to reconcile
    </p>
    <p>
     York and Lancaster, graft the warring roses upon one stem, and end
    </p>
    <p>
     forever a crying injustice which had already lasted far too long. One
    </p>
    <p>
     could infer that he had thought this thing all out and chosen this way
    </p>
    <p>
     of making all things fair and right because it was sufficiently fair
    </p>
    <p>
     and considerably wiser than the renunciation-scheme which he had brought
    </p>
    <p>
     with him from England. One could infer that, but he didn't say it. In
    </p>
    <p>
     fact the more he read his letter over, the more he got to inferring it
    </p>
    <p>
     himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the old earl received that letter, the first part of it filled him
    </p>
    <p>
     with a grim and snarly satisfaction; but the rest of it brought a snort
    </p>
    <p>
     or two out of him that could be translated differently. He wasted no
    </p>
    <p>
     ink in this emergency, either in cablegrams or letters; he promptly took
    </p>
    <p>
     ship for America to look into the matter himself. He had staunchly held
    </p>
    <p>
     his grip all this long time, and given no sign of the hunger at his
    </p>
    <p>
     heart to see his son; hoping for the cure of his insane dream, and
    </p>
    <p>
     resolute that the process should go through all the necessary stages
    </p>
    <p>
     without assuaging telegrams or other nonsense from home, and here was
    </p>
    <p>
     victory at last. Victory, but stupidly marred by this idiotic marriage
    </p>
    <p>
     project. Yes, he would step over and take a hand in this matter himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     During the first ten days following the mailing of the letter Tracy's
    </p>
    <p>
     spirits had no idle time; they were always climbing up into the clouds
    </p>
    <p>
     or sliding down into the earth as deep as the law of gravitation
    </p>
    <p>
     reached. He was intensely happy or intensely miserable by turns,
    </p>
    <p>
     according to Miss Sally's moods. He never could tell when the mood was
    </p>
    <p>
     going to change, and when it changed he couldn't tell what it was that
    </p>
    <p>
     had changed it. Sometimes she was so in love with him that her love was
    </p>
    <p>
     tropical, torrid, and she could find no language fervent enough for its
    </p>
    <p>
     expression; then suddenly, and without warning or any apparent reason,
    </p>
    <p>
     the weather would change, and the victim would find himself adrift among
    </p>
    <p>
     the icebergs and feeling as lonesome and friendless as the north pole.
    </p>
    <p>
     It sometimes seemed to him that a man might better be dead than exposed
    </p>
    <p>
     to these devastating varieties of climate.
    </p>
    <p>
     The case was simple. Sally wanted to believe that Tracy's preference was
    </p>
    <p>
     disinterested; so she was always applying little tests of one sort or
    </p>
    <p>
     another, hoping and expecting that they would bring out evidence which
    </p>
    <p>
     would confirm or fortify her belief. Poor Tracy did not know that these
    </p>
    <p>
     experiments were being made upon him, consequently he walked promptly
    </p>
    <p>
     into all the traps the girl set for him. These traps consisted in
    </p>
    <p>
     apparently casual references to social distinction, aristocratic
    </p>
    <p>
     title and privilege, and such things. Often Tracy responded to these
    </p>
    <p>
     references heedlessly and not much caring what he said provided it kept
    </p>
    <p>
     the talk going and prolonged the seance. He didn't suspect that the girl
    </p>
    <p>
     was watching his face and listening for his words as one who watches the
    </p>
    <p>
     judge's face and listens for the words which will restore him to
    </p>
    <p>
     home and friends and freedom or shut him away from the sun and human
    </p>
    <p>
     companionship forever. He didn't suspect that his careless words were
    </p>
    <p>
     being weighed, and so he often delivered sentence of death when it would
    </p>
    <p>
     have been just as handy and all the same to him to pronounce acquittal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Daily he broke the girl's heart, nightly he sent her to the rack for
    </p>
    <p>
     sleep. He couldn't understand it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some people would have put this and that together and perceived that the
    </p>
    <p>
     weather never changed until one particular subject was introduced, and
    </p>
    <p>
     that then it always changed. And they would have looked further, and
    </p>
    <p>
     perceived that that subject was always introduced by the one party,
    </p>
    <p>
     never the other. They would have argued, then, that this was done for a
    </p>
    <p>
     purpose. If they could not find out what that purpose was in any simpler
    </p>
    <p>
     or easier way, they would ask.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Tracy was not deep enough or suspicious enough to think of these
    </p>
    <p>
     things. He noticed only one particular; that the weather was always
    </p>
    <p>
     sunny when a visit began. No matter how much it might cloud up later, it
    </p>
    <p>
     always began with a clear sky. He couldn't explain this curious fact to
    </p>
    <p>
     himself, he merely knew it to be a fact. The truth of the matter was,
    </p>
    <p>
     that by the time Tracy had been out of Sally's sight six hours she was
    </p>
    <p>
     so famishing for a sight of him that her doubts and suspicions were all
    </p>
    <p>
     consumed away in the fire of that longing, and so always she came into
    </p>
    <p>
     his presence as surprisingly radiant and joyous as she wasn't when she
    </p>
    <p>
     went out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     In circumstances like these a growing portrait runs a good many risks.
    </p>
    <p>
     The portrait of Sellers, by Tracy, was fighting along, day by day,
    </p>
    <p>
     through this mixed weather, and daily adding to itself ineradicable
    </p>
    <p>
     signs of the checkered life it was leading. It was the happiest
    </p>
    <p>
     portrait, in spots, that was ever seen; but in other spots a damned soul
    </p>
    <p>
     looked out from it; a soul that was suffering all the different kinds of
    </p>
    <p>
     distress there are, from stomach ache to rabies. But Sellers liked it.
    </p>
    <p>
     He said it was just himself all over--a portrait that sweated moods from
    </p>
    <p>
     every pore, and no two moods alike. He said he had as many different
    </p>
    <p>
     kinds of emotions in him as a jug.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a kind of a deadly work of art, maybe, but it was a starchy
    </p>
    <p>
     picture for show; for it was life size, full length, and represented
    </p>
    <p>
     the American earl in a peer's scarlet robe, with the three ermine bars
    </p>
    <p>
     indicative of an earl's rank, and on the gray head an earl's coronet,
    </p>
    <p>
     tilted just a wee bit to one side in a most gallus and winsome way. When
    </p>
    <p>
     Sally's weather was sunny the portrait made Tracy chuckle, but when her
    </p>
    <p>
     weather was overcast it disordered his mind and stopped the circulation
    </p>
    <p>
     of his blood.
    </p>
    <p>
     Late one night when the sweethearts had been having a flawless visit
    </p>
    <p>
     together, Sally's interior devil began to work his specialty, and soon
    </p>
    <p>
     the conversation was drifting toward the customary rock. Presently, in
    </p>
    <p>
     the midst of Tracy's serene flow of talk, he felt a shudder which
    </p>
    <p>
     he knew was not his shudder, but exterior to his breast although
    </p>
    <p>
     immediately against it. After the shudder came sobs; Sally was crying.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, my darling, what have I done--what have I said? It has happened
    </p>
    <p>
     again! What have I done to wound you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She disengaged herself from his arms and gave him a look of deep
    </p>
    <p>
     reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What have you done? I will tell you what you have done. You have
    </p>
    <p>
     unwittingly revealed--oh, for the twentieth time, though I could not
    </p>
    <p>
     believe it, would not believe it!--that it is not me you love, but that
    </p>
    <p>
     foolish sham, my father's imitation earldom; and you have broken my
    </p>
    <p>
     heart!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, my child, what are you saying! I never dreamed of such a thing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, Howard, Howard, the things you have uttered when you were
    </p>
    <p>
     forgetting to guard your tongue, have betrayed you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Things I have uttered when I was forgetting to guard my tongue?
    </p>
    <p>
     These are hard words. When have I remembered to guard it? Never in one
    </p>
    <p>
     instance. It has no office but to speak the truth. It needs no guarding
    </p>
    <p>
     for that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Howard, I have noted your words and weighed them, when you were not
    </p>
    <p>
     thinking of their significance--and they have told me more than you
    </p>
    <p>
     meant they should.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you mean to say you have answered the trust I had in you by using
    </p>
    <p>
     it as an ambuscade from which you could set snares for my unsuspecting
    </p>
    <p>
     tongue and be safe from detection while you did it? You have not done
    </p>
    <p>
     this--surely you have not done this thing. Oh, one's enemy could not do
    </p>
    <p>
     it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     This was an aspect of the girl's conduct which she had not clearly
    </p>
    <p>
     perceived before. Was it treachery? Had she abused a trust? The thought
    </p>
    <p>
     crimsoned her cheeks with shame and remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, forgive me,” she said, “I did not know what I was doing. I have
    </p>
    <p>
     been so tortured--you will forgive me, you must; I have suffered
    </p>
    <p>
     so much, and I am so sorry and so humble; you do forgive me, don't
    </p>
    <p>
     you?--don't turn away, don't refuse me; it is only my love that is at
    </p>
    <p>
     fault, and you know I love you, love you with all my heart; I couldn't
    </p>
    <p>
     bear to--oh, dear, dear, I am so miserable, and I never meant any harm,
    </p>
    <p>
     and I didn't see where this insanity was carrying me, and how it
    </p>
    <p>
     was wronging and abusing the dearest heart in all the world to
    </p>
    <p>
     me--and--and--oh, take me in your arms again, I have no other refuge, no
    </p>
    <p>
     other home and hope!”
    </p>
    <p>
     There was reconciliation again--immediate, perfect, all-embracing--and
    </p>
    <p>
     with it utter happiness. This would have been a good time to adjourn.
    </p>
    <p>
     But no, now that the cloud-breeder was revealed at last; now that it was
    </p>
    <p>
     manifest that all the sour weather had come from this girl's dread that
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy was lured by her rank and not herself, he resolved to lay that
    </p>
    <p>
     ghost immediately and permanently by furnishing the best possible proof
    </p>
    <p>
     that he couldn't have had back of him at any time the suspected motive.
    </p>
    <p>
     So he said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me whisper a little secret in your ear--a secret which I have kept
    </p>
    <p>
     shut up in my breast all this time. Your rank couldn't ever have been an
    </p>
    <p>
     enticement. I am son and heir to an English earl!”
    </p>
    <p>
     The girl stared at him--one, two, three moments, maybe a dozen--then her
    </p>
    <p>
     lips parted:
    </p>
    <p>
     “You?” she said, and moved away from him, still gazing at him in a kind
    </p>
    <p>
     of blank amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why--why, certainly I am. Why do you act like this? What have I done
    </p>
    <p>
     now?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What have you done? You have certainly made a most strange statement.
    </p>
    <p>
     You must see that yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well,” with a timid little laugh, “it may be a strange enough
    </p>
    <p>
     statement; but of what consequence is that, if it is true?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “If it is true. You are already retiring from it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, not for a moment! You should not say that. I have not deserved it.
    </p>
    <p>
     I have spoken the truth; why do you doubt it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her reply was prompt.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Simply because you didn't speak it earlier!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh!” It wasn't a groan, exactly, but it was an intelligible enough
    </p>
    <p>
     expression of the fact that he saw the point and recognized that there
    </p>
    <p>
     was reason in it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You have seemed to conceal nothing from me that I ought to know
    </p>
    <p>
     concerning yourself, and you were not privileged to keep back such
    </p>
    <p>
     a thing as this from me a moment after--after--well, after you had
    </p>
    <p>
     determined to pay your court to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Its true, it's true, I know it! But there were circumstances--in--in
    </p>
    <p>
     the way--circumstances which--”
    </p>
    <p>
     She waved the circumstances aside.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, you see,” he said, pleadingly, “you seemed so bent on our
    </p>
    <p>
     traveling the proud path of honest labor and honorable poverty, that
    </p>
    <p>
     I was terrified--that is, I was afraid--of--of--well, you know how you
    </p>
    <p>
     talked.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, I know how I talked. And I also know that before the talk was
    </p>
    <p>
     finished you inquired how I stood as regards aristocracies, and my
    </p>
    <p>
     answer was calculated to relieve your fears.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He was silent a while. Then he said, in a discouraged way:
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't see any way out of it. It was a mistake. That is in truth
    </p>
    <p>
     all it was, just a mistake. No harm was meant, no harm in the world. I
    </p>
    <p>
     didn't see how it might some time look. It is my way. I don't seem to
    </p>
    <p>
     see far.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The girl was almost disarmed, for a moment. Then she flared up again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “An Earl's son! Do earls' sons go about working in lowly callings for
    </p>
    <p>
     their bread and butter?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “God knows they don't! I have wished they did.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do earls' sons sink their degree in a country like this, and come sober
    </p>
    <p>
     and decent to sue for the hand of a born child of poverty when they can
    </p>
    <p>
     go drunk, profane, and steeped in dishonorable debt and buy the pick
    </p>
    <p>
     and choice of the millionaires' daughters of America? You an earl's son!
    </p>
    <p>
     Show me the signs.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I thank God I am not able--if those are the signs. But yet I am an
    </p>
    <p>
     earl's son and heir. It is all I can say. I wish you would believe me,
    </p>
    <p>
     but you will not. I know no way to persuade you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She was about to soften again, but his closing remark made her bring her
    </p>
    <p>
     foot down with smart vexation, and she cried out:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, you drive all patience out of me! Would you have one believe that
    </p>
    <p>
     you haven't your proofs at hand, and yet are what you say you are? You
    </p>
    <p>
     do not put your hand in your pocket now--for you have nothing there. You
    </p>
    <p>
     make a claim like this, and then venture to travel without credentials.
    </p>
    <p>
     These are simply incredibilities. Don't you see that, yourself?”
    </p>
    <p>
     He cast about in his mind for a defence of some kind or other--hesitated
    </p>
    <p>
     a little, and then said, with difficulty and diffidence:
    </p>
    <p>
     “I will tell you just the truth, foolish as it will seem to you--to
    </p>
    <p>
     anybody, I suppose--but it is the truth. I had an ideal--call it a
    </p>
    <p>
     dream, a folly, if you will--but I wanted to renounce the privileges and
    </p>
    <p>
     unfair advantages enjoyed by the nobility and wrung from the nation by
    </p>
    <p>
     force and fraud, and purge myself of my share of those crimes against
    </p>
    <p>
     right and reason, by thenceforth comrading with the poor and humble on
    </p>
    <p>
     equal terms, earning with my own hands the bread I ate, and rising by my
    </p>
    <p>
     own merit if I rose at all.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The young girl scanned his face narrowly while he spoke; and there was
    </p>
    <p>
     something about his simplicity of manner and statement which touched her
    </p>
    <p>
     --touched her almost to the danger point; but she set her grip on the
    </p>
    <p>
     yielding spirit and choked it to quiescence; it could not be wise to
    </p>
    <p>
     surrender to compassion or any kind of sentiment, yet; she must ask
    </p>
    <p>
     one or two more questions. Tracy was reading her face; and what he read
    </p>
    <p>
     there lifted his drooping hopes a little.
    </p>
    <p>
     “An earl's son to do that! Why, he were a man! A man to love!--oh, more,
    </p>
    <p>
     a man to worship!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why, I--?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But he never lived! He is not born, he will not be born. The
    </p>
    <p>
     self-abnegation that could do that--even in utter folly, and hopeless of
    </p>
    <p>
     conveying benefit to any, beyond the mere example--could be mistaken for
    </p>
    <p>
     greatness; why, it would be greatness in this cold age of sordid ideals!
    </p>
    <p>
     A moment--wait--let me finish; I have one question more. Your father is
    </p>
    <p>
     earl of what?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rossmore--and I am Viscount Berkeley!”
    </p>
    <p>
     The fat was in the fire again. The girl felt so outraged that it was
    </p>
    <p>
     difficult for her to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How can you venture such a brazen thing! You know that he is dead, and
    </p>
    <p>
     you know that I know it. Oh, to rob the living of name and honors for
    </p>
    <p>
     a selfish and temporary advantage is crime enough, but to rob the
    </p>
    <p>
     defenceless dead--why it is more than crime, it degrades crime!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, listen to me--just a word--don't turn away like that. Don't
    </p>
    <p>
     go--don't leave me, so--stay one moment. On my honor--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, on your honor!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “On my honor I am what I say! And I will prove it, and you will believe,
    </p>
    <p>
     I know you will. I will bring you a message--a cablegram--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “When?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “To-morrow--next day--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Signed 'Rossmore'?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes--signed Rossmore.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What will that prove?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What will it prove? What should it prove?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you force me to say it--possibly the presence of a confederate
    </p>
    <p>
     somewhere.”
    </p>
    <p>
     This was a hard blow, and staggered him. He said, dejectedly:
    </p>
    <p>
     “It is true. I did not think of it. Oh, my God, I do not know any way
    </p>
    <p>
     to do; I do everything wrong. You are going?--and you won't say even
    </p>
    <p>
     good-night--or good-bye? Ah, we have not parted like this before.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, I want to run and--no, go, now.” A pause--then she said, “You may
    </p>
    <p>
     bring the message when it comes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, may I? God bless you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He was gone; and none too soon; her lips were already quivering, and now
    </p>
    <p>
     she broke down. Through her sobbings her words broke from time to time.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, he is gone. I have lost him, I shall never see him any more. And he
    </p>
    <p>
     didn't kiss me good-bye; never even offered to force a kiss from me,
    </p>
    <p>
     and he knowing it was the very, very last, and I expecting he would,
    </p>
    <p>
     and never dreaming he would treat me so after all we have been to each
    </p>
    <p>
     other. Oh, oh, oh, oh, what shall I do, what shall I do! He is a dear,
    </p>
    <p>
     poor, miserable, good-hearted, transparent liar and humbug, but oh, I do
    </p>
    <p>
     love him so--!” After a little she broke into speech again. “How dear
    </p>
    <p>
     he is! and I shall miss him so, I shall miss him so! Why won't he ever
    </p>
    <p>
     think to forge a message and fetch it?--but no, he never will, he never
    </p>
    <p>
     thinks of anything; he's so honest and simple it wouldn't ever occur to
    </p>
    <p>
     him. Oh, what did possess him to think he could succeed as a fraud--and
    </p>
    <p>
     he hasn't the first requisite except duplicity that I can see. Oh, dear,
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll go to bed and give it all up. Oh, I wish I had told him to come
    </p>
    <p>
     and tell me whenever he didn't get any telegram--and now it's all my own
    </p>
    <p>
     fault if I never see him again. How my eyes must look!”

    <p>
     Next day, sure enough, the cablegram didn't come. This was an immense
    </p>
    <p>
     disaster; for Tracy couldn't go into the presence without that ticket,
    </p>
    <p>
     although it wasn't going to possess any value as evidence. But if the
    </p>
    <p>
     failure of the cablegram on that first day may be called an immense
    </p>
    <p>
     disaster, where is the dictionary that can turn out a phrase sizeable
    </p>
    <p>
     enough to describe the tenth day's failure? Of course every day that the
    </p>
    <p>
     cablegram didn't come made Tracy all of twenty-four hours' more ashamed
    </p>
    <p>
     of himself than he was the day before, and made Sally fully twenty-four
    </p>
    <p>
     hours more certain than ever that he not only hadn't any father
    </p>
    <p>
     anywhere, but hadn't even a confederate--and so it followed that he was
    </p>
    <p>
     a double-dyed humbug and couldn't be otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
     These were hard days for Barrow and the art firm. All these had their
    </p>
    <p>
     hands full, trying to comfort Tracy. Barrow's task was particularly
    </p>
    <p>
     hard, because he was made a confidant in full, and therefore had to
    </p>
    <p>
     humor Tracy's delusion that he had a father, and that the father was an
    </p>
    <p>
     earl, and that he was going to send a cablegram. Barrow early gave up
    </p>
    <p>
     the idea of trying to convince Tracy that he hadn't any father, because
    </p>
    <p>
     this had such a bad effect on the patient, and worked up his temper to
    </p>
    <p>
     such an alarming degree. He had tried, as an experiment, letting Tracy
    </p>
    <p>
     think he had a father; the result was so good that he went further, with
    </p>
    <p>
     proper caution, and tried letting him think his father was an earl; this
    </p>
    <p>
     wrought so well, that he grew bold, and tried letting him think he had
    </p>
    <p>
     two fathers, if he wanted to, but he didn't want to, so Barrow withdrew
    </p>
    <p>
     one of them and substituted letting him think he was going to get a
    </p>
    <p>
     cablegram--which Barrow judged he wouldn't, and was right; but Barrow
    </p>
    <p>
     worked the cablegram daily for all it was worth, and it was the one
    </p>
    <p>
     thing that kept Tracy alive; that was Barrow's opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
     And these were bitter hard days for poor Sally, and mainly delivered
    </p>
    <p>
     up to private crying. She kept her furniture pretty damp, and so caught
    </p>
    <p>
     cold, and the dampness and the cold and the sorrow together undermined
    </p>
    <p>
     her appetite, and she was a pitiful enough object, poor thing. Her state
    </p>
    <p>
     was bad enough, as per statement of it above quoted; but all the forces
    </p>
    <p>
     of nature and circumstance seemed conspiring to make it worse--and
    </p>
    <p>
     succeeding. For instance, the morning after her dismissal of Tracy,
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins and Sellers read in the associated press dispatches that a toy
    </p>
    <p>
     puzzle called Pigs in the Clover, had come into sudden favor within
    </p>
    <p>
     the past few weeks, and that from the Atlantic to the Pacific all the
    </p>
    <p>
     populations of all the States had knocked off work to play with it,
    </p>
    <p>
     and that the business of the country had now come to a standstill
    </p>
    <p>
     by consequence; that judges, lawyers, burglars, parsons, thieves,
    </p>
    <p>
     merchants, mechanics, murderers, women, children, babies--everybody,
    </p>
    <p>
     indeed, could be seen from morning till midnight, absorbed in one deep
    </p>
    <p>
     project and purpose, and only one--to pen those pigs, work out that
    </p>
    <p>
     puzzle successfully; that all gayety, all cheerfulness had departed from
    </p>
    <p>
     the nation, and in its place care, preoccupation and anxiety sat upon
    </p>
    <p>
     every countenance, and all faces were drawn, distressed, and furrowed
    </p>
    <p>
     with the signs of age and trouble, and marked with the still sadder
    </p>
    <p>
     signs of mental decay and incipient madness; that factories were at
    </p>
    <p>
     work night and day in eight cities, and yet to supply the demand for the
    </p>
    <p>
     puzzle was thus far impossible. Hawkins was wild with joy, but Sellers
    </p>
    <p>
     was calm. Small matters could not disturb his serenity. He said--
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's just the way things go. A man invents a thing which could
    </p>
    <p>
     revolutionize the arts, produce mountains of money, and bless the earth,
    </p>
    <p>
     and who will bother with it or show any interest in it?--and so you are
    </p>
    <p>
     just as poor as you were before. But you invent some worthless thing to
    </p>
    <p>
     amuse yourself with, and would throw it away if let alone, and all of
    </p>
    <p>
     a sudden the whole world makes a snatch for it and out crops a fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hunt up that Yankee and collect, Hawkins--half is yours, you know. Leave
    </p>
    <p>
     me to potter at my lecture.”
    </p>
    <p>
     This was a temperance lecture. Sellers was head chief in the Temperance
    </p>
    <p>
     camp, and had lectured, now and then in that interest, but had been
    </p>
    <p>
     dissatisfied with his efforts; wherefore he was now about to try a new
    </p>
    <p>
     plan. After much thought he had concluded that a main reason why his
    </p>
    <p>
     lectures lacked fire or something, was that they were too transparently
    </p>
    <p>
     amateurish; that is to say, it was probably too plainly perceptible
    </p>
    <p>
     that the lecturer was trying to tell people about the horrid effects of
    </p>
    <p>
     liquor when he didn't really know anything about those effects except
    </p>
    <p>
     from hearsay, since he had hardly ever tasted an intoxicant in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
     His scheme, now, was to prepare himself to speak from bitter experience.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins was to stand by with the bottle, calculate the doses, watch the
    </p>
    <p>
     effects, make notes of results, and otherwise assist in the preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Time was short, for the ladies would be along about noon--that is to
    </p>
    <p>
     say, the temperance organization called the Daughters of Siloam--and
    </p>
    <p>
     Sellers must be ready to head the procession.
    </p>
    <p>
     The time kept slipping along--Hawkins did not return--Sellers could not
    </p>
    <p>
     venture to wait longer; so he attacked the bottle himself, and proceeded
    </p>
    <p>
     to note the effects. Hawkins got back at last; took one comprehensive
    </p>
    <p>
     glance at the lecturer, and went down and headed off the procession. The
    </p>
    <p>
     ladies were grieved to hear that the champion had been taken suddenly
    </p>
    <p>
     ill and violently so, but glad to hear that it was hoped he would be out
    </p>
    <p>
     again in a few days.
    </p>
    <p>
     As it turned out, the old gentleman didn't turn over or show any signs
    </p>
    <p>
     of life worth speaking of for twenty-four hours. Then he asked after the
    </p>
    <p>
     procession, and learned what had happened about it. He was sorry; said
    </p>
    <p>
     he had been “fixed” for it. He remained abed several days, and his
    </p>
    <p>
     wife and daughter took turns in sitting with him and ministering to his
    </p>
    <p>
     wants. Often he patted Sally's head and tried to comfort her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't cry, my child, don't cry so; you know your old father did it
    </p>
    <p>
     by mistake and didn't mean a bit of harm; you know he wouldn't
    </p>
    <p>
     intentionally do anything to make you ashamed for the world; you know he
    </p>
    <p>
     was trying to do good and only made the mistake through ignorance, not
    </p>
    <p>
     knowing the right doses and Washington not there to help. Don't cry so,
    </p>
    <p>
     dear, it breaks my old heart to see you, and think I've brought this
    </p>
    <p>
     humiliation on you and you so dear to me and so good. I won't ever do it
    </p>
    <p>
     again, indeed I won't; now be comforted, honey, that's a good child.”
    </p>
    <p>
     But when she wasn't on duty at the bedside the crying went on just the
    </p>
    <p>
     same; then the mother would try to comfort her, and say:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't cry, dear, he never meant any harm; it was all one of those
    </p>
    <p>
     happens that you can't guard against when you are trying experiments,
    </p>
    <p>
     that way. You see I don't cry. It's because I know him so well. I could
    </p>
    <p>
     never look anybody in the face again if he had got into such an amazing
    </p>
    <p>
     condition as that a-purpose; but bless you his intention was pure
    </p>
    <p>
     and high, and that makes the act pure, though it was higher than was
    </p>
    <p>
     necessary. We're not humiliated, dear, he did it under a noble impulse
    </p>
    <p>
     and we don't need to be ashamed. There, don't cry any more, honey.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus, the old gentleman was useful to Sally, during several days, as an
    </p>
    <p>
     explanation of her tearfulness. She felt thankful to him for the shelter
    </p>
    <p>
     he was affording her, but often said to herself, “It's a shame to let
    </p>
    <p>
     him see in my crying a reproach--as if he could ever do anything that
    </p>
    <p>
     could make me reproach him! But I can't confess; I've got to go on using
    </p>
    <p>
     him for a pretext, he's the only one I've got in the world, and I do
    </p>
    <p>
     need one so much.”
    </p>
    <p>
     As soon as Sellers was out again, and found that stacks of money had
    </p>
    <p>
     been placed in bank for him and Hawkins by the Yankee, he said, “Now
    </p>
    <p>
     we'll soon see who's the Claimant and who's the Authentic. I'll just go
    </p>
    <p>
     over there and warm up that House of Lords.” During the next few days
    </p>
    <p>
     he and his wife were so busy with preparations for the voyage that Sally
    </p>
    <p>
     had all the privacy she needed, and all the chance to cry that was good
    </p>
    <p>
     for her. Then the old pair left for New York--and England.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sally had also had a chance to do another thing. That was, to make up
    </p>
    <p>
     her mind that life was not worth living upon the present terms. If she
    </p>
    <p>
     must give up her impostor and die, doubtless she must submit; but might
    </p>
    <p>
     she not lay her whole case before some disinterested person, first,
    </p>
    <p>
     and see if there wasn't perhaps some saving way out of the matter? She
    </p>
    <p>
     turned this idea over in her mind a good deal. In her first visit with
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins after her parents were gone, the talk fell upon Tracy, and she
    </p>
    <p>
     was impelled to set her case before the statesman and take his counsel.
    </p>
    <p>
     So she poured out her heart, and he listened with painful solicitude.
    </p>
    <p>
     She concluded, pleadingly, with--
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't tell me he is an impostor. I suppose he is, but doesn't it look
    </p>
    <p>
     to you as if he isn't? You are cool, you know, and outside; and so,
    </p>
    <p>
     maybe it can look to you as if he isn't one, when it can't to me.
    </p>
    <p>
     Doesn't it look to you as if he isn't? Couldn't you--can't it look to
    </p>
    <p>
     you that way--for--for my sake?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The poor man was troubled, but he felt obliged to keep in the
    </p>
    <p>
     neighborhood of the truth. He fought around the present detail a little
    </p>
    <p>
     while, then gave it up and said he couldn't really see his way to
    </p>
    <p>
     clearing Tracy.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” he said, “the truth is, he's an impostor.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That is, you--you feel a little certain, but not entirely--oh, not
    </p>
    <p>
     entirely, Mr. Hawkins!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's a pity to have to say it--I do hate to say it, but I don't think
    </p>
    <p>
     anything about it, I know he's an impostor.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, now, Mr. Hawkins, you can't go that far. A body can't really know
    </p>
    <p>
     it, you know. It isn't proved that he's not what he says he is.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Should he come out and make a clean breast of the whole wretched
    </p>
    <p>
     business? Yes--at least the most of it--it ought to be done. So he set
    </p>
    <p>
     his teeth and went at the matter with determination, but purposing to
    </p>
    <p>
     spare the girl one pain--that of knowing that Tracy was a criminal.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now I am going to tell you a plain tale; one not pleasant for me to
    </p>
    <p>
     tell or for you to hear, but we've got to stand it. I know all about
    </p>
    <p>
     that fellow; and I know he is no earl's son.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The girl's eyes flashed, and she said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't care a snap for that--go on!”
    </p>
    <p>
     This was so wholly unexpected that it at once obstructed the narrative;
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins was not even sure that he had heard aright. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know that I quite understand. Do you mean to say that if he was
    </p>
    <p>
     all right and proper otherwise you'd be indifferent about the earl part
    </p>
    <p>
     of the business?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Absolutely.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You'd be entirely satisfied with him and wouldn't care for his not
    </p>
    <p>
     being an earl's son,--that being an earl's son wouldn't add any value to
    </p>
    <p>
     him?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not the least value that I would care for. Why, Mr. Hawkins, I've
    </p>
    <p>
     gotten over all that day-dreaming about earldoms and aristocracies and
    </p>
    <p>
     all such nonsense and am become just a plain ordinary nobody and content
    </p>
    <p>
     with it; and it is to him I owe my cure. And as to anything being able
    </p>
    <p>
     to add a value to him, nothing can do that. He is the whole world to me,
    </p>
    <p>
     just as he is; he comprehends all the values there are--then how can you
    </p>
    <p>
     add one?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She's pretty far gone.” He said that to himself. He continued, still to
    </p>
    <p>
     himself, “I must change my plan again; I can't seem to strike one that
    </p>
    <p>
     will stand the requirements of this most variegated emergency five
    </p>
    <p>
     minutes on a stretch. Without making this fellow a criminal, I believe I
    </p>
    <p>
     will invent a name and a character for him calculated to disenchant her.
    </p>
    <p>
     If it fails to do it, then I'll know that the next rightest thing to do
    </p>
    <p>
     will be to help her to her fate, poor thing, not hinder her.” Then he
    </p>
    <p>
     said aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, Gwendolen--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want to be called Sally.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm glad of it; I like it better, myself. Well, then, I'll tell you
    </p>
    <p>
     about this man Snodgrass.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Snodgrass! Is that his name?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes--Snodgrass. The other's his nom de plume.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's hideous!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know it is, but we can't help our names.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And that is truly his real name--and not Howard Tracy?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins answered, regretfully:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, it seems a pity.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The girl sampled the name musingly, once or twice--
    </p>
    <p>
     “Snodgrass. Snodgrass. No, I could not endure that. I could not get used
    </p>
    <p>
     to it. No, I should call him by his first name. What is his first name?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “His--er--his initials are S. M.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “His initials? I don't care anything about his initials. I can't call
    </p>
    <p>
     him by his initials. What do they stand for?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, you see, his father was a physician, and he--he--well he was an
    </p>
    <p>
     idolater of his profession, and he--well, he was a very eccentric man,
    </p>
    <p>
     and--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do they stand for! What are you shuffling about?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “They--well they stand for Spinal Meningitis. His father being a phy--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I never heard such an infamous name! Nobody can ever call a person
    </p>
    <p>
     that--a person they love. I wouldn't call an enemy by such a name.
    </p>
    <p>
     It sounds like an epithet.” After a moment, she added with a kind of
    </p>
    <p>
     consternation, “Why, it would be my name! Letters would come with it
    </p>
    <p>
     on.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes--Mrs. Spinal Meningitis Snodgrass.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't repeat it--don't; I can't bear it. Was the father a lunatic?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, that is not charged.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am glad of that, because that is transmissible. What do you think was
    </p>
    <p>
     the matter with him, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I don't really know. The family used to run a good deal to
    </p>
    <p>
     idiots, and so, maybe--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, there isn't any maybe about it. This one was an idiot.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, yes--he could have been. He was suspected.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Suspected!” said Sally, with irritation. “Would one suspect there was
    </p>
    <p>
     going to be a dark time if he saw the constellations fall out of the
    </p>
    <p>
     sky? But that is enough about the idiot, I don't take any interest in
    </p>
    <p>
     idiots; tell me about the son.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Very well, then, this one was the eldest, but not the favorite. His
    </p>
    <p>
     brother, Zylobalsamum--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait--give me a chance to realize that. It is perfectly stupefying.
    </p>
    <p>
     Zylo--what did you call it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Zylobalsamum.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I never heard such a name: It sounds like a disease. Is it a disease?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I don't think it's a disease. It's either Scriptural or--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, it's not Scriptural.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then it's anatomical. I knew it was one or the other. Yes, I remember,
    </p>
    <p>
     now, it is anatomical. It's a ganglion--a nerve centre--it is what is
    </p>
    <p>
     called the zylobalsamum process.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, go on; and if you come to any more of them, omit the names; they
    </p>
    <p>
     make one feel so uncomfortable.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Very well, then. As I said, this one was not a favorite in the family,
    </p>
    <p>
     and so he was neglected in every way, never sent to school, always
    </p>
    <p>
     allowed to associate with the worst and coarsest characters, and so of
    </p>
    <p>
     course he has grown up a rude, vulgar, ignorant, dissipated ruffian,
    </p>
    <p>
     and--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “He? It's no such thing! You ought to be more generous than to make such
    </p>
    <p>
     a statement as that about a poor young stranger who--who--why, he is the
    </p>
    <p>
     very opposite of that! He is considerate, courteous, obliging, modest,
    </p>
    <p>
     gentle, refined, cultivated-oh, for shame! how can you say such things
    </p>
    <p>
     about him?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't blame you, Sally--indeed I haven't a word of blame for you for
    </p>
    <p>
     being blinded by--your affection--blinded to these minor defects which
    </p>
    <p>
     are so manifest to others who--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Minor defects? Do you call these minor defects? What are murder and
    </p>
    <p>
     arson, pray?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It is a difficult question to answer straight off--and of course
    </p>
    <p>
     estimates of such things vary with environment. With us, out our way,
    </p>
    <p>
     they would not necessarily attract as much attention as with you, yet
    </p>
    <p>
     they are often regarded with disapproval--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Murder and arson are regarded with disapproval?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, frequently.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “With disapproval. Who are those Puritans you are talking about? But
    </p>
    <p>
     wait--how did you come to know so much about this family? Where did you
    </p>
    <p>
     get all this hearsay evidence?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sally, it isn't hearsay evidence. That is the serious part of it. I
    </p>
    <p>
     knew that family--personally.”
    </p>
    <p>
     This was a surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You? You actually knew them?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Knew Zylo, as we used to call him, and knew his father, Dr. Snodgrass.
    </p>
    <p>
     I didn't know your own Snodgrass, but have had glimpses of him from time
    </p>
    <p>
     to time, and I heard about him all the time. He was the common talk, you
    </p>
    <p>
     see, on account of his--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “On account of his not being a house-burner or an assassin, I suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
     That would have made him commonplace. Where did you know these people?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “In Cherokee Strip.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, how preposterous! There are not enough people in Cherokee Strip to
    </p>
    <p>
     give anybody a reputation, good or bad. There isn't a quorum. Why the
    </p>
    <p>
     whole population consists of a couple of wagon loads of horse thieves.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins answered placidly--
    </p>
    <p>
     “Our friend was one of those wagon loads.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Sally's eyes burned and her breath came quick and fast, but she kept a
    </p>
    <p>
     fairly good grip on her anger and did not let it get the advantage of
    </p>
    <p>
     her tongue. The statesman sat still and waited for developments. He was
    </p>
    <p>
     content with his work. It was as handsome a piece of diplomatic art as
    </p>
    <p>
     he had ever turned out, he thought; and now, let the girl make her own
    </p>
    <p>
     choice. He judged she would let her spectre go; he hadn't a doubt of it
    </p>
    <p>
     in fact; but anyway, let the choice be made, and he was ready to ratify
    </p>
    <p>
     it and offer no further hindrance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meantime Sally had thought her case out and made up her mind. To the
    </p>
    <p>
     major's disappointment the verdict was against him. Sally said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “He has no friend but me, and I will not desert him now. I will not
    </p>
    <p>
     marry him if his moral character is bad; but if he can prove that it
    </p>
    <p>
     isn't, I will--and he shall have the chance. To me he seems utterly
    </p>
    <p>
     good and dear; I've never seen anything about him that looked
    </p>
    <p>
     otherwise--except, of course, his calling himself an earl's son. Maybe
    </p>
    <p>
     that is only vanity, and no real harm, when you get to the bottom of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     I do not believe he is any such person as you have painted him. I want
    </p>
    <p>
     to see him. I want you to find him and send him to me. I will implore
    </p>
    <p>
     him to be honest with me, and tell me the whole truth, and not be
    </p>
    <p>
     afraid.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Very well; if that is your decision I will do it. But Sally, you know,
    </p>
    <p>
     he's poor, and--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, I don't care anything about that. That's neither here nor there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Will you bring him to me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll do it. When?--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, dear, it's getting toward dark, now, and so you'll have to put
    </p>
    <p>
     it off till morning. But you will find him in the morning, won't you?
    </p>
    <p>
     Promise.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll have him here by daylight.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, now you're your own old self again--and lovelier than ever!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I couldn't ask fairer than that. Good-bye, dear.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Sally mused a moment alone, then said earnestly, “I love him in spite of
    </p>
    <p>
     his name!” and went about her affairs with a light heart.
    </p>

     CHAPTER XXV.
    </head>
    <p>
     Hawkins went straight to the telegraph office and disburdened his
    </p>
    <p>
     conscience. He said to himself, “She's not going to give this galvanized
    </p>
    <p>
     cadaver up, that's plain. Wild horses can't pull her away from him. I've
    </p>
    <p>
     done my share; it's for Sellers to take an innings, now.” So he sent
    </p>
    <p>
     this message to New York:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come back. Hire special train. She's going to marry the materializee.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Meantime a note came to Rossmore Towers to say that the Earl of Rossmore
    </p>
    <p>
     had just arrived from England, and would do himself the pleasure of
    </p>
    <p>
     calling in the evening. Sally said to herself, “It is a pity he didn't
    </p>
    <p>
     stop in New York; but it's no matter; he can go up to-morrow and see my
    </p>
    <p>
     father. He has come over here to tomahawk papa, very likely--or buy out
    </p>
    <p>
     his claim. This thing would have excited me, a while back; but it
    </p>
    <p>
     has only one interest for me now, and only one value. I can say
    </p>
    <p>
     to--to--Spine, Spiny, Spinal--I don't like any form of that name!--I can
    </p>
    <p>
     say to him to-morrow, 'Don't try to keep it up any more, or I shall have
    </p>
    <p>
     to tell you whom I have been talking with last night, and then you will
    </p>
    <p>
     be embarrassed.'”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy couldn't know he was to be invited for the morrow, or he might
    </p>
    <p>
     have waited. As it was, he was too miserable to wait any longer; for his
    </p>
    <p>
     last hope--a letter--had failed him. It was fully due to-day; it had
    </p>
    <p>
     not come. Had his father really flung him away? It looked so. It was not
    </p>
    <p>
     like his father, but it surely looked so. His father was a rather
    </p>
    <p>
     tough nut, in truth, but had never been so with his son--still, this
    </p>
    <p>
     implacable silence had a calamitous look. Anyway, Tracy would go to
    </p>
    <p>
     the Towers and --then what? He didn't know; his head was tired out with
    </p>
    <p>
     thinking--he wouldn't think about what he must do or say--let it
    </p>
    <p>
     all take care of itself. So that he saw Sally once more, he would be
    </p>
    <p>
     satisfied, happen what might; he wouldn't care.
    </p>
    <p>
     He hardly knew how he got to the Towers, or when. He knew and cared for
    </p>
    <p>
     only one thing--he was alone with Sally. She was kind, she was gentle,
    </p>
    <p>
     there was moisture in her eyes, and a yearning something in her face and
    </p>
    <p>
     manner which she could not wholly hide--but she kept her distance. They
    </p>
    <p>
     talked. Bye and bye she said--watching his downcast countenance out of
    </p>
    <p>
     the corner of her eye--
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's so lonesome--with papa and mamma gone. I try to read, but I can't
    </p>
    <p>
     seem to get interested in any book. I try the newspapers, but they
    </p>
    <p>
     do put such rubbish in them. You take up a paper and start to read
    </p>
    <p>
     something you thinks interesting, and it goes on and on and on about how
    </p>
    <p>
     somebody--well, Dr. Snodgrass, for instance--”
    </p>
    <p>
     Not a movement from Tracy, not the quiver of a muscle. Sally was amazed
    </p>
    <p>
     --what command of himself he must have! Being disconcerted, she paused
    </p>
    <p>
     so long that Tracy presently looked up wearily and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, I thought you were not listening. Yes, it goes on and on about
    </p>
    <p>
     this Doctor Snodgrass, till you are so tired, and then about his younger
    </p>
    <p>
     son--the favorite son--Zylobalsamum Snodgrass--”
    </p>
    <p>
     Not a sign from Tracy, whose head was drooping again. What supernatural
    </p>
    <p>
     self-possession! Sally fixed her eye on him and began again, resolved
    </p>
    <p>
     to blast him out of his serenity this time if she knew how to apply the
    </p>
    <p>
     dynamite that is concealed in certain forms of words when those words
    </p>
    <p>
     are properly loaded with unexpected meanings.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And next it goes on and on and on about the eldest son--not the
    </p>
    <p>
     favorite, this one--and how he is neglected in his poor barren boyhood,
    </p>
    <p>
     and allowed to grow up unschooled, ignorant, coarse, vulgar, the comrade
    </p>
    <p>
     of the community's scum, and become in his completed manhood a rude,
    </p>
    <p>
     profane, dissipated ruffian--”
    </p>
    <p>
     That head still drooped! Sally rose, moved softly and solemnly a step or
    </p>
    <p>
     two, and stood before Tracy--his head came slowly up, his meek eyes met
    </p>
    <p>
     her intense ones--then she finished with deep impressiveness--
    </p>
    <p>
     “--named Spinal Meningitis Snodgrass!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracy merely exhibited signs of increased fatigue. The girl was outraged
    </p>
    <p>
     by this iron indifference and callousness, and cried out--
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you made of?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I? Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Haven't you any sensitiveness? Don't these things touch any poor
    </p>
    <p>
     remnant of delicate feeling in you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “N--no,” he said wonderingly, “they don't seem to. Why should they?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “O, dear me, how can you look so innocent, and foolish, and good, and
    </p>
    <p>
     empty, and gentle, and all that, right in the hearing of such things as
    </p>
    <p>
     those! Look me in the eye--straight in the eye. There, now then, answer
    </p>
    <p>
     me without a flinch. Isn't Doctor Snodgrass your father, and isn't
    </p>
    <p>
     Zylobalsamum your brother,” [here Hawkins was about to enter the room,
    </p>
    <p>
     but changed his mind upon hearing these words, and elected for a walk
    </p>
    <p>
     down town, and so glided swiftly away], “and isn't your name Spinal
    </p>
    <p>
     Meningitis, and isn't your father a doctor and an idiot, like all the
    </p>
    <p>
     family for generations, and doesn't he name all his children after
    </p>
    <p>
     poisons and pestilences and abnormal anatomical eccentricities of the
    </p>
    <p>
     human body? Answer me, some way or somehow--and quick. Why do you sit
    </p>
    <p>
     there looking like an envelope without any address on it and see me
    </p>
    <p>
     going mad before your face with suspense!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, I wish I could do--do--I wish I could do something, anything that
    </p>
    <p>
     would give you peace again and make you happy; but I know of nothing--I
    </p>
    <p>
     know of no way. I have never heard of these awful people before.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? Say it again!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have never--never in my life till now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, you do look so honest when you say that! It must be true--surely
    </p>
    <p>
     you couldn't look that way, you wouldn't look that way if it were not
    </p>
    <p>
     true--would you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I couldn't and wouldn't. It is true. Oh, let us end this
    </p>
    <p>
     suffering--take me back into your heart and confidence--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait--one more thing. Tell me you told that falsehood out of mere
    </p>
    <p>
     vanity and are sorry for it; that you're not expecting to ever wear the
    </p>
    <p>
     coronet of an earl--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Truly I am cured--cured this very day--I am not expecting it!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “O, now you are mine! I've got you back in the beauty and glory of your
    </p>
    <p>
     unsmirched poverty and your honorable obscurity, and nobody shall ever
    </p>
    <p>
     take you from me again but the grave! And if--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “De earl of Rossmore, fum Englan'!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “My father!” The young man released the girl and hung his head.
    </p>
    <p>
     The old gentleman stood surveying the couple--the one with a strongly
    </p>
    <p>
     complimentary right eye, the other with a mixed expression done with the
    </p>
    <p>
     left. This is difficult, and not often resorted to. Presently his face
    </p>
    <p>
     relaxed into a kind of constructive gentleness, and he said to his son:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't you think you could embrace me, too?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The young man did it with alacrity. “Then you are the son of an earl,
    </p>
    <p>
     after all,” said Sally, reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, I--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then I won't have you!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “O, but you know--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I will not. You've told me another fib.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She's right. Go away and leave us. I want to talk with her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Berkeley was obliged to go. But he did not go far. He remained on the
    </p>
    <p>
     premises. At midnight the conference between the old gentleman and
    </p>
    <p>
     the young girl was still going blithely on, but it presently drew to a
    </p>
    <p>
     close, and the former said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “I came all the way over here to inspect you, my dear, with the general
    </p>
    <p>
     idea of breaking off this match if there were two fools of you, but as
    </p>
    <p>
     there's only one, you can have him if you'll take him.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Indeed I will, then! May I kiss you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You may. Thank you. Now you shall have that privilege whenever you are
    </p>
    <p>
     good.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Meantime Hawkins had long ago returned and slipped up into the
    </p>
    <p>
     laboratory. He was rather disconcerted to find his late invention,
    </p>
    <p>
     Snodgrass, there. The news was told him that the English Rossmore was
    </p>
    <p>
     come.
    </p>
    <p>
     --“And I'm his son, Viscount Berkeley, not Howard Tracy any more.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins was aghast. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good gracious, then you're dead!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Dead?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes you are--we've got your ashes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hang those ashes, I'm tired of them; I'll give them to my father.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly and painfully the statesman worked the truth into his head that
    </p>
    <p>
     this was really a flesh and blood young man, and not the insubstantial
    </p>
    <p>
     resurrection he and Sellers had so long supposed him to be. Then he said
    </p>
    <p>
     with feeling--
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm so glad; so glad on Sally's account, poor thing. We took you for
    </p>
    <p>
     a departed materialized bank thief from Tahlequah. This will be a heavy
    </p>
    <p>
     blow to Sellers.” Then he explained the whole matter to Berkeley, who
    </p>
    <p>
     said:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, the Claimant must manage to stand the blow, severe as it is. But
    </p>
    <p>
     he'll get over the disappointment.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who--the colonel? He'll get over it the minute he invents a new
    </p>
    <p>
     miracle to take its place. And he's already at it by this time. But look
    </p>
    <p>
     here--what do you suppose became of the man you've been representing all
    </p>
    <p>
     this time?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know. I saved his clothes--it was all I could do. I am afraid
    </p>
    <p>
     he lost his life.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, you must have found twenty or thirty thousand dollars in those
    </p>
    <p>
     clothes, in money or certificates of deposit.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I found only five hundred and a trifle. I borrowed the trifle and
    </p>
    <p>
     banked the five hundred.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What'll we do about it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Return it to the owner.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's easy said, but not easy to manage. Let's leave it alone till we
    </p>
    <p>
     get Sellers's advice. And that reminds me. I've got to run and meet
    </p>
    <p>
     Sellers and explain who you are not and who you are, or he'll come
    </p>
    <p>
     thundering in here to stop his daughter from marrying a phantom.
    </p>
    <p>
     But--suppose your father came over here to break off the match?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, isn't he down stairs getting acquainted with Sally? That's all
    </p>
    <p>
     safe.”
    </p>
    <p>
     So Hawkins departed to meet and prepare the Sellerses.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rossmore Towers saw great times and late hours during the succeeding
    </p>
    <p>
     week. The two earls were such opposites in nature that they fraternized
    </p>
    <p>
     at once. Sellers said privately that Rossmore was the most extraordinary
    </p>
    <p>
     character he had ever met--a man just made out of the condensed milk of
    </p>
    <p>
     human kindness, yet with the ability to totally hide the fact from any
    </p>
    <p>
     but the most practised character-reader; a man whose whole being was
    </p>
    <p>
     sweetness, patience and charity, yet with a cunning so profound, an
    </p>
    <p>
     ability so marvelous in the acting of a double part, that many a person
    </p>
    <p>
     of considerable intelligence might live with him for centuries and never
    </p>
    <p>
     suspect the presence in him of these characteristics.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally there was a quiet wedding at the Towers, instead of a big one
    </p>
    <p>
     at the British embassy, with the militia and the fire brigades and the
    </p>
    <p>
     temperance organizations on hand in torchlight procession, as at first
    </p>
    <p>
     proposed by one of the earls. The art-firm and Barrow were present at
    </p>
    <p>
     the wedding, and the tinner and Puss had been invited, but the tinner
    </p>
    <p>
     was ill and Puss was nursing him--for they were engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Sellerses were to go to England with their new allies for a brief
    </p>
    <p>
     visit, but when it was time to take the train from Washington, the
    </p>
    <p>
     colonel was missing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawkins was going as far as New York with the party, and said he would
    </p>
    <p>
     explain the matter on the road.
    </p>
    <p>
     The explanation was in a letter left by the colonel in Hawkins's hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     In it he promised to join Mrs. Sellers later, in England, and then went
    </p>
    <p>
     on to say:
    </p>
    <p>
     The truth is, my dear Hawkins, a mighty idea has been born to me within
    </p>
    <p>
     the hour, and I must not even stop to say goodbye to my dear ones.
    </p>
    <p>
     A man's highest duty takes precedence of all minor ones, and must be
    </p>
    <p>
     attended to with his best promptness and energy, at whatsoever cost to
    </p>
    <p>
     his affections or his convenience. And first of all a man's duties
    </p>
    <p>
     is his duty to his own honor--he must keep that spotless. Mine is
    </p>
    <p>
     threatened. When I was feeling sure of my imminent future solidity, I
    </p>
    <p>
     forwarded to the Czar of Russia--perhaps prematurely--an offer for the
    </p>
    <p>
     purchase of Siberia, naming a vast sum. Since then an episode has
    </p>
    <p>
     warned me that the method by which I was expecting to acquire this
    </p>
    <p>
     money--materialization upon a scale of limitless magnitude--is marred
    </p>
    <p>
     by a taint of temporary uncertainty. His imperial majesty may accept
    </p>
    <p>
     my offer at any moment. If this should occur now, I should find myself
    </p>
    <p>
     painfully embarrassed, in fact financially inadequate. I could not take
    </p>
    <p>
     Siberia. This would become known, and my credit would suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Recently my private hours have been dark indeed, but the sun shines
    </p>
    <p>
     again now; I see my way; I shall be able to meet my obligation, and
    </p>
    <p>
     without having to ask an extension of the stipulated time, I think. This
    </p>
    <p>
     grand new idea of mine--the sublimest I have ever conceived, will save
    </p>
    <p>
     me whole, I am sure. I am leaving for San Francisco this moment, to test
    </p>
    <p>
     it, by the help of the great Lick telescope. Like all of my more notable
    </p>
    <p>
     discoveries and inventions, it is based upon hard, practical scientific
    </p>
    <p>
     laws; all other bases are unsound and hence untrustworthy. In brief,
    </p>
    <p>
     then, I have conceived the stupendous idea of reorganizing the climates
    </p>
    <p>
     of the earth according to the desire of the populations interested.
    </p>
    <p>
     That is to say, I will furnish climates to order, for cash or negotiable
    </p>
    <p>
     paper, taking the old climates in part payment, of course, at a fair
    </p>
    <p>
     discount, where they are in condition to be repaired at small cost and
    </p>
    <p>
     let out for hire to poor and remote communities not able to afford a
    </p>
    <p>
     good climate and not caring for an expensive one for mere display.
    </p>
    <p>
     My studies have convinced me that the regulation of climates and the
    </p>
    <p>
     breeding of new varieties at will from the old stock is a feasible
    </p>
    <p>
     thing. Indeed I am convinced that it has been done before; done in
    </p>
    <p>
     prehistoric times by now forgotten and unrecorded civilizations.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everywhere I find hoary evidences of artificial manipulation of climates
    </p>
    <p>
     in bygone times. Take the glacial period. Was that produced by accident?
    </p>
    <p>
     Not at all; it was done for money. I have a thousand proofs of it, and
    </p>
    <p>
     will some day reveal them.
    </p>
    <p>
     I will confide to you an outline of my idea. It is to utilize the
    </p>
    <p>
     spots on the sun--get control of them, you understand, and apply the
    </p>
    <p>
     stupendous energies which they wield to beneficent purposes in the
    </p>
    <p>
     reorganizing of our climates. At present they merely make trouble and do
    </p>
    <p>
     harm in the evoking of cyclones and other kinds of electric storms; but
    </p>
    <p>
     once under humane and intelligent control this will cease and they will
    </p>
    <p>
     become a boon to man.
    </p>
    <p>
     I have my plan all mapped out, whereby I hope and expect to acquire
    </p>
    <p>
     complete and perfect control of the sun-spots, also details of the
    </p>
    <p>
     method whereby I shall employ the same commercially; but I will not
    </p>
    <p>
     venture to go into particulars before the patents shall have been
    </p>
    <p>
     issued. I shall hope and expect to sell shop-rights to the minor
    </p>
    <p>
     countries at a reasonable figure and supply a good business article
    </p>
    <p>
     of climate to the great empires at special rates, together with
    </p>
    <p>
     fancy brands for coronations, battles and other great and particular
    </p>
    <p>
     occasions. There are billions of money in this enterprise, no expensive
    </p>
    <p>
     plant is required, and I shall begin to realize in a few days--in a
    </p>
    <p>
     few weeks at furthest. I shall stand ready to pay cash for Siberia
    </p>
    <p>
     the moment it is delivered, and thus save my honor and my credit. I am
    </p>
    <p>
     confident of this.
    </p>
    <p>
     I would like you to provide a proper outfit and start north as soon as
    </p>
    <p>
     I telegraph you, be it night or be it day. I wish you to take up all
    </p>
    <p>
     the country stretching away from the north pole on all sides for many
    </p>
    <p>
     degrees south, and buy Greenland and Iceland at the best figure you
    </p>
    <p>
     can get now while they are cheap. It is my intention to move one of the
    </p>
    <p>
     tropics up there and transfer the frigid zone to the equator. I will
    </p>
    <p>
     have the entire Arctic Circle in the market as a summer resort next
    </p>
    <p>
     year, and will use the surplusage of the old climate, over and above
    </p>
    <p>
     what can be utilized on the equator, to reduce the temperature of
    </p>
    <p>
     opposition resorts. But I have said enough to give you an idea of
    </p>
    <p>
     the prodigious nature of my scheme and the feasible and enormously
    </p>
    <p>
     profitable character of it. I shall join all you happy people in England
    </p>
    <p>
     as soon as I shall have sold out some of my principal climates and
    </p>
    <p>
     arranged with the Czar about Siberia.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meantime, watch for a sign from me. Eight days from now, we shall be
    </p>
    <p>
     wide asunder; for I shall be on the border of the Pacific, and you far
    </p>
    <p>
     out on the Atlantic, approaching England. That day, if I am alive and my
    </p>
    <p>
     sublime discovery is proved and established, I will send you greeting,
    </p>
    <p>
     and my messenger shall deliver it where you are, in the solitudes of
    </p>
    <p>
     the sea; for I will waft a vast sun-spot across the disk like drifting
    </p>
    <p>
     smoke, and you will know it for my love-sign, and will say “Mulberry
    </p>
    <p>
     Sellers throws us a kiss across the universe.”
