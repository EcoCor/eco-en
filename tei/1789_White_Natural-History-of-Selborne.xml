    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_70">
     A HE parish of Selborne lies in the extreme eastern corner of the county of Hampshire, bordering on the county of Sussex, and not far from the county of Surrey ; is about fifty miles south-west of London, in latitude 51, and near midway between the towns of Alton and Petersfield. Being very large and extensive, it abuts on twelve parishes, two of which are in Sussex, viz. Trotton and Rogate. If you begin from the south, and proceed westward, the adjacent parishes are Emshot, Newton, Valence, Faringdon, Harteley, Mauduit, Great Ward-le-ham, Kingsley, Hedleigh, Bramshot, Trotton, Rogate, Lysse, and Greatham. The soils of this district are almost as various and diversified as the views and aspects. The high part to the south-west consists of a vast hill of chalk, rising three hundred feet above the village ; and is divided into a sheep down, the high wood, and a long hanging wood called the Hanger. The covert of this eminence is altogether beech, the most lovely of all forest trees, whether we consider its smooth rind, or bark, its glossy foliage, or graceful pendulous boughs.* The down, or sheep-walk, is a pleasing park-like spot, of about one mile by half that space, jutting out on the verge of the hill country, where it begins to break down into the plains, and commanding a very engaging view, being an assemblage of hill, dale, woodlands, heath, and water. The prospect is bounded to the south-east and east by the vast range of mountains called the Sussex Downs, by Guild-down near Guildford, and by the Downs round Dork- ing, and Ryegate in Surrey, to the north-east, which altogether, with the country beyond Alton and Farnham, form a noble and extensive outline.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_80">
     * While the beech is admitted to be one of the most beautiful trees of the forest, it must yield in grandeur, dignity? and picturesque beauty, to the oak, which, in these respects, stands pre-eminent in the British sylva : like the lion amongst animals, it is the unquestionable king of the forest. Beauty of a sublime kind, united with strength, is characteristic of the oak ED.

     VILLAGE OF SELBORNE.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_120">
     At the foot of this hill, one stage, or step, from the uplands, lies the village, which consists of one single straggling street, three quarters of a mile in length, in a sheltered vale, and running parallel with the Hanger. The houses are divided from the hill by a vein of stiff clay, (good wheat land,) yet stand on a rock of white stone, little in appearance removed from chalk ; but seems so far from being calcareous, that it endures extreme heat. Yet that the freestone still preserves somewhat that is analogous to chalk, is plain from the beeches, which descend as low as those rocks extend, and no farther, and thrive as well on them, where the ground is steep, as on the chalks.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_140">
     The cart-way of the village divides, in a remarkable manner, two very incongruous soils. To the south-west is a rank clay, that requires the labour of years to render it mellow; while the gardens to the north-east, and small enclosures behind, consist of a warm, forward, crumbling mould, called black malm, which seems highly saturated with vegetable and animal manure ; and these may perhaps have been the original site of the town ; while the woods and coverts might extend down to the opposite bank.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_160">
     At each end of the village, which runs from south-east to north-west, arises a small rivulet ; that at the north-west end frequently fails ; but the other is a fine perennial spring, little influenced by drought or wet seasons, called Wellhead.* This breaks out of some high grounds adjoining to Nore Hill, a noble chalk promontory, remarkable for sending forth two streams into two different seas. The one to the south becomes a branch of the Arun, running to Arundel, and so falling into the British Channel ; the other to the north. The Selborne stream makes one branch of the Wey ; and, meeting the Black-down stream at Hedleigh, and the Alton and Farnham stream at Tilfordbridge, swells into a considerable river, navigable at Godalming ; from whence it passes to Guildford, and so into the Thames at Weybridge ; and thus at the Nore into the German Ocean, Our wells, at an average, rim to about sixty-three feet, and when sunk to that depth, seldom fail ; but produce a fine limpid water, soft to the taste, and much commended by those who drink the pure element, but which does not lather well with soap.*
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_180">
     * This spring produced, September 14, 1781, after a severe hot summer, and a preceding dry spring and winter, nin-3 gallons of water in a minute, which is five hundred and forty in an hour, and twelve thousand nine hundred and sixty, or two hundred and sixteen hogsheads, in twenty-tour hours, or one natural day. At this time many of the wells failed, and all the ponds in the vales were dry.

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_220">
     To the north-west, north and east of the village, is a range of fair enclosures, consisting of what is called a white malm, a. sort of rotten or rubble stone, which, when turned up to the frost and rain, moulders to pieces, and becomes manure to itself,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_240">
     Still on to the north-east, and a step lower, is a kind of white land, neither chalk nor clay, neither fit for pasture nor for the plough, yet kindly for hops, which root deep into the freestone, and have their poles and wood for charcoal growing just at hand. This white soil produces the brightest hops.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_260">
     As the parish still inclines down towards Wolmer Forest, at the juncture of the clays and sand, the soil becomes a wet sandy loam, remarkable for timber, and infamous for roads. The oaks of Temple and Blackmoor stand high in the estima- tion of purveyors, and have furnished much naval timber ; while the trees on the freestone grow large, but are what workmen call shakey, and so brittle as often to fall to pieces in sawing. Beyond the sandy loam the soil becomes an hungry lean sand, till it mingles with the forest ; and will produce little without the assistance of lime and turnips.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_280">
     * This hardness of the water is occasioned by the great proportion of earthy salts which it holds in solution, the most common of which is sulphate of lime. These salts have the property of decomposing common soap. Their acids unite with the alkali of the soap, while the earthy basis forms with the oil of the soap a substance not soluble in water, which envelopes the soap and gives it a greasy feel. These waters may in general be cured by dropping into them an alkaline carbonate. ED.

     IN the court of Norton farm-house, a manor farm to the north-west of the village, on the white malms, stood, within these twenty years, a broad-leaved elm, or wych hazel, ulmus folio latissimo scabro of Ray, which, though it had lost a considerable leading bough in the great storm in the year 1703, equal to a moderate tree, yet, when felled, contained eight loads of timber ; and being too bulky for a carriage, \vas sawn off at seven feet above the but, where it measured near eight feet in the diameter. * This elm I mention, to shew to what a bulk planted elms may attain ; as this tree must certainly have been such from its situation, In the centre of the village, and near the church, is a square piece of ground, surrounded by houses, and vulgarly called the Plestor. In the midst of this spot stood, in old times, a vast oak, with a sshort squat body, and huge horizontal arms, extending almost to the extremity of the area. This venerable tree, surrounded with stone steps, and seats above them, was the delight of old and young, and a place of much resort in summer evenings ; where the former sat in grave debate, while the latter frolicked and danced before them. Long might it have stood, had not

     * In Evelyn's Sylva, vol. ii. p. 189, we are informed of a witch elm that grew in the park of Sir Walter Baggot, Staffordshire, which was seventeen feet diameter at the base, and extended, when felled, one hundred and twenty feet. Its timber was estimated at the amazing quantity of ninety-seven tons ED.

     | The Plestor was left by Sir Adam Gordon, a gentleman of Scottish extraction, who was leader of the Mountfort faction during the reign of Henry III, and is thus described by Mr White in the Antiquities of Selborne, " As Sir Adam began to advance in years, he found his mind influenced by the prevailing opinion of the reasonableness and efficacy of prayers for the dead ; and, therefore, in conjunction with his wife Constantia, in the year 1271, granted to the prior and convent of Selborne all his right and claim to a certain place, placea, called La Pleystow, in the village aforesaid, t in liberam, puram, et perpetuam elemosinam.' This pleystow locus ludorum, or play-place is in a level area near the church, of about forty-four yards by thirty-six, and is known now by the name of the Plestor. It continues still, as it was in old times, to be the scene of recreation for the youths and children of the neighbourhood ; and impresses an idea on the mind, that this village, even in Saxon times, could not be the most abject of places, when the inhabitants thought proper to assign so spacious a spot for the sports and amusements of its young people."

     The Shire Oak, so named from its peculiar local situation, standing on a spot where the counties of Derby, Nottingham, and York join, is one of the largest in the kingdom. The area which it covers is seven hundred and seven square yards. In February, 1828, an ash tree was felled in Blackburn Hollows, near Shires Green, Yorkshire, containing seven hundred and fifty feet of solid timber : it was ten feet six inches across the stool. An oak was also felled in Shining Cliff, near Cricli, Derbyshire, containing nine hundred and sixty-five feet, and was thirteen feet four indies across the stool. One of the most gigantic and venerable trees of this species is the celebrated Cowthorpe Oak, which stands on the extremity of the village of that name, near Wether by, county of York. The late Dr Hunter, while describing an oak of extraordinary size, which decorates Sheffield Park, notices this majestic production of nature, in his edition of Evelyn's Syha, in the following terms : " Neither this, nor any of the oaks mentioned by Mr Evelyn, bears any proportion to one now growing at Cowthorpe. The dimensions are almost incredible. Within three feet of the ground it measures sixteen yards, and close to the ground twenty-six yards. Its heigbt, in its present ruinous state, (1776,) is almost eighty-five feet, and its principal limb extends sixteen yards from the bole. Throughout the whole tree the foliage is extremely thin ; so that the anatomy of the ancient branches may be distinctly seen in the height of summer. When compared to this, all other trees are but children of the forest." Book iii. p. 500.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_600">
     The description here given answers as nearly as possible to the present condition of the tree, as may be seen by comparing it with the accom- panying cut. The common oak is the quercus robur of botanists.

     a little brush, without any large limbs. About twenty years ago the bridge at the Toy, near Hampton Court, being much decayed, some trees were wanted for the repairs that were fifty feet long without bough, and would measure twelve inches diameter at the little end. Twenty such trees did a purveyor find in this little wood, with this advantage, that many of them answered the description at sixty feet. These trees were sold for twenty pounds a-piece.*

     In the centre of this grove there stood an oak, which, though shapely and tall on the whole, bulged out into a large excres- cence about the middle of the stem. On this a pair of ravens had fixed their residence for such a series of years, that the oak was distinguished by the title of the Raven Tree. Many were the attempts of the neighbouring youths to get at this eyry: the difficulty whetted their inclinations, and each was ambitious of surmounting the arduous task. But when they arrived at the swelling, it jutted out so in their way, and was so far beyond their grasp, that the most daring lads were awed, and acknowledged the undertaking to be too hazardous. So the ravens built on, nest upon nest, in perfect security, till the fatal day arrived in which the wood was to be levelled. It was in the month of February, when those birds usually sit. The saw was applied to the but, the wedges were inserted into the opening, the woods echoed to the heavy blows of the beetle, or mallet, the tree nodded to its fall ; but still the dam sat on. At last, when it gave way, the bird was flung from her nest ; and, though her parental affection deserved a better fate, was whipped down by the twigs, which brought her dead to the ground.

     During the time of incubation, the natural timidity of birds is greatly lessened ; and, in many instances, the females will allow themselves to be taken rather than desert their nests. The following instance, recorded by William Henry Hill, Esq. of Newland, Gloucestershire, in 18*28, finely illustrates this : He says, " Some time since, a pair of blue titmice (parus cceruleus) built their nest in the upper part of an old pump, fixing on the piti on which the handle worked. It happened that, during the time of building, and laying the eggs, the pump had not been in use; when again set going, the female was sitting, and it was naturally expected the motion of the pump-handle would drive her away. The young brood were hatched safely, however, without any other misfortune than the loss of part of the tail of the sitting bird, which was rubbed off by the friction of the pump-handle ; nor did they appear disturbed by the visitors who were frequently looking at her."

     THE fossil shells of this district, and sorts of stone, such as have fallen within my observation, must not be passed over in silence. And first, I must mention, as a great curiosity, a specimen that was ploughed up in the chalky fields, near the side of the Down, and given to me for the singularity of its appearance, which, to an incurious eye, seems like a petrified fish, of about four inches long I , the cardo passing for a head and mouth. It is in reality a bivalve of the Linnaean genus of my til-us and the species of cristagalli; called by Lister, rastellum ; by Rumphius, ostreum plicatum minus; by D' Argenville, amis porci, crista galli; and by those who make collections, cock's comb.* Though I applied to several such in London, I never could meet with an entire specimen ; nor could I ever find in books any engraving from a perfect one. In the superb museum at Leicester House, permission was given me to examine for this article ; and, though I was disappointed as to the fossil, I was highly gratified with the sight of several of the shells themselves, in high preservation. This bivalve is only known to inhabit the Indian Ocean, where it fixes itself to a zoophyte, known by the name gorgonia.

     * Modern naturalists have constituted twenty genera of those fossil shells, known by the general appellation of cornu ammonis. The con- clusions which geologists have come to regarding them, are these: 1st, That they are first found in the formation called the lias, and appear in most of the succeeding strata, but seem to have become extinct in the ocean which deposited the hard chalk. The division here alluded to, is what has been named the ammonacea by Larnark, which are shells with a sinous septa, lobed and cut at the margin, meeting together upon the inner wall of the shell, and articulated by jagged sutures. 2d, The orthocerata appear in the early strata, and are continued upwards to the soft chalk stratum, after which they are not seen. These shells are straight, or nearly so, and not spiral. 3d, The ova) ammonites are not known in the early strata, but in the hard chalk only, and are not seen afterwards, as if they had been created at a comparatively late period, and had been soon suffered to become extinct. The shells alluded to by our author, which mouldered away, had been the impressions only of these cornua ammonis. ED.

When chiselled smooth, it makes elegant fronts for houses, equal in colour and grain to the Bath stone, and superior in one respect, that, when sea- soned, it does not scale. Decent chimneypieces are worked from it, of much closer and finer grain than Portland ; and rooms are floored with it ; but it proves rather too soft for this purpose. It is a freestone, cutting in all directions ; yet has something of a grain parallel with the horizon, and therefore should not be surbedded, but laid in the same position that it grows in the quarry. -j~ On the ground abroad this firestone will not succeed for pavements, because, probably some degree of salt- ness prevailing within it, the rain tears the slabs to pieces. Though this stone is too hard to be acted on by vinegar, yet both the white part, and even the blue rag, ferment strongly in mineral acids. Though the white stone \vill not bear wet, yet in every quarry, at intervals, there are thin strata of blue rag, which resist rain and frost, and are excellent for pitching of stables, paths, and courts, and for building of dry walls against banks, a valuable species of fencing, much in use in this village, and for mending of roads. This rag is rugged and stubborn, and will not hew to a smooth face, but is very durable ; yet, as these strata are shallow, and lie deep, large quantities cannot be procured but at considerable expense. Among the blue rags turn up some blocks, tinged with a stain of yellow, or rust colour, which seem to be nearly as lasting as the blue ; and every now and then balls of a friable substance, like rust of iron, called rust balls.

     AMONG the singularities of this place, the two rocky hollow lanes, the one to Alton, and the other to the forest, deserve our attention. These roads, running through the malm lands, are, by the traffic of ages, and the fretting of water, worn down through the first stratum of our freestone, and partly through the second ; so that they look more like watercourses than roads, and are bedded with naked rag for furlongs together. In many places they are reduced sixteen or eighteen feet beneath the level of the fields ; and after floods, and in frosts, exhibit very grotesque and wild appearances, from the tangled roots that are twisted among the strata, and from the torrents rushing down their broken sides ; and especially when those cascades are frozen into icicles, hanging in all the fanciful shapes of frostwork. These rugged gloomy scenes affright the ladies when they peep down into them from the paths above, and make timid horsemen shudder while they ride along them ; but delight the naturalist with their various botany, and particularly with their curious filices, with which they abound.

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_1740">
     SHOULD I omit to describe with some exactness the Forest of Wolmer, of which three-fifths perhaps lie in this parish, my account of Selborne would be very imperfect, as it is a district abounding with many curious productions, both animal and vegetable ; and has often afforded me much entertainment both as a sportsman and as a naturalist.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_1760">
     The royalForest of Wolmer is a tract of land of about seven miles in length, by two and a half in breadth, running nearly from north to south, and is abutted on, to begin to the south, and so to proceed eastward, by the parishes of Greatham, Lysse, Rogate, and Trotton, in the county of Sussex ; by Bramshot, Hedleigh, and Kingsley. This royalty consists entirely of sand, covered with heath and fern ; but is somewhat diversified with hills and dales, without having one standing tree in the whole extent. In the bottoms, where the waters stagnate, are many bogs, which formerly abounded with subterraneous trees ; though Dr Plot says positively,* that " there never were any fallen trees hidden in the mosses of the southern counties." But he was mistaken ; for I myself have seen cottages on the verge of this wild district, whose timbers consisted of a black hard wood, looking like oak, which the owners assured me they procured from the bogs by probing the soil with spits, or some such instruments, but the peat is so much cut out, and the moors have been so well examined, that none has been found of late. Besides the

     Old people have assured me, that on a winter's morning they have discovered these trees, in the bogs, by the hoar frost, which lay longer over the space where they were concealed, than on the surrounding morass. Nor does this seem to be a fanciful notion, but consistent with true philosophy. Dr Hales saith, " That the warmth of the earth, at

     oak, I have also been shewn pieces of fossil wood, of a paler colour, and softer nature, which the inhabitants called fir ; but, upon a nice examination, and trial by fire, I could discover nothing resinous in them ; and therefore rather suppose that they were parts of a willow, or alder, or some such aquatic tree.*
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_1860">
     This lonely domain is a very agreeable haunt for many sorts of wild fowls, which not only frequent it in the winter, but breed there in the summer ; such as lapwings, snipes, wild- ducks, and, as I have discovered within these few years, teals. Partridges in vast plenty are bred in good seasons on the verge of this Forest, into which they love to make excur- sions ; and in particular, in the dry summer of 1740 and 1741, and some years after, they swarmed to such a degree, that parties of unreasonable sportsmen killed twenty and sometimes thirty, brace in a day.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_1880">
     But there was a nobler species of game in this forest, now extinct, which I have heard old people say abounded much before shooting flying became so common, and that was the heath-cock, or black game. When I was a little boy, I recollect one coming now and then to my father's table. The last pack remembered was killed about thirty-five years ago ; and within these ten years, one solitary gray-hen was sprung by some beagles in beating for a hare. The sportsman cried out, " A hen pheasant ! " but a gentleman present, who had often seen black game in the north of England, assured me that it was a gray-hen.

November 29, 1731, a little snow having fallen in the night, it was, by eleven the next morning, mostly melted away on the surface of the earth, except in several places in Bushy Park, where there were drains dug and covered with earth, on which the snow continued to lie, whether those drains were full of water or dry ; as also where elm-pipes lay under ground : a plain proof this, that those drains intercepted the warmth of the earth from ascending from greater depths below them ; for the snow lay where the drain had more than four feet depth of earth over it. It continued also to lie on thatch, tiles, and the tops of walls." See Hales's Hceinastatics, p. 360. Quere, Might not such observations be reduced to domestic use, by promoting the discovery of old obliterated drains and wells about houses ; and in Roman stations and camps, lead to the finding of pavements, baths, and graves, and other hidden relics of curious antiquity ?

     Nor does the loss of our black game prove the only gap in the Fauna Selborniensis ; for another beautiful link in the chain of beings is wanting, I mean the red deer, which toward the beginning of this century amounted to about five hundred head, and made a stately appearance. There is an old keeper, now alive, named Adams, whose great-grandfather (mentioned in a perambulation taken in 1635), grandfather, father, and self, enjoyed the head keepership of Wolmer Forest in succes- sion far more than an hundred years. This person assures me, that his father has often told him that Queen Anne, as she was journeying on the Portsmouth road, did not think the Forest of Wolmer beneath her royal regard ; for she came out of the great road at Lippock, which is just by, and, reposing herself on a bank smoothed for that purpose, lying about half a mile to the east of Wolmer Pond, and still called Queen's Bank, saw, with great complacency and satisfaction, the whole herd of red deer brought by the keepers along the vale before her, consisting then of about five hundred head. A sight this, worthy the attention of the greatest sovereign ! But he farther adds, that, by means of the Waltham Blacks, or, to use his own expression, as soon as they began blacking, they were reduced to about fifty head, and so continued decreasing, till the time of the late Duke of Cumberland. It is now more than thirty years ago, that his Highness sent down an huntsman, and six yeomen prickers, in scarlet jackets laced with gold, attended by the stag-hounds ; ordering them to take every deer in this forest alive, and to convey them in carts to Windsor. In the course of the summer, they caught every stag, some of which shewed extraordinary diversion ; but in the following winter, when the hinds were also carried off, such fine chases were

I saw myself one of the yeomen prickers single out a stag from the herd, and must confess that it was the most curious feat of activity I ever beheld, superior to any thing in Mr Astley's riding-school. The exertions made by the horse and deer much exceeded all my expecta- tions, though the former greatly excelled the latter in speed. When the devoted deer was separated from his companions, they gave him, by their watches, law, as they called it, for twenty minutes ; when, sounding their horns, the stop-dogs were permitted to pursue, and a most gallant scene ensued.

     THOUGH large herds of deer do much harm to the neigh- bourhood, yet the injury to the morals of the people is of more moment than the loss of their crops. The temptation is irresistible ; for most men are sportsmen by constitution, and there is such an inherent spirit for hunting in human nature, as scarce any inhibitions can restrain. Hence, towards the beginning of this century, all this country was wild about deer- stealing. Unless he was a hunter, as they affected to call themselves, no young person was allowed to be possessed of manhood or gallantry. The Waltham Blacks at length com- mitted such enormities, that government was forced to interfere with that severe and sanguinary act called the Black Act,* which now comprehends more felonies than any law that ever was framed before. And, therefore, a late bishop of Win- chester, when urged to re-stock Waltham Chase, refused, from a motive worthy of a prelate, replying, that " It had done mischief enough already."-)-

     Another temptation to idleness and sporting, was a number of rabbits, which possessed all the hillocks and dry places ; but these being inconvenient to the huntsmen, on account of their burrows, when they came to take away the deer, they permitted the country people to destroy them all.

     Such forests and wastes, when their allurements to irre- gularities are removed, are of considerable service to neigh- bourhoods that verge upon them, by furnishing them with peat and turf for their firing; with fuel for the burning their lime; and with ashes for their grasses ; and by maintaining their geese and their stock of young cattle at little or no expense.

     The plea for these burnings is, that, when the old coat of heath, &amp;c. is consumed, young will sprout up, and afford much tender browse for cattle ; but, where there is large old furze, the fire, following the roots, consumes the very ground ; so that, for hundreds of acres, nothing is to be seen but smother and desolation, the whole circuit round looking like the cinders of a volcano ; and the soil being quite exhausted, no traces of vegetation are to be found for years. These conflagrations, as they take place usually with a north-east or east wind, much annoy this village with their smoke, and often alarm the country ; and once, in particular, I remember that a gentleman, who lives beyond Andover, coming to my house, when he got on the downs between that town and Winchester, at twenty- five miles distance, was surprised much with smoke, and a hot smell of fire, and concluded that Alresford was in flames ; but, when he came to that town, he then had apprehensions for the next village, and so on to the end of his journey.

The farm called Blackmoor, in this parish, is obliged to find the posts and brushwood for the former ; while the farms at Greatham, in rotation, furnish for the latter; and are all enjoined to cut and deliver the materials at the spot. This custom I mention, because I look upon it to be of very remote antiquity.

     ON the verge of the forest, as it is now circumscribed, are three considerable lakes, two in Oakhanger, of which I have nothing particular to say; and one called Bin's, or Bean's Pond, which is worthy the attention of a naturalist or a sports- man : for, being crowded at the upper end with willows, and with the car ex cespitosa* it affords such a safe and pleasant shelter to wild ducks, teals, snipes, &amp;c. that they breed there.

     By a perambulation of Wolmer Forest and the Holt, made in 1635, and in the eleventh year of Charles the First, (which now lies before me,) it appears that the limits of the former are much circumscribed. For, to say nothing of the farther side, with which I am not so well acquainted, the bounds on this side, in old times, came into Binswood, and extended to the ditch of Ward-le-ham Park, in which stands the curious mount called King John's Hill and Lodge Hill, and to the verge of Hartley Mauduit, called Mauduit-hatch ; compre- hending also Shortheath, Oakhanger, and Oakwoods, a large district, now private property, though once belonging to the royal domain.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_2610">
     It is remarkable, that the term purlieu is never once men- tioned in this long roll of parchment. It contains, besides the perambulation, a rough estimate of the value of the timbers, which were considerable, growing at that time in the district of the Holt ; and enumerates the officers, superior and inferior, of those joint forests, for the time being, and their ostensible fees and perquisites. In those days, as at present, there were hardly any trees in Wolmer Forest.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_2630">
     Within the present limits of the forest are three considerable lakes, Hogmer, Cranmer, and Wolmer; all of which are stocked with carp, tench, eels, and perch : but the fish do not thrive T ell, because the water is hungry, and the bottoms are a naked sand.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_2650">
     A circumstance respecting these ponds, though by no means peculiar to them, I cannot pass over in silence ; and that is, that instinct by which, in summer, all the kine, whether oxen, cows, calves, or heifers, retire constantly to the water during the hotter hours ; where, being more exempt from flies, and inhaling the coolness of that element, some belly deep, and some only to mid-leg, they ruminate and solace themselves from about ten in the morning till four in the afternoon, and then return to their feeding. During this great proportion of the day, they drop much dung, in which insects nestle ; and so supply food for the fish, which would be poorly subsisted but for this contingency. Thus Nature, who is a great econo- mist, converts the recreation of one animal to the support of another! Thomson, who was a nice observer of natural

     Wolmer Pond so called, I suppose, for eminence sake is a vast lake for this part of the world, containing, in its whole circumference, two thousand six hundred and forty-six yards, or very near a mile and a half. The length of the north-west and opposite side is about seven hundred and four yards, and the breadth of the south-west end, about four hundred and fifty-six yards. This measurement, which I caused to be made with good exactness, gives an area of about sixty-six acres, exclusive of a large irregular arm at the north-east corner, which we did not take into the reckoning.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_2810">
     On the face of this expanse of waters, and perfectly secure from fowlers, lie all day long, in the winter season, vast flocks of ducks, teals, and widgeons, of various denominations ; where they preen, and solace, and rest themselves, till towards sunset, when they issue forth in little parties (for, in their natural state, they are all birds of the night) to feed in the brooks and meadows ; returning again with the dawn of the morning. Had this lake an arm or two more, and were it planted round with thick covert, (for now it is perfectly naked,) it might make a valuable decoy.

     Though these two forests are only parted by a narrow range of enclosures, yet no two soils can be more different ; for the Holt consists of a strong loam, of a miry nature, carrying a good turf, and abounding with oaks, that grow to be large timber, while Wolmer is nothing but a hungry, sandy, barren waste.

     A very large fall of timber, consisting of about one thousand oaks, has been cut this spring (viz. 1784) in the Holt Forest ; one-fifth of which, it is said, belongs to the grantee, Lord Stawel. He lays claim also to the lop and top ; but the poor of the parishes of Bins ted and Frinsham, Bentley and Kings- ley, assert that it belongs to them ; and, assembling in a riotous manner, have actually taken it all away. One man, who keeps a team, has carried home, for his share, forty stacks of wood. Forty-five of these people his lordship has served with actions. These trees, which were very sound, and in high perfection, were winter-cut, viz. in February and March, before the bark would run.In old times, the Holt was estimated to be eighteen miles, computed measure, from water carriage, viz. from the town of Chertsey, on the Thames ; but now it is not half that distance, since the Wey is made navigable up to the town of Godalming, in the county of Surrey.

     * There is a curious fact, not generally known, which is, that at one period the horns of stags grew into a much greater number of ramifications than at the present day. Some have supposed this to have arisen from the greater abundance of food, and from the animal having more repose, before population became so dense. In some individuals these multiplied to an extraordinary extent. There is one in the museum of Hesse Cassel with twenty-eight antlers. Baron Cuvier mentions one with sixty-six, or thirty-three on each horn. ED.

     The superiority of wood cut in winter arises from its being divested of sap at that season of the year. Timber felled in summer is liable to crack, and is very subject to the dry-rot ; both of which are caused by the sap not having properly escaped in the process of drying. The sap rises only in the spring, and descends at the fall of the year. ED.

     IT has been my misfortune never to have had any neigh- bours whose studies have led them towards the pursuit of natural knowledge ; so that, for want of a companion to quicken my industry and sharpen my attention, I have made but slender progress in a kind of information to which I have been attached from my childhood.

     As to swallows (hirundmes rusticce) being found in a torpid state during the winter in the Isle of Wight, or any part of this country, I never heard any such account worth attending to. But a clergyman, of an inquisitive turn, assures me that, when he was a great boy, some workmen, in pulling down the battlements of a church tower early in the spring, found two or three swifts (hirundines apodes) among the rubbish, which were, at first appearance, dead ; but, on being carried towards the fire, revived. He told me that, out of his great care to preserve them, he put them in a paper bag, and hung them by the kitchen fire, where they were suffocated.

     Another intelligent person has informed me that, while he was a schoolboy at Brighthelmstone, in Sussex, a great fragment of the chalk cliff fell down one stormy winter on the beach, and that many people found swallows among the rubbish ; but, on my questioning him whether he saw any of those birds himself, to my no small disappointment he answered me in the negative, but that others assured him they did.*

     * That a few solitary instances of swallows remaining in this country, in a state of torpidity, have occurred, there can be little doubt ; but that they generally hybernate is out of the question. Charles Lucian Bona- parte, in a letter to the Secretary of the Linnten Society, dated from on board the Delaware, near Gibraltar, March 20, 1828, says, " A few days ago, being five hundred miles from the coasts of Portugal, four hundred from those of Africa, we were agreeably surprised by the appearance of a few swallows, (Jiirundo urbica and rustica. ) This, however extraordinary, might have been explained by an easterly gale, which might have cut off the swallows migrating from the main to Madeira, only two hundred miles distant from us ; but what was my surprise in observing several small xvarblers popping about the deck and rigging. These poor little strangers were soon caught and brought to me. " These warblers were the sylvia trochilus, or hay bird, &amp;c. ED.

     then fledged in their nests. Both species will breed again once; for I see by my fauna of last year, that young broods came forth so late as September the 18th. Are not these late hatchings more in favour of hiding than migration ? Nay, some young martens remained in their nests last year so late as September the 29th ; and yet they totally disappeared with us by the 5th of October.

     How strange it is, that the swift, which seems to live exactly the same life with the swallow and house-marten, should leave us before the middle of August invariably ! while the latter stay often till the middle of October ; and once I saw numbers of house-martens on the 7th of November. * The martens and red-wing fieldfares were flying in sight together, an uncom- mon assemblage of summer and winter birds !

     A little yellow bird (it is either a species of the alauda trivialis, or rather, perhaps, of the motacilla trochilus J) still continues to make a sibilous shivering noise in the tops of tall woods. The stoparola of Ray (for which we have as yet no name in these parts) is called, in your Zoology, the fly- catcher. There is one circumstance characteristic of this bird, which seems to have escaped observation ; and that is, it takes its stand on the top of some stake or post, from whence it springs forth on its prey, catching a fly in the air, and hardly ever touching the ground, but returning still to the same stand for many times together.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_3510">
     * The latest time which the swift has been known to remain in this country was till September 15, in the year 1817. Two or three were seen sporting about with the large assemblies of swallows and martens, by the sea side, near Penzance, to the eastward. These birds, there can be little doubt, were on their passage from this country to a more southern climate. The swallow (H. rustica) was seen, by the Rev. W. T. Bree, in the year 1806, so late as November 20 ; and Mr Sweet mentions having seen one pass over his garden, near London, November 23, 1828. The day was line, and flies plentiful ; but, he asks, how did it subsist during the severe frosty days that were past ? The earliest period noticed by that keen observer of nature is on the 3d April, 1803; while he records having seen the sand-marten (H. reparia) on the 31st March, in the years 1818 and 1822, the former at Penzance, and adds, " I have been informed by an intelligent friend, that a house-swallow once took up its residence late in the autumn within St Mary's Church at Warwick, and was regularly observed there by the congregation until Christmas eve, after, which it disappeared, and was seen no more." These birds arrive in the following order : The sand-marten, the house-swallow, house-marten, swift. ED.

Nat.) which, he says, " natat infossis et urinatur" I should be glad to procure one " plantis palmatis" Linnaeus seems to be in a puzzle about his mus amphibius, and to doubt whether it differs from his mus terrestris ; which, if it be, as he allows, the " mus agrestis capite grandi brachyuros" of Ray, is widely different from the water-rat, both in size, make, and manner of life.

     IT will not be without impatience that I shall wait for your thoughts with regard to the falco. As to its weight, breadth, &amp;c. I wish I had set them down at the time ; but, to the best of my remembrance, it weighed two pounds and eight ounces, and measured, from wing to wing, thirty-eight inches.

     The most unusual birds I ever observed in these parts were a pair of hoopoes, (upupa^) which came, several years ago, in the summer, and frequented an ornamented piece of ground, which joins to my garden, for some weeks. They used to march about in a stately manner, feeding in the walks, many times in the day, and seemed disposed to breed in my outlet ; but were frighted and persecuted by idle boys, who never let them be at rest.*

     * In Latham's General Synopsis, there is an account of a young hoopoe having been shot in May. These birds have been seen in many parts of Great Britain, from Devonshire to the north of Scotland. Some years ago, one was shot near Banff; and it has been killed in Devonshire and South Wales. Mr Selby says, " the specimen in my possession, and from which the figure in my illustrations is taken, was caught, after some severe weather, and overcome by fatigue, upon the sea coast of Northumberland, near Bamburgh Castle." The Rev. Percival Hunter says, they were frequently seen, during the brumal months, in various parts of Kent, in 1829. The upupa eops can only be reckoned an occasional visitant, its chief residence, during the summer months, being the south of Europe, from whence it migrates to Africa. Colonel Williamson, late of the 92d regiment, informed us, that it is to be met with, in vast numbers, near Ceuta, in Africa, opposite to Gibraltar, during the whole year. The nest is formed of bents, and lined with soft materials ; it is built in the hollow of a tree, and is said to be extremely fetid. The eggs are four in number, bluish white, spotted with pale brown. ED.

It seldom visits the northern counties. There is, however, one instance recorded by Mr T. F. Loudon, in the first volume of the Magazine of Natural History, p. 374. He says, " On the 14th May, 1828, the nest of a hawfinch was taken in an orchard belonging to Mr Waring, at Chelsfield, Kent. The old female was shot on the nest, which was of a slovenly, loose form, and shallow, not being so deep as those of the greenfinch or linnet, and was placed against the large bough of an apple tree, about ten feet from the ground. It was composed externally of dead twigs and a few roots, mixed with coarse white moss, or lichen, and lined with horse hair and a little fine, dried grass. The eggs were five in number, about the size of a skylark's, but shorter and rounder, and spotted with bluish ash and olive brown, some of the spots inclining to dusky, or blackish brown. The markings were variously distributed on the different eggs." It is a native of Italy, Germany, Sweden, and South of France ED.

Mr Selby mentions that, in June, 1821, a vast number visited Britain, and spread themselves through the country in all places where fir trees were abundant, the cones of which being their principal food. These consisted chiefly of females. A pretty large flock made its appearance in the neighbourhood of Ambleside, Westmoreland, in November, 1828. Their favourite haunt was a plantation of young larches. The crossbill is a native of Northern Europe ED.

I have generally kept them in a deal tub, about three feet two inches wide, and about two feet deep. When they are put in, for some time, probably a day or two, they swim about in a shoal, apparently exploring their new habitation. Suddenly one will take possession of the tub, or, as it will sometimes happen, the bottom, and will instantly commence an attack upon his companions ; and, if any of them venture to oppose his sway, a regular and most furious battle ensues. They swim round and round,

From this period an interesting change takes place in the conqueror, who, from being a speckled and greenish looking fish, assumes the most beautiful colours ; the belly and lower jaws becoming a deep crimson, and the back sometimes a cream colour, but generally a fine green ; and the whole appearance full of animation and spirit. I have occasionally known three or four parts of the tub taken possession of by these little tyrants, who guard their territories with the strictest vigilance, and the slightest invasion brings on invariably a battle.

     I was much entertained last summer with a tame bat, which would take flies out of a person's hand. If you gave it any thing to eat, it brought its wings round before the mouth, hovering and hiding its head in the manner of birds of prey when they feed. The adroitness it shewed in shearing off the wings of the flies, which were always rejected, was worthy of observation, and pleased me much. Insects seemed to be most acceptable, though it did not refuse raw flesh when offered ; so that the notion, that bats go down chimneys and gnaw men's bacon, seems no improbable story. While I amused myself with this wonderful quadruped, I saw it several times confute the vulgar opinion, that bats, when down on a flat surface, cannot get on the wing again, by rising with great ease from the floor. It ran, I observed, with more despatch than I was aware of ; but in a most ridiculous and grotesque manner.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_4350">
     Bats drink on the wing, like swallows, by sipping the surface, as they play over pools and streams. They love to frequent waters, not only for the sake of drinking, but on account of insects, which are found over them in the greatest plenty. As I was going some years ago, pretty late, in a boat from Rich- mond to Sunbury, on a warm summer's evening, I think I saw myriads of bats between the two places ; the air swarmed with them all along the Thames, so that hundreds were in sight at a time.

     I have procured some of the mice mentioned in my former letters, a young one, and a female with young, both of which I have preserved in brandy. From the colour, shape, size, and manner of nesting, I make no doubt but that the species is nondescript. They are much smaller, and more slender, than the mus domesticus medius of Ray, and have more of the squirrel or dormouse colour. Their belly is white ; a straight line along their sides divides the shades of their back and belly. They never enter into houses ; are carried into ricks and barns with the sheaves ; abound in harvest ; and build their nests amidst the straws of the corn above the ground, and sometimes in thistles. They breed as many as eight at a litter, in a little round nest composed of the blades of grass or wheat.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_4570">
     One of these nests I procured this autumn, most artificially platted, and composed of the blades of wheat ; perfectly round, and about the size of a cricket-ball ; with the aperture so ingeniously closed, that there was no discovering to what part it belonged. It was so compact and well filled, that it would roll across the table without being discomposed, though it contained eight little mice that were naked and blind. As this nest was perfectly full, how could the dam come at her litter respectively, so as to administer a teat to each ? Perhaps she opens different places for that purpose, adjusting them again when the business is over ; but she could not possibly be contained herself in the ball with her young, which, more- over, would be daily increasing in bulk. This wonderful procreant cradle, an elegant instance of the efforts of instinct, was found in a wheat field suspended in the head of a thistle.

     About ten years ago, I used to spend some weeks yearly at Sunbury, which is one of those pleasant villages lying on the Thames, near Hampton Court. In the autumn I could not help being much amused with those myriads of the swallow kind which assemble in those parts. But what struck me most was, that, from the time they began to congregate, forsaking the chimneys and houses, they roosted every night in the osierbeds of the aits of that river. Now this resorting towards that element, at that season of the year, seems to give some countenance to the northern opinion (strange as it is) of their retiring under w r ater. A Swedish naturalist is so much persuaded of that fact, that he talks, in his Calendar of Flora, as familiarly of the swallow's going under water in the beginning of September, as he would of his poultry going to roost a little before sunset.

This extraordinary occurrence brought to my mind the remark of Linngeus, that, " before winter, all their hen chaffinches migrate through Holland into Italy." Now, I want to know, from some curious person in the north, whether there are any large flocks of these finches with them in the winter, and of which sex they mostly consist ?

This well accounts for the vast quantities that are caught about that time on the south downs near Lewes, where they are esteemed a delicacy. There have been shepherds, I have been credibly informed, that have made many pounds in a season by catching them in traps. And though such multitudes are taken, I never saw (and I am well acquainted with those parts) above two or three at a time ; for they are never gregarious. -p They may perhaps migrate in general ; and, for that purpose, draw towards the coast of Sussex in autumn ; but that they do not all withdraw I am sure, because I see a few stragglers in many counties, at all times of the year, especially about warrens and stone quarries.

     Some young man, possessed of fortune, health, and leisure, should make an autumnal voyage into that kingdom, and should spend a year there, investigating the natural history of that vast country. Mr Willughby passed through that kingdom on such an errand; but he seems to have skirted along in a superficial manner, and an ill humour, being much disgusted at the rude, dissolute manners of the people.

     As to the small mice,* I have farther to remark, that though they hang their nests for breeding up amidst the straws of the standing corn, above the ground, yet I find that, in the winter, they burrow deep in the earth, and make warm beds of grass ; but their grand rendezvous seems to be in corn ricks, into which they are carried at harvest. A neighbour housed an oat rick lately, under the thatch of which were assembled near a hundred, most of which were taken ; and some I saw. I measured them, and found that, from nose to tail, they were just two inches and a quarter, and their tails just two inches long. Two of them, in a scale, weighed down just one copper halfpenny, which is about the third of an ounce avoirdupois ; so that I suppose they are the smallest quadrupeds in this island. A full grown mus medius domesticus weighs, I find, one ounce lumping weight, which is more than six times as much as the mouse above, and measures, from nose to rump, four inches and a quarter, and the same in its tail. We have had a very severe frost and deep snow this month. My thermometer was one day fourteen degrees and a half below the freezing point, within doors.

     DEAR SIR, If some curious gentleman would procure the head of a fallow deer, and have it dissected, he would find it furnished with two spiracula, or breathing places, besides the nostrils ; probably analogous to the puncta lachrymalia in the human head.* When deer are thirsty, they plunge their noses, like some horses, very deep under water, while in the act of drinking, and continue them in that situation for a considerable time ; but, to obviate any inconveniency, they can open two vents, one at the inner corner of each eye, having a communi- cation with the nose. Here seems to be an extraordinary provision of nature worthy our attention, and which has not, that I know of, been noticed by any naturalist : for it looks as if these creatures would not be suffocated, though both their mouths and nostrils were stopped. This curious formation of the head may be of singular service to beasts of chase, by affording them free respiration ; and no doubt these additional nostrils are thrown open when they are hard run. Mr Ray observed, that at Malta the owners slit up the nostrils of such asses as were hard worked ; for they, being naturally strait or small, did not admit air sufficient to serve them when they travelled or laboured in that hot climate. And we know that grooms and gentlemen of the turf, think large nostrils neces- sary, and a perfection, in hunters and running horses.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_5590">
     Oppian, the Greek poet, by the following line, seems to have had some notion that stags have four spiracula :

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_5630">
     In answer to this account, Mr Pennant sent me the following curious and pertinent reply : "I was much surprised to find in the antelope something analogous to what you mention as so remarkable in deer. This animal also has a long slit beneath each eye, which can be opened and shut at pleasure. On holding an orange to one, the creature made as much use of those orifices as of his nostrils, applying them to the fruit, and seeming to smell it through them."

     DEAR SIR, Some intelligent country people have a notion that we have, in these parts, a species of the genus mustelmwn^ besides the weasel, stoat, ferret, and polecat ; a little reddish beast, not much bigger than a field mouse, but much longer, which they call a cane. This piece of intelligence can be little depended on ; but farther inquiry may be made.*

     A gentleman in this neighbourhood had two milk-white rooks in one nest. A booby of a carter, finding them before they were able to fly, threw them down, and destroyed them, to the regret of the owner, who would have been glad to have preserved such a curiosity in his rookery. I saw the birds myself nailed against the end of a barn, and was surprised to find that their bills, legs, feet, and claws, were milk-white.

     We can see no reason why the bird referred to may not have been a white lark, as well as a snow-bunting. We have seen white birds of many British species. There was a white lark shot in the neighbourhood of Kingston Rectory, near Canterbury, in October, 1828. In the Natural History Magazine there is a notice of a blackbird's nest found at St Anstell, Cornwall, containing two birds, one of them perfectly white. In the summer of 1831, a blackbird's nest was found at Newbottle, near Edinburgh, containing four young ; two of which were of the ordinary colour, and two perfectly white. The former turned out females, ani the latter were both male birds. On the grounds of Drumsheugh, the property of our friend Sir Patrick Walker, there was, some years ago, a beautifully mottled blackbird, which became so tame that it fed along

     EFFECT OF FOOD ON THE COLOUR OF BIRDS.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_5920">
     A few years ago, I saw a cock bullfinch in a cage, which had been caught in the fields after it was come to its full colours. In about a year, it began to look dingy, and, black- ening every succeeding year, it became coal-black at the end of four. Its chief food was hempseed. Such influence has food on the colour of animals! The pied and mottled colours of domesticated animals are supposed to be owing to high, various, and unusual food.*

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_5940">
     I had remarked, for years, that the root of the cuckoo-pint (arum) was frequently scratched out of the dry banks of hedges, and in severe snowy weather. After observing, with some exactness, myself, and getting others to do the same, we found it was the thrush kind that searched it out. The root of the arum is remarkably warm and pungent.

     In the middle of February, I discovered, in my tall hedges, a little bird that raised my curiosity : it was of that yellow- green colour that belongs to the salicaria kind, and, I think, was soft-billed. It was no parus, and was too long and too big for the golden-crowned wren, appearing most like the largest willow-wren. It hung sometimes with its back down- wards, but never continuing one moment in the same place. I shot at it, but it was so desultory that I missed my aim.

     with the domestic fowls. It continued at Drumsheugh for some years, and was shot by a gentleman from a back window in Melville Street, who had not heard of it, and supposed it a bird of some very uncommon species. It is now in the museum of Sir Patrick. Another mottled blackbird was some years ago kept in a cage by Mr Veitch, the distin- guished optician, at Inehbonny, near Jedburgh. We have seen white crows very often ; a white robin, with red eyes ; a white sparrow, and a white jack -daw. These accidental varieties, we believe, have existed in almost every species of birds. Sir William Jardine mentions a pair of magpies of a cream colour, which were hatched at a farm-steading in Eskdale, Dumfriesshire. In the Natural History Magazine it is stated, that a greenfinch was shot in the neighbourhood of Ross, Herefordshire, the prevailing colour of which was a rich yellow, mottled with green, yellow, and dirty white.

     I wonder that the stone curlew, charadnus oedicnemus, should be mentioned by the writers as a rare bird : it abounds in all the champaign parts of Hampshire and Sussex, and breeds, I think, all the summer, having young ones, I know, very late in the autumn. Already they begin clamouring in the evening. They cannot, I think, with any propriety, be called, as they are by Mr Ray, " circa aquas versantes ;" for with us (by day at least) they haunt only the most dry, open, upland fields and sheep-walks, far removed from water : what they may do in the night I cannot say. Worms are their usual food, but they also eat toads and frogs.

     DEAR SIR, The history of the stone curlew, charadrius oedicnemus, is as follows : It lays its eggs, usually two, never more than three, on the bare ground, without any nest, in the field, so that the countryman, in stirring his fallows, often destroys them. The young run immediately from the egg like partridges, &amp;c. and are withdrawn to some flinty field by the dam, where they skulk among the stones, which are their best security ; for their feathers are so exactly of the colour of our grey spotted flints, that the most exact observer, unless he catches the eye of the young bird, may be eluded. The eggs are short arid round, of a dirty white, spotted with dark bloody blotches. Though I might not be able, just when I pleased, to procure you a bird, yet I could shew you them almost any day ; and any evening you may hear them round the village ; for they make a clamour which may be heard a mile. Oedicnemus is a most apt and expressive name for them, since their legs seem swollen like those of a gouty man. After harvest, I have shot them before the pointers in turnip fields.

     procure the third. No two birds can differ more in their notes, and that constantly, than those two that I am acquainted with ; for the one has a joyous, easy, laughing note, the other a harsh loud chirp. The former is every way larger, and three quarters of an inch longer, and weighs two drachms and a half, while the latter weighs but two ; so that the songster is one-fifth heavier than the chirper. The chirper (being the first summer bird of passage that is heard, the wryneck some- times excepted) begins his two notes in the middle of March, and continues them through the spring and summer, till the end of August, as appears by my journals. The legs of the larger of these two are flesh-coloured ; of the less, black.

     The grasshopper lark began his sibilous note in my fields last Saturday.* Nothing can be more amusing than the whisper of this little bird, which seems to be close by, though at an hundred yards' distance ; and, when close at your ear, is scarcely any louder than when a great way off. Had I not been a little acquainted with insects, and known that the grasshopper kind is not yet hatched, I should have hardly believed but that it had been a locusta whispering- in the bushes. The country people laugh when you tell them that it is the note of a bird. It is a most artful creature, skulking in the thickest part of a bush, and will sing at a yard distance, provided it be concealed. I was obliged to get a person to go on the other side of the hedge where it haunted ; and then it would run, creeping like a mouse before us for an hundred yards together, through the bottom of the thorns ; yet it would not come into fair sight ; but in a morning early, and when undisturbed, it sings on the top of a twig, gaping, and shivering with its wings. Mr Ray himself had no knowledge of this bird, but received his account from Mr Johnston, who apparently confounds it with the reguli non cristati, from which it is very distinct. See Ray's Philosophical Letters, p. 108.

     * A nuthatch, which had been accidentally winged by a sportsman, was kept in a small cage of plain oak wood and wire. During a night and a day in which he was in captivity, his tapping labour was incessant ; and after occupying his prison for that short time, he left the wood-work pierced and worn like worm-eaten timber. He manifested extreme impatience at his situation ; he was unremitting in his endeavours to effect his escape, and in these efforts exhibited much intelligence and cunning. He was fierce, fearlessly bold, and eat voraciously of food which was placed before him. At the close of the third day, he sank under the combined effects of vexation, assiduous labour, and voracious appetite. This nuthatch was peculiarly laborious under his confinement, and pecked in a manner different from all other birds ; " grasping hard with his immense feet, he turned upon them as upon a pivot, and struck with the whole weight of his body."

     SELBORNE, June 18, 1768.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_7200">
     DEAR SIR, On Wednesday last, arrived your agreeable letter of June the 10th. It gives me great satisfaction to find that you pursue these studies still with such vigour, and are in such forwardness with regard to reptiles and fishes.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_7220">
     The reptiles, few as they are, I am not acquainted with, so well as I could wish, with regard to their natural history. There is a degree of dubiousness and obscurity attending the propagation of this class of animals something analogous to that of the cryptogamia in the sexual system of plants ; and the case is the same with regard to some of the fishes, as the eel, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_7240">
     * This elegant little species is the smallest of British birds ; its weight seldom exceeds eighty grains. This minute bird braves the severest winter of our climates. Two remarkable instances of its being migra- tory are recorded by Selby- He says, on the 24th and 25th October, 1822, " after a very heavy gale and thick fog from the north-west, thousands of these birds were seen to arrive upon the sea shore and sand- banks of the Northumbrian coast."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_7260">
     " A more extraordinary circumstance in the economy of this bird took place during the same winter, viz. the total disappearance of the whole tribe, natives as well as strangers, throughout Scotland and the north of England. This happened towards the conclusion of the month of January, 1823, and a few days previous to the long continued snow-storm, so severely felt through the northern counties of England, and along the eastern parts of Scotland. The range and point of this migration are unascertained, but it must probably have been a distant one, from the fact, that not a single pair returned to breed or pair the succeeding summer, in the situations they had been known always to frequent ; nor was one of the species to be seen till the following October." * ED.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_7280">
     Many absurd opinions have prevailed regarding the propagation of eels, such as their originating from the hairs of the mane and tail of horses thrown into rivers, with various other theories equally unfounded. These have arisen from the circumstance that the roe of the eel does not present the same appearance as that of other fishes. On this intricate subject Mr Couch makes the following observations : " The generation of eels has been involved in extraordinary obscurity, notwithstanding the attention which eminent naturalists have paid to the subject. I have no doubt that the pearly substance which lies along the course of the spine

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_7340">
     The method in which toads procreate and bring forth, seems to be very much in the dark. Some authors say that they are viviparous ; and yet Ray classes them among his oviparous animals, and is silent with regard to the manner of their bringing forth. Perhaps they may be eda {tsv woroxo/, ggw ds fyoroxoi, as is known to be the case with the viper.*

     The copulation of frogs (or at least the appearance of it for Swammerdam proves that the male has no penis intrans) is notorious to every body ; because we see them sticking upon each other's backs, for a month together, in the spring ; and

     of this fish (the situation of the roe in most fishes) is the roe. Contrary to what is found in most species of fish, this roe contains a large quantity of fine oil, so free from fishy flavour, as to be commonly employed (at least that found in the conger) in crust and other culinary uses in Cornwall. In the fish, its use seems to be to protect the delicate sexual organs from cold. The whole constitution of the eel is remarkably susceptible of cold; it feels every change of temperature. There are no eels in the Danube, nor in any of its tributary streams. The rivers of Siberia, though large and numerous, are destitute of them."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_7400">
     It appears pretty evident that eels are not viviparous, although this opinion has long prevailed amongst naturalists.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_7420">
     That snakes are oviparous there can be little doubt. A correspondent in the Magazine of Natural History, iv. p. 268, having killed an adder in Essex, opened it, and " discovered a string of eggs, fourteen

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_7500">
     * Toads procreate exactly in the same manner as frogs, and are also oviparous. The eggs are imbued by the spermatic fluid of the male, at the time of their extrusion. The eggs of frogs are deposited in water, in irregular congeries, while those of the toad are extruded in catinated strings. Schneider, a zealous observer of nature, affirms, that toads eat the skin which they cast periodically. This fact has been confirmed by Mr Bell, in a paper in the Zoological Journal.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_7520">
     The manner in which a frog takes his prey is very curious. When he first notices a worm or fly, he makes a point at it, like a pointer dog setting game. After a pause of some seconds, the frog makes a dart at the worm, endeavouring to seize it with his mouth ; in which attempt he frequently fails more than once, and generally waits for a short interval before he renews the attack.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_7560">
     yet I never saw, or read of toads being observed in the same situation. It is strange that the matter with regard to the venom of toads has not been yet settled. That they are not noxious to some animals is plain ; for ducks, buzzards, owls, stone-curlews, and snakes, eat them, to my knowledge, with impunity. And I well remember the time, but was not eye- witness to the fact, (though numbers of persons were,) when a quack, at this village, ate a toad to make the country people stare : afterwards he drank oil.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_7580">
     I have been informed also, from undoubted authority, that some ladies (ladies, you will say, of peculiar taste) took a fancy to a toad, which they nourished, summer after summer, for many years, till he grew to a monstrous size, with the maggots which turn to flesh flies. The reptile used to come forth, every evening, from a hole under the garden steps ; and was taken up, after supper, on the table to be fed. But at last a tame raven, kenning him as he put forth his head, gave him such a severe stroke with his horny beak, as put out one eye. After this accident, the creature languished for some time, and died.

     I need not remind a gentleman of your extensive reading, of the excellent account there is from Mr Derham, in Ray's Wisdom of God in the Creation, p. 365, concerning the migration of frogs from their breeding ponds. In this account, he at once subverts that foolish opinion, of their dropping from the clouds in rain ; shewing, that it is from the grateful coolness and moisture of those showers that they are tempted to set out on their travels, which they defer till those fall.* Frogs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_7620">
     * The following paragraph is extracted from a late number of the Belfast Chronicle: " As two gentlemen were sitting conversing on a causey pillar, near Bushmills, they were very much surprised by an unusually heavy shower of frogs, half formed, falling in all directions ; some of which are preserved in spirits of wine, and are now exhibited to the curious by the two resident apothecaries in Bushmills."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_7640">
     Mr London says, " When at Rouen, in September, 1828, I was assured by an English family, resident there, that, during a very heavy thunder shower, accompanied by violent wind, and almost midnight darkness, an innumerable multitude of young frogs fell on and around the house. The roof, the window-sills, and the gravel walks, were covered with them ; they were very small, but perfectly formed ; all dead ; and the next day being excessively hot, they were dried up to so many points, or pills, about the size of the heads of pins. The most obvious way of accounting for this phenomenon, is by supposing the water and frogs of some adjacent ponds to have been taken up by wind in a sort of whirl, or tornado." Mag. of Nat. Hist. ii. p. 103.

     are as yet in their tadpole state ; but, in a few weeks, our lanes, paths, fields, will swarm, for a few days, with myriads of those emigrants, no larger than my little finger nail. Swammerdam gives a most accurate account of the method and situation in which the male impregnates the spawn of the female. How wonderful is the economy of Providence with regard to the limbs of so vile a reptile ! While it is an aquatic, it has a fish- like tail, and no legs ; as soon as the legs sprout, the tail drops off as useless, and the animal betakes itself to the land!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_7720">
     Merret, I trust, is widely mistaken when he advances that the rana arborea is an English reptile ; it abounds in Germany and Switzerland.*
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_7740">
     It is to be remembered that the salamandra aquatica of Ray, (the water newt, or eft,) will frequently bite at the angler's bait, and is often caught on his hook. I used to take it for granted, that the salamandra aquatica was hatched, lived, and died, in the water. But John Ellis, Esq. F. R. S. (the Coralline Ellis) asserts, in a letter to the Royal Society, dated June the 5th, 1766, in his account of the mud inguana, an amphibious bipes from South Carolina, that the water eft, or newt, is only the larva of the land eft, as tadpoles are of frogs. Lest I should be suspected to misunderstand his meaning, I shall give it in his own words. Speaking of the opercula, or coverings to the gills of the mud inguana, he proceeds to say, that " the form of these pennated coverings approaches very near to what I have some time ago observed in the larva, or aquatic state, of our English lacerta, known by the name of eft, or newt, which serve them for coverings to their gills, and for fins to swim with while in this state ; and which they lose, as well as the fins of their tails, when they change their state, and

     two recent instances, to prove that our author is wrong. A sliower of young herrings fell in Kinross-shire, about ten years ago, many of which were picked up, in the fields around Loch Leven, by persons with whom I am acquainted. The reason why frogs go abroad during showers, is thus accounted for by Dr Townson, founded on certain experiments which he instituted regarding them. He says, " That frogs take in their supply of liquid through the skin alone, all the aqueous fluids which they imbibe being absorbed by the skin, and all they reject being transpired through it. One frog, in an hour and a half, absorbed nearly its own weight of water." ED.

     * It has never been verified that the tree-frog is a native of Britain. But Mr Don discovered the edible frog, rana esculenta, in the neighbour- hood of lakes in Forfarshire. This species is principally distinguished from the common one, by its larger size, and having three longitudinal yellow lines on its back. ED.

     Providence has been so indulgent to us as to allow of but one venomous reptile of the serpent kind in these kingdoms, and that is the viper. As you propose the good of mankind to be an object of your publications, you will not omit to mention common salad oil as a sovereign remedy against the bite of the viper. As to the blind worm, (anguis fragilis, so called because it snaps in sunder with a small blow,) I have found, on examination, that it is perfectly innocuous. A neighbouring yeoman (to whom I am indebted for some good hints) killed and opened a female viper about the 27th of May : he found her filled with a chain of eleven eggs, about the size of those of a blackbird ; but none of them were advanced so far towards a state of maturity as to contain any rudiments of young. Though they are oviparous, yet they are viviparous also, hatching their young within their bellies, and then bringing them forth. Whereas snakes lay chains of eggs every summer in my melon beds, in spite of all that my people can do to prevent them ; which eggs do not hatch till the spring following, as I have often experienced. Several intelligent folks assure me, that they have seen the viper open her mouth and admit her helpless young down her throat on sudden surprises, just as the female opossum does her brood into the pouch under her belly, upon the like emergencies ; and yet the London viper catchers insist on it, to Mr Barrington, that no such thing ever happens. The serpent kind eat, I believe, but once in a year ; or, rather, but only just at one season of the year. Country people talk much of a water snake, but, I am pretty sure, without any reason ; for the common snake (coluber natruc) delights much

     * In an excellent paper on this subject, in the seventeenth number of the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal, the metamorphoses of these animals are well described ; from which it would appear, that the aquatic salamander is three years of being capable of reproducing ; that its first change from the egg is to the tadpole state, and that it undergoes several changes in progressing to maturity.

     All the snake tribe eat only periodically, but it is a mistake to suppose they feed but once a year, or at a particular time of the year. After having gorged their prey, they are overcome by a sleepy torpor, and remain for days, and sometimes even weeks, in this state, when they again become lively, and crawl abroad in quest of prey. Most of the tribe, like nearly the whole amphibia, cast their skins periodically. ED.

They were taken in the gulleys that were cut for watering the meadows. From these fishes (which measured from two to four inches in length) I took the following description : The loach, in its general aspect, has a pellucid appearance ; its back is mottled with irregular collections of small black dots, not reaching much below the linea lateral^ as are the back and tail fins ; a black line runs from each eye down to the nose; its belly is of a silvery white ; the upper jaw projects beyond the lower, and is surrounded with six feelers, three on each side; its pectoral fins are large, its ventral much smaller ; the fin behind its anus small ; its dorsal fin large, containing eight spines ; its tail, where it joins to the tail fin, remarkably broad, without any taperness, so as to be characteristic of this genus ; the tail fin is broad, and square at the end. From the breadth and muscular strength of the tail, it appears to be an active nimble fish. *

She says of herself, that, " labouring under a virulent cancer, she went to some church where there was a vast crowd ; on going into a pew, she was accosted by a strange clergyman, who, after expressing compassion for her situation, told her, that if she would make such an application of living toads as is mentioned, she would be well."

This last haunts only the tops of trees in high beechen woods, and makes a sibilous grasshopper- like noise now and then, at short intervals, shivering a little with its wings when it sings ; and is, I make no doubt now, the regulus non cristatus of Ray ; which he says, " cantat voce striduld locustce" Yet this great ornithologist never suspected that there were three species. *

     IT is, I find, in zoology as it is in botany : all nature is so full, that that district produces the greatest variety which is the most examined. Several birds, which are said to belong to the north only, are, it seems, often in the south. I have discovered this summer three species of birds with us, which writers mention as only to be seen in the northern counties. The first that was brought me, on the 14th of May, was the sandpiper, tringa hypoleucus : it was a cock bird, and haunted the banks of some ponds near the village ; and, as it had a companion, doubtless intended to have bred near that water. Besides, the owner has told me since&gt; that, on recollection, he has seen some of the same birds round his ponds in former summers,

My neighbour, who shot it, says that it might easily have escaped his notice, had not the outcries and chattering of the white-throats and other small birds drawn his attention to the bush where it was : its craw was filled with the legs and wings of beetles.

     This bird is the totanus hypoleucus of Temminck. It visits Britain in the spring, and chiefly frequents oar lakes and rivers ; on the borders of which it makes a nest composed of moss and dried leaves. Great numbers breed in Scotland.

     This week twelvemonths a gentleman from London, being with us, was amusing himself with a gun, and found, he told us, on an old yew hedge, where there were berries, some birds like blackbirds, with rings of white round their necks ; a neighbouring farmer also at the same time observed the same ; but, as no specimens were procured, little notice was taken. I mentioned this circumstance to you in my letter of November the 4th, 1767 ; you, however, paia but small regard to what I said, as I had not seen these birds myself : but last week the aforesaid farmer, seeing a large flock, twenty or thirty of these birds, shot two cocks and two hens ; and says, on recollection, that he remembers to have observed these birds again last spring, about Ladyday, as it were, on their return to the north. Now, perhaps these ousels are not the ousels of the north of England, but belong to the more northern parts of Europe ; and may retire before the excessive rigour of the frosts in those parts ; and return to breed in spring, when the cold abates. If this be the case, here is discovered a new bird of winter passage, concerning whose migrations the writers are silent ; but if these birds should prove the ousels of the north of England, then here is a migration disclosed within our own kingdom never before remarked. It does not yet appear whether they retire beyond the bounds of our island to the south ; but it is most probable that they usually do, or else one cannot suppose that they would have continued so long unnoticed in the southern counties.* The ousel is larger than a blackbird, and feeds on haws ; but last autumn (when there were no haws) it fed on yew-berries ; in the spring it feeds on ivy-berries, which ripen only at that season, in March and April.

     in the manner goldfinches frequently are ; they were extremely docile ; would come to the call for the sake of a fly, of which they were extremely fond ; when raw meat was given them, would endeavour to fasten it to some part of their cage in order to tear it ; would eat mice and small birds cut in pieces, leathers, fur, and bones, disgorging the refuse like the hawk tribe. One was killed by swallowing too large a quantity of mouse fur, which it could not eject. ED.

It is a migratory species, appearing in the latter end of April, or beginning of May, and leaving Britain early in October. It makes no nest, but lays two eggs on the bare ground ; these are of a light brown colour, blotched and streaked with dusky. This bird confines its range to the southern counties, never having been noticed except in Norfolk, Hampshire, Sussex, and Dorsetshire. ED.

When I have obtained information with respect to this circumstance, I shall have finished my history of the stone-curlew, which I hope will prove to your satisfaction, as it will be, I trust, very near the truth. This gentleman, as he occupies a large farm of his own, and is abroad early and late, will be a very proper spy upon the motions of these birds ; and besides, as I have prevailed on him to buy the Naturalises Journal, (with which he is much delighted,) I shall expect that he will be very exact in his dates. It is very extraordinary, as you observe, that a bird so common with us should never straggle to you.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_9000">
     And here will be the properest place to mention, while I think of it, an anecdote which the above mentioned gentleman told me when I was last at his house ; which was, that in a warren joining to his outlet, many daws, corvi monedul&lt;&gt; build every year in the rabbit burrows under ground. The way he and his brothers used to take their nests, while they were boys, was by listening at the mouths of the holes, and if they heard the young ones cry, they twisted the nest out with a forked stick. Some water fowls (viz. the puffins) breed, I know, in this manner ; but I should never have suspected the daws of building in holes on the flat ground.*

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_9020">
     Another very unlikely spot is made use of by daws as a place to breed in, and that is Stonehenge. These birds deposit their nests in the interstices between the upright and the impost stones of that amazing work of antiquity ; which circumstance alone speaks the prodigious height of the upright stones, that they should be tall enough to secure those nests from the annoyance of shepherd boys, who are always idling round that place.

     Your approbation with regard to my new discovery of the migration of the ringousel, gives me satisfaction ; and I find you concur with me in suspecting that they are foreign birds which visit us. You will be sure, I hope, not to omit to make inquiry whether your ringousels leave your rocks in the autumn. What puzzles rne most, is the very short stay they make with us ; for in about three weeks they are all gone. I shall be very curious to remark whether they will call on us at their return in the spring, as they did last year.*

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_9360">
     * There have been many instances of toads being tamed. Mr Arscott mentions one which lived upwards of thirty-five years. Not the leas?t wonderful part of the history of the toad, is the circumstance of its being frequently found alive in the heart of solid rocks, and internal cavities of trees. In 1777, Herissant undertook some experiments to ascertain the truth of what has been related on this point. He shut up three toads in sealed boxes in plaster, and they were deposited in the Academy of Sciences. At the end of eighteen months, the boxes were opened, and one of these toads was dead, but the other two were still living. Nobody could doubt the authenticity of this fact; yet the experiments were severely criticised, as well as the observations which they seemed to confirm. It was contended that the air must have come to these animals through some imperceptible hole, which escaped the notice of the observer. Some probability was given to this supposition by the researches of Dr Edwards, published in 1817. He has observed, that toads shut up totally in plaster, and absolutely deprived of air, lived for a greater number of days, and much longer than those which were forced to remain under water. This certainly is one of the most extra- ordinary phenomena which the history of the physiology of reptiles can furnish, and seems to be an exception to the rule that air is indispensable to animal life. It appears, however, that in the above instance, some air did penetrate the plaster, as Dr Edwards afterwards proved by the fact, that as soon as the plaster which enclosed them was placed un'der water, the toads perished. The opponents of Herissant were therefore justified to a certain extent in their scepticism. Still the facts of animals existing so long a time under such circumstances, even with a little air, is most surprising, and calculated to produce very strange reflections. If these reptiles lived in this manner longer than they would have done in the open dry air, the reason must be, that they had lost less by transpiration ; and if they died much later than they would have done in water, it was because the air certainly had some access to them.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_9380">
     Professor Buckland has recently made some experiments, in order to throw light on this obscure subject. Two blocks of stone were taken, one of porous oolite limestone, and one of a compact silicious sand- stone; twelve cells, five inches wide, and six inches deep, were cut in the sandstone, and twelve others, five inches wide, and twelve inches dep, in the limestone. In November, 1825, one live toad was placed in each of the twenty-four cells, its weight being previously ascertained with care., A glass plate was placed over each cell as a cover, with a circular slate above to protect it ; and the two blocks of stone, with the immured toads, were buried in Dr Buckland's garden under three feet of earth. They were uncovered after the lapse of a year,

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_9440">
     in December, 1826. All the toads in the small cells of compact sand- stone were dead, and their bodies so much decayed as to prove that they had been dead for some months. The greater number of the toads in the larger cells of porous limestone were alive; but they were all a good deal emaciated, except two, which had increased in weight, the one from one thousand one hundred and eighty-five grains to one thousand two hundred and sixty-five, the other from nine hundred and eighty-eight to one thousand one hundred and sixteen. With regard to these two, Dr Buckland thinks they had both been nourished by insects, which had got into the one cell through a crack found in the glass cover, and into the other probably by some small aperture in the luting, which was not carefully examined. No insects were found in either cell, but an assemblage of insects was found on the outside of another glass, and a number within one of the cells whose cover was cracked, and where the animal was dead. Of the emaciated toads, one had diminished in weight from nine hundred and twenty-four grains to six hundred and ninety- eight, and one from nine hundred and thirty-six to six hundred and fifty- two. " The results of the experiments," says Dr Buckland, " amount to this : All the toads, both large and small, enclosed in the sandstone, and the small toads enclosed in the limestone also, were dead at the end of thirteen months. Before the expiration of the second year, all the large 'ones also were dead. These were examined several times, during the second year, through the glass covers of the cells, but without removing them to admit air. They appeared always awake, with their eyes open, and never in a state of torpor, their meagreness increasing at each interval, until at length they were found dead. Those which had gained an increase of weight at the end of the first year, and were then carefully closed up again, were emaciated and dead before the expiration of the second year." Four toads, enclosed in cavities cut in the trunk of an apple tree, and closed up by plugs so tightly as to exclude insects, and " apparently air," were found dead at the end of a year.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_9460">
     The phenomena, then, of live toads enclosed in rocks, he explains in this way. The young toad, as soon as it leaves its tadpole state, and emerges from the water, seeks shelter in holes and crevices of rocks and trees. One may thus enter a small opening in a rock, and when there rind food, by catching the insects which seek shelter in the same retreat ; and its increase of size may prevent it from getting out again by the same opening. It is probable that there are some small apertures in all the stones m which toads are found, though they escape the notice of the workmen, who have no motive to induce them to make a narrow exami- nation. In other cases, there may have been an opening, which had been closed up, after the animal was immured, by stalactitic incrustation. Deprived of food and air, it might fall into that state of torpor, or sus- pended animation, to which certain animals are subject in winter ; but how long it might continue in this state is uncertain.

At the end of twenty years, he took it up, and found the toad increased in bulk, and healthy. ED. * Cressi-hall is near Spalding, in Lincolnshire.

     DEAR SIR, Tt is not improbable that the Guernsey lizard and our green lizards may be specifically the same ; all that I know is, that when, some years ago, many Guernsey lizards were turned loose in Pembroke college garden, in the univer- sity of Oxford, they lived a great while, and seemed to enjoy themselves very well ; but never bred. Whether this circum- stance will prove any thing either way, I shall not pretend to say.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_9850">
     I return you thanks for your account of Cressi-hall ; but recollect, not without regret, that in June, 1746, I was visiting for a week together at Spalding, without ever being told that such a curiosity was just at hand. Pray send me word in your next what sort of tree it is that contains such a quantity of herons' nests ; and whether the heronry consists of a whole i&gt; % rove, or wood, or only of a few trees.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_9870">
     It gave me satisfaction to find we accorded so well about the capnmidgus ; all I contended for was, to prove that it often chatters sitting as well as flying, and therefore the noise was voluntary, and from organic impulse, and not from the resistance of the air against the hollow of its mouth and throat.*
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_9890">
     * This is a common species in the United States of America, and is ealled by the natives whip-poor -will, from the similarity of his cry to these words. The following interesting account of their cry is given by Wilson : " Every morning and evening his shrill and rapid repetitions are heard from the adjoining woods ; and, when two or more are calling- out at the same time, as is often the case in the pairing season, and at no great distance from each other, the noise, mingling with the echoes from the mountains, is really surprising. Strangers, in parts of the country where these birds are numerous, find it almost impossible for some time to sleep; while, to those long acquainted with them, the sound often serves as a lullaby to assist their repose.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_9910">
     " These notes seem pretty plainly to articulate the words which have been generally applied to them, whip-poor-will, the first and last syllables being uttered with great emphasis, and the whole in about a second to each repetition ; but when two or more males meet, their whip-poor-will altercations become much more rapid and incessant, as if each, were straining to overpower or silence the other. When near, you often hear an introductory cluck between the notes. At these times, as well as at almost all others, they fly low, not more than a few feet from the surface, skimming about the house and before the door, alighting on the wood

     MIGRATION.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_9950">
     If ever I saw any thing like actual migration, it was last Michaelmas-day. I was travelling, and out early in the morn- ing ; at first there was a vast fog, but, by the time that I was got seven or eight miles from home towards the coast, the sun broke out into a delicate warm day. We were then on a large heath, or common, and I could discern, as the mist began to break away, great numbers of swallows, hirundines rusticce, clustering on the stunted shrubs and bushes, as if they had roosted there all night. As soon as the air became clear and pleasant, they all were on the wing at once ; and, by a placid and easy flight, proceeded on southward, towards the sea : after this I did not see any more flocks, only now and then a straggler.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_9970">
     I cannot agree with those persons that assert, that the swallow kind disappear some and some, gradually, as they come ; for the bulk of them seem to withdraw at once ; only some stragglers stay behind a long while, and do never, there is the greatest reason to believe, leave this island. Swallows seem to lay themselves up, and to come forth in a warm day, as bats do continually of a warm evening, after they have disappeared for weeks. For a very respectable gentleman assured me, that, as he was walking with some friends, under Merton-wall, on a remarkably hot noon, either in the last week in December, or the first week in January, he espied three or four swallows huddled together on the moulding of one of the windows of that college. I have frequently remarked that swallows are seen later at Oxford than elsewhere : is it owing to the vast, massy buildings of that place, to the many waters round it, or to what else ?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_9990">
     When I used to rise in a morning last autumn, and see the swallows and martens clustering on the chimneys and thatch of the neighbouring cottages, I could not help being touched with a secret delight, mixed with some degree of mortification : with delight, to observe with how much ardour and punctuality those poor little birds obeyed the strong impulse towards migration, or hiding, imprinted on their minds by their great Creator ; and with some degree of mortification, when I reflected that, after all our pains and inquiries, we are yet not quite certain to what regions they do migrate ; and are still farther embarrassed to find that some actually do not migrate at all.

     DEAR SIR, The scarabceus fullo I know very well, having seen it in collections ; but have never -been able to discover one wild in its natural state. Mr Banks told me he thought it might be found on the sea-coast.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_10140">
     On the 13th of April, I went to the sheep-down, where the ringousels have been observed to make their appearance at spring and fall, in their way, perhaps, to the north or south ; and was much pleased to see three birds about the usual spot. We shot a cock and a hen ; they were plump and in high condition. The hen had but very small rudiments of eggs within her, which proves they are late breeders ; whereas those species of the thrush kind that remain with us the whole year have fledged young before that time. In their crops was nothing very distinguishable, but somewhat that seemed like blades of vegetables nearly digested. In autumn they feed on haws and yew-berries, and in the spring on ivy-berries. I dressed one of these birds, and found it juicy and well-flavoured. It is remarkable that they make but a few days' stay in their spring visit, but rest near a fortnight at Michaelmas. These birds, from the observations of three springs and two autumns, are most punctual in their return ; and exhibit a new migration unnoticed by the writers, who supposed they never were to be seen in any of the southern counties.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_10160">
     One of my neighbours lately brought me a new salicaria, which, at first, I suspected might have proved your willow- lark,* but on a nicer examination, it answered much better to the description of that species which you shot at Revesby, in Lincolnshire. My bird I describe thus : It is a size less than the grasshopper-lark ; the head, back, and coverts of the wings, of a dusky brown, without the dark spots of the grass- hopper-lark ; over each eye is a milk-white stroke ; the chin and throat are white, and the under parts of a yellowish white ;

     the rump is tawny, and the feathers of the tail sharp pointed ; the bill is dusky and sharp, and the legs are dusky, the hinder claw long and crooked."* The person that shot it says, that it sung so like a reed-sparrow, that he took it for one ; and that it sings all night : but this account merits farther inquiry. For my part, I suspect it is a second sort of locustella, hinted at by Dr Derhain in Ray's Letters : see p. 74. He also procured me a grasshopper-lark.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_10240">
     The question that you put with regard to those genera of animals that are peculiar to America, namely, How they came there, and whence ? is too puzzling for me to answer ; and yet so obvious as often to have struck me with wonder. If one looks into the writers on that subject, little satisfaction is to be found. Ingenious men will readily advance plausible arguments to support whatever theory they shall choose to maintain ; but then the misfortune is, every one's hypothesis is each as good as another's, since they are all founded on conjecture. The late writers of this sort, in whom may be seen all the argu- ments of those that have gone before, as I remember, stock America from the western coast of Africa, and the south of Europe ; and then break down the isthmus that bridged over the Atlantic. But this is making use of a violent piece of machinery : it is a difficulty worthy of the interposition of a god ! " Incredulus odi"

     DEAR SIR, It gives me satisfaction to find that my account of the ousel migration pleases you. You put a very shrewd question, when you ask me how I know that their autumnal migration is southward ? Were not candour and openness the very life of natural history, I should pass over this query just as a sly commentator does over a crabbed passage in a classic ; but common ingenuousness obliges me to confess, not without some degree of shame, that I only reasoned in that case from analogy. For as all other autumnal birds migrate from the northward to us, to partake of our milder winters, and return to the northward again, when the rigorous cold abates, so I concluded that the ringousels did the same, as well as their congeners, the fieldfares ; and especially as ring- ousels are known to haunt cold mountainous countries ; but I have good reason to suspect since, that they may come to us from the westward ; because I hear, from very good authority, that they breed on Dartmoor : and that they forsake that wild district about the time that our visitors appear, and do not return till late in the spring.

I have surveyed it alive and dead, and have procured several specimens ; and am perfectly persuaded myself (and trust you will soon be convinced of the same) that it is no more or less than the passer arundinaceus minor of Ray. * This bird, by some means or other, seems to be entirely omitted in the British Zoology ; and one reason probably was, because it is so strangely classed in Ray, who ranges it among his pici affines. It ought, no doubt, to have gone among his aviculce cauda unicolore, and among your slender-billed small birds of the same division. Linnaeus might, with great propriety, have put it into his genus of motacilla ; and the motacilla salicaria of his fauna suecica seems to come the nearest to it. It is no uncommon bird, haunting the sides of ponds and rivers, where there is covert, and the reeds and sedges of moors. The country people in some places call it the sedge-bird. It sings inces- santly, night and day, during the breeding time, imitating the note of a sparrow, a swallow, a skylark ; and has a strange hurrying manner in its song. My specimens correspond most minutely to the description of your fen salicaria shot near Revesby. Mr Ray has given an excellent characteristic of it when he says, " Rostrum et pcdes in hdc avicula multo majores sunt qudm pro corporis rationed

Thus the squnck, or stonck, of Ray's Synop. Quadr. is an innocuous and sweet animal ; but, when pressed hard by dogs and men, it can eject such a most pestilent and fetid smell and excre- ment, that nothing can be more horrible,

     * The following circumstance, as to the imitative powers of the black- bird, is a new fact in natural history, and was recorded by the Rev. Barton Bouchier, of Wold Rectory, near Northampton, in April, 1831. " Within hah a mile of my residence," says he, " there is a blackbird which crows constantly, and as accurately as the common cock, and nearly as loud ; as it may, on a still day, be heard at the distance of several hundred yards. When first told of the circumstance, I conjectured that it must have been the work of a cock pheasant, concealed in a neighbouring brake ; but on the assurance that it was nothing more or less than a common blackbird, I determined to ascertain the fact with my own eyes and ears; and this day I had the gratification of getting close to it, seated on the top bough of an ash-tree, and pursuing with unceasing zeal its unusual note. The resemblance to the crow of the domestic cock is so perfect, that more than one in the distance were answering to it, and the little fellow seemed to take delight in competing with its rivals of the dunghill. It occasion- ally indulged in its usual song; but only for a second or two, resuming its more favourite note ; and once or twice it commenced with crowing, and broke oif in the middle to its more natural whistle. I am not aware that the blackbird has even been included among those birds which could be taught to imitate sounds ; such as the starling, jay, or magpie ; and in what way this bird has acquired its present propensity, I am unable to say, except that, as its usual haunt is near a mill where poultry are kept, it may have learnt the note from the common fowl."

     Blackbirds can be taught various airs, while in a state of captivity, but we consider the circumstance of this bird, in a wild state, imitating the crowing of a cock, as very remarkable. ED.

The following are the facts recorded : One writer says, vol. iii. p. 193, " The note resembles that of the blackbird more than the common thrush, and is, I believe, generally mistaken for the former, but it is much louder, and less mellow, and free from that warbling nature so peculiar to the blackbird." Another correspondent, in Ayrshire, says, " It often happens that the woods resound, far and near, with its powerful melody, on a still day, or middle of winter, or early in the spring, when no other songster is heard." Mr J. D. Marshall, of Belfast, an authority which we highly respect, says, " This bird seems to have two kinds* of song, one not unlike the notes of the blackbird, the other very sweet, though in a much lower tone, and more nearly resembling those of the common thrush. I have one which I reared from the nest ; and, having been kept a year near a canary, it has, to a certain degree, acquired its song, as, in several notes, it has imitated it almost to perfection."- ED.

     * Both male and female bullfinches sing ; their notes are not much varied, but possess a degree of simple wildness, which is delivered in a low, but pleasing strain. The call note is very audible, and greatly resembles the action of metallic substances against each other. In a domesticated state, these birds are capable of attaining various tunes in a high degree of perfection. We have heard them singing, with much exactness, " Braw, braw lads o' Gala Water," and other melodies. In Germany, they are taught a variety of waltzes. Our friend, William Sharp, Esq. Cononsyth, near Montrose, has one of these foreign birds, which sings several difficult waltzes and airs in a beautiful manner. ED.

     Most kinds of birds seem to me to be wild and shy, some- what in proportion to their bulk ; I mean in this island, where they are much pursued and annoyed ; but in Ascension Island, and many other desolate places, mariners have found fowls so unacquainted with a human figure, that they would stand still to be taken, as is the case with boobies, &amp;c. As an example of what is advanced, I remark that the golden-crested wren, (the smallest British bird,) will stand unconcerned till you come within three or four yards of it, while the bustard, (otis,) the largest British land fowl, does not care to admit a person within so many furlongs.

He fired at the hawk with the first barrel, (while the fieldfare sat still,) but missed ; the hawk, intent upon his prey, disregarded that shot ; with the second barrel he brought the bird down. The fieldfare left his shoulder, and fluttered for a short time around its fallen and dead enemy, uttering a chirp of joy, and then winged away from its friend and unexpected protector.

If they came to spend the whole winter with us, as some of their congeners do, and then left us, as they do, in spring, I should not be so much struck with the occurrence, since it would be similar to that of the other winter birds of passage ; but when I see them for a fortnight at Michaelmas, and again for about a week in the middle of April, I am seized with wonder, and long to be informed whence these travellers come, and whither they go, since they seem to use our hills merely as an inn, or baiting place.

     Your account of the greater brambling, or snow-fleck, is very amusing; and strange it is, that such a short-winged bird should delight in such perilous voyages over the northern ocean ! * Some country people in the winter time have every now and then told me that they have seen two or three white larks on our downs ; but, on considering the matter, I begin to suspect that these are some stragglers of the birds we are talking of, which sometimes, perhaps, may rove so far to the southward.

     This is the Alpine hare, lepus variabilis, of British naturalists. Its ears are shorter than the head, and black towards the tips ; the rest of the body, dusky in summer, and white in winter. There appears to be a correlative connection in the distribution of colour in animals as regards temperature. In tropical regions, the colour of man and animals exhibits more variety and intensity than in northern latitudes. In temperate climates, animals, in general, suffer little change from the vicissitudes of the seasons, although, in many cases, winter and summer clothing is very different in some species. In Britain, the white hare is an instance, whose fur is tawny gray in summer, but changes, in September or October, to a snowy white. This remarkable transition takes place in the following manner : About the middle of September, the gray feet begin to get white, and, before the end of the month, all the four feet are white, and the ears and muzzle are of a brighter colour. The white generally ascends the legs and thighs, and whitish spots are observed under the gray hairs, which continue to increase till the end of October; but still the back remains of a gray colour, while the eyebrows and ears are nearly white. From this period, the change of colour advances very rapidly, and, by the middle of November, the whole fur, with the excep- tion of the tips of the ears, which continue black, js of a shining white.

     The back becomes white within eight days. During the whole of this remarkable change in the fur, no hair falls from the animal. Hence it appears, that the hair actually changes its colour, and that there is no renewal of it. The fur continues white till the month of March, or even later, depending on the temperature of the atmosphere, and, by the middle of May, it has again assumed its gray colour. But the spring change is different from the winter, as the hair is completely shed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_14810">
     An instance of a similar change may be instanced in the ptarmigan, (tetrao lagopus. ) Its summer plumage is ash gray, mottled with dusky spots and bars. At the approach of winter, the dark colours disappear, and its feathers are then found to be pure white. We are naturally led to inquire what benefit the animals reeceive from this periodical change, as we know that the All-wise does nothing in vain. Colour has a great influence on the ratio at which bodies cool. It is an established law, that surfaces which reflect heat most readily, allow it to escape very slowly by radiation. White objects reflect most readily, consequently there will be a proportionate difficulty in its radiation of heat. If a black animal and a white one were placed in a higher temperature than that of their own body, the heat will enter the black one with the greatest rapidity, and soon elevate its temperature considerably above that of the other. These differences manifest themselves in wearing black and white coloured clothing during hot weather ; so that if these animals are placed in a temperature considerably lower than their own, the animal which is black will give out its heat by radiation to the surrounding objects sooner than itself, by which its temperature will speedily be reduced, while the white animal will part with its heat by radiation at a much slower rate. Hence it would appear that the clothing of animals is suited in colour to the temperature of the situations where they localize. Accidental variations, however, sometimes occur, as in some birds we have already mentioned at page 36. A black hare was shot at Combe, near Coventry, in February, 1828 ; and another was killed at Netley, Shropshire, by the Rev. F. W. Hope. ED.

     As a neighbour was lately ploughing in a dry chalky field, far removed from any water, he turned out a water-rat, that was curiously laid up in an hybernaculum artificially formed of grass and leaves. At one end of the burrow lay above a gallon of potatoes, regularly stowed, on which it was to have supported itself for the winter. But the difficulty with me is, how this amphibius mus came to fix its winter station at such a distance from the water. Was it determined in its choice of that place by the mere accident of finding the potatoes which were planted there ? or is it the constant practice of the aquatic rat to forsake the neighbourhood of the water in the colder months ?

     Though I delight very little in analogous reasoning, knowing how fallacious it is with respect to natural history ; yet, in the following instance, I cannot help being inclined to think it may conduce towards the explanation of a difficulty that I have mentioned before, with respect to the invariable early retreat of the kirundo apus, or swift, so many weeks before its congeners ; and that not only with us, but also in Andalusia, where they begin to retire about the beginning of August.

     The great large bat* (which, by the by, is at present a nondescript in England, and what I have never been able yet to procure) retires or migrates very early in the summer : it also ranges very high for its food, feeding in a different region of the air ; and that is the reason I never could procure one. ( Now, this is exactly the case with the swifts ; for they take their food in a more exalted region than the other species, and are very seldom seen hawking for flies near the ground, or over the surface of the water. From hence I would conclude, that these kirundines, and the larger bats, are supported by some sorts of high-flying gnats, scarabs, or phalcencB, that are of short continuance ; and that the short stay of these strangers is regulated by the defect of their food.

     Mr Sweet, who has devoted much time to taming the musical genus sylvia, has, by diligent observation, and appropriate management, actually changed most of the species from annual to perennial songsters. In the month of March, these interesting choristers may be heard, pouring forth the familiar strains of midsummer. A little room, with a fire- place, serves as an aviary ; and in this he has two large cages, which contain the nightingale, white-throat, pettichaps, white-ear, whin-chat, stone-chat, redstart, black-cap, willow-wren, seskin, and other birds.

     DEAR SIR, Your observation, that "the cuckoo does not deposit its egg indiscriminately in the nest of the first bird that comes in its way, but probably looks out a nurse in some degree congenerous, with whom to intrust its young," is per- fectly new to me ; and struck me so forcibly, that I naturally fell into a train of thought that led me to consider whether the fact were so, and what reason there was for it. When I came to recollect and inquire, I could not find that any cuckoo had ever been seen in these parts, except in the nest of the wagtail, the hedge-sparrow, the titlark, the white-throat, and the red-breast, all soft-billed insectivorous birds. The excel- lent Mr Willughby mentions the nest of the palumbus, (ring- dove,) and of the fringilla, (chaffinch,) birds that subsist on acorns and grains, and such hard food ; but then he does not mention them as of his own knowledge ; but says afterwards, that he saw himself a wagtail feeding a cuckoo. It appears hardly possible that a soft-billed bird should subsist on the same food with the hard-billed ; for the former have thin membranaceous stomachs suited to their soft food ; while the latter, the granivorous tribe, have strong muscular gizzards, which, like mills, grind, by the help of small gravels and pebbles, what is swallowed. This proceeding of the cuckoo, of dropping its eggs as it were by chance, is such a monstrous outrage on maternal affection, one of the first great dictates of nature, and such a violence on instinct, that, had it only been related of a bird in the Brazils, or Peru, it would never have merited our belief. But yet, should it farther appear that this simple bird, when divested of that natural avogyjij that seems to raise the kind in general above themselves, and inspire them with extraordinary degrees of cunning and address, may be still endued with a more enlarged faculty of discerning what species are suitable and congenerous nursing

A few days after the young birds had left the nest, I observed the old birds apparently collecting materials for building, and was much amused at seeing the young running after the parent birds, with imploring looks and gestures, demanding food ; but the old birds, with roots or pieces of grass in their bills, seemed quite heedless of them, and intent on their new habitation. Their motions were narrowly watched by a female cuckoo, which I saw constantly near the place ; but the wagtails had placed their second nest within a yard of the door, and so well concealed among some luxuriant ivy, that the cuckoo, being often frightened away, was not able to discover the nest. The intruder being thus thwarted in its design, the birds hatched their second brood, which was accidentally destroyed a few days after. In about ten days they actually commenced a third nest, within a few feet of the situation of the second, in safety. I have repeatedly taken the cuckoo's eggs from the wagtail's nest ; in this locality, it has a decided preference to it. I do not recollect finding it in any other, excepting in two instances, once in the hedge-warbler's, and another time in the redstart's nest. In this vicinity, whether the wagtail selects the hole of a pollard tree, a cleft in the wall, or a projecting ledge under a bridge, it does not often escape the prying eye of the cuckoo, as, in all these situations, I have frequently found either egg or young. The cuckoo appears to possess the power of retaining its egg for some time after it is ready for extrusion. On one occasion, I had observed a cuckoo during several days anxiously watching a pair of wagtails building ; I saw the cuckoo fly from the nest two or three times before it was half completed ; and at last the labour of the wagtails not going on, I imagine, so rapidly as might be wished, the cuckoo deposited its egg before the lining of the nest was finished. The egg, contrary to my expectation, was not thrown out ; and on the following day the wagtail commenced laying, and, as usual, the intruder was hatched at the same time as the rest, and soon had the whole nest to itself. I once observed a cuckoo enter a wagtail's nest, which I had noticed before to contain one egg ; in a few minutes the cuckoo crept from the hole, and was flying away with something in its beak, which proved to be the egg of the wagtail, which it dropped on my firing a gun at it. On examining the nest, the cuckoo had only made an exchange, leaving its own egg for the one taken. In May, 1829, I found two cuckoo's eggs in the same nest, and depended on witnessing a desperate struggle between the parties, but my hopes were frustrated by some person destroying it."

     DEAR SIR, Hedge-hogs abound in my gardens arid fields. The manner in which they eat the roots of the plantain in my grass walks is very curious : with their upper mandible, which is much longer than their lower, they bore under the plant, and so eat the root off upwards, leaving the tuft of leaves untouched. In this respect they are serviceable, as they destroy a very troublesome weed ;* but they deface the walks in some measure, by digging little round holes. It appears, by the dung that they drop upon the turf, that beetles are no inconsiderable part of their food, j- In June last, I procured a

     We are surprised to find that some naturalists of the present day deny the fact that hedge-hogs eat flesh. Buffon says, speaking of some tame ones, " They ate caterpillars, beetles, and worms, and were also very fond of flesh, which they devoured, boiled or raw." Later observations prove them to be predatory animals. We saw one in the possession of Mr Woodcock, surgeon, Bury, Lancashire, which he got from a peasant, who caught it in the act of eating a toad, and which it pertinaciously kept hold of when taken, rolling itself up, and keeping firm hold of the toad with its mouth. We attempted to pull the toad from it, but it held its victim the firmer. It had consumed the head and one of the legs, when discovered. Hedge-hogs also feed on eggs, and do considerable mischief to game during the breeding season. They have been known to enter a hen -house, drive the hen off her nest, and devour the eggs.

     In 1829, a labourer of the name of Copland, while abroad in the fields near Terraughty, Dumfriesshire, heard a sound which convinced him that a hare was at hand, and in jeopardy. The squeaking, however, soon ceased, and the man, after looking carefully round, came upon a leveret, which was lying dead by the side of a hedge-hog. The enemy had, by this time, coiled himself into a ball ; but, as appearances indicated that he had both bit and smothered the leveret, Copland was so enraged at

     litter of four or five young hedge-hogs, which appeared to be about five or six days old : they, I find, like puppies, are born blind, and could not see when they came to my hands. No doubt their spines are soft and flexible at the time of their birth, or else the poor dam would have but a bad time of it in the critical moment of parturition : but it is plain that they soon harden ; for these little pigs had such stiff prickles on their backs and side as would easily have fetched blood, had they not been handled with caution. Their spines are quite white at this age ; and they have little hanging ears, which I do not remember to be discernible in the old ones. They can, in part, at this age, draw their skin down over their faces ; but are not able to contract themselves into a ball, as they do, for the sake of defence, when full grown. The reason, I suppose, is, because the curious muscle that enables the creature to roll itself up in a ball was not then arrived at its full tone and firmness. Hedge-hogs make a deep and warm hybernaculum with leaves and moss, in which they conceal themselves for the winter ; but I never could find that they stored in any winter provision, as some quadrupeds certainly do.

     I have discovered an anecdote with respect to the fieldfare, (turdus pilaris,) which I think is particular enough. This bird, though it sits on trees in the day-time, and procures the greatest part of its food from white-thorn hedges ; yea, moreover, builds on very high trees, as may be seen by the Fauna Suecica; yet always appears with us to roost on the ground. They are seen to come in flocks just before it is dark, and to settle and nestle among the heath on our forest. And, besides, the larkers, in dragging their nets by night, frequently catch them in the wheat stubbles ; while the bat fowlers, who take many red- wings in the hedges, never entangle any of this species. Why these birds, in the matter of roosting, should differ from ail their congeners, and from themselves also with respect to their proceedings by day, is a fact for which I am by no means able to account.

     ON Michaelmas day, 1768, I managed to get a sight of the female moose belonging to the Duke of Richmond, at Good- wood; but was greatly disappointed, when I arrived at the spot, to find that it died, after having appeared in a languishing way for some time, on the morning before. However, under- standing that it was not stripped, I proceeded to examine this rare quadruped ; I found it in an old greenhouse, slung under the belly and chin by ropes, and in a standing posture ; but, though it had been dead for so short a time, it was in so putrid a state that the stench was hardly supportable. The grand distinction between this deer and any other species that I have ever met with, consisted in the strange length of its legs ; on which it was tilted up much in the manner of the birds of the grallcB order. I measured it, as they do a horse, and found that, from the ground to the wither, it was just five feet four inches, which height answers exactly to sixteen hands, a growth that few horses arrive at : but then, with this length of legs, its neck was remarkably short, no more than twelve inches ; so that, by straddling with one foot forward and the other backward, it grazed on the plain ground, with the greatest difficulty, between its legs : the ears were vast and lopping, and as long as the neck ; the head was about twenty inches long, and ass-like ; and had such a redundancy of upper lip as I never saw before, with huge nostrils. * This lip, travellers say, is esteemed a dainty dish in North America.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_16070">
     * The gigantic moose-deer is said by some travellers to attain from eleven to twelve feet ; but it is probable that the size of a large horse is more near its dimensions. The European elk reaches from seven to eight feet, and measures in length, from the muzzle to the insertion of the tail, ten feet. We annex a represention of this large animal.

     The elk was at one time a native of Ireland, as its remains in a fossil state are often discovered in that country. A very large fossil skeleton was found in the Isle of Man, in 1821, while digging a marie pit. It was obtained for the Edinburgh College Museum, by that patriotic nobleman the late Duke of Atholl.

     It is very reasonable to suppose, that this creature supports itself chiefly by browsing of trees, and by wading after water plants, towards which way of livelihood the length of legs and great lip must contribute much. I have read somewhere, that it delights in eating the nymphcea, or water lily. From the fore-feet to the belly, behind the shoulder, it measured three feet and eight inches ; the length of the legs before and behind consisted a great deal in the tibia, which was strangely long ; but, in my haste to get out of the stench, I forgot to measure that joint exactly. Its scut seemed to be about an inch long; the colour was a grizzly black ; the mane about four inches long ; the fore-hoofs were upright and shapely, the hind flat and splayed. The spring before, it was only two years old, so that most probably it was not then come to its growth. What a vast tall beast must a full-grown stag be ! I have been told some arrive at ten feet and a half! This poor creature had at first a female companion of the same species, which died the spring before. In the same garden was a young stag, or red-deer, between whom and this moose it was hoped that there might have been a breed ; but their inequality of height must have always been a bar to any commerce of the amorous kind. I should have been glad to have examined the teeth, tongue, lips, hoofs, &amp;c. minutely ; but the putrefaction precluded all farther curiosity. This animal, the keeper told me, seemed to enjoy itself best in the extreme frost of the former winter. In the house, they shewed me the horn of a male moose, which had no front antlers, but only a broad palm, with some snags on the edge. The noble owner of the dead moose proposed to make a skeleton of her bones.

     As to the matter of long billed birds growing fatter in moderate frosts, I have no doubt within myself what should be the reason. The thriving at those times appears to me to arise altogether from the gentle check which the cold throws upon insensible perspiration. The case I is just the same with blackbirds, &amp;c. ; and farmers and warreners observe, the first, that their hogs fat more kindly at such times, and the latter, that their rabbits are never in such good case as in a gentle frost. But, when frosts are severe, and of long continuance, the case is soon altered ; for then a want of food soon over- balances the repletion occasioned by a checked perspiration. I have observed, moreover, that some human constitutions are more inclined to plumpness in winter than in summer.

     DEAR SIR, Last month we had such a series of cold tur- bulent weather, such a constant succession of frost, and snow, and hail, and tempest, that the regular migration, or appearance of the summer birds, was much interrupted. Some did not shew themselves (at least were not heard) till weeks after their usual time, as the black-cap and white-throat ; and some have not been heard yet, as the grasshopper-lark and largest willow-wren. As to the fly-catcher, I have not seen it; it is indeed one of the latest, but should appear about this time ; and yet, amidst all this meteorous strife and war of the elements, two swallows discovered themselves as long ago as the eleventh of April, in frost and snow ; but they withdrew quickly, and were not visible again for many days. House-martens, which are always more backward than swallows, were not observed till May came in.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_16760">
     Among the monogamous birds, several are to be found, after pairing time, single, and of each sex : but whether this state of celibacy is matter of choice or necessity, is not so easily discoverable. When the house-sparrows deprive my martens of their nests, as soon as I cause one to be shot, the other, be it cock or hen, presently procures a mate, and so for several times following. *

     * The late Mr Jaraieson, of Portobello, told us a remarkable circum- stance of the swallow, which was equal to human sagacity. A pair of these birds built a nest in the corner of one of his windows at Portobello. They had scarcely finished their labour, when a pair of house-sparrows took forcible possession, and drove the rightful owners from their domicile. The swallows made several unsuccessful attempts to regain possession, being always beaten off by the sparrows, who defended the entrance with determined obstinacy. At last, finding their attempts fruitless, they departed, and, in a short time, returned with a host of their companions, who did not attempt to take the intruders by storm, but, in a very short time, by their united efforts, built up the entrance to the nest, determined seemingly to imprison, for life, the occupiers of the property which had been unlawfully acquired,

     Male birds procure mates by the power of their song. Hence it may be inferred, that if a confined bird had acquired the song of another species, without retaining any notes of its own, and was set at liberty, the pro- bability is, that it would never find a mate of its own species ; and, even

     I have known a dove-house infested by a pair of white owls, which made great havock among the young pigeons : one of the owls was shot as soon as possible ;*but the survivor readily found a mate, and the mischief went on. After some time the new pair were both destroyed, and the annoyance ceased. *
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_16860">
     Another instance I remember, of a sportsman, whose zeal for the increase of his game being greater than his humanity, after pairing time, he always shot the cock-bird of every couple of partridges upon his grounds, supposing that the rivalry of many males interrupted the breed. He used to say, that, though he had widowed the same hen several times, yet he found she was still provided with a fresh paramour, that did not take her away from her usual haunt.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_16880">
     Again : I knew a lover of setting, an old sportsman, who has often told me, that soon after harvest, he has frequently taken small coveys of partridges, consisting of cock birds alone : these he pleasantly used to call old bachelors.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_16900">
     There is a propensity belonging to common house cats that is very remarkable ; I mean their violent fondness for fish, which appears to be their most favourite food ; and yet, nature in this instance seems to have planted in them an appetite that, unassisted, they know not how to gratify : for of all quadrupeds, cats are the least disposed towards water ;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_16920">
     although it did, there is no reason to doubt but the young of that bird would be devoid of its native notes.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_16940">
     There has been much controversy among naturalists, whether the notes of birds are innate or acquired ; the greater part of which has originated amongst those who argue on general principles without experimenting. We have ourselves instituted these experiments, and have hence proved clearly, that the song of birds is innate. We have brought up repeatedly broods of young chaffinches, and they invariably sang their native notes when they arrived at maturity ; and this without the possi- bility of their hearing the song of their kindred. Nay, on the contrary, they were brought up in the same room with a gray linnet, and never acquired any of its notes ; but had their peculiar notes, which cannot possibly be mistaken. ED.

     * It is a fact not generally known that owls feed on fish. The Rev. Mr Bree took some young brown owls (strix stridula) from the nest, and placed them among the trees in the garden of Allesley rectory. In that situation the parent birds repeatedly brought them live fish, such as bull-heads, and loach, which they had procured in a neighbouring brook. Many years ago, the gold and silver fish in the fishpond in the garden of Balstrode, the property of the Duke of Portland, were captured by the common brown owl. This fact was discovered by men set to watch the pond. ED.

     DEAR SIR, The severity and turbulence of last month so interrupted the regular process of summer migration, that some of the birds do but just begin to shew themselves, and others are apparently thinner than usual ; as the white-throat, the black-cap, the redstart, the fly-catcher. I well remember, that, after the very severe spring, in the year 1739-40, summer birds of passage were very scarce.

     * Many instances have been recorded of cats catching fish. Mr Moody of Jesmond, near Newcastle-upon-Tyne, had a cat in 1829, which had been in his possession for some years, that caught fish with great assiduity, and frequently brought them home alive ! Besides minnows and eels, she occasionally carried home pilchards, one of which, about six inches long, was found in her possession in August, 1827. She also contrived to teach a neighbour's cat to fish ; and the two have been seen together watching by the TJis for fish. At other times, they have been seen at opposite sides of the river, not far from each other, on the look out for their prey.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_17130">
     The following" still more extraordinary circumstance of a cat fishing in the sea, appeared in the Plymouth Journal, June, 1828:

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_17150">
     " There is now at the battery on the Devil's Point, a cat, which is an expert catcher of the finny tribe, being in the constant habit of diving into the sea, and bringing up the fish alive in her mouth, and depositing them in the guard-room, for the use of the soldiers. She is now seven years old, and has long been a useful caterer. It is supposed that her pursuit of the water-rats first taught her to venture into the water, to which it is well known puss has a natural aversion. She is as fond of the water as a Newfoundland dog, and takes her regular peregrinations along the rocks at its edge, looking out for her prey, ready to dive for them at a moment's notice. --ED.

     I am not pleased to find that some people seem so little satisfied with Scopoli's new publication, There is room to expect great things from the hands of that man, who is a good naturalist ; and one would think that a history of the birds of so distant and southern a region as Carniola would be new and interesting. I could wish to see that work, and hope to get it sent down. Dr Scopoli is physician to the wretches that work in the quicksilver mines of that district.

     When you talked of keeping a reed-sparrow, and giving it seeds, I could not help wondering ; because the reed-sparrow which I mentioned to you, (passer arundinaceus minor, Raii,) is a soft-billed bird, and most probably migrates hence before winter ; whereas the bird you kept (passer torquatus, Raii,) abides all the year, and is a thick-billed bird. I question whether the latter be much of a songster ; but in this matter I want to be better informed. The former has a variety of hurrying notes, and sings all night. Some part of the song of the former, I suspect, is attributed to the latter. We have plenty of the soft-billed sort, which Mr Pennant had entirely left out of his British Zoology, till I reminded him of his omission. See British Zoology last published, p. 16.

     There is much variety in the flight of birds; some fly by jerks, closing their wings every third or fourth stroke, which produces an undulatory motion, as may be observed in the flight of woodpeckers, warblers, wagtails, and most other small birds ; others pursue a smooth and even course ; while others, again, are buoyant, without perceptible motion, as the kite, kestril, and many of the hawk tribe. The greater number of birds fly with their legs drawn up, and their neck extended ; others again, from their great length of neck, and its consequent weight, are obliged to contract, or bend it in flight, for the purpose of bringing the centre of gravity on the wings, in aid of which the legs are stretched behind, as exemplified in the heron, stork, and bittern. Others fly with protruded necks, but are compelled to throw out their legs behind, as the goose, duck, and other aquatic birds.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_17330">
     Aquatic birds, and those termed waders, run in the ordinary manner, by alternately placing one foot before the other, but nearly all the smaller birds jump, or hop, along as if their legs were united. The crow, starling, lark, and wagtail, are regular walkers ED.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_17350">
     " The flight of a strong falcon," says Dr Shaw, " is wonderfully swift. It is recorded that a falcon belonging to the Duke of Cleve, flew out of Westphalia into Prussia in one day ; and in the county of Norfolk, a hawk has made a flight at a woodcock near thirty miles in an hour."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_17370">
     " But what are these," says Professor Rennie, " compared to the actual velocity and continuance of the falcon that is recorded to have belonged to Henry IV, King of France, which escaped from Fontainbleau, and in twenty-four hours after was killed in Malta, a space computed to be not less than one thousand three hundred and fifty miles? a velocity equal to fifty-seven miles in an hour, supposing the hawk to have been on the wing the whole time. But as such birds never fly by night, and allowing the day to be at the longest, or to be eighteen hours light, this would make seventy -five miles an hour. It is probable, however, thatjie neither had so many hours of light in the twenty-four to perform the journey, nor that he was retaken the moment of his arrival, so that we may fairly conclude much less time was occupied in performing this distant flight."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_17390">
     We do not agree with the opinion entertained by Professor Rennie, that the falcon in question did not fly by night. Although the birds of this tribe are diurnal, still there must be instances of their flying by night, as in the case above referred to. We would ask, where did be rest during the night in crossing the Mediterranean ? Birds which make long migrations, must fly by night as well as by day in crossing a great extent of ocean.

     SEX OF ANIMALS.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_17450">
     No doubt the reason why the sex of birds in their first plumage is so difficult to be distinguished is, as you say, " because they are not to pair and discharge their parental functions till the ensuing spring." As colours seem to be the chief external sexual distinction in many birds, these colours do not take place till sexual attachments begin to obtain. And the case is the same in quadrupeds ; among whom, in their younger days, the sexes differ but little ; but, as they advance to maturity, horns and shaggy manes, beards and brawny necks, &amp;c. strongly discriminate the male from the female. We may instance still farther in our own species, where a beard and stronger features are usually characteristic of the male sex ; but this sexual diversity does not take place in earlier life ; for a beautiful youth shall be so like a beautiful girl, that the difference shall not be discernible : *

     during the love season, in a circling manner, supporting itself with both wings angularly elevated, in which position it keeps them until it is about to alight. Now and then, during these circular flights, the tips of the primary quills of each wing are made to strike against each other, producing a sharp rap, which may be heard at a distance of thirty or forty yards. Before alighting, the passenger pigeon, like the Carolina parrot, and a few other species of birds, breaks the force of its flight by repeated flappings, as if apprehensive of receiving injury from coming too suddenly into contact with the branch, or the spot of ground, on which it intends to settle."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_17530">
     Mr Audubon calculates that the passenger pigeon must travel at the rate of a mile in a minute, a velocity which would enable one of these birds to visit the European continent in less than three days.

     * There is a remarkable physiological fact in the animal economy, that of the females of many species assuming somewhat of the character of the male when they become aged. This obtains in a strong degree in many animals, and something similar takes place in the human species ; for example, that increase of hair observable in the faces of many women advanced in h'fe, is certainly an approximation towards a beard, which is one of the most distinguishing secondary properties of man. It is also well known that old mares approach the form of the horse, in the thickening of the crest.

     breed was allowed to live as long as possible, because her chickens became so renowned in the cock-pit. \Vhen, however, she had attained the age of fifteen years, she was observed, after moulting, to have acquired some arched cock's feathers in her tail, whilst others (old feathers) remained straight and brown, as formerly. By degrees, and during one moulting season, the whole of her dusky plumage was thrown ofi% and succeeded by a covering of red, and more beautiful feathers, quite like those of the cock of her own breed. In the course of the single season, the change was so fully accomplished, that, as she walked about, any stranger might have pronounced her rather to have been a cock than a hen. Spurs, likewise, sprouted out on her legs ; she acquired a comb and wattles on her head ; and even crowed hoarsely, not unlike a young cock. Her wattles were, however, cut off afterwards, for the purpose of making her look like a fighting cock. After the completion of this change of plumage, she discontinued to lay eggs ; and lived no very considerable time to enjoy her recently acquired, but splendid costume." This bird is now in Dr Butter's collection. This gentleman adduces other evidence of a similar change, in two old hens, kept for him by a Mrs Adams, of Bowden, near Totness, on purpose to ascertain if the change was general. One of these was fifteen years old, and the other thirteen. Of these she says, " I bought them both when pullets. They were of the common domestic breed, and excellent layers, which was the reason I kept them so long. I first observed the change on them after an absence of five months ; when I inquired of my dairy-maid, &lt; From whence come these two young cocks ? ' for such they appeared to me in their plumage and crowing. I was greatly surprised at being informed, that they were my two old hens."

     In Tucker's Ornithologia Danmoniensis, there is an account of a domestic hen, which changed her feathers to those of the cock; and Aristotle, in his Hist. Anim. lib. ix. c. 36, makes mention of a domestic hen assuming the male plumage.

     When we were in Downpatrick, our friend, William Johnstone, Esq. informed us of a circumstance which, no doubt, was referable to this cause. He had succeeded to a large fortune by the will of an uncle, and among the animals which he acquired was an old cock, a favourite of the old gentleman. It was, out of respect for his memory, permitted to live until it died a natural death. Mr Johnstone shewed me the cock, which was then alive, and which he considered as a very miraculous one, having, at short intervals, laid two small eggs, not larger than those of a blackbird, and nearly circular, with very strong shells. He was quite certain that they were extruded by this supposed cock, as no other fowl could possibly get into the place where he was kept at the time. We told him we had no doubt but it was a hen, with the male plumage from age ; but he was firmly of belief that it was an old cock. From circumstances of this kind have arisen, no doubt, the fable of the cockatrice. ED.

     Mr Barrington shewed me many astonishing collections of stuffed and living birds from all quarters of the world. After I had studied over the latter for a time, I remarked that every species almost that came from distant regions, such as South America, the coast of Guinea, &amp;c. were thick-billed birds, of the loxia and fringilla genera ; and no motacillcs or muscicapidce, * were to be met with. When I came to consider, the reason was obvious enough ; for the hard-billed birds subsist on seeds which are easily carried on board, while the soft-billed birds, which are supported by worms and insects, or, what is a succedaneum for them, fresh raw meat, can meet with neither in long and tedious voyages. It is from this defect of food that our collections (curious as they are) are defective, and we are deprived of some of the most delicate and lively genera.

     Scopoli's new work* (which I have just procured) has its merits, in ascertaining many of the birds of the Tyrol and Carniola. Monographers, come from whence they may, have, I think, fair pretence to challenge some regard and approbation from the lovers of natural history ; for, as no man can alone investigate all the works of nature, these partial writers may, each in his department, be more accurate in their discoveries, and freer from errors, than more general writers, and so by degrees may pave the way to an universal correct natural history. Not that Scopoli is so circumstantial and attentive to the life and conversation of his birds as I could wish : he advances some false facts ; as when he says of the hirundo urbicciy that "pullos extra nidum non nutrit" This assertion I know to be wrong, from repeated observation this summer ; for house-martens do feed their young flying, though, it must be acknowledged, not so commonly as the house-swallow : and the feat is done in so quick a manner as not to be perceptible to indifferent observers. He also advances some (I was going to say) improbable facts ; as when he says of the woodcock that "pullos rostro portal fugiens ab hoste." But candour forbids me to say absolutely that any fact is false, because I have never been witness to such a fact. I have only to remark, that the long unwieldy bill of the woodcock is perhaps the worst adapted of any among the winged creation for such a feat of natural affection.

     The Anni of Scopoli are now in my possession ; and I have read the Annus Primus with satisfaction ; for, though some parts of this work are exceptionable, and he may advance some mistaken observations, yet the ornithology of so distant a country as Carniola is very curious.

Every kingdom, every province, should have its own monographer.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_18190">
     The reason, perhaps, why he mentions nothing of Ray's Ornithology ', may be the extreme poverty and distance of his country, into which the works of our great naturalists may have never yet found their way. You have doubts, I know, whether this Ornithology is genuine, and really the work of Scopoli : as to myself, I think I discover strong tokens of authenticity ; the style corresponds with that of his Entomo- logy; and his characters of his Ordines and Genera are many of them new, expressive, and masterly.

     Ray remarks, that birds of the galince order, as cocks and hens, partridges and pheasants, &amp;c. are pulveratrices, such as dust themselves, using that method of cleansing their feathers, and ridding themselves of their vermin. As far as I can observe, many birds that dust themselves never wash ; and I once thought that those birds that wash themselves would never dust : but here I find myself mistaken ; for common house-sparrows are great pulveratrices, being frequently seen grovelling and wallowing in dusty roads ; and yet they are great washers.

In the autumn of 1821, a large flock of crossbills was discovered feeding in a grove of firs. " After watching them for some time," says a narrator, " with a gun, I procured fifteen specimens, out of which only two were in full feather, the breasts and backs of the others being nearly bare.

The dipper begins to pour forth its strong, distinct, and varied notes in the beginning of spring, and is the earliest warbler of the remote situations where it usually localizes. Montagu says, " This bird is amongst the few that sing so early in the spring as the months of January and February. In hard frost, on the 11th of the latter month, when the thermometer in the morning had been at twenty- six degrees, we heard this bird sing incessantly in a strong and elegant manner, and with much variation in notes, many of which were peculiar to itself, intermixed with a little of the piping of the woodlark. At the time it was singing, the day was bright, but freezing in the shade ; the sun had considerably passed the meridian, and was obscured from the bird by the lofty surrounding hills. The dipper devours a considerable (juantity of fishes' spawn, especially the large ova of the salmon."

The nest was so well adapted to the surrounding materials, that nothing but the old bird flying in with a fish in its bittwould have led to a discovery. The young were nearly full feathered, but incapable of ilight ; and the moment the nest was disturbed, they fluttered out, and dropped into the water, and, to our astonishment, instantly vanished ; but, in a little time, made their appearance at some distance down the stream ; and it was with difficulty that two out of the five were taken, as they dived on being approached.

Milky plants, such as lettuces, dandelions, sow-thistles, are its favourite dish.

     DEAR SIR, After an ineffectual search in Linnaeus, Brisson, &amp;c. I begin to suspect that I discern my brother's hirundo kyberna in Scopoli's newly discovered hiriuido rupestris, p. 167. His description of " Supra murina, subtus albida ; rectrices macula ovali alba in later e interno ; pedes nudi, nigri; rostrum aigrum ; remiges obscurlores quam plumes dorsales ; rectrices remigibus concolores; cauda emarginatd nee for tip atd" agrees very well with the bird in question ; but, when he comes to advance that it is " statura hirundmis urbicce" and that " defi- nitio hirundinis riparice Linncei huic quoque convenit" he, in some measure, invalidates all he has said ; at least, he shews at once that he compares them to these species merely from memory ; for I have compared the birds themselves, and find they differ widely in every circumstance of shape, size, and colour. However, as you will have a specimen, I shall be glad to hear what your judgment is in the matter.

     DEAR SIR, I was much pleased to see, among the collection of birds from Gibraltar, some of those short-winged English summer birds of passage, concerning whose departure we have made so much inquiry. Now, if these birds are found in Andalusia to migrate to and from Barbary, it may easily be supposed that those that come to us may migrate back to the continent, and spend their winters in some of the warmer parts of Europe. This is certain, that many soft-billed birds that come to Gibraltar appear there only in spring and autumn, seeming to advance in pairs towards the northward, for the sake of breeding during the summer months, and retiring in parties and broods towards the south at the decline of the year ; so that the rock of Gibraltar is the great rendezvous and place of observation, from whence they take their departure each way towards Europe or Africa. It is therefore no mean discovery, I think, to find that our small short-winged summer birds of passage are to be seen, spring and autumn, on the very skirts of Europe ; it is a presumptive proof of their emigrations.

     Scopoli seems to me to have found the Mrundo melba, (the great Gibraltar swift,) in Tyrol, without knowing it. For what is his hirundo alpina, but the aforementioned bird in other words ?

They live with us all the spring and summer, and at the beginning of autumn prepare to take leave, by getting together in flocks. They seem to me a bird of passage that may travel into some dry hilly country south of us, probably Spain, because of the abundance of sheep-walks in that country ; for they spend their summers with us in such districts.

     hazard, as I never met with any one that has seen them in England in the winter. I believe they are not fond of going near the water, but feed on earth-worms, that are common on sheep-walks and downs. They breed on fallows and lay- fields abounding with grey mossy flints, which much resemble their young in colour, among which they skulk and conceal themselves. They make no nest, but lay their eggs on the bare ground, producing in common but two at a time. There is reason to think their young run soon after they are hatched, and that the old ones do not feed them, but only lead them about at the time of feeding, which, for the most part, is in the night." Thus far my friend.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_19030">

     * The bustard is the largest of British birds ; but we fear it is now nearly, if not entirely, extinct in this country. Some years ago, a pair of these, male and female, were kept in a garden at Norwich infirmary. The male was an extremely majestic bird, and possessed of much courage, for he feared nothing, seizing any one who approached near him by the coat. The female, on the contrary, was shy and timid. It was, however, remarkable that the male bird, on discovering even a small hawk, however high in the air, squatted down on the ground, exhibiting strong marks of fear. In 1804, a fine bustard was shot, and taken to Plymouth market, where it was purchased by a publican for a shilling, its value being unknown, whereas it would have brought three or four pounds in the London market. So completely lost was this rare wanderer, that it was rejected at the second table, in consequence of the pectoral muscles differing in colour from the other parts of the breast, which is not unusual in birds of the grouse kind. Some country gentlemen arriving at the inn the following evening, and hearing of the circumstance, desired that the princely bird might be introduced, and partook of it cold at their repast. ED.

     There are, doubtless, many home internal migrations within this kingdom that want to be better understood ; witness those vast flocks of hen chaffinches that appear with us in the winter without hardly any cocks among them. * Now, were there a due proportion of each sex, it would seem very improbable that any one district should produce such numbers of these little birds, and much more when only one half of the species appears ; therefore, we may conclude, that ihefringillce ccelebes, for some good purposes, have a peculiar migration of their own, in which the sexes part. Nor should it seem so wonderful that the intercourse of sexes in this species of birds should be interrupted in winter ; since, in many animals, and particularly in bucks and does, the sexes herd separately, except at the season when commerce is necessary for the continuance of the breed. For this matter of the chaffinches, see Fauna Suecica, p. 85, and Sy sterna Naturce, p. 318. I see every winter vast flights of hen chaffinches, but none of cocks.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_19220">
     Your method of accounting for the periodical motions of the British singing birds, or birds of flight, is a very probable one, since the matter of food is a great regulator of the actions and proceedings of the brute creation : there is but one that can be set in competition with it, and that is love. But I cannot quite acquiesce with you in one circumstance, when you advance that, " When they have thus feasted, they again separate into small parties of five or six, and get the best fare they can within a certain district, having no inducement to go in quest of fresh-turned earth." Now, if you mean that the business of congregating is quite at an end from the conclusion of wheat-sowing, to the season of barley and oats, it is not the case with us ; for larks and chaffinches, and particularly linnets, flock and congregate as much in the very dead of winter as when the husbandman is busy with his ploughs and harrows.

     Fieldfares visit us in October, and leave us again about the beginning of April. Their principal food in this country is the fruit of the haw- thorn, and other berries, worms, and insects. " Perfectly gregarious as the fieldfare is," says Knapp, " yet we observe every year, in some tall

     the hens are forward with egg, I myself, when I was a sports- man, have often experienced. It cannot indeed be denied, but that now and then we hear of a woodcock's nest, or young- hedgerow, or little quiet pasture, two or three of them, that have with- drawn from the main flocks, and there associate with the blackbird and the thrush."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_19340">
     The woodcocks arrive in Great Britain in flocks ; some of them in October, but not in great numbers till November and December. They generally take advantage of the night, being seldom seen to come before sunset.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_19360">
     The time of their arrival depends considerably on the prevailing winds ; for adverse gales always detain them, they not being able to struggle with the boisterous squalls of the Northern Ocean. The greater part of them leave this country about the latter end of February, or beginning of March, always pairing before they set out. They retire to the coast, and, if the wind be fair, set out immediately ; but, if contrary, they are often detained in the neighbouring woods and thickets for some time. So well skilled are these birds in atmospherical changes, that the instant a fail- wind springs up, they seize the opportunity ; and where the sportsman has seen hundreds in one day, he will not find even a single bird the next.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_19380">
     At the Landsend, Cornwall, every fisherman and peasant can tell, from the temperature of the air, the week, if not the day, on which the wood- cocks will arrive on the coast. They come in prodigious flocks, which reach the shore at the same time, and from their state of exhaustion, induced by their long flight, they are easily knocked down, or caught by dogs. A short respite soon invigorates them, so that they are enabled to pursue their inland course, but till thus recruited they are an easy prey, and produce no small profit to those who live in the neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_19400">
     Mr Warner informs us, that " We were told at Truro, as a proof of the definitive time of their arrival, that a gentleman then had sent to the Landsend for several brace, to be forwarded to him for a particular occasion. This correspondent acquainted him in answer, that no wood- cocks had yet arrived ; but that, on the third day from his writing, if the weather continued as it then was, there would be plenty. The state of the atmosphere remained unchanged, the visitors came as it was asserted they would, and the gentleman received the number of birds he had ordered."

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_19420">
     It seems quite certain that the migratory birds usually return to their former haunts. The following well authenticated circumstance is related by Bewick, on the authority of Sir John Trevelyan, Bart. " In the winter of 1797," says he, " the gamekeeper of E. M. Pleydell, Esq. of Watcombe, in Dorsetshire, brought him a woodcock, alive and unhurt, which he had caught in a net set for rabbits. Mr Pleydell scratched the name upon a bit of thin brass, bent it round the woodcock's leg, and let it fly. In December, the next year, Mr Pleydell shot this bird, with the brass about its leg, in the same wood where it had been first caught." We caught a swallow, which built in the corner of a window, tied a silk thread about one of its limbs, and set it at liberty. Next year the same corner was taken possession of by a pair of swallows. We caught them, and found that one had still round its limb the piece of thread which we had tied on the preceding year, ED.

     birds, discovered in some part or other of this island ; * but then they are always mentioned as rarities, and somewhat out of the common course of things ; but as to redwings and field- fares, no sportsman or naturalist has ever yet, that I could hear, pretended to have found the nest or young of those species in any part of these kingdoms, And I the more admire at this instance as extraordinary, since, to all appearance, the same food in summer, as well as in winter, might support them here which maintains their congeners, the blackbirds and thrushes, did they choose to stay the summer through. From hence it appears, that it is not food alone which determines some species of birds with regard to their stay or departure. Fieldfares and redwings disappear sooner or later, according as the warm weather comes on earlier or later ; for I well remem- ber, after that dreadful winter, 1739-40, that cold northeast winds continued to blow on through April and May, and that these kinds of birds (what few remained of them) did not depart as usual, but were seen lingering about till the beginning of June. The best authority that we can have for the nidification of the birds above mentioned, in any district, is the testimony of faunists that have written professedly the natural history of particular countries. Now, as to the fieldfare, Linnaeus, in his Fauna Suecica, says of it, that " maximis in arboribus nidi- ficat ;" and of the redwing, he says in the same place, that " nidificat in mediis arbusculis, sive sepibus ; ova sex cceruleo- viridia masculis nigris variis." Hence we may be assured that fieldfares and redwings breed in Sweden. Scopoli says, in his Annus Primus, of the woodcock, that, " nupta ad nos venit circa cequinoctium vernale" meaning in Tyrol, of which he is a native. And afterwards, he adds, " nidificat in paludibus alpinis : ova ponit 3 5." It does not appear from Kramer that wood- cocks breed at all in Austria ; but he says, " Avis hcec septen- trionalium provinciarum csstivo tempore incola est ; ubi plerumque nidificat.

     DEAR SIR, You are, I know, no great friend to migration ; and the well-attested accounts from various parts of the king- dom seem to justify you in your suspicions, that at least many of the swallow kind do not leave us in the winter, but lay themselves up, like insects and bats, in a torpid state, and slumber away the more uncomfortable months, till the return of the sun and fine weather awakens them.

     We are told by Wilson, that the swallows of America are also migra- tory, " arriving in Pennsylvania late in April, or early in May ; dispersing themselves over the whole country, wherever there are vacant chimneys, in summer, sufficiently high and convenient for their accommodation. In no other situation, with us, are they observed at present to build. This circumstance naturally suggests the query, Where did these birds construct their nests before the arrival of Europeans in this country, when there were no such places for their accommodation ? I would answer, Probably in the same situations in which they still continue to build in the remote regions of our western forests, where European improvements of this kind are scarcely to be found, namely, in the hollow of a tree, which, in some cases, has the nearest resemblance to their present choice, of any other. One of the first settlers in the state of Kentucky informed me, that he cut down a large hollow beech tree, which contained forty or fifty nests of the chimney swallow, most of which, by the fall of the tree, or by the weather, were lying at the bottom of the hollow ; but sufficient fragments remained, adhering to the sides of the tree, to enable him to number them. They appeared, he said, to be of many years' standing. "

     Dr Richardson says, " In the fur countries, where the habitations of man are few and far between, the barn-swallow inhabits caves, parti- cularly in the limestone rocks ; and it frequents the out-houses of all the trading ports. When Fort Franklin was erected on the shores of the Great Bear Lake, in the autumn of 1825, we found many of the nests in the ruins of a house that had been abandoned for more than ten years." In that northern latitude they arrive about the 15th of May, and take their departure early in August. Swallows were noticed by Dr Richard- son at Fort Good Hope in latitude sixty-seven and a half degrees, the most northerly post in America. ED.

It is not uncommon in the south of France, Italy, Germany, and Sweden, but abounds in the southern Russian provinces bordering on the Don and Wolga. It is gregarious and migratory, leaving its summer quarters for more southern latitudes in autumn. This bird has been frequently taken in Britain, but was not noticed tillJuly, 1794, when one was shot at Mattishall, county of Norfolk.

     DEAR SIR, There is an insect with us, especially on chalky districts, which is very troublesome and teasing all the latter end of the summer, getting into people's skins, especially those of women and children, and raising tumours, which itch intol- erably. This animal (which we call an harvest bug) is very minute, scarce discernible to the naked eye, of a bright scarlet colour, and of the genus of acarus.* They are to be met with in gardens, on kidney beans, or any legumens, but prevail only in the hot months of summer. Warreners, as some have assured me, are much infested by them on chalky downs, where these insects swarm sometimes to so infinite a degree as to discolour their nets, and to give them a reddish cast ; while the men are so bitten as to be thrown into fevers.

     * This is the acarus autumnalis, or harvest bug, which is one of the most teasing little insects in nature. Though bred to live on vegetable substances, such as French beans, currants, raspberries, and other fruits, yet it deserts these, whether by accident or design, to live on, and among, the most sensitive portions of the human race. These insects are so minute, that they are hardly visible to the naked eye, and that only when they are placed on a smooth, white surface: they are best known by their effects. Females and children are most liable to their attacks, and chiefly where any part of the dress fits closely to the skin : there they seat themselves, at the intersection of the lines, and lay such firm hold with their feet and jaw, that they cannot be displaced by rubbing, or by washing, unless a powerful spirit is used. The point of a fine needle is best calculated for removing them, while the person so employed must use a magnifying glass, to enabb him to do so. They lacerate the skin in some way or other, and cause extreme itching, and considerable inflammation, which surrounds small vesicles, filled with a semi-trans- parent fluid. These animals have a fastidious taste, for there are some individuals whom they will not attack. Of two persons, for instance, who had been together, during a day's nutting in the woods, and who afterwards slept in the same bed-chamber, one of them was entirely covered with red blotches, from the attack of the bug, while the other was quite untouched.

     * The hatica nemorum of Illiger, and the root weevil (nedigus contractus^) of Stephens, are both formidable depredators, in turnip and other crops. The former of these is that probably meant by White. The caterpillar of another species of the genus athalia, is no less destructive. Marshall records an instance, in the Philosophical Transactions, of many thousand acres, which had to be ploughed up, in consequence of the devastations caused by these insects. The Norfolk farmers think they come from beyond the sea, and one even averred, that he saw them arrive in clouds, so as to darken the air; while the fishermen reported, that they had repeatedly witnessed flights of them pass over their heads, when they were at a distance from the shore. So numerous were they upon the beach and cliffs, and lay in such heaps, that they might have been taken up with shovels. Three miles inland, they were found congregated like swarms of bees.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_20880">
     The maggots or larvae of the blow-flies are an equally destructive race to animal matter. Linnaeus says, the musca vomitaria will devour the carcass of a horse as quickly as a lion would do. And this is not at all improbable, when we know, that a species nearly allied to this (the musca carnaria) produces not fewer than twenty thousand at a time ; and that they have been proved by Redi to increase in weight two hundred fold within the short space of twenty-four hours. One of the most extraor- dinary circumstances connected with the destructive powers of maggots, and of their attacking the human frame, is recorded in Bell's Weekly Messenger. " On the 25th June, 1829, died at Asbornby, Lincoln- shire, John Page, a pauper, belonging to Little Willoughby, under circumstances truly singular. He being of a restless disposition, and not choosing to stay in the parish workhouse, was in the habit of strolling about the neighbouring villages, subsisting on the pittance obtained from door to door ; the support he usually received from the benevolent was bread and meat ; and after satisfying the cravings of nature, it was his custom to deposit the surplus provisions, particularly the meat, betwixt his shirt and skin. Having a considerable portion of this provision in store, so deposited, he was taken rather unwell, and laid himself down in a field, in the parish of Scredington ; when, from the heat of the season at that time, the meat speedily became putrid, and was of course struck by the flies : these not only proceeded to devour the inanimate pieces of flesh, but also literally to prey upon the living substance ; and when the wretched man was accidentally found by some of the inhabitants,

     There is an oestrus, known in these parts to every plough- boy, which, because it is omitted by Linnaeus, is also passed over by late writers ; and that is the curvicauda of old Moufet, mentioned by Derham, in his Physico -Theology, p. 250 : an insect worthy of remark, for depositing its eggs, as it flies, in so dexterous a manner on the single hairs of the legs and flanks of grass horses. But then, Derham is mistaken when he advances that this oestrus is the parent of that wonderful star-tailed maggot which he mentions afterwards; for more modern entomologists have discovered that singular production to be derived from the egg of the musca chamceleon.

     A full history of noxious insects, hurtful in the field, garden, and house, suggesting all the known and likely means of destroying them, would be allowed by the public to be a most useful and important work. What knowledge there is of this sort lies scattered, and wants to be collected : great improve- ments would soon follow, of course. A knowledge of the properties, economy, propagation, and, in short, of the life and conversation, of these animals, is a necessary step to lead us to some method of preventing their depredations.

     he was so eaten by the maggots, that his death seemed inevitable. After clearing away, as well as they were able, these shocking vermin, those who found courage conveyed him to Asbornby, and a surgeon was immediately procured, who declared that his body was in such a state, that dressing it must be little short of instantaneous death : and, in fact, the man did survive the operation but a few hours. When first found, and again when examined by the surgeon, he presented a sight loath- some in the extreme ; white maggots of enormous size were crawling in and upon his body, which they had most shockingly mangled, and the removing of the external ones served only to render the sight more horrid."

     DEAR SIR, Happening to make a visit to my neighbour's peacocks, I could not help observing, that the trains of those magnificent birds appear by no means to be their tails, those long feathers growing not from their uropygtum, but all up their backs. A range of short, brown, stift' feathers, about six inches long, fixed in the uropygium, is the real tail, and serves as the fulcrum to prop the train, which is long and top-heavy, when set on end. When the train is up, nothing appears of the bird before, but its head and neck ; but this would not be the case, were these long feathers fixed only in the rump, as may be seen by the turkey cock, when in a strutting attitude.* By a strong muscular vibration, these birds can make the shafts of their long feathers clatter like the swords of a sword- dancer ; they then trample very quick with their feet, and run backwards towards the females.

Lady Tynte had a favourite peahen, which at eight several times produced chicks. Having moulted when eleven years old, the lady and her family were astonished by her displaying the feathers peculiar to the other sex, and appearing like a pied peacock. In the process the tail, which was like that of the cock, first appeared. In the following year she moulted again and produced similar feathers ; in the third year she did the same, and then had also spurs resembling those of the cock. The hen never bred after this change of plumage. ED.

He heard two hooting to each other, the one in A flat, and the other in B flat. Query : Do these different notes proceed from different species, or only from various individuals ? The same person finds, upon trial, that the note of the cuckoo (of which we have but one species) varies in different individuals ; for, about Selborne wood, he found they were mostly in D ; he heard two sing together, the one in D, and the other in D sharp, which made a disagreeable concert ; he afterwards heard one in D sharp, and about Wolmer Forest, some in C. As to nightingales, he says, that their notes are so short, and their transitions so rapid, that he cannot well ascertain their key.

     As I have often remarked that redwings are some of the first birds that suffer with us in severe weather, it is no wonder at all that they retreat from Scandinavian winters ; and much more the ordo of grallce, who all, to a bird, forsake the northern parts of Europe at the approach of winter. * " Grallcs tanquam conjurattB unanimiter in fugam se conjiciunt ; ne earum unlearn quidem inter nos habitantem invenire possimus ; ut enim testate in australibus degere nequeunt ob defectum lumbricorum, terramque siccam ; ita nee infrigidis ob eandem causam" says Ekmarkthe Swede, in his ingenious little treatise called Migrationes Avium, which by all means you ought to read, while your thoughts run on the subject of migration.

     Birds may be so circumstanced as to be obliged to migrate in one country, and not in another; but the grallce (which procure their food from marshes and boggy ground) must, in winter, forsake the more northerly parts of Europe, or perish for want of food.

     * In the very severe winter of 1799, immense flocks of redwings resorted to the west of England, where a sudden fall of snow, unusually deep in that quarter, cut off these poor birds from all supply of food ; and being reduced to too great weakness to attempt a passage over the ocean to some more congenial climate, thousands of them, as well as fieldfares, were starved to death.

     * The woodcock is found in all parts of the old Continent, from north to south. In some places, it is said to remain the whole year, only changing its haunts, in the breeding season, from the plains to the mountainous districts. The habits of all the woodcocks hitherto dis- covered only two or three in number are alike : they are observed to make partial migrations from north to south during the breeding season. The woodcock is among the few winter birds that occasionally breed in Britain. Besides what we have mentioned at page 106, young birds have been killed in August, and eggs found in June. In the year 1795, the Rev. Mr Wheatear, of Hastings, found a nest, with four eggs, in a wood near Battle, in Sussex. In 1802, Mr Foljamb possessed a specimen of a half fledged bird, taken in Broodsworth Wood, near Doncaster ; and, in 1805, a brood of four were hatched in a wood at Shucoaks, near Worksop. The nest from which these last were taken, consisted of moss, bent, and dry leaves. On the 19th May, 1828, James Smith, keeper to John Chetwood, Esq. of Ansley, near Naneaton, shot two young wood- cocks in a wood called Hore Park, in that neighbourhood ; and, on the following day, an old bird was shot by Smith, at the same spot. The young ones are said to have been dry and bad when brought to table, but the old bird was excellent. John Wigson, woodman to W. Dilke, Esq. discovered a woodcock sitting on four eggs, in Regton Wood, near Coventry, in the beginning of May, 1829. From some cause, however, the nest was deserted, and several of the eggs destroyed. On breaking one that remained, it was found to be nearly ready to hatch ; a fact proving that the adults must have commenced the business of nidification about the beginning of April, which is earlier than many individuals of this species leave Britain for northern climates ; thus affording pretty strong evidence in favour of woodcocks pairing previous to their departure. On the 8th August, 1828, a woodcock was shot in Florida demesne, county of Down, Ireland, which must have remained through the summer. ED.

     DEAR SIR, The summer through, I have seen but two of that large species of bat which I call vespertilio altivolans, from its manner of feeding high in the air. I procured one of them, and found it to be a male, and made no doubt, as they accompanied together, that the other was a female ; but, happening in an evening or two to procure the other likewise, I was somewhat disappointed when it appeared to be also of the same sex. This circumstance, and the great scarcity of this sort, at least in these parts, occasions some suspicions in my mind whether it is really a species, or whether it may not be the male part of the more known species, one of which may supply many females, as is known to be the case in sheep, and some other quadrupeds. But this doubt can only be cleared by a farther examination, and some attention to the sex, of more specimens. All that I know at present is, that rny two were amply furnished with the parts of generation, much resembling those of a boar.

     In the extent of their wings, they measured fourteen inches and an half, and four inches and an half from the nose to the tip of the tail : their heads were large, their nostrils bilobated, their shoulders broad and muscular, and their whole bodies fleshy and plump.

I had two sorts of them brought to me, nearly similar in shape, but one very considerably larger than the other. This latter is probably the vespertilio altivolans, mentioned by Mr White, in his Natural History of Selborne, answering to his description of it. It measured nearly fifteen inches from the tip of one wing to that of the other. These larger bats were quite as numerous as the smaller species. A great number of them were also found in an old building in Combe Wood, adjoining Rich- mond Park ; and, subsequently, ten of them were discovered in a decayed tree in that park." This is pretty strong evidence against the migration of the bat in question. Several of these were sent by Mr Jesse to the Zoological Societies of London.

     Bats are possessed of a sense with which we are yet unacquainted, that of avoiding objects in the dark. Spallanzani hung up some cloths across a room, with holes cut in them at various distances, large enough to allow a bat to fly through. He deprived the poor animals of light, and stopt their hearing as much as possible. These animals on being turned loose, flew through the perforations with as much correctness as if they had had the use of their eyes.

     Respecting the hybernation of the bat, the following fact is very curious : " In the beginning of November, 1821, a woodman engaged in splitting timber for rails in the woods close to the lake at Haining, a seat of Mr Pringle in Selkirkshire, discovered in the centre of a large wild cherry tree, a living bat, of a bright scarlet colour, which, as soon as it was relieved from its entombment, took to its wings and escaped. In the tree there was a recess sufficiently large to contain the animal ; but all around the wood was perfectly sound, solid, and free from any fissure through which the atmosphere could reach the animal. A man employed in the same manner at Kelsall, in December, 1826, met with a similar phenomenon, and allowed the bat to escape, under the influence of fear, protesting that it was not a ' being of this world.

If it takes any part of its prey with its foot, as I have now the greatest reason to suppose it does these chaffers, I no longer wonder at the use of its middle toe, which is curiously furnished with a serrated claw. *

     admiring at these congregations, and wishing that it was in my power to account for those appearances, almost peculiar to the season. The two great motives which regulate the proceedings of the brute creation, are love and hunger : the former incites animals to perpetuate their kind, the latter induces them to preserve individuals. Whether either of these should seem to be the ruling passion, in the matter of congregating, is to be considered. As to love, that is out of the question, at a time of the year when that soft passion is not indulged ; besides, during the amorous season, such a jealousy prevails between the male birds, that they can hardly bear to be together in the same hedge or field. Most of the singing and elation of spirits of that time, seem to me to be the effect of rivalry and emulation ; and it is to this spirit of jealousy, that I chiefly attribute the equal dispersion of birds in the spring, over the face of the country.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_22030">
     Now as to the business of food. As these animals are actuated by instinct to hunt for necessary food, they should not, one would suppose, crowd together in pursuit of suste- nance, at a time when it is most likely to fail ; yet such associations do take place in hard weather chiefly, and thicken as the severity increases. As some kind of self-interest and self-defence is, no doubt, the motive for the proceeding, may it not arise from the helplessness of their state in such rigorous seasons, as men crowd together, when under great calamities, though they know not why? Perhaps approximation may dispel some degree of cold ; and a crowd may make each individual appear safer from the ravages of birds of prey, and other dangers.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_22050">
     If I admire when I see how much congenerous birds love to congregate, I am the more struck when I see incongruous ones in such strict amity.* If we do not much wonder to see a flock of rooks usually attended by a train of daws, yet it is strange that the former should so frequently have a flight of starlings for their satellites, Is it because rooks have a more

Anatomists say that rooks, by reason of two large nerves which run down between the eyes into the upper mandible, have a more delicate feeling in their beaks than other round-billed birds, and can grope for their meat when out of sight. Perhaps, then, their associates attend them on the motive of interest, as greyhounds wait on the motions of their finders, and as lions are said to do on the yelp- ings of jackals.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_22170">
     A correspondent, in the Magazine of Natural History, proves that the rook is occasionally a predatory bird. He says, " As I was passing through Chandos Street, Cavendish Square, London, soon after six o'clock this morning, my attention was attracted to a rook flying low, near the walls of some out-buildings, in which were many holes occupied by sparrows' nests. He directed his flight to one of these holes, into which he thrust himself as far as possible. It was evident that he was attempting to reach something with his bill ; but apparently he did not succeed, for he shortly withdrew himself from this hole, and flew to another, into which he intruded himself in the same manner. From this second hole he retired almost immediately, bearing in his beak one of the callow brood. He flew with his spoil to a high chimney at the corner house, followed for a short distance by ten or twelve sparrows, clamouring loudly at such an atrocious robbery ; and one sparrow, probably the parent, ventured to pursue even to the chimney-top, as if determined to assail the fell destroyer ; but both the rook and the sparrow quickly disappeared behind the chimney-pot, and prevented my farther observation.

     The starlings also congregate in autumn. We saw a flight of these birds in the autumn of 1814, in Kings County, Ireland, which liter- ally darkened the air, and must have consisted of at least a hundred thousand ; they were flying near the immense marshy plain near Banachee, through which the Shannon flows. " In the autumnal and hyemal months," says Selby, " these birds gather in immense flocks, and are particularly abundant in the fenny parts of Nottinghamshire and Lin- colnshire, where they roost among the reeds. Before they retire to rest, they perform various manoeuvres in the air, the whole frequently describing rapid revolutions round a common centre. This peculiar flight will sometimes continue for nearly half an hour before they become finally settled for the night. Upon the approach of spring they spread them- selves over the whole country."

     DEAR SIR, As a gentleman and myself were walking, on the 4th of last November, round the sea-banks at Newha^en, near the mouth of the Lewes river, in pursuit of natural knowledge, we were surprised to see three house swallows gliding very swiftly by us. That morning was rather chilly, with the wind at north-west ; but the tenor of the weather, for some time before, had been delicate, and the noons remarkably warm. From this incident, and from repeated accounts which I meet with, I am more and more induced to believe, that many of the swallow kind do not depart from this island, but lay themselves up in holes and caverns, and do, insect-like, and bat-like, come forth at mild times, and then retire again to their latebrce. Nor make I the least doubt but that, if I lived at Newhaven, Seaford, Brighthelmstone, or any of those towns near the chalk cliffs of the Sussex coast, by proper observations, I should see swallows stirring at periods of the winter, when the noons were soft and inviting, and the sun warm and invi- gorating. And I am the more of this opinion, from what I have remarked during some of our late springs, and though some swallows did make their appearance about the usual time, viz. the 13th or 14th of April, yet, meeting with a harsh reception, and blustering, cold, north-east winds, they imme- diately withdrew, absconding for several days, till the weather gave them better encouragement.

     DEAR SIR, While I was in Sussex last autumn, my resi- dence was at the village near Lewes, from whence I had formerly the pleasure of writing to you. On the 1st of November, I remarked that the old tortoise, formerly men- tioned, began first to dig the ground, in order to the forming of its hybernaculum, which it had fixed on just beside a great turf of hepaticas. It scrapes out the ground with its fore feet, and throws it up over its back with its hind ; but the

     motion of its legs is ridiculously slow, little exceeding the hour hand of a clock, and suitable to the composure of an animal said to be a whole month in performing one feat of copulation. Nothing can be more assiduous than this creature night and day in scooping the earth, and forcing its great body into the cavity ; but, as the noons of that season proved unu- sually warm and sunny, it was continually interrupted, and called forth, by the heat in the middle of the day ; and, though I continued there till the 13th of November, yet the work remained unfinished. Harsher weather, and frosty mornings, would have quickened its operations.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_22470">
     No part of its behaviour ever struck me more than the extreme timidity it always expresses with regard to rain ; for though it has a shell that would secure it against the wheel of a loaded cart, yet does it discover as much solicitude about rain as a lady dressed in all her best attire, shuffling away on the first sprinklings, and running its head up in a corner. If attended to, it becomes an excellent weather-glass ; for as sure as it walks elate, and as it w r ere on tiptoe, feeding with great earnest- ness in a morning, so sure will it rain before night. It is totally a diurnal animal, and never pretends to stir after it becomes dark. The tortoise, like other reptiles, has an arbitrary stomach, as well as lungs ; and "can refrain from eating as well as breathing for a great part of the year. When first awakened it eats nothing ; nor again in the autumn, before it retires ; through the height of the summer, it feeds voraciously, devouring all the food that comes in its way. I was much taken with its sagacity in discerning those that do it kind offices ; for, as soon as the good old lady comes in sight who has waited on it for more than thirty years, it hobbles towards its benefactress with awkward alacrity ; but remains inattentive to strangers. Thus not only " the ox krroweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib,"* but the most abject reptile and torpid of beings distinguishes the hand that feeds it, and is touched with the feelings of gratitude.

     DEAR SIR, By my journal for last autumn, it appears that tne house-martens bred very late, and staid very late in these parts ; for, on the 1st of October, I saw young martens in their nests, nearly fledged ; and again, on the 21st of October, we had, at the next house, a nest full of young martens just ready to fly, and the old ones were hawking for insects with great alertness. The next morning, the brood forsook their nest, and were flying round the village. From this day, I never saw one of the swallow kind till November the 3d ; when twenty, or perhaps thirty, house-martens were playing all day long by the side of the Hanging Wood, and over my fields. Did these small weak birds, some of which were nestlings twelve days ago, shift their quarters at this late season of the year, to the other side of the northern tropic ? Or rather, is it not more probable, that the next church, ruin, chalk-cliff, steep covert, or perhaps sand-bank, lake, or pool, (as a more northern naturalist would say,) may become their hybernaculum, and afford them a ready and obvious retreat ? *

     attending this is, that the animal did not exhibit the least signs of decomposition, nor was animation perceptible. It is, however, quite evident it was alive, otherwise putridity would have ensued.

At one time, we were detached, at Holy Island, coast of Northumberland, in command of the castle. A pair of martens built in a hole over the window of our apart- ment. We were generally disturbed at the early dawn by these birds feeding their young. We had the curiosity to take all the young, four in number, out of the nest for examination. We found them in full feather, although they had never yet attempted to leave their nest. After having satisfied our curiosity, we were preparing to replace them in their nest, when the one we had just taken m our hand for that purpose took to its wings, and was immediately followed by the others. These little birds, accompanied by their parents, disported in the sun for upwards of two hours over the deep valley beneath our windows. They returned to the nest in the afternoon, and left it early next morning, never to return. The parents, on the following day, commenced anew the business of incubation. - ED.

     We now begin to expect our vernal migration of ringousels every week. Persons worthy of credit assure me, that ring- ousels were seen at Christmas, 1770, in the forest of Bere, on the southern verge of this county. Hence we may conclude, that their migrations are only internal, and not extended to the continent southward, if they do at first come at all from the northern parts of this island only, and not from the north of Europe. Come from whence they will, it is plain, from the fearless disregard that they shew for men or guns, that they have been little accustomed to places of much resort. Navi- gators mention, that, in the Isle of Ascension, and other such desolate districts, birds are so little acquainted with the human form, that they settle on men's shoulders, and have no more dread of a sailor than they would have of a goat that ,,was grazing. A young man at Lewes, in Sussex, assured me, that, about seven years ago, ringousels abounded so about that town in the autumn, that he killed sixteen himself in one afternoon : he added farther, that some had appeared since in: every autumn ; but he could not find that any had been observed before the season in which he shot so many. I myself have found these birds in little parties in the autumn, cantoned all along the Sussex downs, wherever there were shrubs and bushes, from Chichester to Lewes ; particularly in the autumn of 1770.

     DEAR SIR, The more I reflect on the tfrogyij of animals, the more I am astonished at its effects. Nor is the violence of this affection more wonderful than the shortness of its duration. Thus, every hen is in her turn the virago of the yard, in proportion to the helplessness of her brood ; and will fly in the face of a dog or a sow in defence of those chickens, which, in a few weeks, she will drive before her with relentless cruelty.*

     This affection sublimes the passions, quickens the invention, and sharpens the sagacity of the brute creation. Thus a hen, just become a mother, is no longer that placid bird she used to be ; but, with feathers standing on end, wings hovering, and clucking note, she runs about like one possessed. Dams will throw themselves in the way of the greatest danger in order to avert it from their progeny. Thus a partridge will tumble along before a sportsman, in order to draw away the dogs from her helpless covey. In the time of nidification, the most feeble birds will assault the most rapacious.

For some time his going was delayed, and he therefore directed that the wagon should be placed in a shed in his yard, packed as it was, till it should be convenient for him to send it off. While it was in the shed, a pair of robins built their nest among some straw in the wagon, and had hatched their young just before it was sent away. One of the old birds, instead of being frightened away by the motion of the wagon, enly left its nest from time to time for the purpose of flying to the nearest hedge for food for its young ; and thus, alternately affording warmth and nourish- ment to them, it arrived at Worthing. The affection of this bird having been observed by the wagoner, he took care in unloading not to disturb the robin's nest, and my readers will, I am sure, be glad to hear, that the robin and its young ones returned in safety to Walton Heath, being the place from whence they had set out.

     * A curious example of this was manifested by a wren in opposition to martens. Mr Simpson mentions, that, during his residence at Welton, North America, he one morning heard a loud noise from a pair of martens that were flying from tree to tree near his dwelling. They made several attempts to get into a box fixed against the house, which they had before occupied as a breeding place ; but they always appeared to fly from it again with the utmost dread, at the same time repeating their usual loud cries. Curiosity led the gentleman to watch their motions. After some time, a small wren came from the box, and perched on a tree near it, when her shrill notes seemed to amaze her antagonists. Having remained a short time, she flew away, when the martens took an opportunity of returning to the box, but their stay was of short duration; for their diminutive adversary returned, and made them retreat with the greatest precipitation. They continued maneuvering in this way the whole day ; but the following morning, on the wren quitting the box, the martens immediately returned, took possession of their mansion, broke up their own nest, went to work afresh with much diligence and ingenuity, and soon barricaded their door. The wren returned, but could not now re-eter. She made some bold efforts to storm the nest, but was unsuccessful. The martens abstained from food for nearly two

     exact observer has often remarked, that a pair of ravens, nesting in the rock of Gibraltar, would suffer no vulture or eagle to rest near their station, but would drive them from the hill with an amazing fury : even the blue thrush, at the season of breeding, would dart out from the clefts of the rocks to chase away the kestrel, or the sparrow-hawk. If you stand near the nest of a bird that has young, she will not be induced to betray them by an inadvertent fondness, but will wait about at a distance, with meat in her mouth, for an hour together.

     The fly-catcher of the Zoology (the stoparola of Ray) builds every year in the vines that grow on the walls of my house.* A pair of these little birds had one year inadvertently placed their nest on a naked bough, perhaps in a shady time, not being aware of the inconvenience that followed. But a hot sunny season coming on before the brood was half fledged, the reflection of the wall became insupportable, and must inevitably have destroyed the tender young, had not affection suggested an expedient, and prompted the parent birds to hover over the nest all the hotter hours, while, with wings expanded, and mouths gaping for breath, they screened off the heat from their suffering offspring.

     A farther instance I once saw of notable sagacity in a willow- wren, which had built in a bank in my fields. This bird a friend and myself had observed as she sat in her nest, but were particularly careful not to disturb her, though we saw she eyed us with some degree of jealousy. Some days after, as we passed that way, we were desirous of remarking how this brood went on ; but no nest could be found, till I happened to take up a large bundle of long green moss, as it were carelessly thrown over the nest, in order to dodge the eye of any imper- tinent intruder.

Swine, and sometimes the more gentle race of dogs and cats, are guilty of this horrid and preposterous murder.

     We have had, ever since I can remember, a pair of white owls that constantly breed under the eaves of this church. As I have paid good attention to the manner of life of these birds during their season of breeding, which lasts the summer through, the following remarks may not perhaps be unaccep- table. About an hour before sunset, (for then the mice begin to run,) they sally forth in quest of prey* and hunt all round the hedges of meadows and small enclosures for them, which seem to be their only food. In this irregular country, we can stand on an eminence and see them beat the fields over like a setting-dog, and often drop down in the grass or corn. I have minuted these birds with my watch for an hour together, and have found, that they return to their nest, the one or the other of them, about once in five minutes ; reflecting, at the same time, on the adroitness that every animal is possessed of, as far as regards the well-being of itself and offspring. ) But a piece of address, which they shew when they return loaded, should not, I think, be passed over in silence. As they take their prey with their claws, so they carry it in their claws to their nest ; but, as the feet are necessary in their ascent under the tiles, they constantly perch first on the roof of the chancel, and shift the mouse from their claws to their bill, that the feet may be at liberty to take hold of the plate on the wall, as they are rising under the eaves.

Its loud and full nocturnal cry, issuing from the gloomy recesses of the forest, bear some resemblance to the human voice, uttered in a hollow, sepulchral tone, and has been frequently productive of alarm to the traveller, of which an instance occurred within my own knowledge. A party of Scottish Highlanders, in the service of the Hudson's Bay Company, happened, in a winter journey, to encamp after nightfall in a dense clump of trees, whose dark tops and lofty stems, the growth of centuries, gave a solemnity to the scene that had strongly tended to excite the superstitious feelings of the Highlanders. The effect was heightened by the discovery of a tomb, which, with a natural taste often exhibited by the Indians, had been placed in this secluded spot. Our travellers, having finished their supper, were trimming their fire, preparatory to retiring to rest, when the slow and dismal notes of the horned owl fell on the ear with a startling nearness. None of them being acquainted with the sound, they at once concluded, that so unearthly a voice must be the moaning of the spirit of the departed, whose repose they supposed they had disturbed, by inadvertently making a fire of the wood of which the tomb had been constructed. They passed a tedious night of fear, and with the first dawn of day hastily quitted the ill-omened spot. " Audubon describes the cry of this owl as fearful. He says, " It suddenly alights on the top of a fern-stake or a dead stump, shakes its feathers, arranges them, and utters a shriek so horrid that the woods around echo to its dismal sound. Now, it seems as if you heard the barking of a cur-dog ; again, the notes are so rough and mingled together, that they might be mistaken for the last gurglings of a murdered person, striving in vain to call for assistance."

     When brown owls hoot, their throats swell as big as a hen's egg*. I have known an owl of this species live a full year without any water. Perhaps the case may be the same with all birds of prey.* When owis fly, they stretch out their legs behind them, as a balance to their large heavy heads ; for, as most nocturnal birds have large eyes and ears, they must have large heads to contain them. Large eyes, I pre- sume, are necessary to collect every ray of light, and large concave ears to command the smallest degree of sound or noise.

     The hirundmes are a most inoffensive, harmless, entertaining, social, and useful tribe of birds ; they touch no fruit in our gardens ; delight, all except one species, in attaching them- selves to our houses ; amuse us with their migrations, songs, and marvellous agility ; and clear our outlets from the annoy- ances of gnats and other troublesome insects. Some districts in the South Seas, near Guiaquil, are desolated, it seems, by the infinite swarms of venomous mosquitoes, which fill the air, and render those coasts insupportable. It would be worth inquiring, whether any species of hirundmes is found in these regions. Whoever contemplates the myriads of insects that sport in the sunbeams of a summer evening in this country, will soon be convinced to what a degree our atmosphere would be choked with them were it not for the friendly intercourse of the swallow tribe.

     * Predatory birds are endowed with the power of existing for a great length of time without food or water. In them, digestion seems to be carried on in a slow manner ; and very different from this function in most other birds, as it is extremely rapid in the smaller species. Vultures after feeding may be seen in one unvaried position, patiently waiting till the work of digestion is completed, and the stimulus of hunger is renewed. If violently disturbed after a full meal, they are quite incapable of flight, until they have disgorged the contents of their stomach. ED.

     | The wanton destruction of the swallow tribe is not only an act of great inhumanity, but also very impolitic, and can only be practised by persons who are defective either in the head or heart. The author of the Journal of a Naturalist expresses himself thus feelingly on the subject : " The sportsman's essaying his skill on the swallow race, that skim the dimpled pool,' or harmless glide along the flowery mead, when, if successful, he consigns whole nests of infant broods to famine and to death, is pitiable indeed ! No injury, no meditated crime, was ever imputed to these birds ; they free our dwelling from multitudes of insects; their unsuspicious confidence and familiarity with man merit

     Many species of birds have their peculiar lice ; but the hirundines alone seem to be annoyed with dipterous insects,* which infest every species, and are so large, in proportion to themselves, that they must be extremely irksome and injurious to them. These are the hippoboscce hirundines, with narrow subulated wings, abounding in every nest ; and are hatched by the warmth of the bird's own body during incubation, and crawl about under its feathers.

I supplicate from the youthful sportsman his considera- tion for these most useful creatures. The positive good they do, the beneficial services they perform for us, by clearing the air of innumer- able insects, ought to render them sacred, and secure them from our molestation. Without their friendly aid, the atmosphere we live in would scarcely be habitable by man. They feed entirely on insects, which, if not kept under by their means, would swarm and torment us like another Egyptian plague. The immense quantity of flies destroyed in a short space of time by one individual bird is scarcely to be credited by those who have not actual experience of the fact. I was once present when a swift was shot I may as well confess the truth I myself (then a thoughtless youth) the perpetrator of the deed : I acknowledge the fault in contrition, and will never be guilty of the like again. It was in the breeding season, when the young were hatched, at which time the parent birds, it is well known, are in the habit of making little excursions into the country, to a considerable distance from the breeding places, for the purpose of collecting flies, which they bring home to their infant progeny. On picking up my hopeless and ill-gotten prey, I observed a number of flies, some mutilated, others scarcely injured, crawling out of the bird's mouth ; the throat and pouch seemed absolutely stuffed with them, and an incredible number was at length disgorged. I am sure I speak \\athin compass when I state, that there was a mass of flies, just caught by this single swift, larger than, when pressed close, could conveniently be con-, tained in the bowl of an ordinary tablespoon ! Thus was a whole brood, of young birds deprived of one of their nursing parents, by an act of the most wanton cruelty. " ED.

So tormenting are these insects to swallows, that they sometimes render the poor animals quite stupid, and unfit for their aerial excursions.

The height at which he thus elegantly glides is various, from one hundred to one hundred and fifty, and two hundred feet, sometimes much higher, all the while calmly reconnoitring the face of the deep below. Suddenly he is seen to check his course, as if struck by a particular object, which he seems to survey for a few moments with such steadiness, that he appears fixed in air, flapping his wings. This object, however, he abandons, or rather the fish he had in his eye has disappeared, and he is again seen sailing around as before. Now his attention is again arrested, and he descends with great rapidity ; but ere he reaches the surface, shoots off on another course, as if ashamed that a second victim had escaped him. He now sails at a short height above the surface, and by a zigzag descent, and without seeming to dip his feet in the water, seizes a fish, which,

     after carrying a short distance, he probably drops, or yields up to the bald eagle, (J'alco leucocephalus,) and again ascends by easy spiral circles, to the higher regions of the air, where he glides about in all the ease and majesty of his species. At once, from this sublime aerial height, he descends like a perpendicular torrent, plunging into the sea with a loud rushing sound, and with the certainty of a rifle. In a few moments, he emerges, bearing in his claws his struggling prey, which he always carries head foremost ; and, having risen a few feet above the surface, shakes himself as a water spaniel would do, and directs his heavy and laborious course straightway to the land."

     Mr Lloyd mentions, that in Sweden, the eagle sometimes strikes so large a pike, and so firmly do his talons hold their grasp, that he is carried under water by the superior gravity of the pike, and drowned. Dr Mullenbog says, he himself saw an enormous pike with an eagle fixed to its back by his talons, lying dead on a piece of ground which had been overflowed by a river, and from which the water had subsided.

     This naturalist also gives an account of a conflict between an eagle and a pike, which a gentleman saw on the river Gotha, near Wenersborg. In this case, when the eagle first seized the pike, he soared a short distance into the air, but the weight and struggling of the fish together, soon obliged the eagle to descend. Both fell into the water and disappeared. Presently, however, the eagle again came to the surface, uttering the most piercing cries, and making apparently every endeavour to extricate his talons, but in vain ; and, after a violent struggle, was carried under water.

I have heard it imitate, in succes- sion, (intermixed with its own note of chur chur,) the swallow, the house-marten, the greenfinch, the chaffinch, and lesser redpole, the red- start, the willow-wren, the whinchat, the pied and spring wagtails ; yet its imitations are confined to the notes of alarm of these birds, and so exactly does it imitate them, both in tone and modulation, that, if it were to confine itself to one, (no matter which,) and not interlard the wailings of the little redpole and the shrieks of the marten, with the curses of the house-sparrow, and the twink twink of the chaffinch, and its' own care- for-nought chatter, the most practised ear would not detect the difference. After being silent for a while, it often begins with the chur chur of the sparrow, so exactly imitated, in every respect, that, were it not for what follows, no one would suppose it to be any other bird. It is called the mocking bird here, (Lancashire,) and it well deserves the name; for it is a real scoffer at the sorrows of other birds, which it laughs to scorn, and turns into ridicule, by parodying them so exactly."

     they do migrate at all, or else that their blood may recover its true tone and texture after it has been so long benumbed by the severities of winter.* About the middle of May, if the weather be fine, the marten begins to think in earnest of pro- viding a mansion for its family. The crust, or shell, of this nest seems to be formed of such dirt or loam as comes most readily to hand, and is tempered and wrought together with little bits of broken straws, to render it tough arid tenacious. As this bird often builds against a perpendicular wall, without any projecting ledge under it, it requires its utmost efforts to get the first foundation firmly fixed, so that it may safely carry the superstructure. On this occasion the bird not only clings with its claws, but partly supports itself by strongly inclining its tail against the wall, making that a fulcrum ; and, thus steadied, it works and plasters the materials into the face of the brick or stone. But then, that this work may not, while it is soft and green, pull itself down by its own weight, the provident architect has prudence and forbearance enough not to advance her work too fast ; but, by building only in the morning, and by dedicating the rest of the day to food and amusement, gives it sufficient time to dry and harden. About half an inch seems to be a sufficient layer for a day. Thus, careful workmen, when they build mud-walls, (informed at first, perhaps, by this little bird,) raise but a moderate layer at a time, and then desist ; lest the work should been me top- heavy, and so be ruined by its own weight. By this method, in about ten or twelve days, is formed an hemispheric nest, with a small aperture towards the top, strong, compact, and warm ; and perfectly fitted for all the purposes for which it was intended. But then, nothing is more common than for the house-sparrow, as soon as the shell is finished, to seize on it as its own, to eject the owner, and to line it after its own manner.-)*

We need only again refer to our notes at pages 22 and 30. The ancient authors all speak of their migratory habits. From a passage in the JSirds of Aristophanes, we are told that the swallow pointed out the time to dress in summer attire: and agreeable to the Greek calendar of Flora, which was kept at Athens by Theo- phrastus, the Ornithian winds blow, and the swallow arrives, between the 28th February and the 12th March ED.

     Nature seldom works in vain, martens will breed on for several years together in the same nest, where it happens to be well sheltered and secure from the injuries of weather. The shell, or crust, of the nest is a sort of rustic work, full of knobs and protuberances on the outside ; nor is the inside of those that I have examined smoothed with any exactness at all ; but is rendered soft and warm, and fit for incubation, by a lining of small straws, grasses, and feathers ; and sometimes by a bed of moss, interwoven with wool. In this nest, they tread, or engender, frequently during the time of building ; and the hen lays from three to five white eggs.

     At first, when the young are hatched, and are in a naked and helpless condition, the parent birds, with tender assiduity, carry out what comes away from their young. Were it not for this affectionate cleanliness, the nestlings would soon be burnt up and destroyed, in so deep and hollow a nest, by their own caustic excrement. In the quadruped creation, the same neat precaution is made use of ; particularly among dogs and cats, where the dams lick away what proceeds from their young. But, in birds, there seems to be :i particular provision, that the dung of nestlings is enveloped in a tough kind of jelly, and, therefore, is the easier conveyed off, without soiling or daubing. Yet, as Nature is cleanly in all her ways, the young I perform this office for themselves in a little time, by thrusting their tails out at the aperture of their nest. As the young of small birds presently arrive at their jjX/x/a, or full growth, they soon become impatient of confinement, and sit all day with their heads out at the orifice, where the dams, by clinging to the nest, supply them with food from morning to night. For a time, the young are fed on the wing by their parents ; but the feat is done by so quick and almost imper- ceptible a sleight, that a person must have attended very exactly to their motions, before he would be able to perceive it. As soon as the young are able to shift for themselves, the dams immediately turn their thoughts to the business of a second brood ; while the first flight, shaken off and rejected by their nurses, congregate in great flocks, and are the birds that are seen clustering and hovering, on sunny mornings and evenings, round towers and steeples, and on the roofs of churches and houses. These congregaiings usually begin to take place about the first week in August ; and, therefore, we may conclude, that by that time the first flight is pretty well over. The young of this species do not quit their abodes all together ; but the more forward birds get abroad some days

     before the rest. These, approaching- the eaves of buildings, and playing about before them, make people think that several old ones attend one nest. They are often capricious in fixing on a nesting-place, beginning many edifices, and leaving them unfinished ; but when once a nest is completed in a sheltered place, it serves for several seasons. Those which breed in a ready finished house get the start, in hatching, of those that build new, by ten days or a fortnight. These industrious artificers are at their labours in the long days before four in the morning : when they fix their materials, they plaster them on with their chins, moving their heads with a quick vibratory motion. They dip and wash as they fly sometimes, in very hot weather, but not so frequently as swallows. It has been observed, that martens usually build to a north-east or north- west aspect, that the heat of the sun may not crack and destroy their nests : but instances are also remembered where they bred for many years in vast abundance in a hot stifled inn- yard, against a wall facing to the south.

     Birds in general are wise in their choice of situation ; but, in this neighbourhood, every summer, is seen a strong proof to the contrary, at a house without eaves, in an exposed district, where some martens build year by year in the corners of the windows. * But, as the comers of these windows (which face to the south-east and south-west) are too shallow, 'the

     * A gentleman residing at Blois, in France, on the 14th April, 1831, made the following curious remarks on the building of the marten : A pair of martens commenced making their nest in the deep corner of one of his windows, which, being of French make, frame and all moved inwards every time it was opened. So close did these birds build their nest to the corner, that it became attached to the frame of the window ; the nest was consequently carried away every time the window was opened; but they recommenced building every morning, and so perseveringly did they adhere to the spot, that nothing would make them desist from their fruitless labour, until a piece of paper was nailed up at the corners of the window. When this was done, they removed to the next window, and there, with wonderful sagacity, commenced and carried on the business of building their nest, out of reach of the motion of the window frame. It is surprising to see animals thus exhibit such strong proofs of thought and skill out of the ordinary sphere of their habits.

     Mr Clement Jackson, of East Looe, observed, in the same year, in a cavern near Falmouth, numbers of martens building their nests, and says, the roof was quite studded with them. But what renders the circumstance still more remarkable is, that while these birds colonized in the upper part of the cave, a pair of kestrels had taken up their abode, and were rearing their brood, under a projecting ledge at the entrance. Neither party seemed to be incommoded by the neighbourhood of the other. ED.

     nests are washed down every hard rain ; and yet these birds drudge on to no purpose, from summer to summer, without changing their aspect or house. It is a piteous sight to see them labouring when half their nest is washed away, and bringing dirt " generis lapsi sarcire ruinas" Thus is instinct a most wonderfully unequal faculty ; in some instances so much above reason, in other respects so far below it ! Martens love to frequent towns, especially if there are great lakes and rivers at hand ; nay, they even affect the close air of London. And I have not only seen them nesting in the Borough, but even in the Strand and Fleet Street : but then it was obvious, from the dinginess of their aspect, that their feathers partook of the filth of that sooty atmosphere. Martens are by far the least agile of the four species ; their wings and tails are short, and therefore they are not capable of such surprising" turns, and quick and glancing evolutions as the swallow. Accord- ingly, they make use of a placid, easy motion, in a middle region of the air, seldom mounting to any great height, and never sweeping along together over the surface of the ground or water. They do not wander far for food, but affect sheltered districts, over some lake, or under some hanging wood, or in some hollow vale, especially in windy weather. They breed the latest of all the swallow kind : in 1772, they had nestlings on to October twenty-first, and are never without unfledged young as late as Michaelmas.

     As the summer declines, the congregating flocks increase in numbers daily by the constant accession of the second broods : till at last they swarm in myriads upon myriads round the villages on the Thames, darkening the face of the sky as they frequent the aits of that river, where they roost. They retire, the bulk of them I mean, in vast flocks together, about the beginning of October ; but have appeared of late years, in a considerable flight, in this neighbourhood, for one day or two, as late as November the third and sixth, after they were supposed to have been gone for more than a fortnight. They, therefore, withdraw with us the latest of any species. Unless these birds are very short-lived, indeed, or unless they do not return to the district where they are bred, they must undergo vast devastations somehow, and somewhere ; for the birds that return yearly bear no manner of proportion to the birds that retire. *

     One thing is very remarkable as to the sheep: from the westward, till you get to the river Adur, all the flocks have horns, and smooth white faces, and white legs ; and a hornless sheep is rarely to be seen. But as soon as you pass that river eastward, and mount Beeding-hill, all the flocks at once become hornless, or, as they call them, poll-sheep ; and have, moreover, black faces, with a white tuft of wool on their fore- heads, and speckled and spotted legs : so that, you would think that the flocks of Laban were pasturing on one side of the stream, and the variegated breed of his son-in-law, Jacob, were cantoned along on the other. And this diversity holds good respectively on each side, from the valley of Bramber and Beeding to the eastward, and westward all the whole length of the downs. If you talk with the shepherds on this subject, they tell you that the case has been so from time immemorial ; and smile at your simplicity if you ask them, whether the

We make great inquiries concerning the withdrawing of the swallow kind, without examining enough into the causes why this tribe is never to be seen in winter ; for, entre nous, the disappearing of the latter is more marvellous than that of the former, and much more unaccountable. The kirundines, if they please, are certainly capable of migration ; and yet, no doubt, are often found in a torpid state: but redstarts, nightingales, white-throats, black-caps, &amp;c. &amp;c. are very ill provided for long flights ; have never been once found, as I ever heard of, in a torpid state, and yet can never be supposed, in such troops, from year to year, to dodge and elude the eyes of the curious and inquisitive, which, from day to day, discern the other small birds that are known to abide our winters. But, notwithstanding all my care, I saw nothing like a summer bird of passage ; and what is more strange, not one wheatear, though they abound

     * There are ten or twelve distinct varieties of the common sheep, which will all breed with each other. In the mountainous districts of Wales and in the Highlands of Scotland, the kind preferred is the small- horned black-faced breed, remarkable for the very fine flavour of its flesh. There are four distinct species ; the bearded sheep of Barbary, the argali, which ranges the mountains and steeps of Northern Asia, the American argali, which inhabits Canada, and the musmon of Corsica and Sardinia. With regard to colour, Southey, in his Letters from Spain, says, the sheep of that peninsula are nearly all black. Geraldus Cambrensis informs us that the Irish in his time were usually clothed in black habiliments, made from wool which did not require dying. Much has been done within the last century to improve the breed in Ireland, but still, in many districts, black sheep are numerous. The cloth peculiar to Scotland, called hodden grey, was a manufacture from the natural fleece ; and throughout the domestic farming districts, the housewives still use their iniiuence to have one black lamb retained among the flock, as the wool takes on the dye more kindly, and is indeed often spun into thread for the stockings of the family, without receiving any artificial tinge. Indi- viduals with a black covering are very common in black-faced flocks, and occasionally occur among the Cheviot breed. ED.

The most intelligent shepherds tell me, that some few of these birds appear on the downs in March, and then withdraw to breed, probably, in warrens and stone quarries : now and then a nest is ploughed up in a fallow on the downs, under a furrow ; but it is thought a rarity. At the time of wheat-harvest, they begin to be taken in great numbers ; are sent for sale in vast quantities to Brighthelm- stone and Tunbridge ; and appear at the tables of all the gentry that entertain with any degree of elegance. About Michaelmas they retire, and are seen no more till March. Though these birds are, when in season, in great plenty on the South Downs round Lewes, yet at East Bourn, which is the eastern extremity of those downs, they abound much more. One thing is very remarkable, that, though in the height of the season so many hundreds of dozens are taken, yet they never are seen to flock ; and it is a rare thing to see more than three or four at a time : so that there must be a perpetual flitting and constant progressive succession. It does not appear that any wheatears are taken to the westward of Houghton-bridge, which stands on the river Arun. *

     Mr Jesse makes the following curious remarks, illustrative of the attachment of this bird to its old accustomed haunts, and to the established usages of its tribe : " The average number of rooks' nests, during the last four years, in the avenue of Hampton-Court Park, has been about seven hundred and fifty. Allowing three young birds and a pair of old ones to each nest, the number would amount to three thousand seven hundred and fifty. They are very particular that none of their society build away from the usual line of trees. A pair of rooks did so this spring, 1832, and when their nest was nearly finished, at least fifty others came and demolished it in a few minutes."

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_26080">
     Differently from all other birds, rooks exhibit much sympathy when one of their fraternity has been killed, or hurt by a shot. They hover over their wounded companion, uttering cries of distress, and endeavouring all in their power to render him assistance. If he be able to flutter along, they animate him with their voices, and by advancing a little in front, try to induce him by their example to follow. ED.

     DEAR SIR, The house-swallow, or chimney-swallow, is, undoubtedly, the first comer of all the British hirundines ; and appears in general on or about the thirteenth of April, as I have remarked from many years' observation. * Not but now and then a straggler is seen much earlier : and, in particular, when I was a boy, I observed a swallow for a whole day together on a sunny warm Shrove Tuesday, which day could not fall out later than the middle of March, and often happened early in February.

     It is worth remarking, that these birds are seen first about lakes and mill-ponds ; and it is also very particular, that, if these early visitors happen to find frost and snow, as was the case of the two dreadful springs of 1770 and 1771, they imme- diately withdraw for a time ; a circumstance this, much more in favour of hiding than migration ; since it is much more probable that a bird should retire to its hybernaculum just

     off to their box every thing they could get hold of. Besides this, they were very mischievous : they would attend the gardener at his work, and as soon as he removed to another part of the garden, they pulled up by the roots every thing he had planted ; such as young cabbages, or leeks. They Lad particular pleasure in turning over the leaves of a book, or pulling the whole thread off a bobbin. ED.

     * The following beautiful and vivid reflections on the swallow are from the pen of the late Sir Humphry Davy : "I delight in this living landscape ! the swallow is one of my favourite birds, and a rival of the nightingale ; for he glads my sense of hearing. He is the joyous prophet of the year, the harbinger of the best season ; he has a life of enjoyment amongst the loveliest forms of nature ; winter is unknown to him, and he leaves the green meadows of England in autumn for the myrtle and orange groves of Italy, and for the palms of Africa ; he has always objects of pursuit, and his success is secure. Even the beings selected for his prey are poetical, beautiful, and transient. The ephemerae are saved by his means from a slow and lingering death in the evening, and killed in a moment when they have known nothing of life but pleasure. He is the constant destroyer of insects, the friend of man ; and with the stork and the ibis, may be regarded as a sacred bird. This instinct, which gives him his appointed seasons, and which teaches him always when and where to move, may be regarded as flowing from a Divine source, and he belongs to the oracles of nature, which speak the awful and intelligible language of a present Deity."

     * That the migration of the swallow elicited attention in the earliest times, is evident from the manner in which it is noticed by the prophet Jeremiah. From that migration also, Cicero has drawn the following simile : " As swallows are present with us in summer, but are gone in winter, so false friends attend us in the sunshine of prosperity, but in the winter of affliction they all flee away." The ancients usually mention this bird as wintering in Africa ; which is distinctly stated in Anacreon, \J. Edn. Brunck. p. 38. So great a favourite was the swallow among the Greeks, particularly at Rhodes, that they had a festival called ysX/3oy/cc, which was a holyday for the Greek boys, when they carried about young swallows, and sung a song, which is preserved in the works of Meursius. It has been thus rendered in English :

     It is remarkable that most countries have a similar proverb relating to the swallow's accidental appearance before its usual time. The French have, Une hirondelle ne fait pas le printemps ; the Germans, Eine Sheval bemacht keinen Fruhling the Dutch, Eeu swalaw maak geen zomer ; the Italians, Una rodine non fa primevera ; the Swede?, En svala gor ingen sommar; which may be all literally translated by the English proverb, " One swallow doth not make a summer." The story is well known of a thin brass plate having been fixed on a swallow, with this inscription, " Prithee, swallow, \v hither goest thou in winter?" The bird returned next spring, with the answer subjoined, " To Anthony of Athens. Why dost thou inquire?" ED.

     Here and there a bird may affect some odd, peculiar place ; as we have known a swallow build down the shaft of an old well, through which chalk had been formerly drawn up, for the purpose of manure ; but, in general, with us this hirundo breeds in chimneys, and loves to haunt those stacks where there is a constant fire no doubt for the sake of warmth. Not that it can subsist in the immediate shaft where there is a fire ; but prefers one adjoining to that of the kitchen, and disregards the perpetual smoke of that funnel, as I have often observed with some degree of wonder.

     Five or six, or more feet down the chimney, does this little bird begin to form her nest, about the middle of May, which

     whole length of the building, and is a frequented promenade. They had thus to graze the heads of the passengers on entering their nests, and were, moreover, exposed to the depredations of the children, to whom they were novelties ; yet they preferred the dwelling-house to the more lofty eaves of the storehouses, and, on the following season, returned with augmented numbers to the same spot. Fort Chepewyan has existed for many years, and trading posts, though far distant from each other, have been established in the fur countries for a century and a half; yet this, as far as I could learn, is the first instance of this species of swallow placing itself under the protection of man within the widely extended lands north of the great lakes. What cause could have thus suddenly called into action that confidence in the human race, with which the Framer of the universe has endowed this species, in common with others of the swallow tribe ? It has been supposed that birds, frequenting desert countries, and unaccustomed to annoyance from man, would approach him fearlessly, or at least be less shy than those inhabiting the thickly peopled districts where they are daily exposed to the attacks of the great destroyer of their tribes. But although this may be true of some families of birds, it is far from being generally the case. On the contrary, the small birds of the fur countries, which are never objects of pursui't, and scarcely even of notice, to the Indian hunter, are shy, retiring, and distrustful, their habits contrasting strongly with the boldness and familiarity of sparrows, that are persecuted to death by every idle boy in Europe. Nay, some species which are bold enough during their winter residence in the United States, evince great timidity in the northern regions, where the raising their progeny occupies the whole time. In like manner, the redbreast of Europe, familiar as it is in winter, sequesters itself with the greatest care in the breeding season. The question, however, recurs, What is the peculiarity of economy which leads one species of bird to conceal its nest with the most extraordinary care and address, and another to place its offspring in the most exposed situation it can select ?"

     In the cabinet of the Lycaeurn, Governor De Witt Clinton has given an account of the fulvous swallow, il folva, which is nearly allied to the preceding species, laving built its nest in the walls of houses in the Western States ; and which has, every succeeding year, been advancing farther to the eastward.

     consists, like that of the house-marten, of a crust, or shell, composed of dirt, or mud, mixed with short pieces of straw, to render it tough and permanent ; with this difference, that whereas the shell of the marten is nearly hemispheric, that of the swallow is open at the top, and like half a deep dish : this nest is lined with fine grasses, and feathers, which are often collected as they float in the air.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_26690">
     Wonderful is the address which this adroit bird shews all day long, in ascending and descending with security through so narrow a pass. When hovering over the mouth of the funnel, the vibrations of her wings, acting on the confined air, occasion a rumbling like thunder. It is not improbable that the dam submits to this inconvenient situation so low in the shaft, in order to secure her broods from rapacious birds, and particularly from owls, which frequently fall down chimneys, perhaps in attempting to get at these nestlings. *

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_26710">
     The swallow lays from four to six white eggs, dotted with red specks ; and brings out her first brood about the last week in June, or the first week in July. The progressive method by which the young are introduced into life is very amusing : first they emerge from the shaft with difficulty enough, and often fall down into the rooms below ; for a clay or so, they are fed on the chimney top, and then are conducted to the dead leafless bough of some tree, where, sitting in a row, they are attended with great assiduity, and may then be called perchers. In a day or two more, they become fliers, but are still unable to take their own food ; therefore, they play about near the place where the dams are hawking for flies ; and when a mouthful is collected, at a certain signal given, the dam and the nestling advance, rising towards each other, and meeting at an angle ; the young one all the while uttering

     * Swallows have a strong attachment to places where they once found security, and sometimes make their nests in curious situations. At Blois, in France, a chimney, which had a moving iron top placed over it to prevent smoking, became, in consequence of the fireplace being bricked up, a safe place for building in; and, no doubt, the birds discovered that it was such. Within the very hood, or top of this machine, swinging about with every wind, and making a most hideous noise, swallows have built their nests for the last two years, 1830 and 1831 ; and often, for five minutes or more, when the wind was high, they have been noticed in vain attempting to get into it, the constant motion preventing them from entering their airy dwelling. The force of habit must be very strong indeed to induce birds to choose so inconvenient a situation for incubation, No doubt, however, the feelings of security overcome many considerations. ED.

     The dam betakes herself immediately to the business of a second brood, as soon as she is disengaged from her first ; which at once associates with the first broods of house-martens, and with them congregates, clustering on sunny roofs, towers* and trees. This hirundo brings out her second brood towards the middle and end of August.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_26810">
     All the summer long is the swallow a most instructive pattern of unwearied industry and affection ; for, from morning to night, while there is a family to be supported, she spends the whole day in skimming close to the ground, and exerting the most sudden turns and quick evolutions. Avenues, and long walks, under hedges, and pasture fields, and mown meadows where cattle graze, are her delight, especially if there are trees interspersed ; because in such spots insects most abound. When a fly is taken, a smart snap from her bill is heard, resembling the noise at the shutting of a watch case ; but the motion of the mandibles is too quick for the eye.

     The swallow, probably the male bird, is the excubitor to house-martens, and other little birds, announcing the approach of birds of prey. For as soon as a hawk appears, with a shrill alarming note, he calls all the swallows and martens about him ; who pursue in a body, and buffet and strike their enemy, till they have driven him from the village, darting down from above on his back, and rising in a perpendicular line in perfect security. This bird also will sound the alarm, and strike at cats when they climb on the roofs of houses, or otherwise approach the nests.* Each species of hirundo drinks as it

     * The swallow is well known to be a very intrepid bird, and will attack animals of a size superior to itself, and which larger birds would not dare to face. While a gentleman was walking through a retired village lane, near Lynn Regis, in 1830, a stoat, mustela erminea, issued from the hedge a few paces before him, on the footpath. A swallow, flying over the place, immediately discovered the animal, fearlessly pounced upon him, and forced him to retire to his hiding-place. In a minute after- wards, however, the stoat again ventured out, when the swallow, having taken another round in the air, again obliged him to retreat. This was repeated four several times, after which the stoat disappeared, and was not again seen.

     A swallow has been seen to attack a cat, in the same manner as above described. A writer in London's Magazine says, " Swallows were and ^are allowed to build in out-houses belonging to my father ; the house cat would often bask in the sun, beside the out-houses, when the swallows testified their detestation of her by flying over her head in a

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_26930">
     The swallow is a delicate songster, and, in soft, sunny weather, sings both perching and flying ; on trees in a kind of concert, and on chimney tops ; is also a bold flier, ranging to distant downs and commons, even in windy weather, which the other species seem much to dislike ; nay, even frequenting exposed seaport towns, and making little excursions over the salt water. Horsemen on wide downs are often closely attended by a little party of swallows for miles together, which plays before and behind them, sweeping around, and collecting all the skulking insects that are roused by the trampling of the horses' feet. When the wind blows hard, without this expedient, they are often forced to settle to pick up their lurking prey.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_26950">
     This species feeds much on little coleoptera, as well as on gnats and flies, and often settles on dug ground, or paths, for gravels to grind and digest its food. Before they depart, for some weeks, to a bird they forsake houses and chimneys, and roost in trees, and usually withdraw about the beginning of October, though some few stragglers may appear on, at times, till the first week in November.

     rapid, sweeping curve, almost touching her in its lowest inclination ; and they shrieked their hatred as they flew. Now and then, as if enraged by their pertinacity, and her own want of success, she would spring up in the air at them, as they passed, with her best vigour and agility ; but I never knew her catch one." Another correspondent mentions a cat which was more successful. He says, " The thing is, a priori, nearly impossible, and yet we stake our credit on the authenticity of the fact, having seen the whole process of grimalkin's wonderful cunning, and almost miraculous rapidity. It was in the early part of May, 1832, when insects, in conse- quence of the cold, fly low, and, of course, the swallows are forced to Hawk for their prey by skimming the surface of the ground. The wily cat, taking advantage of this, stretches herself upon the sunny grass-plot, with her legs extended, as if she were dead ; the flies collect about her, as flies always do when they can find any animal as patient as my Uncle Toby, to endure their tickling and buzzing ; the simple swallows, dream- ing of no harm, and thinking they can make good a meal, dip down from the barren air, dart with free will upon the flies, when puss, perceiving her prey within reach, makes a spring like a flash of lightning, and strikes down with her paw the poor thoughtless swallow. The best marksmen know how difficult it is to shoot a swallow on the wing ; but the cat found her patience, cunning, and rapidity, well rewarded, by her unerring success whenever a swallow ventured within her reach*" ED.

     Both male and female are distinguished from their con- geners by the length and forkedness of their tails.

     A certain swallow built, for two years together, on the handles of a pair of garden shears, that were stuck up against the boards in an out-house, and therefore must have her nest spoiled whenever that implement was wanted. And, what is stranger still, another bird of the same species built its nest on the wings and body of an owl, that happened by accident to hang, dead and dry, from the rafter of a barn. This owl, with the nest on its wings, and with eggs in the nest, was brought as a curiosity worthy the most elegant private museum in Great Britain. The owner, struck with the oddity of the sight, furnished the bringer with a large shell, or conch, desiring him to fix it just where the owl hung. The person did as he was ordered ; and the following year, a pair, probably the same pair, built their nest in the conch, and laid their eggs,

     f- The following interesting circumstance is mentioned in Kalm's Travels: " A pair of swallows built their nest in the stable belonging to n lady ; the female laid eggs in the nest, and was about to breed them. Some days after, the people saw the female sitting on the eggs, but the male flying about the nest, and, sometimes sitting on a nail, he was heard to utter a very plaintive note, which betrayed his uneasiness. On a nearer examination, the female was found dead in the nest, and the people flung her body away. The male went to sit upon the eggs ; but, after being about two hours on them, and perhaps finding the business too trouble- some, he went out, and returned in the afternoon with another female, which sat upon the nest, and afterwards fed the young ones, till they were able to provide for themselves." There seems to have been displayed in this a degree of intelligence higher than mere instinct. ED.

     As to the quotations, it is difficult to say precisely which species of hit- undo Virgil might intend, in the lines in question, since the ancients did not attend to specific differences, like modern naturalists ; yet somewhat may be gathered, enough to incline me to suppose, that, in the two passages quoted, the poet had his eye on the swallow.

     In the first place, the epithet garrula suits the swallow well, who is a great songster, and not the marten, which is rather a mute bird, and when it sings, is so inward as scarce to be heard. Besides, if tignum in that place signifies a rafter, rather than a beam, as it seems to me to do, then I think it must be the swallow that is alluded to, and not the marten, since the former does frequently build within the roof, against the rafters, while the latter always, as far as I have been able to observe, builds without the roof, against eaves and cornices.*

     As to the simile, too much stress must not be laid on it ; yet the epithet nigra speaks plainly in favour of the swallow, whose back and wings are very black ; while the rump of the marten is milk-white, its back and wings blue, and all its under part white as snow. Nor can the clumsy motions (compara* tively clumsy) of the marten well represent the sudden and artful evolutions, and quick turns, which Juturna gave to her brother's chariot, so as to elude the eager pursuit of the enraged

     We have had a very wet autumn and winter, so as to raise the springs to a pitch beyond any thing since 1764, which was a remarkable year for floods and high waters. The land- springs, which we call levants, break out much on the downs of Sussex, Hampshire, and Wiltshire. The country people say, when the levants rise, corn will always be dear ; meaning, that when the earth is so glutted with water as to send forth springs on the downs and uplands, that the corn vales must be drowned : and so it has proved for these ten or eleven years past ; for land-springs have never obtained more since the memory of man than during that period, nor has there been known a greater scarcity of all sorts of grain, considering the great improvements of modern husbandry. Such a run of wet seasons, a century or two ago, would, I am persuaded, have occasioned a famine. Therefore, pamphlets and newspaper letters that talk of combinations, tend to inflame and mislead, since we must not expect plenty till Providence sends us more favourable seasons.

     DEAR SIR, The sand-marten, or bank-marten, is by much the least of any of the British hirundines, and, as far as we have ever seen, the smallest known hirundo; though Brisson asserts that there is one much smaller, and that is the hirundo esculenta.-\

     The edible nest of this species constitutes one of the luxuries of an ian banquet. The Nicobar swallow builds in fissures and cavities of rocks, especially such as are open to the south. In the latter situation, the finest and whitest nests are found. Sometimes fifty pounds weight of them are gathered in a nest-hunting excursion. They are small, and

     But it is much to be regretted, that it is scarce possible for any observer to be so full and exact as he could wish, in reciting the circumstances attending the life and conversation of this little bird, since it \sfera naturd, at least in this part of the kingdom, disclaiming all domestic attachments, and haunt- ing wild heaths and commons where there are large lakes ; while the other species, especially the swallow and house- marten, are remarkably gentle and domesticated, and never seem to think themselves safe but under the protection of man.*

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_27610">
     Here are in this parish, in the sand-pits and banks of the lake of Wolmer Forest, several colonies of these birds ; and yet they are never seen in the village, nor do they at all frequent the cottages that are scattered about in that wild district. The only instance I ever remember where this species haunts any building, is at the town of Bishop's Waltham, in this county, where many sand-martens nestle and breed in the scaffold holes of the back wall of William of Wykeham's stables ; but then this wall stands in a very sequestered and retired enclosure, and faces upon a large and beautiful lake.

     shaped like the nest of a window-swallow. If these are perfect, seventy- two of them will go to a catty, or one pound and three quarters. They bring a very high price in China. They are composed of a substance resembling amber, and probably the gum of the Nicobar cedar, which grows abundantly in all the islands. From December to May, it is covered with blossoms, and bears a fruit somewhat resembling a cedar or pine apple, but more like a large berry full of pustules, discharging a gum or resinous fluid. The hen constructs a neat, large nest, for laying and hatching her eggs, and the cock contrives to fix another smaller, and rather more clumsy, close to his mate ; for they are not only built for the purpose of incubation, but also for resting places. If they are robbed of them, they immediately fall to work to build others, ana I being remarkably active, are able in a day to finish enough to support the weight of their bodies, although they take about three weeks to com- plete a nest. During the north-east trade-wind, they are all alive, and fly about briskly ; but as soon as the wind comes round to the south- west, they sit or lie in their nests, in a state of stupor, and shew anima- tion only by a kind of tremulous motion over their whole body. If the nests were taken away at this season, the poor birds must inevitably

     * If the sand-martens of Selborne were solitary, as Mr White states, they have been different from all others we have heard of or seen. In many situations the excavations are so near each other, that the entrance to one of their holes is frequently close to that of the other. Professor Rennie tells us that he has noticed them not three inches apart, and the whole face of a bank thickly studded over with them. We have seen them in an indurated sandbank, on the side of a stream called the Lothrie, near Leslie, in Fife, very numerous, and not above fifteen inches from each other. ED.

     And, indeed, this species seems so to delight in large waters, that no instance occurs of their abounding, but near vast pools or rivers ; and, in particular, it has been remarked that they swarm in the banks of the Thames, in some places below London Bridge.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_27730">
     It is curious to observe with what different degrees of architectonic skill Providence has endowed birds of the same genus, and so nearly correspondent in their general mode of life ; for, while the swallow and the house-marten discover the greatest address in raising and securely fixing crusts, or shells, of loam, as cunabula for their young, the bank-marten terebrates a round and regular hole in the sand or earth, which is serpen- tine, horizontal, and about two feet deep. At the inner end of this burrow does this bird deposit, in a good degree of safety, her rude nest, consisting of fine grasses and feathers, usually goose feathers, very inartificially laid together.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_27750">
     Perseverance will accomplish any thing : though at first one would be disinclined to believe that this weak bird, with her soft and tender bill and claws, should ever be able to bore the stubborn sand bank, without entirely disabling herself ; * yet, with these feeble instruments, have I seen a pair of them make great despatch, and could remark how much they had scooped that day, by the fresh sand which ran down the bank, and was of a different colour from that which lay loose and bleached in the sun.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_27770">
     In what space of time these little artists are able to mine and finish these cavities, I have never been able to discover, for reasons given above ; but it would be a matter worthy of observation, where it falls in the way of any naturalist, to make his remarks. This I have often taken notice of, that several holes of different depths are left unfinished at the end of summer. To imagine that these beginnings were inten- tionally made, in order to be in the greater forwardness for next spring, is allowing, perhaps, too much foresight and rerum prudentia to a simple bird. May not the cause of these latebraz being left unfinished arise from their meeting in those places with strata too harsh, hard, and solid for their purpose, which they relinquish, and go to a fresh spot that works more freely ? or may they not in other places fall in with a soil as much too loose and mouldering, liable to founder, and threaten- ing to overwhelm them and their labours ?

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_27830">
     One thing is remarkable, that, after some years, the old holes are forsaken, and new ones bored ; perhaps because the old habitations grow foul and fetid from long use, or because they may so abound with fleas as to become untenantable. This species of swallow, moreover, is strangely annoyed with fleas ; and we have seen fleas, bed-fleas, (pulex irritans, *) swarming at the mouths of these holes like bees on the stools of their hives.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_27850">
     The following circumstance should by no means be omitted, that these birds do not make use of their caverns by way of hybernacula, as might be expected ; since banks so perforated have been dug out with care in the winter, when nothing was found but empty nests.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_27870">
     The sand-marten arrives much about the same time with the swallow, and lays, as she does, from four to six white eggs. But, as this species is cryptogame, carrying on the business of nidification, incubation, and the support of its young, in the dark, it would not be easy to ascertain the time of breeding, were it not for the coming forth of the broods, which appear much about the time, or rather somewhat earlier, than those of the swallow. The nestlings are supported, in common, like those of their congeners, with gnats and other small insects, and sometimes they are fed with libellultz, (dragon-flies,) almost as long as themselves. In the last week in June, we have seen a row of these sitting on a rail, near a great pool, as perchers, and so young and helpless, as easily to be taken by hand ; but whether the dams ever feed them on the wing, as swallows and house-martens do, we have never yet been able to determine ; nor do we know whether they pursue and attack birds of prey.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_27890">
     When they happen to breed near hedges and enclosures, they are dispossessed of their breeding holes by the house- sparrow, which is, on the same account, a fell adversary to house-martens.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_27910">
     These hirundines are no songsters, but rather mute, making only a little harsh noise when a person approaches their nests. They seem not to be of a sociable turn, never with us congre- gating with their congeners in the autumn. Undoubtedly they breed a second time, like the house-marten and swallow, and withdraw about Michaelmas.

     abound, yet, on the whole, in the south of England at least, is this much the rarest species ; for there are few towns or large villages but what abound with house-martens ; few churches, towers, or steeples, but what are haunted by some swifts ; scarce a hamlet or single cottage chimney that has not its swallow ; while the bank-martens, scattered here and there live a sequestered life among some abrupt sand hills, and in the banks of some few rivers. *
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_28030">
     These birds have a peculiar manner of flying, flitting about with odd jerks and vacillations, not unlike the motions of a butterfly. Doubtless the flight of all hirundines is influenced by, and adapted to, the peculiar sort of insects which furnish their food. Hence it would be worth inquiry to examine what particular genus of insects affords the principal food of each respective species of swallow.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_28050">
     Notwithstanding what has been advanced above, some few sand-martens, I see, haunt the skirts of London, frequenting the dirty pools in St George's Fields, and about Whitechapel. The question is, where these build, since there are no banks or bold shores in that neighbourhood ? Perhaps they nestle in the scaffold-holes of some old or new deserted building. They dip and wash as they fly sometimes, like the house-marten and swallow.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_28070">
     * Professor Rennie says, " We can hardly bring ourselves to believe that he meant the same species, or at least that he spoke in this instance from his own observation. A more decidedly social bird we are not acquainted with ; since it not only nestles in numerous colonies, but also hunts for insects in troops of from thirty to fifty, and, as BuiFon correctly remarks, associates freely with other swallows." La Vaillant, Montagu, and Wilson, all agree on this point ; the latter says, it " appears to be the most social of its kind of all our swallows, living together in large communities of sorretimes three or four hundred. Several of their holes," he adds, " are often within a few inches of each other, and extend in various strata along the front of a precipice, sometimes for eighty or a hundred yards. They are particularly fond of the shores of rivers, and in several places along the Ohio and the Kentucky river, they congregate in immense multitudes." Although it may be true, according to the remarks of these naturalists, that the sand-marten has been found in much frequented situations, we do not think that any proof of the inaccu- racy of our author, as the Professor seems desirous of establishing. We have already pointed out, in our note at page 150, on the respectable authority of Dr Richardson, that one of the congeners of this bird, the cliif-swallow, has entirely changed its habits within these very few years ; and this may be the case with the sand-marten also. These birds may have been in Mr White's time much more rare in this country than at present. As far as our own observation goes, we have always noticed this species in remote and rather sequestered situations. ED.

     DEAR SIR, Before your letter arrived, and of my own accord, I had been remarking and comparing the tails of the male and female swallow, and this ere any young broods appeared ; so that there was no danger of confounding the dams with their pulli ; and, besides, as they were then always in pairs, and busied in the employ of nidification, there could be no room for mistaking the sexes, nor the individuals of different chimneys, the one for the other. From all my obser- vations, it constantly appeared that each sex has the long feathers in its tail that give it that forked shape ; with this difference, that they are longer in the tail of the male than in that of the female.

     * Dr Richardson considers the sand-marten of the fur countries of North America, as identical with the European bird ; and, from all accounts, it is the same in every quarter of the glohe. It breeds but once in the fur countries, generally late, and takes its departure about the middle of August with the rest of the swallow tribe ; which confirms the fact that they live in societies. That traveller says, " We observed thousands of these sand-martens fluttering at the entrance of their burrows, near the mouth of the Mackenzie, in the sixty-eighth parallel, on the 4th July ; and it is probable, from the state of the weather, that they had arrived at least a fortnight prior to that date. They are equally numerous in every district of the fur countries, wherein banks suitable for burrowing exist." En.

     Sinclair, Bart, long known for his patriotism, comrnissioned the late Mr Dickson of Covent Garden, to purchase for him as many nightingales' eggs 'as he could procure, at a shilling each. This was accordingly done, the eggs carefully packed in wool, and transmitted to Sir John by the mail. Sir John employed several men to find, and take care of, the nests of several robins, "in places where the eggs might be deposited and hatched with security. The robins' eggs were removed, and replaced by those of the nightingale, which were all sat upon, hatched in due time, and the young brought up by the foster-parents. The songsters flew, when fully fledged, and were observed, for some time afterwards, near the places where they were incubated. In September, the usual migratory period, they disappeared, and never returned to the place of their birth. The nightingale is usually silent on the 1st of July. ED.

     * A man of acute observation, who had set a common spring mole- trap, perceived that a mole was taken. He took the trap from the ground, allowing the mole to continue suspended in it. He was working in the neighbourhood, and chancing to look at the trap, he perceived a weasel actively engaged in attempting to get the mole out of the wires which held it. The weasel ran up the stick, which formed the spring of the trap, and descended on the captive, which he seized, and, tried by wriggling, twisting, and hanging by it, to disengage it from the trap, but without being able to effect his purpose. When exhausted with these fruitless efforts, he relinquished his hold, and dropt to the ground, where he rested for some time; he re-ascended the stick, and renewed his efforts with redoubled ardour. The workman, after seeing him make nearly a dozen attempts, took the mole from the trap, and threw it down as a reward for his perseverance ; but, on seeing the man, he made his escape, and never returned while he remained.

Repairing to a rivulet, they stick a hair in the mud at the bottom, both because they think the incipient animal derives some nourishment from the ground, and to prevent its being swept away from their observation. On their return to the spot, next day perhaps, the admiring group gather round ; one of them with his finger touches the hair, which being by this time moistened and rendered pliable, exhibits in the rippling stream a tremulous motion, that is unhesitatingly ascribed

     * The late Mrs O'Brien, of Manor Place, Chelsea, being exceedingly fond of birds, kept a number in cages. One of them, a canary, was a great favourite, but the loudness of its song frequently obliged her to put it outside of the window, among trees trained in the front of the house. During breakfast one morning, a sparrow was observed to fly several times round the cage, to alight upon the top, and chirp to the canary ; at length a reciprocal conversation ensued. He remained a few minutes, and then flew away, but soon returned with a worm in his bill, which he dropped into the cage, and again took his departure. The same atten- tions were manifested day after day, till they became so familiar, that the canary would at length receive the proffered food from the bill of his generous friend. This trait of the sparrow soon became known to the neighbours, who were frequent spectators of his acts of benevolence. Some of them, wishing to ascertain the extent of his kindly feelings, also put their birds out at the window, and he extended his attention to all of them ; but his first and longest visit was always paid to his old acquain- tance, Mrs O'Brien's canary.

     The note of the white-throat, which is continually repeated, and often attended with odd gesticulations on the wing, is harsh and displeasing. These birds seem of pugnacious dis- position, for they sing with an erected crest, and attitudes of rivalry and defiance ; are shy and wild in breeding time, avoid- ing neighbourhoods, and haunting lonely lanes and commons ; nay, even the very tops of the Sussex Downs, where there are bushes and covert ; but in July and August, they bring their broods into gardens and orchards, and make great havoc among the summer fruits.

     The black-cap has, in common, a full, sweet, deep, loud, and wild pipe ; yet that strain is of short continuance, and his motions are desultory ; but, when that bird sits calmly and engages in song in earnest, he pours forth very sweet, but inward melody, and expresses great variety of soft and gentle modulations, superior perhaps to those of any of our warblers, the nightingale excepted.

Gesner mentions an instance of one that reached the extraordinary age of a hundred years. Carp have been known to live a fortnight out of the water, being placed in a net, among wet moss, the head only left out, and hung up in a cellar. They are frequently plunged into water, and fed with white bread and milk. In this situation they even fatten, and their flesh is considered of a higher flavour than when taken fresh out of a pond.

     DEAR SIR, As the swift, or black-marten, is the largest of the British hirundines y so it is undoubtedly the latest comer : for I remember but one instance of its appearing before the last week in April ; and in some of our late frosty harsh springs, it has not been seen till the beginning of May. This species usually arrives in pairs.

     The swift, like the sand-marten, is very defective in architecture, making no crust, or shell, for its nest, but forming it of dry grasses and feathers, very rudely and inartificially put together. With all my attention to these birds, I have never been able once to discover one in the act of collecting or carrying in materials : so that I have suspected (since their nests are exactly the same) that they sometimes

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_29390">
     Swifts, like sand-martens, carry on the business of nidifica- tion quite in the dark, in crannies of castles, and towers, and steeples, and upon the tops of the walls of churches, under the roof, and therefore cannot be so narrowly watched as those species that build more openly ; but, from what I could ever observe, they begin nesting about the middle of May ; and I have remarked, from eggs taken, that they have sat hard by the 9th of June. In general, they haunt tall buildings, churches, and steeples, and breed only in such ; yet, in this village, some pairs frequent the lowest and meanest cottages, and educate their young under those thatched roofs. We remember but one instance where they breed out of buildings, and that is in the sides of a deep chalk pit near the town of Odiham, in this county, where we have seen many pairs entering the crevices, and skimming and squeaking round the precipices.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_29410">
     As I have regarded these amusive birds with no small attention, if I should advance something new and peculiar with respect to them, and different from all other birds, I might perhaps be credited, especially as my assertion is the result of many years' exact observation. The fact that I would advance is, that swifts tread, or copulate, on the wing ; and I would wish any nice observer, that is startled at this supposition, to use his own eyes, and I think he will soon be convinced. In another class of animals, viz. the insect, nothing is so common as to see the different species of many genera, in conjunction as they fly. The swift is almost continually on the wing ; and, as it never settles on the ground, on trees, or roofs, would seldom find opportunity for amorous rites, were it not enabled to indulge them in the air. If any person would watch these birds of a fine morning in May, as they are sailing round, at a great height from the ground, he would see, every now and then, one drop on the back of another, and both of them sink down together for many fathoms, with a loud, piercing shriek. This I take to be the juncture when the business of generation is carrying on.

     as it seems, propagates on the wing, it appears to live more in the air than any other bird, and to perform all functions there, save those of sleeping and incubation.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_29490">
     This hirundo differs widely from its congeners, in laying invariably but two eggs at a time, which are milk-white, long, and peaked at the small end ; whereas the other species lay at each brood from four to six.* It is a most alert bird, rising very early, and retiring to roost very late, and is on the wing in the height of summer, at least sixteen hours. In the longest days it does not withdraw to rest till a quarter before nine in the evening^ being the latest of all day birds. Just before they retire, whole groups of them assemble high in the air, and squeak and shoot about with wonderful rapidity. But this bird is never so much alive as in sultry thundery weather, when it expresses great alacrity, and calls forth all its powers. In hot mornings, several, getting together into little parties, dash round the steeples and churches, squeaking as they go, in a very clamorous manner: these, by nice observers, are supposed to be males serenading their sitting hens ; and not without reason, since they seldom squeak till they come close to the walls or eaves, and since those within utter at the same time, a little inward note of complacency.^
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_29510">
     When the hen has sat hard all day, she rushes forth just as it is almost dark, and stretches and relieves her weary limbs, and snatches a scanty meal for a few minutes, and then returns to her duty of incubation. Swifts, when wantonly and cruelly shot while they have young, discover a little lump of insects in their mouths, which they pouch and hold under their tongue. In general, they feed in a much higher district than the other species ; a proof that gnats and other insects do

     The velocity of the swift's flight is extraordinary; the following curious circumstance is recorded in London's Magazine of Natural History, for November, 1831 : " Some few months ago, being on a visit at Hastings, I stopped, during an early morning's walk, to watch a party of swifts dashing round the ruins of an old castle which overlook the town. While I was thus amusing myself, and admiring the extraor- dinary rapidity of their flight, to my infinite astonishment, one of them flew directly against the castle wall. My surprise was so great, that at first I thought I was mistaken ; but as the spot where the bird fell was not very difficult of approach, I climbed up, and there found the bird fluttering on the ground. I picked it up, but in a very few minutes it died in my hand. It would be difficult to assign a cause* for this curious circumstance. " ED.

     also abound to a considerable height in the air : they also range to vast distances ; since locomotion is no labour to them, who are endowed with such wonderful powers of wing. Their powers seem to be in proportion to their levers ; and their wings are longer in proportion, than those of almost any other bird. When they mute, or ease themselves in flight, they raise their wings, and make them meet over their backs.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_29630">
     At some certain times in the summer, I had remarked that swifts were hawking very low, for hours together, over pools and streams ; and could not help inquiring into the object of their pursuit, that induced them to descend so much below their usual range. After some trouble, I found that they were taking phryganece, ephemerae^ libellulas^ (cadew-flies, may- flies, and dragon-flies,) that were just emerged out of their aurelia state. I then no longer wondered that they should be so willing to stoop for a prey that afforded them such plentiful and succulent nourishment.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_29650">
     They bring out their young about the middle or latter end of July ; but as these never become perchers, nor, that ever I could discern, are fed on the wing by their dams, the coming forth of the young is not so notorious as in the other species.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_29670">
     On the thirtieth of last June, I untiled the eaves of a house where many pairs build, and found in each nest only two squab, naked pulli ; on the eighth of July, I repeated the same inquiry, and found they had made very little progress towards a fledged state, but were still naked and helpless. From whence we may conclude, that birds whose way of life keeps them perpetually on the wing, would not be able to quit their nest till the end of the month. Swallows and martens, that have numerous families, are continually feeding them every two or three minutes ; while swifts, that have but two young to maintain, are much at their leisure, and do not attend on their nests for hours together.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_29690">
     Sometimes they pursue and strike at hawks that come in their way, but not with that vehemence and fury that swallows express on the same occasion. * They are out all day long on wet days, feeding about, and disregarding still rain ; from whence two things may be gathered, first, that many insects abide high in the air, even in rain ; and next, that the feathers of these birds must be well preened to resist so much wet.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_29710">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_29790">
     There is a circumstance respecting the colour of swifts, which seems not to be unworthy our attention. When they arrive in the spring, they are all over of a glossy dark soot colour, except their chins, which are white ; but, by being all day long in the sun and air, they become quite weather-beaten and bleached before they depart, and yet they return glossy again in the spring. Now if they pursue the sun into lower latitudes, as some suppose, in order to enjoy a perpetual summer, why do they not return bleached ? Do they not rather, perhaps, retire to rest for a season, and at that juncture moult and change their feathers, since all other birds are known to moult soon after the season of breeding?*
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_29810">
     Swifts are very anomalous in many particulars, dissenting- from all their congeners, not only in the number of their young, but in breeding but once in a summer ; whereas all the other British hirundines breed invariably twice. It is past all doubt that swifts can breed but once, since they withdraw in a short time after the flight of their young, and some time

     naturalists have lately had a controversy. " Last summer," says he, " I brought up by hand a turtle dove, which I accustomed to fly about my room, till within this last month, at all times, except at night. Invariably when I had it sitting on my hand, it would begin pluming itself, (particularly while in moult, which was for about four months,) and, at such times, it was curious to see it apply its bill to the gland, or nipple just above its tail, and, by pincing it, procure something, though I could never discover what. On withdrawing its bill, it always stretched out its neck, and twisted its head about in the strangest manner, with its eyes shut, and the bill opening and shutting, as if in the act of chewing something which put it in pain, but which I always considered was for the purpose of spreading, or allowing the substance procured to circulate to all parts of the bill. This operation lasted about twelve seconds, and then it immediately applied it, quickly, to only three or four different parts of its plumage at a time, and, at its pleasure, easily enough, all over its head and neck, by rubbing them on such parts ae were within a convenient distance ; for who ever saw a bird, particularly a duck, wash itself, without observing it rub its head and neck on its back, or the shoulders of its wings ? This I have seen it do at least ten times in as many minutes on my hand; but confess, I could never detect what it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_29850">
     he probability is, that these birds have just arrived in this country after they have undergone the vernal moult. Birds differ considerably in colour before the renewal of their plumage ; and that they are in this state before taking their departure there can be little doubt, as they have not yet been subjected to the autumnal moult.

     before their congeners bring out their second broods. We may here remark, that, as swifts breed but once in a summer, and only two at a time, and the other hirundines twice, the latter, who lay from four to six eggs, increase, at an average, five times as fast as the former.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_29910">
     But in nothing are swifts more singular than in their early retreat. They retire, as to the main body of them, by the tenth of August, and sometimes a few days sooner ; and every straggler invariably withdraws by the twentieth : while their congeners, all of them, stay till the beginning of October, many of them all through that month, and some occasionally to the beginning of November. This early retreat is mysterious and wonderful, since that time is often the sweetest season in the year. But, what is more extraordinary, they begin to retire still earlier in the more southerly parts of Andalusia, w r here they can be nowise influenced by any defect of heat, or as one might suppose, defect of food. Are they regulated in their motions with us by a failure of food, or by a propensity to moulting, or by a disposition to rest after so rapid a life, or by what ? This is one of those incidents in natural history that not only baffles our researches, but almost eludes our guesses !
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_29930">
     These hirundines never perch on trees or roofs, and so never congregate with their congeners. They are fearless while haunting their nesting places, and are not to be scared with a gun, and are often beaten down with poles and cudgels as they stoop to go under the eaves. Swifts are much infested with those pests to the genus, called hippobosccE hirundinis,* and often wriggle and scratch themselves, in their flight, to get rid of that clinging annoyance.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_29950">
     Swifts are no songsters, and have only one harsh, screaming note ; yet there are ears to which it is not displeasing, from an agreeable association of ideas, since that note never occurs but in the most lovely summer weather.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_29970">
     They never settle on the ground but through accident, and when down can hardly rise, on account of the shortness of their legs, and the length of their wings : neither can they walk, but only crawl ; but they have a strong grasp with their feet, by which they cling to walls. Their bodies being flat, they can enter a very narrow crevice ; and where they cannot pass on their bellies, they will turn up edgewise.

This, and some peculiarities attending the nostrils and under mandible, have induced a discerning naturalist* to suppose that this species might con- stitute a genus per se.

     In London, a party of swifts frequent the Tower, playing and feeding over the river just below the Bridge ; others haunt some of the churches of the Borough next the fields, but do not venture, like the house-marten, into the close, crowded part of the town.

     The Swedes have bestowed a very pertinent name on this swallow, calling it ring-sivala, from the perpetual rings, or circles, that it takes round the scene of its nidification.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_30110">
     Swifts feed on coleoptera, or small beetles with hard cases over their wings, as well as on the softer insects ; but it does not appear how they can procure gravel to grind their food, as swallows do, since they never settle on the ground. Young ones, overrun with li'ippoboscce, are sometimes found, under their nests, fallen to the ground, the number of vermin ren- dering their abode insupportable any longer. They frequent, in this village, several abject cottages ; yet a succession still haunts the same unlikely roofs a good proof this that the same birds return to the same spots. As they must stoop very low to get up under these humble eaves, cats lie in wait, and sometimes catch them on the wing.

     Perhaps it may be some amusement to you to hear at what times the-different species of hirundines arrived this spring in three very distant counties of this kingdom. With us, the swallow was seen first on April the 4th ; the swift on April the 24th ; the bank-marten on April the 12th ; and the house- marten not till April the 30th. At South Zele, Devonshire, swallows did not arrive till April the 25th ; swifts, in plenty, on May the 1st ; and house-martens not till the middle of May. At Blackburn, in Lancashire, swifts were seen April the 28th ; swallows, April the 29th ; house-martens, May the 1st. Do these different dates, in such distant districts, prove any thing for or against migration ?

In general, he is very suc- cessful in the defence of his family : but once I observed in my garden, that several magpies came determined to storm the nest of a missel-thrush ; the dams defended their mansion with great vigour, and fought resolutely pro arts etfocis ; but num- bers at last prevailed, they tore the nest to pieces, and swal- lowed the young alive.*

     TO THOMAS PENNANT, ESQ.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_30630">
     IT is matter of curious inquiry to trace out how those species of soft-billed birds, that continue with us the winter through, subsist during the dead months. The imbecility of birds seems not to be the only reason why they shun the rigour of our winters ; for the robust wry-neck (so much resembling the hardy race of woodpeckers) migrates, while the feeble little golden-crowned wren, that shadow of a bird, braves our severest frosts, without availing himself of houses or villages, to which most of our winter birds crowd in distressful seasons, while he keeps aloof in fields and woods ; but perhaps this may be the reason why they may often perish, and why they are almost as rare as any bird we know. *
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_30650">
     I have no reason to doubt, but that the soft-billed birds, which winter with us, subsist chiefly on insects in their aurelia state. All the species of wagtails, in severe weather, haunt shallow streams, near their spring-heads, where they never freeze ; and, by wading, pick out the aurelias of the genus phrygane&amp;j^ &amp;e.

The great titmouse, driven by stress of weather, much frequents houses ; and, in deep snows, I have seen this bird, while it hung with its back downwards, (to my no small delight and admiration,) draw straws lengthwise from out the eaves of thatched houses, in order to pull out the flies that were concealed between them, and that in such numbers that they quite defaced the thatch, and gave it a ragged appearance,

We have more than once seen a little hero of a blue titmouse disputing the right of a hen to feed from the same dish with him. In Loudon's Magazine, a correspondent says that this species destroys bees, " which it eifects by rapping with its bill at the entrance of the hive, and killing the insects as they come out.

     * The Highlands of Scotland are separated from that portion of North Britain termed the Lowlands, by a lofty range of granitic mountains, called the Grampians, which is the only line of demarkation between these distinct divisions of the kingdom. The physical structure of this chain is as remarkable as the general direction is striking, regular, and continuous, forming a grand natural boundary of sublime and romantic peaks, commencing north of the river Don, in the county of Aberdeen, and intersecting the kingdom in a diagonal direction, till it terminates in the south-west, beyond Ardmore, in the county of Dunbarton. This barrier presents a bold, rocky, and precipitous aspect. Many places of the south front consist of a species of breccia. In the centre, and following the range, is a bed of limestone, of vast extent, which contains many strata of slate, and a marble which takes a fine polish, the prevailing colours of which are blue, green, and brown, intermixed with streaks of pure white. A very valuable quarry of green marble has been recently wrought in Glentilt. In the districts of Fortingall, Strathfillan, and Glenlyon, quantities of lead and silver ore have been found.

     DEAR SIR, On September the 21st, 1741, being then on a visit, and intent on field diversions, I rose before daybreak ; when I came into the enclosures, I found the stubbles and clover grounds matted all over with a thick coat of cobweb, in the meshes of which, a copious and heavy dew hung so plen- tifully that the whole face of the country seemed, as it were, covered with two or three setting-nets drawn one over another. When the dogs attempted to hunt, their eyes were so blinded and hoodwinked that they could not proceed, but were obliged to lie down and scrape the encumbrances from their faces with their fore feet ; so that, finding my sport interrupted, I returned home, musing in my mind on the oddness of the occurrence.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_31410">
     As the morning advanced, the sun became bright and warm, and the day turned out one of those most lovely ones which no season but the autumn produces, cloudless, calm, serene, and worthy of the south of Erance itself.

     These webs were not single filmy threads, floating in the air in all directions, but perfect flakes, or rags : some near an

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_31530">
     How far this wonderful shower extended, would be difficult to say ; but we know that it reached Bradley, Selborne, and Alresford, three places which lie in a sort of triangle, the shortest of whose sides is about eight miles in extent.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_31550">
     At the second of those places, there was a gentleman, (for whose veracity and intelligent turn we have the greatest veneration,) who observed it the moment he got abroad ; but concluded that, as soon as he came upon the hill above his house, where he took his morning rides, he should be higher than this meteor, which he imagined might have been blown, like thistle-down, from the common above ; but, to his great astonishment, when he rode to the most elevated part of the down, three hundred feet above his fields, he found the webs, in appearance, still as much above him as before ; still des- cending into sight in constant succession, and twinkling in the sun, so as to draw the attention of the most incurious.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_31570">
     Neither before nor after, was any such fall observed ; but on this day, the flakes hung in the trees and hedges so thick, that a diligent person sent out might have gathered baskets full.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_31590">
     The remark that I shall make on these cobweb-like appear- ances, called gossamer, is, that strange and superstitious as the notions about them were formerly, nobody in these days doubts but that they are the real production of small spiders, which swarm in the fields in fine weather in autumn, and have a power of shooting out webs from their tails, so as to render themselves buoyant and lighter than air. But why these apterous insects should that day take such a wonderful aerial excursion, and why their webs should at once become so gross and material as to be considerably more weighty than air, and to descend with precipitation, is a matter beyond my skill. If I might be allowed to hazard a supposition, I should imagine that those filmy threads, when first shot, might be entangled in the rising dew, and so drawn up, spiders and all, by a brisk evaporation, into the regions where clouds are formed ; and if the spiders have a power of coiling and thickening their webs in the air, as Dr Lister says they have, [see his Letters
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_31610">
     GOSSAMER.

     to Mr Ray,] then, when they were become heavier than the air, they must fall.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_31650">
     Every day in fine weather, in autumn chiefly, do I see those spiders shooting out their webs and mounting aloft : they will go off from your finger, if you will take them into your hand. Last summer, one alighted on my book as I was reading in the parlour ; and, running to the top of the page, and shooting out a web, took its departure from thence. But what I most wondered at was, that it went off with considerable velocity in a place where no air was stirring ; and I am sure that I did not assist it with rny breath. So that these little crawlers seem to have, while mounting, some locomotive power without the use of wings, and to move in the air faster than the air itself. *
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_31670">
     * Gossamer has been long noticed both by poets and naturalists. It is now known to be produced by several different kinds of spiders, particu- larly the flying ones. Mr Murray, who has given much attention to the economy of these insects, says, they have the power of projecting their threads to a considerable distance, and by this means transporting them- selves from the ground to any elevation in the atmosphere, or from the apex of one object to another. He is of opinion that the threads of their web are electric, or so influenced by that subtle element, that buoyancy is imparted, and the baseless shrouds of this aerial voyager are, together with their fabricator, raised into the higher regions of the air.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_31690">
     Most spiders, when crawling over uneven surfaces, leave behind them a thread, serving as a cable, or line of suspension, lest they should foil, or be blown from their eminence ; so that nearly the whole surface of the ground is covered with the net work of these singular animals. Besides the ground spiders, other wanderers contribute to these accumulations, which, however delicate, are at the same time durable. That this tissue is always on the increase, may be noticed by following a plough for a short space ; for no sooner has it finished one ridge, than the fresh mould turned up is equally interlaced with innumerable threads, which glisten in the sun's rays, and can only be accounted for by the circumstance mentioned by Mr Murray, that during fine weather the air is filled with these excursive webs of the aranea aeronautica. The spider is often seen at the end of its thread, with extended limbs, balancing itself like a bird, and invariably floating before the wind. The same gentleman, however, says, he has seen threads projected in a close room, where there was no current of air to carry them in a direct line, which is an interesting'fact.

     Mr Murray thinks that electricity, either positive or negative, is an active agent in the movement of the spiders' webs ; which opinion has been combated by Mr Bakewell, who asserts, that they have not the power of propelling their webs without assistance from the wind, and that the cobwebs seen floating in the air are raised from the surface of the ground by the action of air, highly rarified by a cloudless sun.

     DEAR SIR, There is a wonderful spirit of sociality in the brute creation, independent of sexual attachment : the con- gregating of gregarious birds in the winter is a remarkable instance.

     Many horses, though quiet with company, will not stay one minute in a field by themselves ; the strongest fences cannot restrain them. My neighbour's horse will not only not stay by himself abroad, but. he will not bear to be left alone in a strange stable, without discovering the utmost impatience, and endea- vouring to break the rack and manger with his fore feet. He has been known to leap out at a stable window, through which dung was thrown, after company ; and yet, in other respects, is remarkably quiet. Oxen and cows will not fatten by themselves ; ' but will neglect the finest pasture that is not recommended by society. It would be needless to instance in sheep, which constantly flock together. *

     * There were two Hanoverian horses, which had assisted in drawing the same gun during the whole Peninsular War, in the German brigade of artillery. One of them met his death in an engagement ; after which the survivor was picqueted as usual, and his food was brought to him. He refused to eat, and kept constantly turning his head round to look for his companion, and sometimes calling him by a neigh. Every care was taken, and all means that could be thought of were adopted, to make him eat, but without effect. Other horses surrounded him on all sides, but he paid no attention to them ; his whole demeanour indicated the deepest sorrow, and he died from hunger, not having tasted a bit from the time his companion fell.

     But this propensity seems not to be confined to animals of the same species ; for we know a doe, still alive, that was brought up from a little fawn with a dairy of cows ; with them it goes afield, and with them it returns to the yard. The dogs of the house take no notice of this deer, being used to her ; but, if strange dogs come by, a chase ensues ; while the master smiles to see his favourite securely leading her pursuers over hedge, or gate, or stile, till she returns to the cows, who, with fierce lo wings, and menacing horns, drive the assailants quite out of the pasture.

     Even great disparity of kind and size does not always prevent social advances and mutual fellowship. For a very intelligent and observant person has assured me, that, in the former part of his life, keeping but one horse, he happened also on a time to have but one solitary hen. These two incongruous animals spent much of their time together, in a lonely orchard, where they saw no creature but each other. By degrees, an apparent regard began to take place between these two sequestered individuals. The fowl would approach the quadruped with notes of complacency, rubbing herself gently against his legs ; while the horse would look down with satisfaction, and move with the greatest caution and circum- spection, lest he should trample on his diminutive companion. Thus, by mutual good offices, each seemed to console the vacant hours of the other ; so that Milton, when he puts the

Instead of being afraid of its two old acquaintances, the dog and the cat, it now treated them as inferiors, and arrogated to itself the place which it had previously obtained by humble solicitation. This interesting pet was at last choked by a bone which it had swallowed."

     The following singular presentiment in a goose is related by Mr C. A. Brew, of Ennis : " An old goose, that had been for a fortnight hatching in a farmer's kitchen, was perceived on a sudden to be taken violently ill. She soon after left the nest, and repaired to an outhouse, where there was a young goose of the past year, which she brought with her into the kitchen. The young one immediately scrambled into the old one's nest, sat, hatched, and afterwards brought up the brood. The old goose, as soon as the young one had taken her place, sat down by the side of the nest, and shortly after died. As the young goose had never been in the habit of entering the kitchen before, it would be difficult to account for this fact, except by supposing that the old one had some way of communicating her anxieties, which the other was perfectly able to understand.

     DEAR SIR, We have two gangs, or hordes of gipsies, which infest the south and west of England, and come round in their circuit two or three times in the year. One of these tribes calls itself by the noble name of Stanley, of which I have nothing particular to say ; but the other is distinguished by an appellative somewhat remarkable. As far as their harsh gibberish can be understood, they seem to say that the name of their clan is Curleople : now the termination of this word is apparently Grecian ; and, as Mezeray and the gravest historians all agree that these vagrants did certainly migrate from Egypt and the East, two or three centuries ago, * and so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_32130">
     * The gipsies first attracted notice in the beginning of the fifteenth century, and, within a few years afterwards, they had spread themselves all over the Continent. The earliest mention which is made of them was in the years 1414 and 1417, when they were observed in Germany. In 1418, they were found in Switzerland"; in 1422, in Italy; and, in 1427, they are mentioned as having been seen in the neighbourhood of Paris, and about the same time in Spain. In England they were not known till some time after. One remarkable part of their history is, their continuing the same unsettled mode of life, and rigidly keeping apart from all other people. It is impossible to find a greater similarity in the traits of character, and the manners exhibited by different tribes of the same family, than that which is observable amongst the gipsies of the different countries of Europe, under whatever appellation they are known. The habits of the cygani of Hungary, the gitano of Spain, the zigenners of Transylvania, the zingari of Italy, the bohemien of France, the gipsy of England, and the tinkler of Scotland, are identical ; whether we regard their physical distinction, or their mode of subsistence.

     Their features and complexion mark them of eastern origin. Grell- man thinks them Hindoos of the lowest class; and a comparison of the language of that people with a list of about four hundred words pos- sessed by him goes far to prove a national connection. There is, besides, some striking coincidences in the construction of the languages. He attributes their appearance to the cruel war of devastation carried on by Timur-Beg in 1408-9, and supposes them to be fugitives from their native land, and that they passed through the desert of Persia, and along the Gulf of Persia, through Arabia Petrea, over the Isthmus of Suez, into

     Egypt, and, entering Europe from thence, have brought with them the name Egyptians, which has been corrupted in England into gipsies.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_32230">
     This opinion seems to have been early entertained, but soon forgotten ; for we find that Hieronymus Foroliviensis, in the nineteenth volume of Muratori, says, that, on the 7th day of August, A.D. 1432, two hundred of the cingari came to his native town, and halted there two days on their journey to Rome, and that some of them said they came from India " et, ut atidivi, aliqui dicebant quod erant India." Munster, who, in 1524, conversed with one of the cingari, found that bis belief was, the tribe had come from that country.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_32250">
     The Abbe Dubois says, that in every country of the Peninsula, great numbers of families are to be found, whose ancestors were obliged to emigrate thither in times of trouble or famine from their native land, and to establish themselves amongst strangers. But the most remarkable feature in their history is, that these colonists preserve their own language, from generation to generation, as well as their national peculiarities. Many families might be pointed out who have continued four or five hundred years in particular districts without approximating in the least to the manners, fashions, or language, of the tribes among whom they have been naturalized.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_32270">
     Leaving this species of evidence, we shall proceed to one which seems to afford more conclusive proofs than any other of the Hindoo origin of the gipsies ; namely, a short vocabulary of words, collected from the gipsy of England, the giatano of Spain, and the cygani of Hungary; and if we make allowance for the corruptions, which must necessarily have crept in amongst people wandering through countries whose language was not only distinct from their own, but also unconnected with each other, we shall not wonder at the slight difference, seeing the great variety of provincial dialect spoken even in Britain itself :

     With regard to those peculiar people, the gipsies, one thing is very remarkable, and especially as they came from warmer climates ; and that is, that while other beggars lodge in barns, stables, and cow-houses, these sturdy savages seem to pride themselves in braving the severities of winter, and in living sub dio the whole year round. Last September was as wet a month as ever was known ; and yet, during those deluges, did a young gipsy girl lie in the midst of one of our hop-gardens, on the cold ground, with nothing over her but a piece of a blanket, extended on a few hazel rods bent hoop fashion, and stuck into the earth at each end, in circumstances too trying for a cow in the same condition : yet within this garden there was a large hop-kiln, into the chambers of which she might have retired, had she thought shelter an object worthy her attention.

     Ludolf, in the seventeenth century, collected from certain wandering tribes, which he met in ^Ethiopia and Nubia, a vocabulary of thiry-eight words. These were so fortunately selected, that a counterpart has, in almost every instance, offered itself, both from the language of Hindostan, and from that of the European gipsy. This fact recalls an observation made by Sir William Jones, though it may bear but little upon the question that the ancient Egyptian and Sanscrit are probably the same. ED.

     I shall make no apology for troubling you with the detail of a very simple piece of domestic economy, being satisfied that you think nothing beneath your attention that tends to utility : the matter alluded to is the use of rushes instead of candles, which I arn well aware prevails in many districts besides this ; but as I know there are countries also where it does not obtain, and as I have considered the subject with some degree of exactness, I shall proceed in my humble story, and leave you to judge of the expediency.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_32920">
     The proper species of rush for this purpose seems to be the juncus conglomerate, or common soft rush, which is to be found in most moist pastures, by the sides of streams, and under hedges.* These rushes are in best condition in the height of summer ; but may be gathered, so as to serve the purpose well, quite on to autumn. It would be needless to add, that the largest and longest are best. Decayed labourers, women, and children, make it their business to procure and prepare them. As soon as they are cut, they must be flung into water, and kept there ; for otherwise they will dry and shrink, and the peel will not run. At first, a person would find it no easy matter to divest a rush of its peel, or rind, so as to leave one regular, narrow, even rib, from top to bottom, that may support the pith; but this, like other feats, soon becomes familiar, even to children ; and we have seen an old woman, stone blind, performing this business with great des- patch, and seldom failing to strip them with the nicest

     * In many of the northern parts of Scotland rushes were formerly used in place of cotton for wicks to lamps, which, in Perthshire and the adjoining counties, are termed crozeys. They are much more durable than cotton. In Zetland, a shell, the fusus antiquus of Lamark, suspended horizontally by a cord, was formerly used as a lamp, the canal of the shell serving as a cavity for the reception of the rush-wick. In various places of the same districts, ropes for tethering cattle were formed of rushes by the peasantry during their idle hours, and also by herd boys. If firmly platted, they were pretty durable. We have seen them often used in the north. ED.

     regularity. When these junci are thus far prepared, they must lie out on the grass to be bleached, and take the dew for some nights, and afterwards be dried in the sun.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_33000">
     Some address is required in dipping these rushes in the scalding fat, or grease ; but this knack also is to be attained by practice. The careful wife of an industrious Hampshire labourer obtains all her fat for nothing, for she saves the scummings of her bacon-pot for this use ; and, if the grease abounds with salt, she causes the salt to precipitate to the bottom, by setting the scummings in a warm oven. Where hogs are not much in use, and especially by the sea-side, the coarser animal oils will come very cheap. A pound of common grease may be procured for fourpence ; and about six pounds of grease will dip a pound of rushes ; and one pound of rushes may be bought for one shilling ; so that a pound of rushes, medicated and ready for use, will cost three shillings. If men that keep bees will mix a little wax with the grease, it will give it a consistency, and render it more cleanly, and make the rushes burn longer : mutton suet would have the same effect.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_33020">
     A good rush, which measured in length two feet four inches and a half, being minuted, burnt only three minutes short of an hour ; and a rush of still greater length has been known to burn one hour and a quarter.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_33040">
     These rushes give a good, clear light. Watch-lights, (coated with tallow,) it is true, shed a dismal one " darkness visible ;" but then the wicks of those have two ribs of the rind, or peel, to support the pith, while the wick of the dipped rush has but one. The two ribs are intended to impede the progress of the flame, and make the candle last.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_33060">
     In a pound of dry rushes, avoirdupois, which I caused to be weighed and numbered, we found upwards of one thousand six hundred individuals. Now, suppose each of these burns, one with another, only half an hour, then a poor man will purchase eight hundred hours of light, a time exceeding thirty- three entire days, for three shillings. According to this account, each rush, before dipping, costs one thirty-third of a farthing, and one-eleventh afterwards. Thus a poor family will enjoy five and a half hours of comfortable light for a farthing. An experienced old housekeeper assures me, that one pound and a half of rushes completely supplies his family the year round, since working people burn no candle in the long days, because they rise and go to bed by daylight.

     While on the subject of rural economy, it may not be improper to mention a pretty implement of housewifery that we have seen nowhere else ; that is, little neat besoms which our foresters make from the stalks of the polytricum commune, or great golden maiden-hair, which they call silk-wood, and find plenty in the bogs.* When this moss is well combed and dressed, and divested of its outer skin, it becomes of a beautiful bright chestnut colour; and, being soft and pliant, is very proper for the dusting of beds, curtains, carpets, hangings, &amp;c.

     DEAR SIR, We had in this village, more than twenty years ago, an idiot boy, whom I well remember, who, from a child, shewed a strong propensity to bees ; they were his food, his amusement, his sole object. And as people of this cast have seldom more than one point in view, so this lad exerted all his few faculties on this one pursuit. In the winter, he dozed away his time, within his father's house, by the fire-side, in a kind of torpid state, seldom departing from the chimney corner ; but in the summer he was all alert, and in quest of his game in the fields, and on sunny banks. Honey-bees, humble- bees, and wasps, were his prey wherever he found them : he had no apprehensions from their stings, but would seize them nudis manibus, and at once disarm them of their weapons, and suck their bodies for the sake of their honey-bags. Sometimes he would fill his bosom, between his shirt and skin, with a number of these captives ; and sometimes would confine them

He has been known to overturn hives for the sake of honey, of which he was passionately fond. Where metheglin was making, he would linger round the tubs and vessels, begging a draught of what he called bee-wine.

     DEAR SIR, It is the hardest thing in the world to shake off superstitious prejudices : they are sucked in, as it were&gt; with our mother's milk ; and, growing up with us at the time when they take the fastest hold, and make the most lasting impressions, become so interwoven into our very constitutions, that the strongest good sense is required to disengage our- selves from them. No wonder, therefore, that the lower people retain them their whole lives through, since their minds are not invigorated by a liberal education, and therefore not enabled to make any efforts adequate to the occasion.

     In a farm-yard, near the middle of this village, stands, at this day, a row of pollard-ashes, which, by the seams and long cicatrices down their sides, manifestly shew that, in former times, they have been cleft asunder. These trees, when young and flexible, were severed and held open by wedges, while ruptured children, stripped naked, were pushed through the apertures, under a persuasion that, by such a process, the poor babes would be cured of their infirmity. As soon as the operation was over, the tree in the suffering part was plastered with loam, and carefully swathed up. * If the parts coalesced

     * Among the popular superstitions of Britain trees have always held a conspicuous place. There is hardly a county in the kingdom, or indeed a parish, that has not had its witch's thorn, or some such ominously named tree. Among the peasantry of Scotland, the mountain ash, which is termed the rowan tree, was considered a complete antidote against the effects of witchcraft ; and, in consequence, a twig of it was very commonly carried in the pocket : but that it might have complete efficacy, it was necessary that it should be accompanied by the following couplet, written on paper, wrapped round the wood, and secured by a red silk thread :

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_33560">
     An amber bead was supposed to have precisely the same effect ; if the red silk thread was attached to it with the above couplet, only the words " lammar bead" were substituted for rowan tree. Among the higher classes, amber beads were worn, and always strung with red silk thread. The Hindoos have a similar superstition, as remarked by Bishop Heber, near Boitpoor, in Upper Nilia. " I passed a fine tree of the mimosa, with leaves, at a little distance, so much resembling those of the mountain ash, that I was for a moment deceived, and asked if it did not bring fruit ? They answered, no ; but that it was a very noble tree, being called

One, indeed, they said, who was very renowned for his power (like Loorinite in the Kehama) of killing plants and drying up their sap with a look, had come to this very tree, and gazed on it intently ;

     If a magpie cross our path, when we first go out of a morning, it is considered a bad omen. Anglers, in spring, seeing a single magpie, augur a bad day's sport ; but^if there are two, the case is otherwise. We have no doubt the observation may generally hold true, as in cold weather the prudent magpies only leave their nests, one at a time, in search of food, the other remaining to keep the eggs warm. It is, therefore, only in mild weather that two are to be seen together ; and fish never take well, except in such weather. The magpie has always been esteemed an ominous bird ; the following old distich tells what the numbers of those seen at a time forebodes :

They imagined they saw the figure of a man on a white horse, holding in his hand a red sword, moving across the heavens, and that it foretold the present eventful* times, "wars and rumours of wars." Sailors for the most part will not whistle at sea, because, they say, it will raise the wind.

     At the south comer of the Plestor, or area, near the church, there stood, about twenty years ago, a very old, grotesque, hollow, pollard-ash, which for ages had been looked on with no small veneration as a shrew-ash. Now, a shrew-ash is an ash whose twigs or branches, when gently applied to the limbs of cattle, will immediately relieve the pains which a beast suffers from the running of a shrew-mouse over the part affected : for it is supposed that a shrew-mouse is of so baneful and deleterious a nature, that wherever it creeps over a beast, be it horse, cow, or sheep, the suffering animal is afflicted with cruel anguish, and threatened with the loss of the use of the limb. Against this accident, to which they were continually liable, our provident forefathers always kept a shrew-ash at hand, which, when once medicated, would maintain its virtue for ever. A shrew-ash was made thus:* Into the body of the tree, a deep hole was bored with an auger, and a poor devoted shrew-mouse was thrust in alive, and plugged in, no doubt, with several quaint incantations, long since forgotten. As the ceremonies necessary for such a consecration are no longer understood, all succession is at an end, and no such tree is known to subsist in the manor or hundred.

To supply the place of a fountain, however, Nature, ever bountiful, has bestowed upon this island a species of tree, unknown to all other parts of the world. It is of moderate size, and its leaves are straight, long, and evergreen. Around its summit a small cloud perpetually rests, which so drenches the leaves with moisture, that they continually distil upon the ground a stream of fine clear water. To these trees, as to perennial springs, the inhabitants of Ferro resort ; and are thus supplied with an abundance of water for themselves and for their cattle.

     Trees require a great quantity of water to supply their organs. This is given off in perspiration by their leaves. In the experiments of Hales on the quantity of water taken up by plants, it was found that a pear- tree, which weighed seventy-one pounds, absorbed fifteen pounds of water in six hours ; and that branches of an inch diameter, and from five to six feet high, sucked up from fifteen to thirty ounces in twelve hours.

Ivy leaves are smooth, and thick, and cold, and therefore condense very fast ; and besides, ever- greens imbibe very little.* These facts may furnish the intelligent with hints concerning what sorts of trees they should plant round small ponds that they would wish to be perennial ; and shew them how advantageous some trees are in preference to others.

To this orifice a bottle is attached to collect the flowing juice, which is limpid, watery, and sweetish, but retains something of both the taste and odour of the tree. One tree affords two or three gallons a day ; at the same time, it receives no perceptible injury from being thus bled, from which it would appear, that much of its moisture has at other times been given off through its leaves ; and, in all proba- bility, it acquires an increased action to supply the extra quantity which is thus drained from it.

     * There can be little doubt, that the moisture of climate is greatly influenced by trees. It has been remarked, after cutting down forests, particularly on high grounds, that the quantity of rain has been lessened, by diminishing, it is supposed, the attraction between the earth and the clouds. This fact has been experienced on a large scale in America. In Kentucky there are many brooks, now completely dry in summer, which afforded an abundant supply of water all the year round about twenty-five or thirty years ago ; and, in some parts of the state of New Jersey, where the woods have been extensively cleared away, many streams have altogether disappeared.

     The climate of Britain, it is very generally believed, has deteriorated by becoming much more changeable than it was sixty years ago. This has, with much probability, been attributed to the extent of planting, to the introduction of green crops, and abolition of fallows in an improved sys- tem of agriculture. Mr Murray is of opinion, that trees, by condensing the moisture of the air in foggy weather, materially affect the climate, and that thickly wooded countries must necessarily be colder, and more humid than naked savannahs. Trees are, therefore, it would seem, ready- conductors of aerial electricity, the climate being improved when woods are cleared away, and becoming more moist by planting. This fact receives corroboration from the history of our own country, as well as from that of North America. ED.

     To a thinking mind, few phenomena are more strange than the state of little ponds on the summits of chalk hills, many of which are never dry in the most trying droughts of summer ; on chalk hills, I say, because in many rocky and gravelly soils, springs usually break out pretty high on the sides of elevated grounds and mountains ; but no person acquainted with chalky districts will allow that they ever saw springs in such a soil but in valleys and bottoms, since the waters of so pervious a stratum as chalk all lie on one dead level, as well-diggers have assured me again and again,

     j* For the diminution of some of the lakes and rivers of America, we must seek other causes. About a thousand rivers and streams empty themselves into Lake Superior, sweeping into it earth, primitive boulder stones, and drift timber, which sometimes accumulate so much as to form islands in the estuaries. A lignite formation, indeed, is said to be now in progress, similar to that of Bovey in Devonshire. Within a mile of the share, the water is about seventy fathoms; within eight miles, one hundred and thirty-six fathoms ; and the greatest depth of the lake, farther from the shore, is unknown. Lake Erie, from similar causes, is gradually becoming shallower. Long Point, for example, has, in three years, gained no less than three miles on the water. ED.

The wall being completed, they bore through the bed of chalk, at the bottom, with a long auger, but take care to ascend from the pit before they draw out the instrument again : which when they have done, the water springs up into the well, and in a little time rises to the brim nay, sometimes over- flows the neighbouring grounds.

     containing perhaps not more than two or three hundred hogs- heads of water, yet never is known to fail, though it affords drink for three hundred or four hundred sheep, and for at least twenty head of large cattle besides. This pond, it is true, is overhung with two moderate beeches, that, doubtless, at times, afford it much supply; but then we have others as small, that, without the aid of trees, and in spite of evaporation from sun and wind, and perpetual consumption by cattle, yet constantly maintain a moderate share of water, without over- flowing in the wettest seasons, as they would do if supplied by springs. By my journal of May, 1775, it appears that " the small and even considerable ponds on the vales are now dried up, while the small ponds on the very tops of hills are but little affected." Can this difference be accounted for from evaporation alone, which certainly is more prevalent in bottoms ? or rather have not those elevated pools some unnoticed recruits, which in the night-time counterbalance the waste of the day ; without which, the cattle alone must soon exhaust them ? And here it will be necessary to enter more minutely into the cause. Dr Hales, in his Vegetable Statics, advances, from experiment, that " the moister the earth is, the more dew falls on it in a night ; and more than a double quantity of dew falls on an equal surface of moist earth." Hence we see that water, by its coolness, is enabled to assimi- late to itself a large quantity of moisture nightly by condensation ; and that the air, when loaded with fogs and vapours, and even with copious dews, can alone advance a considerable and never- failing resource.* Persons that are much abroad, and travel early and late, such as shepherds, fishermen, &amp;c. can tell what prodigious fogs prevail in the night on elevated downs, even in the hottest parts of summer ; and how much the surfaces of things are drenched by those swimming vapours, though, to the senses, all the while, little moisture seems to fall.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_34570">
     * Fogs are much more frequent in cold seasons, and cold countries, than in such as are warm ; because, in the former, the aqueous particles, being condensed almost as soon as they proceed from the surface of the earth, are incapable of rising into the higher portions of the atmosphere. If the cold be augmented, the fog freezes, attaching itself in small icicles to the branches of trees, and to the hair and clothes of persons exposed to it, to the blades of grass, and other substances.

According to this gentleman, the crop, or craw, of a cuckoo, does not lie before the sternum at the bottom of the neck, as in the gallmcB, columbce, &amp;c. but imme- diately behind it, on and over the bowels, so as to make a large protuberance in the belly.*
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_34680">
     Induced by this assertion, we procured a cuckoo ; and, cutting open the breast-bone, and exposing the intestines to sight, found the crop lying as mentioned above. This stomach was large and round, and stuffed hard, like a pin-cushion, with food, which, upon nice examination, we found to consist of various insects ; such "as small scarabs, spiders, and dragon- flies ; the last of which we have seen cuckoos catching on the wing, as they were just emerging out of the aurelia state. Among this farrago also were to be seen maggots, and many seeds, which belonged either to gooseberries, currants, cran- berries, or some such fruit ; so that these birds apparently subsist on insects and fruits ; nor was there the least appear- ance of bones, feathers, or fur, to support the idle notion of their being birds of prey,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_34700">
     The sternum in this bird seemed to us to be remarkably short, between which and the anus lay the crop, or craw, and, immediately behind that, the bowels against the back-bone.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_34720">
     It must be allowed, as this anatomist observes, that the crop, placed just below the bowels, must, especially when full, be in a very uneasy situation during the business of incubation ; yet the test will be, to examine whether birds that are actually known to sit for certain are not formed in a similar manner.

     Sir William Jardine says, that when cuckoos have fed much on some of the large hairy caterpillars so common on the northern moors, the stomach becomes coated with the short hairs, which may have given rise to the opinion that they are predatory. But has not Sir William mistaken the fibrous structure of the stomach for these hairs ? Its American congeners, the yellow-billed cuckoo, and the black-billed cuckoo, rob birds of their effgs ; and the latter feeds on fresh water shell-fish. ED.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_34800">
     This inquiry I proposed to myself to make with a fern-owl, or goat-sucker, as soon as opportunity offered : because, if their formation proves the same, the reason for incapacity in the cuckoo will be allowed to have been taken up somewhat hastily.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_34820">
     Not long after, a fern-owl was procured, which, from its habits and shape, we suspected might resemble the cuckoo in its internal construction. Nor were our suspicions ill grounded ; for, upon the dissection, the crop, or craw, also lay behind the sternum, immediately on the viscera, between them and the skin of the belly. It was bulky, and stuffed hard with large phakEnce, moths of several sorts, and their eggs, which, no doubt, had been forced out of these insects by the action of swallowing.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_34840">
     Now, as it appears that this bird, which is so well known to practise incubation, is formed in a similar manner with cuckoos, Monsieur Herissant's conjecture, that cuckoos are incapable of incubation from the disposition of their intestines, seems to fall to the ground : and we are still at a loss for the cause of that strange and singular peculiarity in the instance of the cuculus canorus.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_34860">
     We found the case to be the same with the ring-tail hawk, in respect to formation ; and, as far as I can recollect, with the swift ; and probably it is so with many more sorts of birds that are not granivorous.

     DEAR SIR, On August the 4th, 1775, we surprised a large viper, which seemed very heavy and bloated, as it lay in the grass, basking in the sun. When we came to cut it up, we found that the abdomen was crowded with young, fifteen in number ; the shortest of which measured full seven inches, and were about the size of full-grown earth-worms. This little fry issued into the world with the true viper spirit about them, shewing great alertness as soon as disengaged from the belly of the dam : they twisted and wriggled about, and set them- selves up, and gaped very wide, when touched with a stick, shewing manifest tokens of menace and defiance, though as yet they had no manner of fangs that we could find, even with the help of our glasses.

     To a thinking mind, nothing is more wonderful than that early instinct which impresses young animals with the notion of the situation of their natural weapons, and of using them properly in their own defence, even before those weapons subsist or are formed. * Thus a young cock will spar at his adversary before his spurs are grown ; and a calf or lamb will push with their heads before their horns are sprouted. In the same manner did these young adders attempt to bite before their fangs were in being. The dam, however, was furnished with very formidable ones, which we lifted up, (for they fold down when not used,) and cut them off with the point of our scissars.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_34970">
     There was little room to suppose that this brood had ever been in the open air before, and that they were taken in for refuge, at the mouth of the dam, when she perceived that danger was approaching ; because then, probably, we should have found them somewhere in the neck, and not in the abdomen.

     Thus far it is plain, that the deprivation of masculine vigour puts a stop to the growth of those parts or appendages that are looked upon as its insignia. But the ingenious Mr Lisle, in his book on husbandry, carries it much farther ; for he says, that the loss of those insignia alone has sometimes a strange effect on the ability itself. He had a boar so fierce and venereous that, to prevent mischief, orders were given for his tusks to be broken off. No sooner had the beast suffered this injury than his powers forsook him, and he neglected those females to whom before he was passionately attached, and from whom no fences could restrain him.

     My friend had a little helpless leveret brought to him, which the servants fed with milk in a spoon, and, about the same time, his cat kittened, and the young were despatched and buried. The hare was soon lost, and supposed to be gone the way of most foundlings, to be killed by some dog or cat. However, in about a fortnight, as the master was sitting in his garden, in the dusk of the evening, he observed his cat, with tail erect, trotting towards him, and calling with little short inward notes of complacency, such as they use towards their kittens, and something gamboling after, which proved to be the leveret that the cat had supported with her milk, and continued to support with great affection.

     This strange affection probably was occasioned by that desiderium, those tender maternal feelings, which the loss of her kittens had awakened in her breast ; and by the compla- cency and ease she derived to herself from procuring her teats to be drawn, which were too much distended with milk ; till, from habit, she became as much delighted with this foundling, as if it had been her real offspring.

Soon afterwards, the girl discovered that one of the larks had been taken out of the cage, and, on searching for it, found that the cat, whose only kitten died a day or two before, had carried the bird to the place where she usually nurtured her offspring, and was trying every method to make it suckle her ; and when the lark attempted to get away, she still detained it, evincing the utmost anxiety for its safety. The girl, however, caught the bird, and placed it in the cage, which she hung in a situation beyond the reach of the cat. A few days after, several more birds were brought to the house, one of which the persevering cat also stole, and again tried, by all the endearing acts in her power, to make this likewise accept of her nourishment.

     DEAR SIR, Lands that are subject to frequent inundations, are always poor ; and, probably, the reason may be, because the worms are drowned. The most insignificant insects and reptiles are of much more consequence, and have much more influence in the economy of Nature, than the incurious are aware of ; and are mighty in their effect, from their minuteness, which renders them less an object of attention ; and from their numbers and fecundity. * Earth-worms, though in appearance a small and despicable link in the chain of Nature, yet, if lost, would make a lamentable chasm. For to say nothing of half the birds, and some quadrupeds, which are almost entirely supported by them, worms seem to be the great promoters of vegetation, which would proceed but lamely without them, by boring, perforating, and loosening the soil, and rendering it pervious to rains and the fibres of plants, by drawing straws and stalks of leaves into it ; and, most of all, by throwing up such infinite numbers of lumps of earth, called worm-casts,

     * The earth-worm has been long considered a viviparous animal, but M. Leon Dufour seems to have determined that it is oviparous. The eggs are of a very peculiar structure, being long, tapering, and terminated at each end by a pencil of fringed membranaceous substance. They have more the appearance, indeed, of a chrysalis or cocoon than of an egg ; but their pulp, c. prove them to be true eggs. The worms, when hatched, are very agile, and, when disturbed, will sometimes retreat for safety within the shell, which they have just quitted, or instinctively dig into the clay.

But these men would find, that the earth without worms would soon become cold, hard-bound, and void of fermentation, and consequently steril : and, besides, in favour of worms it should be hinted, that green corn, plants, and flowers are not so much injured by them as by many species of coleoptera (scarabs) and tipulcs (long-legs,) in their larva or grub state ; and by unnoticed myriads of small shell-less snails, called slugs, which silently and imperceptibly make amazing havoc in the field and garden.*

     A curious fact respecting the swallow was mentioned by our late worthy friend and intelligent naturalist, Captain Dougal Carmichael. It appears that swallows are birds of passage at the southern extremity of Africa, as well as in other parts of the world. They return to the Cape of Good Hope in September, and quit it again in March and April. A pair of these birds (liirundo capensis} fixed their flask-shaped nest against the angle formed by the wall with the board which supported the eaves. This nest had a single aperture, by which the birds went in and out. It fell down after the young quitted it. On the February following, these birds built in the same place ; but on this occasion Captain Carmichael remarked, in the construction of the nest, an improvement which can hardly be referred to the dictates of mere instinct. It was formed with an opening at both sides, and the swallows invariably entered at the one, and came out at the other. One advantage obtained by this arrangement was, that its occupants were saved the trouble of turning round in the nest, and thus avoided the risk of any derangement in its internal economy. But the chief object appeared to be, to facilitate their escape from the attacks of serpents, which harbour in the roofs of thatched houses, or crawl up along the wall, and not unfrequently devour both the mother and her young.

The preceding day was wet and blustering, but the fourth was dark, and mild, and soft, the wind at south-west, and the thermometer at 58^ ; a pitch not common at that season of the year. Moreover, it may not be amiss to add in this place, that whenever the thermometer is above 50, the bat comes flitting out in every autumnal and winter month.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_36100">
     From all these circumstances laid together, it is obvious that torpid insects, reptiles, and quadrupeds, are awakened from their profoundest slumbers by a little untimely warmth ; and, therefore, that nothing so much promotes this deathlike stupor as a defect of heat. And farther, it is reasonable to suppose, that two whole species, or at least many individuals of these two species of British hirundines^ do never leave this island at all, but partake of the same benumbed state ; for we cannot suppose that, after a month's absence, house-martens can return from southern regions to appear for one morning in November, or that house-swallows should leave the districts of Africa to enjoy, in March, the transient summer of a couple of days.

     DEAR SIR, There was, in this village, several years ago, a miserable pauper, who, from his birth, was afflicted with a leprosy, as far as we are aware, of a singular kind, since it affected only the palms of his hands and the soles of his feet. This scaly eruption usually broke out twice in the year, at the spring and fall ; and by peeling away, left the skin so thin and tender, that neither his hands nor feet were able to perform their functions ; so that the poor object was half his time on crutches, incapable of employ, and languishing in a tiresome state of indolence and inactivity. His habit was lean, lank, and cadaverous. In this sad plight, he dragged on a miserable existence, a ; burden to^ himself and his parish, which was obliged to support him, till he was relieved by death, at more than thirty years of age.

     children by the doctrine of longing, said that his mother felt a violent propensity for oysters, which she was unable to gratify, and that the black rough scurf on his hands and feet were the shells of that fish. We knew his parents, neither of whom were lepers : his father, in particular, lived to be far advanced in years.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_36250">
     In all ages, the leprosy has made dreadful havoc among mankind. The Israelites seem to have been greatly afflicted with it from the most remote times, as appears from the pecu- liar and repeated injunctions given them in the Levitical law, * Nor was the rancour of this foul disorder much abated in the last period of their commonwealth, as may be seen in many passages of the New Testament.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_36270">
     Some centuries ago, this horrible distemper prevailed all over Europe ; and our forefathers were by no means exempt, as appears by the large provision made for objects labouring under this calamity. There was an hospital for female lepers in the diocese of Lincoln, a noble one near Durham, three in London and Southwark, and perhaps many more in or near our great towns and cities. Moreover, some crowned heads, and other wealthy and charitable personages, bequeathed large legacies to such poor people as languished under this hopeless infirmity.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_36290">
     It must, therefore, in these days, be, to a humane and thinking person, a matter of equal wonder and satisfaction, when he contemplates how nearly this pest is eradicated, and observes that a leper is now a rare sight. He will, moreover, when engaged in such a train of thought, naturally inquire for the reason. This happy change, perhaps, may have originated and been continued from the much smaller quantity of salted meat and fish now eaten in these kingdoms from the use of linen next the skin from the plenty of better bread and from the profusion of fruits, roots, legumes, and greens, so common in every family, Three or four centuries ago, before there were any enclosures, sown grasses, field turnips, or field carrots, or hay, all the cattle that had grown fat in summer, and were not killed for winter use, were turned out soon after Michaelmas to shift as they could through the dead months ;

     Leprosy is closely allied to scurvy ; and certainly has been nearly eradicated, from the causes pointed out by our author, with the use of tea, coffee, and other diluting diet. Medical practitioners treat it in thy same manner as scurvy. The case here noticed has been certainly a peculiar one. En.

     so that no fresh meat could be had in winter or spring. Hence the marvellous account of the vast stores of salted flesh found in the larder of the eldest Spencer,* in the days of Edward the Second, even so late in the spring as the third of May. It was from magazines like these that the turbulent barons supported in idleness their riotous swarms of retainers, ready for any disorder or mischief. But agriculture has now arrived at such a pitch of perfection, that our best and fattest meats are killed in the winter ; and no man needs eat salted flesh, unless he prefer it, that has money to buy fresh.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_36410">
     One cause of this distemper might be, no doubt, the quantity of wretched fresh and salt fish consumed by the commonalty at all seasons, as well as in Lent, which our poor now would hardly be persuaded to touch.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_36430">
     The use of linen changes, shirts or shifts, in the room of sordid or filthy woollen, long worn next the skin, is a matter of neatness comparatively modern, but must prove a great means of preventing cutaneous ails. At this very time, woollen instead of linen prevails among the poorer Welsh, who are subject to foul eruptions.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_36450">
     The plenty of good wheaten bread that now is found among all ranks of people in the south, instead of that miserable sort which used in old days to be made of barley or beans, may contribute not a little to the sweetening their blood and cor- recting their juices ; for the inhabitants of mountainous districts, to this day, are still liable to the itch and other cutaneous disorders, from a wretchedness and poverty of diet.

     As to the produce of a garden, every middle-aged person of observation may perceive, within his own memory, both in town and country, how vastly the consumption of vegetables is increased. Green stalls in cities now support multitudes in a comfortable state, while gardeners get fortunes. Every decent labourer, also, has his garden, which is half his support, as well as his delight ; and common farmers provide plenty of beans, pease, and greens, for their hinds to eat with their bacon ; and those few that do not are despised for their sordid parsimony, and looked upon as regardless of the welfare of their dependents. Potatoes have prevailed in this little district, by means of premiums, within these twenty years only, and are much esteemed here now by the poor, who would scarce have ventured to taste them in the last reign.

     Our Saxon ancestors certainly had some sort of cabbage, because they call the month of February sprout-cale ; * but long after their days, the cultivation of gardens was little attended to. The religious, being men of leisure, and keeping up a constant correspondence with Italy, were the first people among us who had gardens and fruit trees in any perfection, within the walls of their abbeys and priories. The barons neglected every pursuit that did not lead to war, or tend to the pleasure of the chase.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_36550">
     It was not till gentlemen took up the study of horticulture themselves that the knowledge of gardening made such hasty advances. Lord Cobham, Lord Ila, and Mr Waller of Bea- consfield, were some of the first people of rank that promoted the elegant science of ornamenting, without despising the superintendence of the kitchen quarters and fruit walls.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_36570">
     A remark made by the excellent Mr Ray, in his Tour of Europe, at once surprises us, and corroborates what has been advanced above; for we find him observing, so late as his days, that " the Italians use several herbs for salads, which are not yet, or have not been but lately, used in England, viz. seller'^ (celery,) which is nothing else but the sweet smallage, the young shoots whereof, with a little of the head of the root cut off, they eat raw with oil and pepper." And farther, he adds, " curled endive, blanched, is much used beyond seas, and, for a raw salad, seemed to excel lettuce itself." Now this journey was undertaken no longer ago than in the year 1663.

     DEAR SIR, In a district so diversified as this, so full of hollow vales and hanging woods, it is no wonder that echoes should abound. Many we have discovered, that return the cry of a pack of dogs, the notes of a hunting horn, a tunable ring of bells, or the melody of birds, very agreeably ; but we were still at a loss for a polysyllabical articulate echo, till a young gentleman, who had parted from his company in a summer evening walk, and was calling after them, stumbled upon a very curious one, in a spot where it might least be expected. At first, he was much surprised, and could not be persuaded but that he was mocked by some boy ; but repeating his trials in several languages, and finding his respondent to be a very adroit polyglot, he then discerned the deception.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_36760">
     This echo, in an evening before rural noises cease, would repeat ten syllables most articulately and distinctly, especially if quick dactyls were chosen. The last syllables of

     Tityre, tu patulse recubans

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_36800">
     were as audibly and intelligibly returned as the first; and there is no doubt, could trial have been made, but that at midnight, when the air is very elastic, and a dead stillness prevails, one or two syllables more might have been obtained ; but the distance rendered so late an experiment very inconvenient.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_36820">
     Quick dactyls, we observed, succeeded best ; for when we came to try its powers in slow, heavy, embarrassed spondees, of the same number of syllables,

     * There is a very extraordinary echo at a ruined fortress near Lourain in France. If a person sings, he only hears his own voice, without any repetition ; on the contrary, those who stand at some distance, hear the echo, but not the voice ; but then they hear it with surprising variations, sometimes louder, sometimes softer, now more near, then more distant.

     ECHOES.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_36920">
     All echoes have some one place to which they are returned stronger and more distinct than to any other; and that is always the place that lies at right angles with the object of repercussion, and is not too near, nor too far off. Buildings, or naked rocks, re-echo much more articulately than hanging woods or vales ; because, in the latter, the voice is, as it were, entangled, and embarrassed in the covert, and weakened in the rebound.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_36940">
     The true object of this echo, as we found by various experi- ments, is the stone-built, tiled hop-kiln in Gaily Lane, which measures in front forty feet, and from the ground to the eaves, twelve feet. The true centrum phonicum, or just distance, is one particular spot in the King's Field, in the path to Nore- hill, on the very brink of the steep balk above the hollow cart-way. In this case, there is no choice of distance ; but the path, by mere contingency, happens to be the lucky, the identical spot, because the ground rises or falls so immediately, if the speaker either retires or advances, that his mouth would at once be above or below the object.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_36960">
     We measured this polysyllabical echo with great exactness, and found the distance to fall very short of Dr Plot's rule for distinct articulation ; for the Doctor, in his History of Oxford- shire, allows one hundred and twenty feet for the return of each syllable distinctly ; hence this echo, which gives ten dis- tinct syllables, ought to measure four hundred yards, or one hundred and twenty feet to each syllable ; whereas our distance is only two hundred and fifty-eight yards, or near seventy-five feet to each syllable. * Thus our measure falls short of the Doctor's as five to eight ; but then it must be acknowledged, that this candid philosopher was convinced afterwards, that some latitude must be admitted of in the distance of echoes, according to time and place.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_36980">
     When experiments of this sort are making, it should always be remembered, that weather and the time of day have a vast

     There is an account in the Memoirs of the French Academy of a similar echo near Rouen. The building which returns it is a semicircular court- yard ; yet every one of the same form does not produce a similar effect. ED. * A knowledge of the progression of sound is not an article of mere steril curiosity, but in several instances useful ; for by this means we are enabled to determine the distance of ships, or other moving bodies. Suppose, for example, that a vessel fires a gun, the sound of which is heard five seconds after the flash is seen, as sound moves one thousand one hundred and forty-two English feet in a second, this number, multiplied by five, gives the distance of five thousand seven hundred and ten teet. The same principle is applicable in storms of lightning and thunder. ED,

     influence on an echo ; for a dull, heavy, moist air deadens and clogs the sound ; and hot sunshine renders the air thin and weak, and deprives it of all its springiness ; and a ruffling wind quite defeats the whole. In a still, clear, dewy evening, the air is most elastic ; and perhaps the later the hour the more so.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_37060">
     Echo has always been so amusing to the imagination, that the poets have personified her ; and, in their hands, she has been the occasion of many a beautiful fiction. Nor need the gravest man be ashamed to appear taken with such a pheno- menon, since it may become the subject of philosophical or mathematical inquiries.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_37080">
     One should have imagined that echoes, if not entertaining, must at least have been harmless and inoffensive : yet Virgil advances a strange notion, that they are injurious to bees. After enumerating some probable and reasonable annoyances, such as prudent owners would wish far removed from their bee-gardens, he adds,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_37100">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_37140">
     This wild and fanciful assertion will hardly be admitted by the philosophers of these days, especially as they all now seem agreed that insects are not furnished with any organs of hear- ing at all.* But if it should be urged, that, though they cannot hear, yet perhaps they may feel the repercussion of sounds, I grant it is possible they may. Yet that these impressions are distasteful or hurtful I deny, because bees, in good summers, thrive well in my outlet, where the echoes are very strong ; for this village is another Anathoth, a place of responses, or echoes. Besides, it does not appear from experiment that bees are in any way capable of being affected by sounds : for I have often tried my own with a large speaking trumpet held close to their hives, and with such an exertion of voice as would have hailed a ship at the distance of a mile, and still these insects pursued their various employments undisturbed, and without shewing the least sensibility or resentment.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_37160">
     * The organs of hearing in insects are the antennae, or horn-like processes, which stand out from the forehead. If these organs do not convey sound, in the same manner as the ears of other animals, they are, at least, very sensible of any concussion produced in the atmosphere by sounds, and if not the ears themselves, are, at least, analogous to them. The reflected sound of an echo cannot take place at less than fifty-five feet ; because it is necessary that the distance should be such, and the reverberated or reflected sound so long in arriving, that the ear may distinguish clearly between that and the original sound.

     Some time since its discovery, this echo is become totally silent, though the object, or hop-kiln, remains : nor is there any mystery in this defect, for the field between is planted as a hop-garden, and the voice of the speaker is totally absorbed and lost among the poles and entangled foliage of the hops. And when the poles are removed in autumn, the disappointment is the same ; because a tall quick-set hedge, nurtured up for the pur- pose of shelter to the hop-ground, entirely interrupts the impulse and repercussion of the voice : so that, till those obstructions are removed, no more of its garrulity can be expected.

     Should any gentleman of fortune think an echo in his park or outlet a pleasing incident, he might build one at little or no expense. For, whenever he had occasion for a new barn, stable, dog-kennel, or the like structure, it would be only need- ful to erect this building on the gentle declivity of a hill, with a like rising opposite to it, at a few hundred yards' distance ; and perhaps success might be the easier ensured could some canal, lake, or stream, intervene. From a seat at the centrum phonicum, he and his friends might amuse themselves sometimes of an evening with the prattle of this loquacious nymph ; of whose complacency and decent reserve, more may be said than can with truth of every individual of her sex ; since she is

     DEAR SIR, Among the many singularities attending those amusing birds, the swifts, I am now confirmed in the opinion that we have every year the same number of pairs invariably ; at least the result of my inquiry has been exactly the same for a long time past. The swallows and martens are so numerous, and so widely distributed over the village, that it is hardly possible to recount them ; while the swifts, though they do not all build in the church, yet so frequently haunt it, and play and rendezvous round it, that they are easily enumerated. The number that I constantly find are eight pairs, about half of which reside in the church, and the rest build in some of the lowest and meanest thatched cottages. * Now, as these eight pairs allowance being made for accidents breed yearly eight pairs more, what becomes annually of this increase ? and what determines, every spring, which pairs shall visit us, and re-occupy their ancient haunts ?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_37410">
     Ever since I have attended to the subject of ornithology, I have always supposed that the sudden reverse of affection, that strange avrnfrogyvi, which immediately succeeds in the feathered kind to the most passionate fondness, is the occasion of an equal dispersion of birds over the face of the earth. Without this provision, one favourite district would be crowded with inha- bitants, while others would be destitute and forsaken. But the parent birds seem to maintain a jealous superiority, and to oblige the young to seek for new abodes ; and the rivalry of the males in many kinds prevents their crowding the one on the other. Whether the swallows and house-martens return in the same exact number annually it is not easy to say, for reasons given above; but it is apparent, as I have remarked before in my Monographing, that the numbers returning bear no manner of proportion to the numbers retiring.

     DEAR SIR, The standing objection to botany has always been, that it is a pursuit that amuses the fancy and exercises the memory, without improving the mind, or advancing any real knowledge ; and, where the science is carried no farther than a mere systematic classification, the charge is but too true. But the botanist that is desirous of wiping off this aspersion, should be by no means content with a list of names ; he should study plants philosophically, should investigate the laws of vegetation, should examine the powers and virtues of efficacious herbs, should promote their cultivation, and graft the gardener, the planter, and the husbandman on the phytologist. Not that system is by any means to be thrown aside without system the field of Nature would be a pathless wilderness but sys- tem should be subservient to, not the main object of, pursuit.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_37540">
     Vegetation is highly worthy of our attention, and in itself is of the utmost consequence to mankind, and productive of many of the greatest comforts and elegancies of life. To plants we owe timber, bread, beer, honey, wine, oil, linen, cotton, &amp;c. what not only strengthens our hearts, and exhi- larates our spirits, but what secures us from inclemencies of weather, and adorns our persons. Man, in his true state of nature, seems to be subsisted by spontaneous vegetation ; in middle climes, where grasses prevail, he mixes some animal food with the produce of the field and garden ; and it is towards the polar extremes only, that, like his kindred bears and wolves, he gorges himself with flesh alone, and is driven to what hunger has never been known to compel the very beasts, to prey upon his own species.*
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_37560">
     The productions of vegetation have had a vast influence on the commerce of nations, and have been the great promoters of navigation, as may be seen in the articles of sugar, tea, tobacco, opium, ginseng, betel, pepper, &amp;c. As every climate has its peculiar produce, our natural wants bring on a mutual intercourse ; so that by means of trade, each distant part is supplied with the growth of every latitude. But, without the knowledge of plants and their culture, we must have been

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_37640">
     Instead of examining the minute distinctions of every various species of each obscure genus, the botanist should endeavour to make himself acquainted with those that are useful. You shall see a man readily ascertain every herb of the field, yet hardly know wheat from barley, or at least one sort of wheat or barley from another. *
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_37660">
     But of all sorts of vegetation, the grasses seem to be most neglected : neither the farmer nor the grazier seem to distin- guish the annual from trie perennial, the hardy from the tender, nor the succulent and nutritive from the dry and juiceless.-)-
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_37680">
     The study of grasses would be of great consequence to a northerly and grazing kingdom. The botanist that could improve the sward of the district where he lived, would be a useful member of society : to raise a thick turf on a naked soil, would be worth volumes of systematic knowledge ; and he would be the best commonwealth's man that could occasion the growth of "two blades of grass where one alone was seen before."

     DEAR SIR, In a district so diversified with such a variety of hill and dale, aspects and soils, it is no wonder that great choice of plants should be found. Chalks, clays, sands, sheep- walks and downs, bogs, heaths, woodlands, and champaign fields, cannot but furnish an ample flora.

     Of all the propensities of plants, none seem more strange than their different periods of blossoming. Some produce their flowers in the winter, or very first dawnings of spring ; many when the spring is established ; some at midsummer, and some not till autumn. When we see the helleborus fvetidus and helleborus niger blowing at Christmas, the helleborus hyemalis in January, and the helleborus viridis as soon as ever it emerges out of the ground, we do not wonder, because they are kindred plants that we expect should keep pace the one with the other ; but other congenerous vegetables differ so widely in their time of flowering, that we cannot but admire. I shall only instance at present in the crocus sativus, * the

     * Two species are generally admitted by botanists, the crocus sativus of Linnaeus, or saffron crocus, and the crocus vernus, the vernal crocus. Besides good specific differences, these two plants are distinct in their properties, the highly odoriferous stigmas of the crocus sativus alone furnishing the saffron of commerce. The stigma of the crocus vernus is inodorous.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_38410">
     Tke similarity of climate and weather that characterizes vernal and autumnal days, often produces, towards the latter end of September, a vegetation vying with that of May in profusion and variety of tints.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_38430">
     Many plants, generally considered as exclusively vernal, bloom a second time. Of this, the vidce canina and odorata are striking examples ; and the sweet gentiana verna, or spring gentian, often unfolds its azure blossoms for the second time, late in October, studding the verdant sward with a blue that rivals in intensity the ultramarine.

Yet the vernal crocus expands its flowers by the beginning of March at farthest, and often in very rigorous weather ; and cannot be retarded but by some violence offered , while the autumnal (the saffron) defies the influence of the spring and summer, and will not blow till most plants begin to fade and run to seed. This circumstance is one of the wonders of the creation, little noticed because a common occurrence ; yet ought not to be overlooked on account of its being familiar, since it would be as difficult to be explained as the most stupendous phenomenon in nature.

     DEAR SIR, A good ornithologist should be able to distin- guish birds by their air as well as their colours and shape, on the ground as well as on the wing, and in the bush as well as in the hand. For, though it must not be said that every species of birds has a manner peculiar to itself, yet there is somewhat in most genera at least that at first sight discriminates them, and enables a judicious observer to pronounce upon them with some certainty.

     windhover, has a peculiar mode of hanging in the air in one place, his wings all the while being briskly agitated. Hen- harriers fly low over heaths or fields of corn, and beat the ground regularly like a pointer or setting-dog. Owls move in a buoyant manner, as if lighter than the air ; they seem to want ballast. There is a peculiarity belonging to ravens that must draw the attention even of the most incurious, they spend all their leisure time in striking and cuffing each other on the wing in a kind of playful skirmish ; and when they move from one place to another, frequently turn on their backs with a loud croak, and seem to be falling to the ground. When this odd gesture betides them, they are scratching themselves with one foot, and thus lose the centre of gravity. Rooks sometimes dive and tumble in a frolicsome manner ; crows and daws swagger in their walk ; woodpeckers fly volatu undoso, opening and closing their wings at every stroke, and so are always rising and falling in curves. All of this genus use their tails, which incline downward, as a support while they run up trees. Parrots, like all other hooked-clawed birds, walk awkwardly, and make use of their bill as a third foot, climbing and descending with ridiculous caution. All the gallincs parade and walk gracefully, and run nimbly ; but fly with difficulty, with an impetuous whirring, and in a straight line. Magpies and jays flutter with powerless wings, and make no despatch ; herons seem encumbered with too much sail for their light bodies ; but these vast hollow wings are necessary in carrying burdens, such as large fishes, and the like ; pigeons, and particularly the sort called smiters, have a way of clashing their wings, the one against the other, over their backs with a loud snap ; another variety, called tumblers, turn themselves over in tne air. * Some birds have movements peculiar to the season of love : thus ring-doves, though strong and rapid at other times, yet, in the spring, hang about on the wing in a toying and playful manner ; thus the cock snipe, while breeding, forgetting his former flight, fans the air like the windhover ; and the greenfinch, in particular, exhibits such languishing and faltering gestures as to appear like a wounded and dying bird ; the king-fisher darts along like an arrow ; fern-owls, or goat-suckers, glance in the dust over the tops of trees like a meteor ; starlings, as it were, swim along, while missel-thrushes use a wild and desultory flight ; swallows

     sweep over the surface of the ground and water, arid distinguish themselves by rapid turns and quick evolutions : swifts dash round in circles ; and the bank-marten moves with frequent vacillations like a butterfly. Most of the small birds fly by jerks, rising and falling as they advance. Most small birds hop ; but wagtails and larks walk, moving their legs alter- nately. Sky-larks rise and fall perpendicularly as they sing ; * woodlarks hang poised in the air ; and titlarks rise and fall in large curves, singing in their descent. The white-throat uses odd jerks and gesticulations over the tops of hedges and bushes. All the duck kind waddle ; divers and auks walk as fettered, and stand erect on their tails ; these are the compedes of LinnaBiis. Geese and cranes, and most wild owls, move in figured flights, often changing their position. The secondary remiges otring&lt;z, wild ducks, and some others, are very long, and give their wings, when in motion, a hooked appearance. Dabchicks, moor-hens, and coots, fly erect, with their legs hanging down, and hardly make any despatch : the reason is plain, their wings are placed too forward out of the true centre of gravity ; as the legs of auks and divers are situated too backward.

     The notes of the eagle kind are shrill and piercing ; and about the season of nidification much diversified, as I have been often assured by a curious observer of nature, who long resided at Gibraltar, where eagles abound.

Owls have very expressive notes ; they hoot in a fine vocal sound, much resembling the vox humana, and reducible by a pitch-pipe to a musical key. This note seems to express complacency and rivalry among the males ; they use also a quick call and an horrible scream ; and can snore and hiss when they mean to menace. Ravens, besides their loud croak, can exert a deep and solemn note that makes the woods to echo ; the amorous sound of a crow is strange and ridiculous ; rooks, in the breed- ing season, attempt sometimes, in the gaiety of their hearts, to sing, but with no great success ; the parrot kind have many modulations of voice, as appears by their aptitude to learn human sounds ; doves coo in an amorous and mournful manner, and are emblems of despairing lovers ; the woodpecker sets up a sort of loud and hearty laugh ; the fern-owl, or goat-sucker, from the dusk till daybreak, serenades his mate with the clat- tering of castanets.

The swallow, as has been observed in a former letter, by a shrill alarm, bespeaks the attention of the other hirundines, and bids them be aware that the hawk is at hand.* Aquatic and gregarious birds, especially the nocturnal, that shift their quar- ters in the dark, are very noisy and loquacious, as cranes, wild-geese, wild-ducks, and the like : their perpetual clamour prevents them from dispersing and losing their companions.

We shall, there- fore, confine the remainder of this letter to the few domestic fowls of our yards, which are most known, and, therefore, best understood. And first, the peacock, with his gorgeous train, demands our attention ; but, like most of the gaudy birds, his notes are grating and shocking to the ear : the yelling of cats, and the braying of an ass, are not more disgustful. The voice of the goose is trumpet-like, and clanking ; and once saved the Capitol at Rome, as grave historians assert: the hiss, also, of the gander is formidable, and full of menace, and " protective of his young." Among ducks, the sexual dis- tinction of voice is remarkable ; for, while the quack of the female is loud and sonorous, the voice of the drake is inward, arid harsh, and feeble, and scarce discernible. The cock turkey struts and gobbles to his mistress in a most uncouth manner : he hath also a pert and petulant note when he attacks his adversary. When a hen turkey leads forth her young brood, she keeps a watchful eye ; and if a bird of prey appear, though ever so high in the air, the careful mother announces the enemy with a little inward moan, and watches him with a

     * Syme makes the following judicious remarks upon the songs of birds : " The notes of soft-billed birds are finely toned, mellow, and plaintive ; those of the hard-billed species are sprightly, cheerful, and rapid. This difference proceeds from the construction of the larynx ; as a large pipe of an organ produces a deeper and more mellow-toned note than a small pipe ; so the trachea of the nightingale, which is wider than that of the canary, sends forth a deeper and more mellow-toned note. Soft-billed birds, also, sing more from the lower part of their throat than the hard-billed species. This, together with the greater width of the larynx of the nightingale and other soft-billed warblers, fully accounts for their soft, round, mellow notes, compared with the shrill, sharp, and clear notes of the canary and other hard-billed songsters. In a comprehensive sense, the complete song of birds includes all the notes they are capable of uttering, and, taken in this sense, it is analogous to the speech of man. I ' ED.

     No inhabitants of a yard seem possessed of such a variety of expression, and so copious a language, as common poultry. Take a chicken of four or five days old, and hold it up to a window where there are flies, and it will immediately seize its prey with little twitterings of complacency ; but if you tender it a wasp or a bee, at once its note becomes harsh, and expres- sive of disapprobation and a sense of danger. When a pullet is ready to lay, she intimates the event by a joyous and easy soft note. Of all the occurrences of their life, that of laying seems to be the most important; for no sooner has a hen disburdened herself, than she rushes forth with a clamorous kind of joy, which the cock and the rest of his mistresses immediately adopt. The tumult is not confined to the family concerned, but catches from yard to yard, and spreads to every homestead within hearing, till at last the whole village is in an uproar. As soon as a hen becomes a mother, her new relation demands a new language ; she then runs clucking and screaming about, and seems agitated as if possessed. The father of the flock has also a considerable vocabulary : if he finds food, he calls a favourite concubine to partake ; and if a bird of prey passes over, with a warning voice, he bids his family beware. The gallant chanticleer has, at command, his amorous phrases, and his terms of defiance. But the sound by which he is best known is his crowing : by this he has been distinguished in all ages as the countryman's clock orlarum, as the watchman that proclaims the divisions of the night.

     A neighbouring gentleman, one summer, had lost most of his chickens by a sparrow-hawk, that came gliding down, between a fagot pile and the end of his house, to the place where the coops stood. The owner, inwardly vexed to see his flock thus diminishing, hung a setting net adroitly between the pile and the house, into which the caitiff dashed, and was entangled. Resentment suggested the law of retaliation ; he, therefore, clipped the hawk's wings, cut off his talons, and, fixing a cork on his bill, threw him down among the brood- hens. Imagination cannot paint the scene that ensued ; the expressions that fear, rage, and revenge inspired, were new, or at least such as had been unnoticed before. The exasperated

     Any person that is curious, and enjoys the advantage of a good horizon, might, with little trouble, make two heliotropes, the one for the winter, the other for the summer solstice ; and these two erections might be constructed with very little expense ; for two pieces of timber frame-work, about ten or twelve feet high, and four feet broad at the base, and close lined with plank, would answer the purpose.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_39370">
     The erection for the former should, if possible, be placed within sight of some window in the common sitting parlour ; because men, at that dead season of the year, are usually within doors at the close of the day ; while that for the latter might be fixed for any given spot in the garden or outlet, whence the owner might contemplate, in a fine summer's evening, the utmost extent that the sun makes to the north- ward at the season of the longest days. Now nothing would be necessary but to place these two objects with so much exactness, that the westerly limb of the sun, at setting, might but just clear the winter heliotrope to the west of it, on the shortest day, and that the whole disc of the sun, at the longest day, might exactly, at setting, also clear the summer helio- trope to the north of it.*

     By this simple expedient, it would soon appear, that there is no such thing, strictly speaking, as a solstice ; for, from the shortest day, the owner would, every clear evening, see the disc advancing, at its setting, to the westward of the object ; and, from the longest day, observe the sun retiring backwards every evening, at its setting, towards the object westward, till, in a few nights, it would set quite behind it,*and so by degrees to the west of it ; for when the sun comes near the summer solstice, the whole disc of it would at first set behind the object: after a time, the northern limb would first appear, and so every night gradually more, till at length the whole diameter would set northward of it for about three nights ; but, on the middle night of the three, sensibly more remote than the former or following. When beginning its recess from the summer tropic, it would continue more and more to be hidden every night, till at length it would descend quite behind the object again ; and so nightly more and more to the westward.

Hence he concluded that an instrument might be constructed upon principles nearly similar to the laws which regulate these motions in plants.

     This instrument he formed of a circular ring of cork, three inches in diameter. Into this is fixed twenty-five needles fully impregnated with the magnetic fluid, and these are placed at equal distances round the circumference of the circle, with their north and south poles placed out- - wards alternately. This circle is affixed to a light slip of wood, five inches long, and one-fourth of an inch broad, by a piece of copper wire, of a semicircular form, the extremities of which are passed through the opposite sides of the cork's circle ; and the slip of w^ood attached to the centre of the wire. Into the centre of the bar is fixed an agate cup ; and the whole traverses like a compass needle upon a fine steel point, the bar of wood being equipoised by a small weight at the end of it, equivalent to the weight of the needles. This instrument, when placed with a disc of purple velvet across the needles, in the sun's rays, continued to revolve nearly the whole day, moving always in the direction from east to west by south, in the course of the sun's apparent motion. It moves forty or fifty degrees to the light of a single candle held close to the side of the circle. A piece of clear amber, formed into a convex lens, if fixed into a circle of cork, and suspended by a fine hair or filament, under a glass cover, will also be arrested by the incidence of the solar rays, and\vill continue to present its surface to the sun, if unclouded, as long as he is invisible above the horizon.

     But, when I came to consider better, I began to suspect that, though our hills may never have journeyed far, yet that the ends of many of them have slipped and fallen away at distant periods, leaving the cliffs bare and abrupt. This seems to have been the case with Nore and Whetham Hills, and especially with the ridge between Harteley Park arid Ward- le-ham, where the ground has slid into vast swellings and furrows, and lies still in such romantic confusion as cannot be accounted for from any other cause. A strange event, that happened not long since, justifies our suspicions ; which, though it befell not within the limits of this parish, yet as it was within the hundred of Selborne, and as the circumstances were singular, may fairly claim a place in a work of this nature,

     FALL OF A CLIFF.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_39860">
     The months of January and February in the year 1774, were remarkable for great melting snows and vast gluts of' rain, so that, by the end of the latter month, the land-springs, or levants, began to prevail, and to be near as high as in the memorable winter of 1764. The beginning of March also went on in the same tenor, when, in the night between the 8th and 9th of that month, a considerable part of the great woody hanger at Hawkley was torn from its place, and fell down, leaving a high freestone cliff naked and bare, and resembling the steep side of a chalk-pit. It appears that this huge fragment, being, perhaps, sapped and undermined by waters, foundered, and was ingulfed, going down in a perpen- dicular direction ; for a gate, which stood in the field on the top of the hill, after sinking with its posts for thirty or forty feet, remained in so true and upright a position, as to open and shut with great exactness, just as in its first situation, Several oaks also are still standing, and in a state of vegetation, after taking the same desperate leap. That great part of this prodigious mass was absorbed in some gulf below, is plain also from the inclining ground at the bottom of the hill, which is free and unencumbered, but would have been buried in heaps of rubbish, had the fragment parted and fallen forward. About an hundred yards from the foot of this hanging coppice stood a cottage by the side of a lane ; and two hundred yards lower, on the other side of the lane, was a farm-house, in which lived a labourer and his family ; and just by, a stout new barn. The cottage was inhabited by an old woman and her son, and his wife. These people, in the evening, which was very dark and tempestuous, observed that the brick floors of their kitchens began to heave and part, and that the walls seemed to open, and the roofs to crack ; but they all agree that no tremor of the ground, indicating an earthquake, was ever felt, only that the wind continued to make a most tre- mendous roaring in the woods and hangers. The miserable inhabitants, not daring to go to bed, remained in the utmost solicitude and confusion, expecting every moment to be buried under the ruins of their shattered edifices. When daylight came, they were at leisure to contemplate the devastations of the night. They then found that a deep rift, or chasm, had opened under their houses, and torn them, as it were, in two, and that one end of the bam had suffered in a similar manner : that a pond near the cottage had undergone a strange reverse, becoming deep at the shallow end, and so vice versa : that many large oaks were removed out of their perpendicular,

     some thrown down, and some fallen into the heads of neigh- bouring trees ; and that a gate was thrust forward, with its hedge, full six feet, so as to require a new track to be made to it. From the foot of the cliff, the general course of the ground, which is pasture, inclines in a moderate descent for half a mile, and is interspersed with some hillocks, which were rifted in every direction, as well towards the great woody hanger as from it. In the first pasture the deep clefts began, and, running across the lane and under the buildings, made such vast shelves that the road was impassable for some time ; and so over to an arable field on the other side, which was strangely torn and disordered. The second pasture field, being more soft and springy, was protruded forward without many fissures in the turf, which was raised in long ridges resembling graves, lying at right angles to the motion. At the bottom of this enclosure, the soil and turf rose many feet against the bodies of some oaks that obstructed their farther course, and terminated this awful commotion.*

     * There are numerous instances on record of mountain slips of this kind, in various places of the world ; indeed, they are almost of daily occurrence, to a greater or lesser extent. That which is recorded by our author, is trifling when compared to some others. We may particularize the fall of Mount Rusfi, in Switzerland, which took place in 1806. " Here," says Saussure, writing on the spot, " but three weeks ago, was one of the most delightfully fertile valleys of all Switzerland, green and luxuriant, adorned with little villages, full of secure and happy farmers. Now, three of these villages are for ever erased from the face of the earth, and an extended desolation, burying alive several hundred peasants, over- spreads the valley of Lowertz."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_39940">
     Early in the evening of the second of September, an immense projection of the mountain of Rusfi gave way, and was precipitated into the valley. In four minutes, it completely overwhelmed three villages, and part of two others. The torrent of earth and stones was more rapid than that of lava, and its effects as irresistible and terrible. The mountain, in its tremendous descent, carried trees, rocks, houses, and every thing before it ; the mass spread in every direction, so as to bury completely a space of charming country, more than three miles square. The force of the earth was so great, that it not only overspread the hollow of the valley, but even ascended to a considerable height on the side of the opposite mountain.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_39960">
     Part of the falling mass rolled into the lake of Lowertz, filling a fifth part of it up; and raised the water so much, that two islands within it, and the village of Sever, were, for a time, completely overwhelmed by the swell. By this frightful catastrophe, four hundred and thirty-four individuals lost their lives ; and there were also lost one hundred and seventy cows and horses, and one hundred and three goats and sheepj eighty-seven meadows destroyed, sixty meadows damaged ; ninety-three houses entirely destroyed, eight houses damaged, and uninhabitable; one hundred and sixty-six cow-houses, barns, &amp;c. destroyed, and nineteen damaged.

About fifty acres of land suffered from this violent convulsion ; two houses were entirely destroyed ; one end of a new barn was left in ruins, the walls being cracked through the very stones that composed them ; a hanging coppice was changed to a naked rock ; and some grass grounds and an arable field so broken and rifted by the chasms, as to be rendered, for a time, neither fit for the plough, nor safe for pasturage, till considerable labour and expense had been bestowed in levelling the surface, and filling in the gap ing' fissures.

     THERE is a steep abrupt pasture field, interspersed with furze, close to the back of this village, well known by the name of the Short Lithe, consisting of a rocky dry soil, and inclining to the afternoon sun.

     As their cheerful summer cry cannot but draw the attention of a naturalist, I have often gone down to examine the economy of these grylli, and study their mode of life ; but they are so shy and cautious that it is no easy matter to get a sight of them ; for, feeling a person's footsteps as he advances, they stop short in the midst of their song, and retire backward nimbly into their burrows, where they lurk till all suspicion of danger is over.

     took a multitude of eggs, which were long and narrow, of a yellow colour, and covered with a very tough skin. By this accident, we learned to distinguish the male from the female ; the former of which is shining black, with a golden stripe across his shoulders ; the latter is more dusky, more capacious about the abdomen, and carries a long sword-shaped weapon at her tail, which probably is the instrument with which she deposits her eggs in crannies and safe receptacles.

     Where violent methods will not avail, more gentle means will often succeed ; and so it proved in the present case . for, though a spade be too boisterous and rough an implement, a pliant stalk of grass, gently insinuated into the caverns, will probe their windings to the bottom, and quickly bring out the inhabitant; and thus the humane inquirer may gratify his curiosity without injuring the object of it. * It is remarkable, that, though these insects are furnished with long legs behind, and brawny thighs for leaping, like grasshoppers, yet, when driven from their holes, they shew no activity, but crawl along in a shiftless manner, so as easily to be taken ; and again, though provided with a curious apparatus of wings, yet they never exert them when there seems to be the greatest occasion. The males only make that shrilling noise, perhaps out of rivalry and emulation, as is the case with many animals which exert some sprightly note during their breeding time : it is raised by a brisk friction of one wing against the other. They are solitary beings, living singly male or female, each as it may happen ; but there must be a time when the sexes have some intercourse, and then the wings may be useful, perhaps, during the hours of night. When the males meet, they will fight fiercely, as I found by some which I put into the crevices of a dry stone wall, where I should have been glad to have made them settle ; for though they seemed distressed by being taken out of their knowledge, yet the first that got possession of the chinks would seize on any that were obtruded upon them, with a vast row of serrated fangs.

     * The children in France amuse themselves in the fields hunting the field-cricket. They put into the hole of that insect an ant, to which a long hair is attached, and allowing the little animal to penetrate to the bottom of the burrow, they then draw it out, and the cricket always follows it, and in this manner is c;iptured. Pliny informs us of a simple method of taking this insect, which is, by thrusting a slender piece of stick to the bottom of their burrow, when the cricket immediately gets upon it to know the reason of the intrusion, and is thus easily secured. This simplicity of the animal no doubt gave rise to the proverb stultior grillo, more foolish than a cricket. ED.

     toothed like the shears of a lobster's claws, they perforate and round their curious regular cells, having no fore-claws to dig, like the mole-cricket. When taken in hand, I could not but wonder that they never offered to defend themselves, though armed with such formidable weapons. Of such herbs as grow before the mouths of their burrows, they eat indiscriminately ; and, on a little platform, which they make just by, they drop their dung ; and never in the day-time seem to stir more than two or three inches from home. Sitting in the entrance of their caverns, they chirp all night as well as day, from the middle of the month of May to the middle of July ; and, in hot weather, when they are most vigorous, they make the hills echo ; and, in the still hours of darkness, may be heard to a considerable distance. In the beginning of the season, their notes are more faint and inward ; but become louder as the summer advances, and so die away again by degrees.

     Sounds do not always give us pleasure according to their sweetness and melody ; nor do harsh sounds always displease. We are more apt to be captivated or disgusted with the associations which they promote, than with the notes them- selves. Thus the shrilling of the field-cricket, though sharp and stridulous, yet marvellously delights some hearers, filling their minds with a train of summer ideas of every thing that is rural, verdurous, and joyous.

     About the 10th of March, the crickets appear at the mouths of their cells, which they then open and bore, and shape very elegantly. All that ever I have seen at that season were in their pupa state, and had only the rudiments of wings lying under a skin, or coat, which must be cast before the insect can arrive at its perfect state ; * from whence I should suppose that the old ones of last year do not always survive the winter. In August, their holes begin to be obliterated, and the insects are seen no more till spring.

     DEAR SIR, While many other insects must be sought after in fields, and woods, and waters, the gryllus domesticus,* or house-cricket, resides altogether within our dwellings, intruding itself upon our notice whether we will or no. This species delights in new-built houses, being, like the spider, pleased with the moisture of the walls ; and, besides, the softness of the mortar enables them to burrow and mine between the joints of the bricks or stones, and to open communications from one room to another. They are particularly fond of kitchens and bakers' ovens, on account of their perpetual warmth,

     Tender insects that live abroad either enjoy only the short period of one summer, or else doze away the cold uncomfortable months in profound slumbers ; but these, residing as it were in a torrid zone, are always alert and merry ; a good Christmas fire is to them like the heats of the dog-days. Though they are frequently heard by day, yet is their natural time of motion only in the night. As soon as it grows dusk, the chirping increases, and they come running forth, and are from the size of a flea to that of their full stature. As one should suppose,

     These animals are exceedingly pugnacious, and fight desperately with each other. We have frequently captured crickets, and, having put them into a tumbler covered with paper, have witnessed their battles. Upon more than one occasion we have known them eat each other. We left three of them together in a tumbler, along with some pieces of bread, and, on examining them on the following day, two had been completely devoured, except three of the limbs and the antennae. The survivor was quite brisk and lively. In return for his misdeeds, we terminated the existence of this insect cannibal, and placed him in our cabinet. Latreille informs us that this cricket eats only insects, and certainly thrives well in houses infested by cockroches. We had always supposed that they lived upon bread, until we discovered them devouring each other. ED.

     from the burning atmosphere which they inhabit, they are a thirsty race, and shew a great propensity for liquids, being found frequently drowned in pans of water, milk, broth, or the like. Whatever is moist they affect ; and, therefore, often gnaw holes in wet woollen stockings and aprons that are hung to the fire ; they are the housewife's barometer, foretelling her when it will rain ; and are prognostics sometimes, she thinks, of ill or good luck ; of the death of a near relation, or the approach of an absent lover. By being the constant com- panions of her solitary hours, they naturally become the objects of her superstition. * These crickets are not only very thirsty, but very voracious ; for they will eat the scummings of pots, and yeast, salt, and crumbs of bread ; and any kitchen offal or sweepings. In the summer we have observed them to fly, when it became dusk, out of the windows, and over the neighbouring roofs. This feat of activity accounts for the sudden manner in which they often leave their haunts, as it does for the method by which they come to houses where they were not known before. It is remarkable, that many sorts of insects seern never to use their wings but when they have a mind to shift their quarters and settle new colonies. When in the air, they move volatu undoso, in waves, or curves, like woodpeckers, opening and shutting their wings at every stroke, and so are always rising or sinking.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_40600">
     When they increase to a great degree, as they did once in the house where I am now writing, they become noisome pests, flying into the candles, and dashing into people's faces ; but may be blasted and destroyed by gunpowder discharged into their crevices and crannies. In families, at such times, they are, like Pharaoh's plague of frogs, " in their bed-chambers, and upon their beds, and in their ovens, and in their kneading- troughs." Their shrilling noise is occasioned by a brisk attrition of their wings. Cats eatch hearth-crickets, and, playing with them as they do with mice, devour them. Crickets may be destroyed, like wasps, by phials half filled with beer, or any liquid, and set in their haunts ; for, being always eager to drink, they will crowd in till the bottles are full.

     How diversified are the modes of life, not only of incon- gruous, but even of congenerous animals ! and yet their specific distinctions are not more various than their propensities. Thus, while the field-cricket delights in sunny, dry banks, and the house-cricket rejoices amidst the glowing heat of the kitchen hearth or oven, the gryllus gryllotalpa (the mole-cricket) haunts moist meadows, and frequents the sides of ponds, and banks of streams, performing all its functions in a swampy wet soil. With a pair of fore-feet, curiously adapted to the purpose, it burrows and works under ground like the mole, raising a ridge as it proceeds, but seldom throwing up hillocks.*
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_40730">
     As mole-crickets often infest gardens by the sides of canals, they are unwelcome guests to the gardener, raising up ridges in their subterraneous progress, and rendering the walks unsightly. If they take to the kitchen quarters, they occasion great damage among the plants and roots, by destroying whole beds of cabbages, young legumes, and flowers. When dug out, they seem very slow and helpless, and make no use of their wings by day ; but at night they come abroad, and make long excursions, as I have been convinced by finding stragglers, in a morning', in improbable places. In fine weather, about the middle of April, and just at the close of day, they begin to solace themselves with a low, dull, jarring note, continued for a long time without interruption, and not unlike the chattering of the fern-owl, or goat-sucker, but more inward.

     There were many caverns and winding passages leading to a kind of chamber, neatly smoothed and rounded, and about the size of a moderate snuff-box. Within the secret nursery were deposited near an hundred eggs, of a dirty yellow colour, and enveloped in a tough skin ; but too lately excluded to con- tain any rudiments of young, being full of a viscous substance. The eggs lay but shallow, and within the influence of the sun, just under a little heap of fresh moved mould, like that which is raised by ants.

     When mole-crickets fly, they move cursu undoso, rising and falling in curves, like the other species mentioned before. In different parts of this kingdom, people call them fen-crickets, churr-worms, and eve-churrs, all very apposite names.

     a large lake belonging to the Bishop of Winchester, and lying between Wolmer Forest and the town of Farnham, in the county of Surrey. The pond-keeper says there were three brace in the flock ; but that, after he had satisfied his curiosity, he suffered the sixth to remain unmolested. One of these specimens I procured, and found the length of the legs to be so extraordinary, that, at first sight, one might have supposed the shanks had been fastened on to impose on the credulity of the beholder : they were legs in caricatura; and had we seen such proportions on a Chinese or Japan screen, we should have made large allowances for the fancy of the draughtsman. These birds are of the plover family, and might, with propriety, be called the stilt-plovers. Brisson, under that idea, gives them the apposite name of Vechasse. My specimen, when drawn, and stuffed with pepper, weighed only four ounces and a quar- ter, though the naked part of the thigh measured three inches and a half, and the legs four inches and a half : Hence we may safely assert, that these birds exhibit, weight for inches, incom- parably the greatest length of legs of any known bird. The flamingo, for instance, is one of the most long-legged birds, and yet it bears no manner of proportion to the himantopus ; for a cock flamingo weighs, at an average, about four pounds avoirdupois ; and his legs and thighs measure usually about twenty inches. But four pounds are fifteen times and a frac- tion more than four ounces and one quarter : and if four ounces and a quarter have eight inches of legs, four pounds must have one hundred and twenty inches and a fraction of legs, viz. somewhat more than ten feet, such a monstrous proportion as the world never saw ! If you should try the experiment in still larger birds, the disparity would still increase. It must be matter of great curiosity to see the stilt-plover move ; to observe how it can wield such a length of lever with such feeble muscles as the thighs seem to be furnished with. At best, one should expect it to be but a bad walker : but what adds to the wonder is, that it has no back toe. Now, without that steady prop to support its steps, it must be liable, in speculation, to perpetual vacillations, and seldom able to pre- serve the true centre of gravity.

     The old name of himantopus is taken from Pliny ; and, by an awkward metaphor, implies that the legs are as slender and pliant as if cut out of a thong of leather.

     Our writers record it to have been found only twice in Great Britain. From all these relations it plainly appears, that these long-legged plovers are birds of South Europe, and rarely visit our island ; and when they do, are wanderers and stragglers, and impelled to make so distant and northern an excursion, from motives or accidents, for which we are not able to account. One thing may fairly be deduced, that these birds come over to us from the Continent, since nobody can suppose that a species not noticed once in an age, and of such a remarkable make, can constantly breed unobserved in this kingdom.*

     * Dr Bright mentions that land-tortoises are used as food in Hungary. He says, " In the evening I was taken to see another object of curiosity. the garden kept for the rearing and preservation of land -tortoises. The testudo orbicularis is the species most common about the lake, and the river Szala, which falls into it. Tortoises, likewise, occur in great numbers in various parts of Hungary, more particularly about Fiixes Gyarmath, and the marshes of the river Theiss ; and being deemed a delicacy for the table, are caught and kept in preserves. That of Keszthely encloses about an acre of land, intersected by trenches and ponds, in which the animals feed and enjoy themselves. In one corner was a space separated from the rest by boards two feet high, forming a pen for snails, which here, as well as in Germany, are in request as an article of food. The upper edge of the boards were spiked with nails an inch in height, and at intervals of half an inch, over which, I was assured, these animals never attempt to make their way. This snail, the helix pomatia, is in great demand in Vienna, where sacks of them are regularly exposed for sale in the markets, alternating with sacks of beans, lentils, kidney-beans, and truffles." The helix pomatia is now ranked among the British land snails. It is the largest of our land shells ; is pretty abun- dant in some of the southern counties of England ; and was introduced by the luxurious Romans, during their residence in Britain. ED.

Yet there is a season of the year (usually the beginning of June) when his exertions are remarkable. He then walks on tiptoe, and is stirring by five in the morning ; and, traversing the garden, examines every wicket and inter- stice in the fences, through which he will escape if possible ; and often has eluded the care of the gardener, and wandered to some distant field. The motives that impel him to under- take these rambles seem to be of the amorous kind : his fancy then becomes intent on sexual attachments, which transport him beyond his usual gravity, and induce him to forget for a time his ordinary solemn deportment.

In the middle of the month of June, a bold boy climbed this tree, though standing on so steep and dizzy a situation, and brought down an egg, the only one in the nest, which had been sat on for some time, and contained the embryo of a young bird. The egg was smaller, and not so round, as those of the common buzzard ; was dotted at each end with small red spots, and surrounded in the middle with a broad bloody zone.

     The hen bird was shot, and answered exactly to Mr Ray's description of that species : had a black cere, short thick legs, and a long tail. When on the wing, this species may be easily distinguished from the common buzzard, by its hawk-like appearance, small head, wings not so blunt, and longer tail.

     About the tenth of July, in the same summer, a pair of sparrow-hawks bred in an old crow's nest on a low beech in the same hanger ;# and as their brood, which was numerous, began to grow up, became so daring and ravenous, that they were a terror to all the dames in the village that had chickens or ducklings under their care. A boy climbed the tree, and found the young so fledged that they all escaped from him ; but discovered that a good house had been kept ; the larder was well stored with provisions ; for he brought down a young blackbird, jay, and house-marten, all clean picked, and some

     The sparrow-hawk is a bold, audacious bird, and builds frequently in the most frequented situations. Some years ago, when on a visit to Lord Douglas, at Douglas Castle, Lanarkshire, we discovered a nest close to the approach, and not far distant from the east gate. We were desirous to possess the birds, and his lordship gave orders to the gamekeeper to shoot them, but he only killed the female. ED.

     SELBORNE, November 30, 1780.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_41840">
     DEAR SIR, ' Every incident that occasions a renewal of our correspondence will ever be pleasing and agreeable to me.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_41860">
     As to the wild wood-pigeon, the oenas, or vinago, of Ray, I am much of your mind ; and see no reason for making it the origin of the common house-dove : but suppose those that have advanced that opinion may have been misled by another appellation, often given to the oenas, which is that of stock- dove.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_41880">
     Unless the stock-dove in the winter varies greatly in manners from itself in summer, no species seems more unlikely to be domesticated, and to make a house-dove. We very rarely see the latter settle on trees at all, nor does it ever haunt the woods ; but the former, as long as it stays with us, from November perhaps to February, lives the same wild life with the ring-dove, (palumbus torquatus ;) frequents coppices and groves, supports itself chiefly by mast, and delights to roost in the tallest beeches. Could it be known in what manner stock-doves build, the doubt would be settled with me at once, provided they construct their nests on trees, like the ring- dove, as I much suspect they do.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_41900">
     You received, you say, last spring, a stock-dove from Sussex ; and are informed that they sometimes breed in that country. But why did not your correspondent determine the place of its nidification, whether on rocks, cliffs, or trees ? If he was not an adroit ornithologist, I should doubt the fact, because people

     * Speaking of the cruel propensities of this bird, Montagu says, *' The more generous hawks, we have frequently observed, kill their prey as soon as caught, by eating the head first ; whereas the buzzards, in particular, begin eating their prey indiscriminately. We have several times taken partridges and other birds from them, which had one side of the breast or a thigh devoured, and the bird still alive." ED.

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_41980">
     For my own part, I readily concur with you in supposing that house-doves are derived from the small blue rock-pigeon, for many reasons. In the first place, the wild stock-dove is manifestly larger than the common house-dove, against the usual rule of domestication, which generally enlarges the breed. Again, those two remarkable black spots on the remiges of each wing of the stock-dove, which are so charac- teristic of the species, would not, one should think, be totally lost by its being reclaimed ; but would often break out among its descendants. But what is worth a hundred arguments* is the instance you give in Sir Roger Mostyn's house- doves in Caernarvonshire ; which, though tempted by plenty of food and gentle treatment, can never be prevailed on to inhabit their cote for any time ; but, as soon as they begin to breed, betake themselves to the fastnesses of Ormshead, and deposit their young in safety amidst the inaccessible caverns and precipices of that stupendous promontory.

     I have consulted a sportsman, now in his seventy-eighth year, who tells me, that fifty or sixty years back, when the beechen woods were much more extensive than at present, the number of wood-pigeons was astonishing ; that he has often killed near twenty in a day ; and that, with a long wild-fowl piece, he has shot seven or eight at a time on the wing, as they came wheeling over his head : he moreover adds, which I was not aware of, that often there were among them little parties of small blue doves, which he calls rockiers. The food of these numberless emigrants was beech-mast and some acorns ; and particularly barley, which they collected in the stubbles. But of late years, since the vast increase of turnips, that vegetable has furnished a great part of their support in

     * There are three species of wild pigeon in Britain, besides the turtle- dove, the ring-dove, columba palumbus, the stock-dove, columba oenas, and the rock-dove, columba lima. The two latter are very nearly allied ; but a very strong distinctive mark is, that the stock-dove is larger than the rock-dove, and the latter is white on the lower part of the back, whereas the stock-dove is ash-coloured. It is now generally believed that the rock-dove is the progenitor of all our domestic breeds of pigeons. There is one circumstance which renders this opinion pretty conclusive, and that is, we never find the domestic pigeon taking to trees to build, when they become wild, but always resorting to old ruins, or to rocks. The ring-dove is much larger than the other two species. ED.

     hard weather ; and the holes they pick in these roots greatly damage the crop. From this food their flesh has contracted a rancidness which occasions them to he rejected by nicer judges of eating, who thought them before a delicate dish. They were shot not only as they were feeding in the fields, and especially in snowy weather, but also at the close of the even- ing, by men who lay in ambush among the woods and groves to kill them as they came in to roost. * These are the principal circumstances relating to this wonderful internal migration, which with us takes place towards the end of November, and ceases early in the spring. Last winter we had, in Selborne High-wood, about an hundred of these doves ; but in former times the flocks were so vast, not only with us, but all the district around, that on mornings and evenings they traversed the air, like rooks, in strings, reaching for a mile together. When they thus rendezvoused here by thousands, if they happened to be suddenly roused from 'their roost-trees on an evening,

     It will by no means be foreign to the present purpose to add, that I had a relation in this neighbourhood who made it a practice for a time, whenever he could procure the eggs of a ringdove, to place them under a pair of doves that were sitting in his own pigeon-house, hoping thereby, if he could bring about a coalition, to enlarge his breed, and teach his own doves to beat out into the woods, and to support themselves by mast. The plan was plausible, but something always interrupted the success ; for though the birds were usually hatched, and sometimes grew to half their size, yet none ever arrived at maturity. I myself have seen these foundlings in their nest displaying a strange ferocity of nature, so as scarcely to bear to be looked at, and snapping with their bills by way of menace. In short, they always died, perhaps for want of proper sustenance ; but the owner thought that by their fierce and wild demeanour they frighted their foster-mothers, and so were starved.

     In some former letters, I expressed my suspicions that many of the house-martens do not depart in the winter far from this village. I therefore determined to make some search about the south-east end of the hill, where I imagined they might slumber out the uncomfortable months of winter. But suppo- sing that the examination would be made to the best advantage in the spring, and observing that no martens had appeared by the llth of April last, on that day I employed some men to explore the shrubs and cavities of the suspected spot. The persons took pains, but without any success ; however, a remarkable incident occurred in the midst of our pursuit, while the labourers were at work, a house-marten, the first that had been seen this year, came down the village in the sight of several people, and went at once into a nest, where it staid a short time, and then flew over the houses ; for some days after, no martens were observed, not till the 16th of April, and then only a pair. Martens in general were remark- ably late this year. *

     I HAVE just met with a circumstance respecting swifts, which furnishes an exception to the whole tenor of my observations ever since I have bestowed any attention on that species of hirundines. Our swifts, in general, withdrew this year about the first day of August, all save one pair, which in two or three days was reduced to a single bird. The perseverance of this individual made me suspect that the strongest of motives, that of an attachment to her young, could alone occasion so late a stay. I watched therefore till the twenty-fourth of August, and then discovered that, under the eaves of the church, she attended upon two young, which were fledged* and now put out their white chins from a crevice. These remained till the twenty-seventh, looking more alert every day, and seeming to long to be on the wing. After this day, they were missing at once ; nor could I ever observe them with their dam coursing round the church in the act of learning to fly, as the first broods evidently do. On the thirty-first, I caused the eaves to be searched ; but we found in the nest only two callow, dead, stinking swifts, on which a second nest had been formed. This double nest was full of the black shining cases of the hippoboscce hirundinis.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_42440">
     The following remarks on this'unusual incident are obvious : The first is, that though it be disagreeable to swifts to remain beyond the beginning of August, yet that they can subsist longer is undeniable. The second is, that this uncommon event, as it was owing to the loss of the first brood, so it cor- roborates my former remark, that swifts breed regularly but once ; since, was the contrary the case, the occurrence above could neither be new nor rare.

     coccus.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_42550">
     one sort which I little expected to have found in this kingdom. I had often observed that one particular part of a vine, growing on the walls of my house, was covered in the autumn with a black, dust-like appearance, on which the flies fed eagerly ; and that the shoots and leaves thus affected did not thrive, nor did the fruit ripen. To this substance I applied my glasses, but could not discover that it had any thing to do with animal life, as I at first expected ; but upon a closer examination behind the larger boughs, we were surprised to find that they were coated over with husky shells, from whose sides proceeded a cotton-like substance, surrounding a multi- tude of eggs. This curious arid uncommon production put me upon recollecting what I have heard and read concerning the coccus vitis vinifercB of Linnaeus, which, in the south of Europe, infests many vines, and is a horrid and loathsome pest. As soon as I had turned to the accounts given of this insect, I saw at once that it swarmed on my vine : and did not appear to have been at all checked by the preceding winter, which had been uncommonly severe.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_42570">
     Not being then at all aware that it had any thing to do with England, I was much inclined to think that it came from Gibraltar, among the many boxes and packages of plants and birds which I had formerly received from thence ; and espe- cially as the vine infested grew immediately under my study window, where I usually kept my specimens.* True it is, that I had received nothing from thence for some years : but as insects, we know, are conveyed from one country to another in a very unexpected manner, and have a wonderful power of maintaining their existence till they fall into a nidus proper

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_42590">
     * Most of the species of coccus, which are found in and infest the green-houses and conservatories of Britain, have been introduced with exotic plants. They are now very common in this country, and are a very prolific race. The females fix themselves, and tenaciously and immoveably adhere, to the branches of plants. Some of them lose entirely the form of insects : their bodies swell, their skin stretches, and becomes smooth, and they so closely resemble some of the galls, or excrescences, found on plants, as to be taken for such by people unacquainted with the subject. After this change, the abdomen serves only as a kind of shell, or covering, under which the eggs are concealed. Others, although they are also thus fixed, preserve their insect form till they have laid their eggs, and then die. A kind of downy substance grows on their abdomeni which serves for the formation of the nest in which they deposit their eg^s.

     for their support and increase, I cannot but suspect still that these cocci came to me originally from Andalusia. Yet, all the while, candour obliges me to confess, that Mr Lightfoot has written me word, that he once, and but once, saw these insects on a vine at Weymouth, in Dorsetshire ; which, it is here to be observed, is a seaport town to which the coccus might be conveyed by shipping.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_42670">
     As many of my readers may possibly never have heard of this strange and unusual insect, I shall here transcribe a passage from a Natural History of Gibraltar, written by the Reverend John White, late vicar of Blackburn, in Lancashire, but not yet published :
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_42690">
     " In the year 1770, a vine, which grew on the east side of my house, and which had produced the finest crops of grapes for years past, was suddenly overspread, on all the woody branches, with large lumps of a white fibrous substance, resembling spiders' webs, or rather raw cotton. It was of a very clammy quality, sticking fast to every thing that touched it, and capable of being spun into long threads. At first I suspected it to be the product of spiders, but could find none. Nothing was to be seen connected with it, but many brown oval husky shells, which by no means looked like insects, but rather resembled bits of the dry bark of the vine. The tree had a plentiful crop of grapes set, when this pest appeared upon it ; but the fruit was manifestly injured by this foul encumbrance. It remained all the summer, still increasing, and loaded the woody and bearing branches to a vast degree. I often pulled off great quantities by handfuls ; but it was so slimy and tenacious that it could by no means be cleared. The grapes never filled to their natural perfection, but turned watery and vapid. Upon perusing the works afterwards of M. de Reaumur, I found this matter perfectly described and accounted for. Those husky shells which I had observed, were no other than the female coccus, from whose sides this cotton-like substance exudes, and serves as a covering and security for their eggs,"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_42710">
     To this account I think proper to add, that, though the female cocci are stationary, and seldom remove from the place to which they stick, yet the male is a winged insect ; and that the black dust which I saw was undoubtedly the excrement of the females, which is eaten by ants as well as flies. Though the utmost severity of our winter did not destroy these insects.

     As we have remarked above, that insects are often conveyed from one country to another in a very unaccountable manner, I shall here mention an emigration of small aphides, which was observed in the village of Selborne, no longer ago than August the 1st, 1785.

     At about three o'clock in the afternoon of that day, which was very hot, the people of this village were surprised by a shower of aphides, or smother-flies, which fell in these parts. * Those that were walking in the street at that juncture, found themselves covered with these insects, which settled also on the hedges and gardens, blackening all the vegetables where they alighted. My annuals were discoloured with them, and the stalks of a bed of onions were quite coated over for six days after. These armies were then, no doubt, in a state of emigration, and shifting their quarters ; and might have come, as far as we know, from the great hop plantations of Kent or Sussex, the wind being all that day in the easterly quarter. They were observed, at the same time, in great clouds about Farnham, and all along the vale from Farnham to Alton,

     with the occurrence, because it offers me an opportunity of observing the actions and propensities of those beings with whom we can be little acquainted in their natural state. Not long since, I spent a fortnight at the house of a friend, where there was such a mvary, to which I paid no small attention, taking every occasion to remark what passed within its narrow limits. It was here that I first observed the manner in which fishes die. As soon as the creature sickens, the head sinks lower and lower, and it stands, as it were, on its head ; till, getting weaker, and losing all poise, the tail turns over, and, at last, it floats on the surface of the water, with its belly uppermost. The reason why fishes, when dead, swim in that manner, is very obvious ; because, when the body is no longer balanced by the fins of the belly, the broad muscular back preponderates by its own gravity, and turns the belly upper- most, as lighter, from its being a cavity, and because it contains the swimming bladders, which contribute to render it buoyant. Some that delight in gold and silver fishes, have adopted a notion that they need no aliment. True it is, that they will subsist for a long time without any apparent food but what they can collect from pure water frequently changed ; yet they must draw some support from animalcula, and other nourish- ment, supplied by the water ; because* though they seem to eat nothing, yet the consequences of eating often drop from them. That they are best pleased with such jejune diet may easily be confuted, since, if you toss them crumbs, they will seize them with great readiness, not to say greediness : how- ever, bread should be given sparingly* lest, turning sour, it corrupt the water. They will also feed on the water plant called lemna, (duck's meat,) and also on small fry.

     When they want to move a little, they gently protrude themselves with their pinnce pectorales ; but it is with their strong muscular tails only that they, and all fishes, shoot along with such inconceivable rapidity. It has been said, that the eyes of fishes are immoveable ; but these apparently turn them forward or backward, in their sockets, as their occasions require. They take little notice of a lighted candle, though applied close to their heads, but flounce, and seem much frightened by a sudden stroke of the hand against the support whereon the bowl is hung ; especially when they have been

     Nothing can be more amusing than a glass bowl containing such fishes : the double refractions of the glass and water represent them, when moving, in a shifting and changeable variety of dimensions, shades, and colours ; while the two mediums, assisted by the concavo-convex shape of the vessel, magnify and distort them vastly ; not to mention that the introduction of another element and its inhabitants into our parlours engages the fancy in a very agreeable manner.

     Gold and silver fishes, though originally natives of China and Japan, yet are become so well reconciled to our climate, as to thrive and multiply very fast in our ponds and stews. Linnaeus ranks this species of fish under the genus of cyprinus, or carp, and calls it cyprinus auratus.

     Some people exhibit this sort of fish in a very fanciful way ; for they cause a glass bowl to be blown with a large hollow space within, that does not communicate with it. In thig cavity they put a bird occasionally, so that you may see a goldfinch or a linnet hopping, as it were, in the midst of the water, and the fishes swimming in a circle round it. The simple exhibition of the fishes is agreeable and pleasant ; but in so complicated a way, becomes whimsical and unnatural, and liable to the objection due to him,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_43150">
     DEAR SIR, I think I have observed before, that much the most considerable part of the house-martens withdraw from hence about the first week in October; but that some, the latter broods, I am now convinced, linger on till towards the middle of that month ; and that at times once perhaps in two or three years a flight, for one day only, has shewn itself in the first week in November.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_43170">
     Having taken notice, in October, 1780, that the last flight was numerous, amounting perhaps to one hundred and fifty, and that the season was soft and still, I was resolved to pay uncommon attention to these late birds, to find, if possible, where they roosted, and to determine the precise time of their

     retreat. The mode of life of these latter hirundines is very favourable to such a design, for they spend the whole day in the sheltered district between me and the Hanger, sailing about in a placid easy manner, and feasting on those insects which love to haunt a spot so secure from ruffling winds. As my principal object was to discover the place of their roosting, I took care to wait on them before they retired to rest, and was much pleased to find that, for several evenings together, just at a quarter past five in the afternoon, they all scudded away in great haste towards the south-east, and darted down among the low shrubs above the cottages at the end of the hill.* This

     * Our author is most desirous to establish the opinion, that some of the hirundines and their congeners live with us during the winter. In addition to the mass of evidence which we have brought forward regarding the migration of the swallow tribe, we shall conclude this subject with the interesting observations of Audubon, the celebrated American ornithologist, on the republican, or cliff-swallow. " Being extremely desirous of settling the long-agitated question respecting the migration or supposed torpidity of swallows, I embraced every opportunity of examining their habits, carefully noted their arrival and disappearance, and recorded every fact connected with their history. After some years' constant observation, and reflection, I remarked, that, among all the species of migratory birds, those that remove farthest from us depart sooner than those which retire only to the confines of the United States ; and, by a parity of reasoning, those that remain later return earlier in the spring. These remarks were confirmed as I advanced towards the soutn-west on the approach of winter, for I there found numbers of warblers, thrushes, &amp;c. in full feather and song. It was also remarked, that the hirundo viridis of Wilson remained about the city of New Orleans later than any other swallow. As immense numbers of them were seen during the month of November, I kept a diary of the temperature of the third of that month, until the arrival of the hirundo purpurea. The following notes an; taken from my journal, and, as I had excellent opportunities, during a residence of many years in the country, of visiting the lakes to which these swallows were said to resort during transient frosts, I present them with con- fidence :

Thousands were flying in different flocks. Fourteen were killed at a single shot, all in perfect plumage and very fat. The markets were abundantly supplied with these tender, juicy, and delicious birds. Saw swallows every day, but remarked them more plentiful the stronger the breeze blew from the sea.

     spot in many respects seems to be well calculated for their winter residence, for, in many parts, it is as steep as the roof of any house, and therefore secure from the annoyances of water ; and it is, moreover, clothed with beechen shrubs, which, being stunted and bitten by sheep, make the thickest covert imaginable, and are so entangled as to be impervious to the smallest spaniel ; besides, it is the nature of underwood beech never to cast its leaf all the winter, so that, with the leaves on the ground and those on the twigs, no shelter can be more complete. I watched them on to the thirteenth and fourteenth of October, and found their evening retreat was exact and uniform ; but after this they made no regular appearance. Now and then a straggler was seen ; and, on the twenty-second of October, I observed two, in the morning, over the village, and with them my remarks for the season ended.

     " During the whole winter, many ot them retired to the holes about the houses, but the greater number resorted to the lakes, and spent the night among the branches of myrica ccrifera, the drier, as it is termed by the French settlers. At sunset they began to flock together, calling to each other for that purpose, and, in a short time, presented the appear- ance of clouds moving towards the lakes, or the mouth of the Mississippi, as the weather and wind suited. Their aerial evolutions, before they alight, are truly beautiful. They appear at first as if reconnoitering the place, when, suddenly throwing themselves into a vortex of apparent confusion, they descend spirally with astonishing quickness, and very much resemble a trombe, or water spout. When within a few feet of the driers, they disperse in all directions, and settle in a few moments. Their twittering, and the motions of their wings, are, however, heard during the whole night. As soon as the day begins to d.iwn, they rise, flying low over the lakes, almost touching the water for some time, and then rising, gradually move off in search of food, separating in different directions. The hunters who resort to these places destroy great numbers of them, by knocking them down with light paddles, used in propelling their canoes."

     THEY who write on natural history, cannot too frequently advert to instinct, that wonderful limited faculty, which, in some instances, raises the brute creation, as it were, above reason, and in others, leaves them so far below it. Philosophers have defined instinct to be that secret influence by which every species is impelled naturally to pursue, at all times, the same way, or track, without any teaching or example ; whereas reason, without instruction, would often vary, and do that by many methods which instinct effects by one alone. Now, this maxim must be taken in a qualified sense, for there are instances in which instinct does vary and conform to the circumstances of place and convenience.

     It has been remarked, that every species of bird has a mode of nidification peculiar to itself, so that a schoolboy would at once pronounce on the sort of nest before him. This is the case among fields, and woods, and wilds ; but in the villages round London, where mosses, and gossamer and cotton from vegetables, are hardly to be found, the nest of the chaffinch has not that elegant finished appearance, nor is it so beautifully studded with lichens, as in a more rural district ; and the wren is obliged to construct its house with straws and dry grasses, which do not give it that rotundity and compactness so remark- able in the edifices of that little architect. Again, the regular nest of the house-marten is hemispheric ; but where a rafter, or a joist, or a cornice, may happen to stand in the way, the nest is so contrived as to conform to the obstruction, and becomes flat, or oval, or compressed.

The first, after rasping I off the small end, splits the shell into two with his long fore teeth, as a man does with his knife ; the second nibbles a hole with his teeth, so regular as if drilled with a wimble, and yet so small that one would wonder how the kernel can be extracted through it ; while the last picks an irregular ragged hole with its bill ; but as this artist has no paws to hold the nut firm while he pierces it, like an adroit workman, he fixes it as it were in a vice, in some cleft of a tree, or in some crevice, when, standing over it, he perforates the stubborn shell. We have often placed nuts in the chink of a gate-post, where nut-hatches have been known to haunt, and have always found that those birds have readily penetrated them. While at work, they make a rapping noise that may be heard at a considerable distance.*

     * Instinct is not invariably infallible, as Professor Rennie justly observes, for we can discover many mistakes of this faculty. For example, when Dr Arnold discovered that wonderful vegetable produc- tion, the rafflesia Arnoldii, in Sumatra, which is said to smell like tainted beef, he observed a swarm of flies gathered around it, for the purpose, as he supposed, of depositing their eggs upon it, as they no doubt imagined it to be tainted carrion.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_43680">
     The circumstance of insects mistaking the rafflesia for putrid meat, is not a singular one, as we have similar mistakes happening in this country. The common flesh fly (musca vomitorea) often lays its eggs in the fetid sorts of phalli and agarici, apparently supposing them genuine flesh.

     The earth-worm, which is instinctively afraid of moles, flies to the surface of the earth whenever it finds the ground shaking, whether by man or animals. Boys who wish to capture these poor animals, take advantage of this natural dread of an enemy, and by sinking a spade or stake into the ground, move it backwards and forwards, and the alarmed worms ascend to the surface. It is mentioned by Dr Anderson, in his Bee, that the lapwing (tringa vanellus} is aware of this instinctive fear of the earth-worm, and when other food is scarce, it pats the ground with its feet, till the earth-worms, mistaking it for a mole approaching, ascend to the surface, when they are immediately devoured by the cunning bird.

Nothing excites more various or terrific sensations in my mind. Thus the plots of the greatest number of my tragedies were either formed while listening to music, or a few hours afterwards."

In this situation, he watched them till he could see no longer. Repeated accounts of this sort, spring and fall, induce us greatly to suspect, that house-swallows have some strong attachment to water, independent of the matter of food ; and, though they may not retire into that element, yet they may conceal themselves in the banks of pools and rivers during the uncomfortable months of winter.

     One of the keepers of Wolmer Forest sent me a peregrine falcon, which he shot on the verge of that district, as it was devouring a wood-pigeon. The falco peregrinus, or haggard falcon, is a noble species of hawk, seldom seen in the southern counties. In winter 1767, one was killed in the neighbouring parish of Faringdon, and sent by me to Mr Pennant into North Wales.* Since that time, I have met with none till now. The specimen mentioned above was in fine preservation, and not injured by the shot : it measured forty -two inches from wing to wing, and twenty-one from beak to tail, and weighed two pounds and a half standing weight. This species is very robust, and wonderfully formed for rapine ; its breast was plump and muscular ; its thighs long, thick, and brawny ; and its legs remarkably short and well set ; the feet were armed with most formidable, sharp, long talons ; the eyelids and cere of the bill were yellow; but the irides of the eyes dusky ; the beak was thick and hooked, and of a dark colour, and had a jagged process near the end of the upper mandible on each side ; its tail, or train, was short in proportion to the bulk of its body ; yet the wings, when closed, did not extend to the end of the train. From its large and fair proportions, it might be sup- posed to have been a female ; but I was not permitted to cut open the specimen. For one of the birds of prey, which are usually lean, this was in high case : in its craw were many barley-corns, which probably came from the crop of the wood- pigeon, on which it was feeding when shot : for voracious birds do not eat grain ; but, when devouring their quarry, with undistinguishing vehemence, swallow bones and feathers, and all matters, indiscriminately, This falcon was probably driven

     MY near neighbour, a young gentleman in the service of the East India Company, has brought home a dog and a bitch of the Chinese breed from Canton ; such as are fattened in that country for the purpose of being eaten : they are about the size of a moderate spaniel ; of a pale yellow colour, with coarse bristling hair on their backs ; sharp, upright ears, and peaked heads, which give them a very fox-like appearance. Their hind legs are unusually straight, without any bend at the hock, or ham, to such a degree as to give them an awkward gait when they trot. When they are in motion, their tails are curved high over their backs, like those of some hounds, and have a bare place each on the outside, from the tip mid- way, that does not seem to be matter of accident, but somewhat singular. Their eyes are jet black, small, and piercing ; the insides of their lips and mouths of the same colour, and their tongues blue. The bitch has a dew-claw on each hind leg ; the dog has none. When taken out into a field, the bitch shewed some disposition for hunting, and dwelt on the scent of a covey of partridges till she sprung them, giving her tongue all the time. The dogs in South America are dumb ; * but these bark much in a short, thick manner, like foxes ; and have a surly, savage demeanour, like their ancestors, which are not domesticated, but bred up in sties, where they are fed for the table with rice-meal and other farinaceous food. These dogs, having been taken on board as soon as weaned, could not learn much from their dam ; yet they did not relish flesh when they came to England.

The Kamtschatdales also train the same sort of sharp-eared, peak-nosed dogs to draw their sledges ; as may be seen in an elegant print engraved for Captain Cook's last voyage round the world.

     Now we are upon the subject of dogs, it may not be impertinent to add, that spaniels, as all sportsmen know, though they hunt partridges and pheasants, as it were, by instinct, and with much delight and alacrity, yet will hardly touch their bones when offered as food ; nor will a mongrel dog of my own, though he is remarkable for finding that sort of game. But, when we came to offer the bones of partridges to the two Chinese dogs, they devoured them with much greediness, and licked the platter clean.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_44340">
     No sporting dogs will flush woodcocks till inured to the scent, and trained to the sport, which they then pursue with vehemence and transport ; but then they will not touch their bones, but turn from them with abhorrence, even when they are hungry. *

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_44360">
     Now, that dogs should not be fond of the bones of such birds as they are not disposed to hunt, is no wonder ; but why they reject and do not care to eat their natural game, is not so easily accounted for, since the end of hunting seems to be, that the chase pursued should be eaten. Dogs, again, will not devour the more rancid water-fowls ; nor indeed the bones of any wild-fowls ; nor will they touch the fetid bodies of birds that feed on offal and garbage ; and indeed there may be somewhat of providential instinct in this circumstance of dislike; for vultures, and kites, and ravens, and crows, &amp;c. were intended to be messmates with dogs over their carrion ; and seem to be appointed by Nature as fellow-scavengers, to remove all cadaverous nuisances from the face of the earth.

     THE fossil wood buried in the bogs of Wolmer Forest, is not yet all exhausted ; for the peat-cutters now and then stumble upon a log. I have just seen a piece which was sent by a labourer of Oakhanger to a carpenter of this village : this was the butt end of a small oak, about five feet long, and about five inches in diameter. It had apparently been severed from the ground by an ax, was very ponderous, and as black as ebony. Upon asking the carpenter for what purpose he had procured it, he told me that it was to be sent to his brother, a joiner at Farnham, who was to make use of it in cabinet work, by inlaying it along with whiter woods.

     Those that are much abroad on evenings after it is dark, in spring and summer, frequently hear a nocturnal bird passing by on the wing, and repeating often a short quick note. This bird I have remarked myself, but never could make out till lately. I am assured now, that it is the stone-curlew, (chara- drlus oedicnemusJ) Some of them pass over or near my house almost every evening after it is dark, from the uplands of the hill and Northfield, away down towards Dorton ; where, among the streams and meadows, they find a greater plenty of food. Birds that fly by night are obliged to be noisy ; their notes, often repeated, become signals, or watch-words, to keep them together, that they may not stray or lose each other in the dark.

Just before dusk, they return in long strings from the foraging of the day, and rendezvous by thousands over Selborne-down, where they wheel round in the air, and sport and dive in a playful manner, all the while exerting their voices, and making a loud cawing, which, being blended and softened by the distance that we at the village are below them, becomes a confused noise or chiding ; or rather a pleasing murmur, very engaging to the imagination, and not unlike the cry of a pack of hounds in hollow, echoing woods, or the rushing of the wind in tall trees, or the tumbling of the tide upon a pebbly shore. When this ceremony is over, with the last gleam of day, they retire for the night to the deep beechen woods of Tisted and Ropley.

     IN reading Dr Huxham's Observations de Aere, &amp;c. written at Plymouth, I find, by those curious and accurate remarks, which contain an account of the weather from the year 1727 to the year 1748, inclusive, that though there is frequent rain in that district of Devonshire, yet the quantity falling is not great; and that some years it has been very small; for in 1731, the rain measured only 17 inch . 266 th . ; and in 1741, 20 354; and again, in 1743, only 20 908. Places near the sea have frequent scuds, that keep the atmosphere moist, yet do not reach far up into the country ; making thus the maritime situations appear wet, when the rain is not consider- able. In the wettest years at Plymouth, the Doctor measured only once 36 ; and again once, viz. 1734, 37 1 14 ; a quantity of rain that has twice been exceeded at Selborne in the short period of my observations.

     My friend, who lives just beyond the top of the Down, brought his three swivel guns to try them in my outlet, with their muzzles towards the Hanger, supposing that the report would have had a great effect; but the experiment did not answer his expectation. He then removed them to the alcove on the Hanger ; when the sound, rushing along the Lythe and Comb-wood, was very grand : but it was at the Hermitage that the echoes and repercussions delighted the hearers ; not only filling the Lythe with a roar, as if all the beeches were tearing up by the roots, but, turning to the left, they pervaded the vale above Comb-wood ponds ; and, after a pause, seemed to take up the crash again, and to extend round Harteley Hangers, and to die away at last among the coppices and coverts of Ward-le-ham. It has been remarked before, that this district is an Anathoth, a place of responses, or echoes* and therefore proper for such experiments ; we may farther add, that the pauses in echoes, when they cease and yet are taken up again, like the pauses in music, surprise the hearers, and have a fine effect on the imagination.

     It was in such an aspect, that the snow on the author's evergreens was melted every day, and frozen intensely every night; so that the laurustines, bays, laurels, and arbutuses, looked, in three or four days, as if they had been burnt in the fire ; while a neighbour's plantation of the same kind, in a high, cold situation, where the snow was never melted at all, remained uninjured.*

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_45010">
     From hence I would infer, that it is the repeated melting and freezing of the snow that is so fatal to vegetation, rather than the severity of the cold. Therefore, it highly behoves every planter, who wishes to escape the cruel mortification of losing in a few days the labour and hopes of years, to bestir himself on such emergencies ; and, if his plantations are small, to avail himself of mats, cloths, pease-haum, straw, reeds, or any such covering, for a short time ; or if his shrubberies are extensive, to see that his people go about with prongs and forks, and carefully dislodge the snow from the boughs ; since the naked foliage will shift much better for itself, than where the snow is partly melted and frozen again.

     It may perhaps appear at first like a paradox, but doubtless the more tender trees and shrubs should never be planted in hot aspects ; not only for the reason assigned above, but also because, thus circumstanced, they are disposed to shoot earlier in the spring, arid to grow on later in the autumn than they would otherwise do, and so are sufferers by lagging or early frosts. For this reason, also, plants from Siberia will hardly endure our climate ; because, on the very first advances of spring, they shoot away, and so are cut off by the severe nights of March or April.

It continued freezing hard, on the evening of the twenty -first, at six o'clock, when we were out of doors. We had occasion to be out again a little after midnight, and, the moment we set our face out of doors, we were astonished at the extreme warmth of the atmosphere, which felt like a genial summer mid-day breeze, the wind blowing gently from the south, and the whole snow had disappeared.

The company at Bath, that wanted to attend the Queen's birth day, were strangely incommoded : many carriages of persons who got, in their way to town from Bath, as far as Maryborough, after strange embarrassments, here met with a ne plus ultra. The ladies fretted, and offered large rewards to labourers, if they would shovel them a road to London ; but the relentless heaps of snow were too bulky to be removed ; and so the eighteenth passed over, leaving the company in very uncomfortable circumstances, at the Castle and other inns.

     On the twentieth, the sun shone out for the first time since the frost began ; a circumstance, that has been remarked before, much in favour of vegetation. All this time, the cold was not very intense, for the thermometer stood at twenty- nine, twenty-eight, twenty-five, and thereabout ; but on the twenty-first it descended to twenty. The birds now began to be in a very pitiable and starving condition. Tamed by the season, sky-larks settled in the streets of towns, because they saw the ground was bare ; rooks frequented dunghills close to houses ; and crows watched horses as they passed, and greedily devoured what dropped from them ; hares now came into men's gardens, and, scraping away the snow, devoured such plants as they could find.

     On the twenty-second, the author had occasion to go to London, through a sort of Laplandian scene, very wild and grotesque indeed. But the metropolis itself exhibited a still more singular appearance than the country ; for, being bedded deep in snow, the pavement of the streets could not be touched by the wheels or the horses' feet, so that the carriages ran about without the least noise. Such an exemption from din and clatter was strange, but not pleasant ; it seemed to convey an uncomfortable idea of desolation :

     for the four following nights, the thermometer fell to eleven, seven, six, six ; and at Selborne, to seven, six, ten ; and on the thirty-first of January, just before sunrise, with rime on the trees, and on the tube of the glass, the quicksilver sank exactly to zero, being thirty-two degrees below the freezing point ; but by eleven in the morning, though in the shade, it sprang up to sixteen and a half,* a most unusual degree of cold this for the south of England ! During these four nights, the cold was so penetrating, that it occasioned ice in warm chambers, and under beds ; and, in the day, the wind was so keen, that persons of robust constitutions could scarcely endure to face it. The Thames was at once so frozen over, both above and below bridge, that crowds ran about on the ice. The streets were now strangely encumbered with snow, which crumbled and trode dusty ; and, turning gray, resembled bay salt : what had fallen on the roofs was so perfectly dry, that, from first to last, it lay twenty-six days on the houses in the city ; a longer time than had been remembered by the oldest housekeepers living. According to all appearances, we might now have expected the continuance of this rigorous weather for weeks to come, since every night increased in severity ; but behold, without any apparent cause, on the first of February, a thaw took place, and some rain followed before night ; making good the observation above, that frosts often go off as it were, at once, without any gradual declension of cold. On the second of February, the thaw persisted; and on the third, swarms of little insects were frisking and sporting in a court-yard at South Lambeth, as if they had felt no frost. Why the juices in the small bodies and smaller limbs of such minute beings, are not frozen, is a matter of curious inquiry. ]*

     * At Selborne, the cold was greater than at any other place that the author could hear of with certainty ; though some reported at the time, that, at a village in Kent, the thermometer fell two degrees below zero, viz. thirty-four degrees below the freezing point. The thermometer used at Selborne was graduated by Benjamin Martin.

     It is surprising the degree of cold which the eggs and chrisalids of insects can endure, without destroying the vital principle ; nor is it less astonishing the degree of heat they are capable of sustaining. Spallanzani, and John Hunter," have made some curious experiments on these subjects. "Intense cold," says Spallanzani, " does not destroy the eggs of insects." The year 1709 was celebrated for the intensity of its cold, and its fatal effects on animals and plants. Fahrenheit's thermometer fell to one degree. ' Who can believe,' exclaims Boerhaave, ' that the severity of this winter did not destroy the eggs of insects, especially those exposed to its influence in open fields, on the bare earth, or on the exposed branches

     Severe frosts seem to be partial, or to run in currents ; for at the same juncture, as the author was informed by accurate correspondents, at Lyndon, in the county of Rutland, the thermometer stood at nineteen; at Blackburn, in Lancashire, at nineteen ; and at Manchester, at twenty-one, twenty, and eighteen. Thus does some unknown circumstance strangely overbalance latitude, and render the cold sometimes much greater in the southern than the northern parts of this kingdom.

     The consequences of this severity were, that, in Hampshire, at the melting of the snow, the wheat looked well, and the turnips came forth little injured. The laurels and laurustines were somewhat damaged, but only in hot aspects. No ever- greens were quite destroyed ; and not half the damage sustained that befell in January, 1768. Those laurels that were a little scorched on the south sides, were perfectly untouched on their north sides. The care taken to shake the snow day by day from the branches, seemed greatly to avail the author's evergreens. A neighbour's laurel hedge, in a high situation, and facing to the north, was perfectly green and vigorous ; and the Portugal laurels remained unhurt.

In the succeeding year, I exposed them to a still greater degree of cold. I prepared a mixture of rock-salt and nitrate of ammonia, and reduced the thermometer to twenty-two degrees below zero, which was twenty-three degrees lower than the cold of 1709.

     The first week in December was very wet, with the barometer very low. On the seventh, with the barometer at twenty-eight five-tenths, came on a vast snow, which continued all that day and the next, and most part of the following night ; so that, by the morning of the ninth, the works of men were quite overwhelmed, the lanes filled so as to be impassable, and the ground covered twelve or fifteen inches without any drifting. In the evening of the ninth, the air began to be so very sharp, that we thought it would be curious to attend to the motions of a thermometer ; we, therefore, hung out two, one made by Martin, and one by Dolland, which soon began to shew us what we were to expect ; for, by ten o'clock, they fell to twenty-one, and at eleven to four, when we went to bed. On the tenth, in the morning, the quicksilver of Dolland's glass was down to half a degree below zero, and that of Martin's, which was absurdly graduated only to four degrees above zero, sunk quite into the brass guard of the ball, so that, when the weather became most interesting, this was useless. On the tenth, at eleven at night, though the air was perfectly still, Dolland's glass went down to one degree below zero ! This strange severity of the weather made me very desirous to know what degree of cold there might be in such an exalted and near situation as Newton. We had,

But, behold ! on the tenth, at eleven at night, it was down only to seventeen, and the next morning at twenty-two, when mine was at ten !

     exactly together, so that, for one night at least, the cold at Newton was eighteen degrees less than at Selborne, and, through the whole frost, ten or twelve degrees ;* and, indeed, when we came to observe consequences, we could readily credit this, for all my laurustines, bays, ilexes, arbutuses, cypresses, and even my Portugal laurels, and, which occasions more regret, my fine sloping laurel hedge, were scorched up, while, at Newton, the same trees have not lost a leaf!

     * The Rev. Mr Bree, of Allesly Rectory, made similar observations in the years 1830 and 1831. He says, " I have elsewhere observed, in the year 1830, that the effects of the frosty nights on trees seemed to diifer according to the circumstances, and to be most destructive in the lower situations. Several instances of the same kind presented themselves to my notice this season, during the frosts which prevailed in the month of May. The gooseberries and currants were in some cases much injured in gardens which lay low, while those in more elevated situations escaped unhurt. Many of our native plants were cut off, as equisetum arvense, aspidiumfelix, mas., and aculeatum, scilla ?iutans, &amp;c. all of them lovers of low ground. But not only were the late frosts most destructive in low situations, they seem also to have had a much more injurious effect on vegetation within a few feet of the surface of the ground than they had as many yards above it. And of this I was struck with a remarkable instance in a wood in this neighbourhood, which consists chiefly of oak. For the space of several acres, I observed the opening foliage of the under- wood oak, about seven or eight feet from the ground, to be entirely cut off by the frost, though the bushes were, of course, much sheltered by the overshadowing boughs of the poles and trees above them ; while, contrary to what might be expected, the foliage of the poles and trees themselves, which were exposed to the atmosphere, but elevated some yards above the underwood, remained unaffected. In the case, also, of single oak trees, in other situations, I observed the foliage of the lower boughs to be cut off by the frost, and the head of the higher branches to be unimpaired.' 1 Eo.

     * We can account for this phenomenon only by the supposition, that these spiculse were formed by a thin stratum of vapour passing through the higher regions of the atmosphere; and that they were not dense enough to have the ordinary appearance of snow. We know that snow itself is crystallized vapour, and the distinctness and forms of these crystals will be in proportion to the intensity of the cold at the time. The ordinary cold in this country is seldom such as to produce these, and the snow has usually a flaky appearance. Captain Scoresby mentions having frequently seen snow in a highly crystallized state in the Arctic Regions. In this country there are occasional showers of highly crystallized snow. On the 4th of February, 1880, a fall of this kind was noticed at Cam- bridge, the thermometer then standing at about twenty-two degrees, and the wind from the east-north-east. Nearly all the snow which fell was of that beautiful stellated form called by Captain Scoresby the " lamellar stelliform crystals." They consisted chiefly of six points, radiating from a centre, forming with each other, at that centre, angles of sixty degrees, and having commonly additional ramifications on the primary ones, in the same plane with them, and forming angles of sixty degrees with the primaries. These, however, consisted of great variety in their arrange- ment. Some were regular in all their parts, while others were quite eccentric. Some of these were fashioned by the obliteration of the alternate rays, so as to form angles of one hundred and twenty, instead of one hundred and sixty, degrees ; the additional ramifications still forming angles of sixty degrees with the primaries. The size of these crystals varied from one-eighth to one-third of an inch in diameter. Scoresby says, that the time when the greatest quantity of crystals fell in the Arctic Seas, was when the thermometer stood between sixteen and twenty-two degrees, and the wind was north-east or north-north-east, which corresponded with what was observed at Cambridge.

     The summers of 1781 and 1783, were unusually hot and dry ; to them, therefore, I shall turn back in my journals, without recurring to any more distant period. In the former of these years, my peach and nectarine trees suffered so much from the heat, that the rind on the bodies was scalded and came off; since which, the trees have been in a decaying state. This may prove a hint to assiduous gardeners to fence arid shelter their wall-trees with mats or boards, as they may easily do, because such annoyance is seldom of long continu- ance. During that summer, also, I observed that my apples were coddled, as it were, on the trees ; so that they had no quickness of flavour, and would not keep in the winter. This

     The great pests of a garden are wasps, which destroy all the finer fruits just as they are coming into perfection. In 1781, we had none ; in 1783, there were myriads, which would have devoured all the produce of my garden had we not set the boys to take the nests, and caught thousands with hazel-twigs tipped with bird-lime : we have since em- ployed the boys to take and destroy the large breeding* wasps in the spring. Such expedients have a great effect on these marauders, and will keep them under. Though wasps do not abound but in hot summers, yet they do not prevail in every hot summer, as I have instanced in the two years above mentioned.*

     * There is a wonderful provision in the economy of Nature, by which the numbers of these troublesome marauders are kept within moderate bounds, and but for which they would soon overrun the face of the earth. Every wasp's nest is peopled by several thousands of neuters, or workers. But the neuters, which are first produced, are likewise the first that perish : for not one of them survives the termination of even a mild winter.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_46620">
     The female wasps are, however, stronger, and can bear the rigours of winter better than either the males or neuters. But several hundreds of the females of every nest perish before the end of the winter, and, indeed, not more than ten or a dozen of each nest survive that season. These females are destined for the continuation of the species, and each of them becomes the founder of a new republic. It is quite uncertain whether any male wasps survive. Every nest, about the beginning of October, presents a strange scene of what appears anomalous cruelty. The wasps then not only desist from bringing nourishment to their young, but also drag them in the caterpillar state from their cells, and expose them to the weather, where they either die for want of food, or become a prey to birds, or, as is more generally the ca?e, the parent wasps pinch them to death with their forceps. But instead of being cruel and unnatural, this is perhaps an act of mercy, as wasps do not lay up a store of food for the winter, and their progeny would consequently die a painful and lingering death from starvation if "left in their cells. So that what appears a transgression of the predominating love of animals for their young is, in fact, a merciful effort of instinct. ED.

The reason, I conclude, is, that our dense clayey soil, so much shaded by trees, is not so easily heated through as those above mentioned ; and, besides, our mountains cause currents of air and breezes ; and the vast effluvia from our woodlands temper and moderate our heats.

     WE are very seldom annoyed with thunder-storms ; and it is no less remarkable than true, that those which arise in the south have hardly been known to reach this village ; for, before they get over us, they take a direction to the east or to the west, or sometimes divide into two, and go in part to one of those quarters, and in part to the other ; as was truly the case in summer 1783, when, though the country round was con- tinually harassed with tempests, and often from the south, yet we escaped them all ; as appears by my journal of that summer.

     * The shocks of the dreadful earthquakes here alluded to began on the 5th February, and continued, at different times, till the 1st of March, 1783; during which time, the face of the two Calabrias, lying between the thirty- eighth and thirty-ninth degree, were entirely altered ; hills had been swallowed up, others lowered ; huge mountains split asunder, and parts of them driven to a considerable distance ; valleys filled up ; the courses of rivers altered; springs dried, and new ones formed. At Laureana, in Calabria Ultra, two tenements, with large plantations, situated in a level valley, were detached by the earthquake, and trans- planted, with their trees still remaining in their places, to the distance of about a mile from their first situation ; and from the spot on which they formerly stood, hot water, mixed with sand, sprang to a considerable height. It would be difficult to asssign the reason why Europe generally was much affected in the electrical condition of its atmosphere during this remarkable summer. ED.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_46940">
     The only way that I can at all account for this fact for such it is is, that on that quarter, between us and the sea, there are continual mountains, hill behind hill, such as Nore-hill, the Barnet, Butser-hill, and Ports-down, which somehow divert the storms, and give them a different direction. High pro- montories, and elevated grounds, have always been observed to attract clouds, and disarm them of their mischievous contents, which are discharged into the trees and summits, as soon as they come in contact with these turbulent meteors ; while the humble vales escape, because they are so far beneath them.

     But when I say I do not remember a thunder-storm from the south, I do not mean that we never have suffered from thunder-storms at all ; for on June 5th, 1784, the thermometer in the morning being at sixty-four, and at noon at seventy, the barometer at twenty-nine, six-tenths one-half, and the wind north, I observed a blue mist, smelling strongly of sulphur, hang along our sloping woods, and seeming to indi- cate that thunder was at hand. I was called in about two in the afternoon, and so missed seeing the gathering of the clouds in the north, which they who were abroad assured me had something uncommon in its appearance. At about a quarter after two, the storm began in the parish of Harteley, moving slowly from north to south ; and from thence it came over Norton-farm, and so to Grange-farm, both in this parish. It began with vast drops of rain, which were soon succeeded by round hail, and then by convex pieces of ice, which measured three inches in girth. * Had it been as extensive as it was violent, and of any continuance, (for it was very short,) it must have ravaged all the neighbourhood. In the parish of Har- teley, it did some damage to one farm ; but Norton, which lay

     * On the 4tli January, 1829, a violent hail-storm passed over Edmonton, near London ; during which, hailstones fell of an irregular shape, and measuring three and four inches in circumference. Calamities from hail, however, are but of rare occurrence in this country, compared with the Continent. In France, hail-storms are frequent and formidable, and, in many districts, have done great injuries to corn, as also to vines and olive trees. In the years 1799, 1800, and 1801, the storms of hail in France had been more than usually prevalent, and many families had, in conse- quence, been reduced to ruin. This state of things suggested to M. Barrau, of Toulouse, the establishment of a mutual indemnity insurance company against hail, which has been continued ever since.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_47000">
     Some time ago, hailstones fell at Sterlitamak, in the government of Oneaburg, which were found to contain in their centre a nucleus of small stones. These were analyzed, and in one hundred, their component parts consisted of red oxide of iron 70.00, of oxide of manganese 7.50, alum 3.75, silica 7.50, sulphur and waste 5,00.

It did but just reach to the middle of the village, where the hail broke my north windows, and all my garden-lights and hand-glasses, and many of my neighbours' windows. The extent of the storm was about two miles in length, and one in breadth. We were just sitting down to dinner; but were soon diverted from our repast by the clattering of tiles, and the jingling of glass. There fell, at the same time, prodigious torrents of rain on the farms above mentioned, which occasioned a flood as violent as it was sudden ; doing great damage to the meadows and fallows, by deluging the one, and washing away the soil of the other. The hollow lane towards Alton was so torn and disordered as not to be passable till mended, rocks being removed that weighed two hundred weight. Those that saw the effect which the great hail had on ponds and pools, say that the dashing of the water made an extraordinary appearance, the froth and spray standing up in the air three feet above the surface. The rushing and roaring of the hail, as it approached, was truly tremendous.

     Though the clouds at South Lambeth, near London, were at that juncture thin and light, and no storm was in sight, nor within hearing, yet the air was strongly electric ; for the bells of an electric machine at that place rang repeatedly, and fierce sparks were discharged.

     SHEEP. The sheep on the downs this winter (1769) are very ragged, and their coats much torn ; the shepherds say, they tear their fleeces with their own mouths and horns, and they are always in that way in mild wet winters, being teased and tickled with a kind of lice.

     After ewes and lambs are shorn, there is great confusion and bleating, neither the dams nor the young being able to distinguish one another as before. This embarrassment seems not so much to arise from the loss of the fleece, which may occasion an alteration in their appearance, as from the defect of that notus odor, discriminating each individual personally ; which also is confounded by the strong scent of the pitch and tar wherewith they are newly marked ; for the brute creation recognize each other more from the smell than the sight ; and in matters of identity and diversity, appeal much more to their noses than their eyes. After sheep have been washed, there is the same confusion, from the reason given above.

     CAT AND SQUIRRELS. A boy has taken three little young squirrels in their nest, or drey, as it is called in these parts. These small creatures he put under the care of a cat who had lately lost her kittens, and finds that she nurses and suckles them with the same assiduity and affection as if they were her own offspring. This circumstance corroborates my suspicion, that the mention of exposed and deserted children being nur- tured by female beasts of prey who had lost their young, may not be so improbable an incident as many have supposed; and therefore may be a justification of those authors who have gravely mentioned, what some have deemed to be a wild and improbable story.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_47440">
     So many people went to see the little squirrels suckled by a cat, that the foster mother became jealous of her charge, and in pain for their safety ; and therefore hid them over the ceiling, where one died. This circumstance shews her affection for these fondlings, and that she supposes the squirrels to be her own young. Thus hens, when they have hatched ducklings, are equally attached to them as if they were their own chickens.

     HOUNDS. The king's stag hounds came down to Alton, attended by a huntsman and six yeoman prickers, with horns, to try for the stag that has haunted Harteley Wood for so long a time. Many hundreds of people, horse and foot, attended the dogs to see the deer unharboured ; but though the huntsman drew Harteley Wood, and Long Coppice, and Shrubwood, and Temple Hangers, and, in their way back, Harteley and Ward-le-ham Hangers, yet no stag could be found.

A horse that was turned out into the same field (which I may observe afforded a good pasture) was in the frequent habit of going to this heap of peat soil, and feeding upon it with as much apparent satisfaction as if it had been a rick of good hay. A pointer dog, also, which was usually kept tied up, on being let loose, would almost invariably go to the heap of soil, and devour lumps of it with avidity." ED.

     The royal pack, accustomed to have the deer turned out before them, never drew the coverts with any address and spirit, as many people that were present observed ; and this remark the event has proved to be a true one : for as a person was lately pursuing a pheasant that was wing-broken, in Harteley Wood, he stumbled upon the stag by accident, and ran in upon him as he lay concealed amidst a thick brake of brambles and bushes.

     I.\ severe weather, fieldfares, redwings, skylarks, and titlarks, resort to watered meadows for food ; the latter wades up to its belly in pursuit of the pupse of insects, and runs along upon the floating grass and weeds. Many gnats are on the snow near the water : these support the birds in part.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_47600">
     Birds are much influenced in their choice of food by colour; for though white currants are much sweeter fruit than red, yet they seldom touch the former till they have devoured every bunch of the latter.

     Redstarts, fly-catchers, and black-caps, arrive early in April. If these little delicate beings are birds of passage, (as we have reason to suppose they are, because they are never seen in winter,) how could they, feeble as they seem, bear up against such storms of snow and rain, and make their way through such meteorous turbulences, as one should suppose would embarrass and retard the most hardy and resolute of the winged nation ? Yet they keep their appointed times and seasons ; and, in spite of frost and winds, return to their stations periodically, as if they had met with nothing to obstruct them. The withdrawing and appearance of the short-winged summer birds, is a very puzzling circumstance in natural history.

     devour the young wasps in their maggot state, with the highest glee and delight. Any insect-eating bird would do the same ; and, therefore, I have often wondered that the accurate Mr Ray should call one species of buzzard buteo apivorus sive vespivorus, or the honey-buzzard, because some combs of wasps happened to be found in one of their nests. The combs were conveyed thither, doubtless, for the sake of the maggots or nymphs, and not for their honey ; since none is to be found in the combs of wasps. Birds of prey occasion- ally feed on insects ; thus have I seen a tame kite picking up the female ants full of eggs, with much satisfaction.*

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_47700">
     * That redstarts, fly-catchers, black-caps, and other slender-billed insectivorous small birds, particularly the swallow tribe, make their first appearance very early in the spring, is a well known fact ; though the fly-catcher is the latest of them all in its visit, (as this accurate naturalist observes in another place,) for it is never seen before the month of May. If these delicate creatures come to us from a distant country, they will probably be exposed in their passage, as Mr White justly remarks, to much greater difficulties from storms and tempests, than their feeble powers appear to be able to surmount : * on the other hand, if we suppose them to pass the winter in a dormant state, in this country, concealed in caverns, or other hiding places, sufficiently guarded from the extreme cold of our winter, to preserve their life, and that, at the approach of spring, they revive from their torpid state, and reassume their usual powers of action, it will entirely remove the first difficulty, arising from the storms and tempests they are liable to meet with in their passage ; but how are we to get over the still greater difficulty of their revivification from their torpid state ? What degree of warmth in the temperature of the air is necessary to produce that effect, and how it operates on the functions of animal life, are questions not easily answered.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_47720">
     How could Mr White suppose that Ray named this species the honey- buzzard, because it fed on honey, when he not only named it in Latin, buteo apivorus et vespivorus, but expressly says, that " it feeds on insects, and brings up its young with the maggots, or nymphs of wasps. "

     That birds of prey, when in want of their proper food, flesh, sometimes feed on insects, I have little doubt, and think I have observed the common buzzard, (falco buteo, ) to settle on the ground, and pick up insects of some kind or other MARK WICK.

Some unhappy pairs are not per- mitted to finish any nests till the rest have completed their building. As soon as they get a few sticks together, a party comes and demolishes the whole.

     In the neighbourhood of Pitlessie, in Fife, a pair of thrushes built their nest in a cart-shed, while four wheelwrights were engaged in it as a work-shop. It was placed between one of the hulls of the harrow and the adjoining tooth. The men were busily employed at the noiseful work of joining wood all the day, yet these birds flew in and out at the door of the shed, without fear or dread, and finished their nest with mortar. On the second day, the hen laid an egg, on which she sat, and was occasionally relieved by the cock. In thirteen days the birds came out of the shells, which the old ones always carried off. They fed their young with shell-snails, such as those of the helex nemoralis, H. arbus- torum, and H. aspersa, as also butterflies and moths.

     The magpies, when they have young, destroy the broods of missel thrushes, though the darns are fierce birds, and fight boldly in defence of their nests. It is probably to avoid such insults, that this species of thrush, though wild at other times, delights to build near houses, and in frequented walks and gardens. *

     POULTRY. Many creatures are endowed with a ready discernment to see what will turn to their own advantage and emolument ; and often discover more sagacity than could be expected. Thus, my neighbour's poultry watch for wagons loaded with wheat, and, running after them, pick up a number of grains which are shaken from the sheaves by the agitation of the carriages. Thus, when my brother used to take down his gun to shoot sparrows, his cats would run out before him, to be ready to catch up the birds as they fell.

     The earnest and early propensity of the gallinte to roost on high, is very observable ; and discovers a strong dread impressed on their spirits respecting vermin that may annoy them on the ground during the hours of darkness. Hence poultry, if left to themselves and not housed, will perch the winter through on yew trees and fir trees ; and turkeys and guinea fowls, heavy as they are, get up into apple trees : pheasants also, in woods, sleep on trees to avoid foxes ; while pea-fowls climb to the tops of the highest trees round their owner's house for security, let the weather be ever so cold or blowing. Partridges, it is true, roost on the ground, not having the faculty of perching ; but then the same fear prevails in their minds ; for, through apprehensions from polecats and stoats, they never trust themselves to coverts, but nestle

I suppose not ; but that, like the rest of the genus, they sleep on the water, where the birds of this genus are not always perfectly secure, as will appear from the following circumstance, which happened in this neighbourhood a few years since, as I was credibly informed : A female fox was found in the morning, drowned in the same pond in which were several geese, and it was supposed, that, in the night, the fox swam into the pond to devour the geese, but was attacked by the gander, which, being most powerful in its own element, buffeted the fox with its wings about the head, till it was drowned.

     A hen which had, for three successive seasons, been occupied in rearing broods of ducks, became quite habituated to their taking the water.

On the fourth year, she sat on her own eggs, and, expecting her chickens to take to the water, as on former occasions, she flew to the stone in the middle of the pond, and called them to her with much earnestness, but they did not feel inclined to follow her dictates.

     A HYBRID PHEASANT. Lord Stawell sent me, from the great lodge in the Holt, a curious bird for my inspection. It was found by the spaniels of one of his keepers in a coppice, and shot on the wing. The shape, air, and habit of the bird, and the scarlet ring round the eyes, agreed well with the appearance of a cock pheasant ; but then the head and neck, and breast and belly, were of a glossy black : and though it weighed three pounds three ounces and a half, * the weight of a large full-grown cock pheasant, yet there was no sign of any spurs on the legs, as is usual with all grown cock pheasants, who have long ones. The legs and feet were naked of feathers, and therefore it could be nothing of the grouse kind. In the tail were no long, bending feathers, such as cock pheasants usually have, and are characteristic of the sex. The tail was much shorter than the tail of a hen pheasant, and blunt and square at the end. The back, wing-feathers, and tail, were all of a pale russet, curiously streaked, somewhat like the upper parts of a hen partridge. I returned it with my verdict, that it was probably a spurious, or hybrid hen-bird, bred between a cock pheasant and some domestic fowl. )* When I came to talk with the keeper who brought it, he told me that some pea-hens had been known last summer to haunt the coppices and coverts where this mule was found.

     We have already noticed this curious subject, in our note at page 9o. The facts of the female bird assuming the plumage of the male, which have been recorded by authors, are the following : pea-hen, by Hunter ; turkey, by Bechstein ; common pheasant, by Hunter ; golden pheasant, by Blumenbach ; the domestic hen, by Aristotle, Tucker, and Butter ; the partridge, by Montagu ; the domestic pigeon, by Tiedmann ; the bustard, by Tiedmann ; American pelican, by Catesby ; common wild duck, by Tiedmann. Some years ago, a female golden pheasant, in the possession of the Duke of Buccleugh, assumed the male plumage. Mr Falconer of Carlowrie, member of the Wernerian Society, knew a domestic duck assume the garb of the drake ; and a nobleman in Devonshire had a female wild duck, which made a similar change. Lord Glenlee lately pre- sented to the Edinburgh College Museum a pea-hen with the male attire.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_48950">
     Dr Butter, who has bestowed much attention to this subject, comes to the three following conclusions: 1st, That in order to separate and distinguish the sexes, Nature has affixed certain external characters, proper to each. 2d, That in early life, the differences between the male and female are scarcely observable, but that at a certain period, the male assumes characteristic distinctions, denominated by Mr Hunter, " secon- dary properties," which the female then wants. 3d, That the female seldom makes an advance towards these secondary properties, until her powers of procreation are gone, when an inclination to resemble the mas- culine form takes place. And he considers, as this principle is common to all females, it is not a monstrous occurrence, as some authors have termed it.

     It is not generally known, that pheasants are beneficial to the farmer.

     When we came to draw it. we found the entrails so soft and tender, that in appearance, they might have been dressed like the ropes of a woodcock. The craw, or crop, was small and lank, containing a mucus ; the gizzard thick and strong, and filled with small shell snails, some whole, and many ground to pieces through the attrition which is occasioned by the muscular force and motion of that intestine. We saw no gravels among the food ; perhaps the shell snails might perform the functions of gravels or pebbles, and might grind one another. Land-rails used to abound formerly, I remember, in the low, wet, bean fields of Christian Malford, in North Wilts, and in the meadows near Paradise Gardens, at Oxford, where I have often heard them cry, crex, crex. The bird mentioned above weighed seven ounces and a half, was fat and tender, and in flavour like the flesh of a woodcock. The liver was very large and delicate.*

     That it is a bird of passage, there can be little doubt, though Mr White thinks it poorly qualified for migration, on account of the wings being short, and not placed in the exact centre of gravity : how that may be I cannot say, but I know that its heavy sluggish flight is not owing to its inability of flying faster, for I have seen it fly very swiftly; although in general its actions are sluggish. Its unwillingness to rise proceeds, I imagine, from its sluggish disposition, and its great timidity; for it will sometimes squat so close to the ground, as to suffer itself to be taken up by the hand, rather than rise ; and yet it will at times run very fast.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_49110">
     What Mr White remarks respecting the small shell snails found in its gizzard, confirms my opinion, that it frequents corn fields, seed clover, and brakes or fern, more for the sake of snails, slugs, and other insects which abound in such places, than for the grain or seeds, and that it is entirely an insectivorous bird.

     HEN-HARRIER. A neighbouring gentleman sprung a phea- sant in a wheat stubble, and shot at it ; when, notwithstanding the report of the gun, it was immediately pursued by the blue hawk, known by the name of the hen-harrier, but escaped into some covert. He then sprung a second, and a third, in the same field, that got away in the same manner ; the hawk hover- ing round him all the while that he was beating the field, conscious, no doubt, of the game that lurked in the stubble. Hence we may conclude, that this bird of prey was rendered very daring- and bold by hunger, and that hawks cannot always seize their game when they please. We may farther observe, that they cannot pounce their quarry on the ground, where it might be able to make a stout resistance, since so large a fowl as a pheasant could not but be visible to the piercing eye of a hawk, when hovering over the field. Hence that propensity of cowring and squatting, till they are almost trod on, which, no doubt, was intended as a mode of security : though long rendered destructive to the whole race of gallijuz by the inven- tion of nets and guns.

And lastly, in an evening, I shot at, and plainly saw that I had wounded a partridge, but, it being late, was obliged to go home without finding it again. The next morning, I walked round my land without any gun ; but a favourite old spaniel followed my heels. When I came near the field where I wounded the bird the evening before, I heard the partridges call, and they seemed to be much disturbed. On my approaching the bar-way, they all rose, some on my right and some on my left hand ; and just before and over my head, I perceived ( though indistinctly, from the extreme velocity of their motion) two birds fly directly against each other, when instantly, to my great astonishment, down dropped a partridge at my feet : the dog immediately seized it, and, on examination, I found the blood flow very fast from a fresh wound in the head, but there was some dry clotted blood on its wings and side ; whence I concluded, that a hawk had singled out my wounded bird as the object of its prey, and had struck it down the instant that my approach had obliged the birds to rise on the wing ; but the space between the hedges was so small, and the motion of the birds so instantaneous and quick, that I could not distinctly observe the operation.

     Most people know, that have observed at all, that the swimming of birds is nothing more than a walking in the water, where one foot succeeds the other as on the land ; yet no one, as far as I am aware, has remarked that diving fowls, while under water, impel and row themselves forward by a motion of their wings, as well as by the impulse of their feet : but such is really the case, as any person may easily be convinced, who will observe ducks when hunted by dogs in a clear pond. Nor do I know that any one has given a reason why the wings of diving fowls are placed so forward : doubtless, not for the pur- pose of promoting I their speed in flying, since that position certainly impedes it ; but probably for the increase of their motion under water, by the use of four oars instead of two ; yet were the wings and feet nearer together, as in land birds, they would, when in action, rather hinder than assist one another.

     This colyinbus was of considerable bulk, weighing only three drachms short of three pounds avoirdupois. It measured in length from the bill to the tail (which was very short) two feet, and to the extremities of the toes, four inches more ; and the breadth of the wings expanded was forty-two inches. A person attempted to eat the body, but found it very strong- and rancid, as is the flesh of all birds living on fish. Divers, or loons, though bred in the most northerly parts of Europe, yet are seen with us in very severe winters ; and, on the Thames, are called sprat loons, because they prey much on that sort of fish.

     STONE-CURLEW. On the twenty-seventh of February, 1788, stone-curlews were heard to pipe ; and on March first, after it was dark, some were passing over the village, as might be perceived by their quick short note, which they use in their nocturnal excursions by way of watch-word, that they may not stray and lose their companions.

These birds were the greater and lesser crested grebe, (podiceps cristatus et auritus. ) What surprised me most was, that the first of these birds was found alive on dry ground, about seven miles from the sea, to which place there was no communication by water. How did it get so far from the sea, its wings and legs being so ill adapted either to flying or walking ? The lesser crested grebe was also found in a fresh water pond, which had no communication with other water, at some miles distance from the sea. MARKWICK.

     FERN-OWL, OR GOAT-SUCKER. The country people have a notion that the fern-owl, or churn-owl, or eve-jarr, which they also call a puckeridge, is very injurious to weanling calves, by inflicting, as it strikes at them, the fatal distemper known to cow-leeches by the name of puckeridge. Thus does this harmless, ill-fated bird, fall under a double imputation, which it by no means deserves, in Italy, of sucking the teats of goats, whence it is called caprimulgus ; and, with us, of communicating a deadly disorder to cattle. But the truth of the matter is, the malady above mentioned is occasioned by the oestrus bovis, a dipterous insect, which lays its eggs along the chines of kine, where the maggots, when hatched, eat their way through the hide of the beast into the flesh, and grow to a very large size. I have just talked with a man, who says he has more than once stripped calves w r ho have died of the puckeridge : that the ail or complaint lay along the chine, where the flesh was much swelled, and filled with purulent matter. Once I myself saw a large, rough maggot of this sort squeezed out of the back of a cow. These maggots in Essex are called wornils.

Ever since the publication of his History of Selborne, I have used my utmost endeavours to discover his three birds, but hitherto without success. I have frequently shot the bird which " haunts only the tops of trees, and makes a sibilous noise," even in the very act of uttering that sibilous note ; but it always proved to be the common willow-wren, or his chiff chaf.

     The least observation and attention would convince men, that these birds neither injure the goatherd nor the grazier, but are perfectly harmless, and subsist alone, being night birds, on night insects, such as scarabcei, and phal&amp;nce ; and, through the month of July, mostly on the scarabceus solstitialis, which in many districts abounds at that season. Those that we have opened have always had their craws stuffed with large night moths and their eggs, and pieces of chaffers ; nor does it any- wise appear how they can, weak and unarmed as they seem, inflict any harm upon kine, unless they possess the powers of animal magnetism, and can affect them by fluttering over them.

This amusing bird was then in pursuit of a brood of some particular phalceiKE belonging to the oak, of which there are several sorts ; and exhibited on the occasion a command of wing superior, I think, to that of the swallow itself.

In 1824, a cow had three of these in her back, which we extracted ; and having put them in a basin for examination, after we had finished the operation, one of our tame jackdaws deprived us from carrying our intentions into effect, by devouring them as a lunch. One of these was an inch long, and as thick as our little finger; and the swelling which it produced in the animal's back was of the size of the largest penny-piece. This was extracted by a person pressing with a piece of wood against another piece which we held opposite. The force required to press it through the aperture (which was about an eighth of an inch in diameter) was such, that the noise resembled that of a pop -gun, and the worm was projected to a distance of twelve feet from me cow's back.

     On this day, (July 14, 1789,) a woman brought me two eggs of a fern-owl, or eve-jarr, which she found on the verge of the hanger, to the left of the hermitage, under a beechen shrub. This person, who lives just at the foot of the hanger, seems well acquainted with these nocturnal swallows, and says she has often found their eggs near that place, and that they lay only two at a time on the bare ground. The eggs were oblong, dusky, and streaked somewhat in the manner of the plumage of the parent bird, and were equal in size at each end. The dam was sitting on the eggs when found, which contained the rudiments of young, and would have been hatched perhaps in a week. From hence we may see the time of their breeding, which corresponds pretty well with the swift, as does also the period of their arrival. Each species is usually seen about the beginning of May : each breeds but once in a summer : each lays only two eggs.

     SAND-MARTENS. March 23, 1788. A gentleman, who was this week on a visit at Waverley, took the opportunity of examining some of the holes in the sand banks with which that district abounds. As these are undoubtedly bored by bank-martens, and are the places where they avowedly breed, he was in hopes they might have slept there also, and that he might have surprised them just as they were awaking from their winter slumbers. When he had dug for some time, he found the holes were horizontal and serpentine, as I had observed before ; and that the nests were deposited at the inner end, and had been occupied by broods in former sum- mers ; but no torpid birds were to be found. He opened and examined about a dozen holes. Another gentleman made the same search many years ago, with as little success. These holes were in depth about two feet.

     SWALLOWS, CONGREGATING AND DISAPPEARANCE OF. During the severe winds that often prevail late in the spring, it is not easy to say how the hirundines subsist ; for they withdraw them- selves, and are hardly ever seen, nor do any insects appear for their support. That they can retire to rest, and sleep away these uncomfortable periods, as bats do, is a matter rather to be suspected than proved : or do they not rather spend their time in deep and sheltered vales near waters, where insects are more likely to be found ? Certain it is, that hardly any individuals of this genus have at such times been seen for several days together.

     September 13, 1791. The congregating flocks of hirundines on the church and tower are very beautiful and amusing ! When they fly off together from the roof, on any alarm, they quite swarm in the air. But they soon settle in heaps, and, preening their feathers, and lifting up their wings to admit the sun, seem highly to enjoy the warm situation. Thus they spend the heat of the day, preparing for their emigration, and, as it were, consulting when and where they are to go. The flight about the church seems to consist chiefly of house-martens, above four hundred in number ; but there are other places of rendezvous about the village frequented at the same time.

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_50340">
     I have frequently taken notice of all these circumstances, which induced Mr White to suppose that some of the hirundines lie torpid during winter. I have seen, so late as November, on a finer day than usual at that season of the year, two or three swallows flying backwards and forwards under a warm hedge, or on the sunny side of some old building ; nay, I once saw, on the 8th of December, two martens flying about very briskly, the weather being mild. I had not seen any considerable number, either of swallows or martens, for a good while before : from whence, then, could these few birds come, if not from some hole or cavern where they had laid themselves up for the winter ? Surely it will not be asserted that these birds migrate back again, from some distant tropical region, merely on the appearance of a fine day or two at this late season of the year. Again, very early in the spring, and sometimes immediately after very cold, severe weather, on its growing a little warmer, a few o'f these birds suddenly make their appearance, long before the generality of them are seen. These appearances certainly favour the opinion of tneir passing the winter in a torpid state, but do not absolutely prove the fact ; for who ever saw them reviving of their own accord from their torpid state, without being first brought to the fire, and, as it were, forced into life again; soon after which revivification they constantly die.

It is very remarkable, that after the hirun- dines have disappeared for some weeks, a few are occasionally seen again ; sometimes, in the first week in November, and that only for one day. Do they not withdraw and slumber in some hiding-place during the interval ? for we cannot suppose they had migrated to warmer climes, and so returned again for one day. Is it not more probable that they are awakened from sleep, and, like the bats, are come forth to collect a little food ?

     GROSBEAK. Mr B. shot a cock grosbeak, which he had observed to haunt his garden for more than a fortnight.

Upon opening its crop, or craw, no buds were to be seen ; but a mass of kernels of the stones of fruits. Mr B. observed, that this bird frequented the spot where plum trees grow ; and that he had seen it with some- what hard in its mouth, which it broke with difficulty : these were the stones of damsons. The Latin ornithologists call this bird coccothraustes, i.e. berry-breaker, because, with its large horny beak, it cracks and breaks the shells of stone fruits for the sake of the seed or kernel.

     On every sunny day, the winter through, clouds of insects, usually called gnats, (I suppose tipul&lt;B and empedes,) appear sporting and dancing over the tops of the evergreen trees in the shrubbery, and frisking about as if the business of genera- tion was still going on. Hence it appears that these diptera (which by their sizes appear to be of different species) are not subject to a torpid state in the winter, as most winged insects are. At night, and in frosty weather, and when it rains and blows, they seem to retire into those trees. They often are out in a fog.

     * This sound does not proceed from bees, as our author supposes, but from the common gnat (culex pipiens. ) We particularly noticed this in August, 1832, in a lane which leads from the back of Warriston Crescent, to the Newhaven road. On the third, the air was very hot, and the sound proceeded from the top of some high trees. Next day we passed the same road ; the air was more cold and somewhat moist, when these gnats were sporting in the sunbeams, close to the top of a hedge, which was not more than four feet high. This mighty congregation of gnats formed a lengthened column of two hundred yards, by about a yard in breadth, and two yards in depth ; their numbers we believe to have been greater than there have been human beings on our globe, from the creation to the present time.

Professor Rennie notices, that upon the leaf of a poplar tree, of three eggs of the puss moth, (cerura rinuftz,) which he found, two were hatched about a fortnight before the other. The first were males, and the last a female ; thus dis- tinctly proving, that eggs from which females are produced are longer of hatching. As they were found on the same leaf, they were of course presumed to be laid by the same parent ; at the same time, the difference in the time of hatching could not depend upon any atmospherical cause.

     CIMEX LINEARIS. August 12, 1775. Cimices lincares are now in high copulation on ponds and pools. The females, who vastly exceed the males in bulk, dart and shoot along on the surface of the water with the males on their backs. When a female chooses to be disengaged, she rears, and jumps, and plunges, like an unruly colt ; the lover, thus dismounted, soon finds a new mate. The females, as fast as their curiosities are satisfied, retire to another part of the lake, perhaps to deposit their fetus in quiet : hence the sexes are found separate, except where generation is going on. From the multitude of minute young of all gradations of sizes, these insects seem, without doubt, to be viviparous.

     <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_52390">
      At first they are very brisk and alert ; but, as they grow more torpid, one cannot help observing that they move with difficulty, and are scarce able to lift their legs, which seem as ff glued to the glass ; and by degrees, many do actually stick on till they die in the place.
     </p>
     <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_52410">
      It has been observed that divers flies, besides their sharp, hooked nails, have also skinny palms, or flaps to their feet, whereby they are enabled to stick on glass and other smooth bodies, and to walk on ceilings with their backs downward, by means of the pressure of the atmosphere on those flaps ; the weight of which they easily overcome in warm weather, when they are brisk and alert. But, in the decline of the year, this resistance becomes too mighty for their diminished strength ; and we see flies labouring along, and lugging their feet in windows, as if they stuck fast to the glass, and it is with the utmost difficulty they can draw one foot after another, and disengage their hollow caps from the slippery surface.
     </p>
     <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_52430">
      Upon the same principle that flies stick and support them- selves, do boys, by way of play, carry heavy weights by only a piece of wet leather, at the end of a string, clapped close on the surface of a stone.

At this juncture they sport and copulate ; as it grows more dark they retire. All day they hide in the hedges. As they rise in a cloud they appear like smoke.

      APHIDES. On the first of August, about half an hour after three in the afternoon, the people of Selborne were surprised by a shower of aphides which fell in these parts. They who were walking the streets at that time found themselves covered with these insects, which settled also on the trees and gardens, and blackened all the vegetables where they alighted. These armies, no doubt, were then in a state of emigration, and shifting their quarters ; and might perhaps come from the great hop plantations of Kent or Sussex, the wind being that day at north. They were observed at the same time at Farn- ham, and all along the vale at Alton.

      ANTS. August 23. Every ant-hill about this time is in a strange hurry and confusion ; and all the winged ants, agitated by some violent impulse, are leaving their homes, and, bent on emigration, swarm by myriads in the air, to the great emolument of the hirundines, which fare luxuriously.* Those that escape the swallows return no more to their nests, but, looking out for fresh settlements, lay a foundation for future colonies. All the females at this time are pregnant ; the males that escape being eaten, wander away and die.

      October 2. Flying ants, male and female, usually swarm and migrate on hot sunny days in August and September ; but this day a vast emigration took place in my garden, and myriads came forth, in appearance from the drain which goes under the fruit wall ; filling the air and the adjoining trees and shrubs with their numbers. The females were full of eggs. This late swarming is probably owing to the backward wet season. The day following, not one flying ant was to be seen.

      When earth-worms lie out a-nights on the turf, though they extend their bodies a great way, they do not quite leave their holes, but keep the ends of their tails fixed therein, so that, on the least alarm, they can retire with precipitation under the earth. Whatever food falls within their reach when thus extended, they seem to be content with, such as, blades of grass, straws, fallen leaves, the ends of which they often draw into their holes ; even in copulation their hinder parts never quit their holes : so that no two, except they lie within reach of each other's bodies, can have any commerce of that kind ; but, as every individual is a hermaphrodite, there is no difficulty in meeting with a mate, as would be the case were they of different sexes.

      About the middle of this month (September) we found, in a field near a hedge, the slough of a large snake, which seemed to have been newly cast. From circumstances, it appeared as if turned wrong side outward, and as drawn off backward, like a stocking, or woman's glove. Not only the whole skin, but scales from the very eyes, are peeled off, and appear in the head of the slough like a pair of spectacles. The reptile, at the time of changing his coat, had entangled himself intricately in the grass and weeds, so that the friction of the stalks and blades might promote this curious shifting of his exuvice.

      It has been the received opinion, that trees grow in height only by their annual upper shoot. But my neighbour, over the way, whose occupation confines him to one spot, assures me, that trees are expanded and raised in the lower parts also. The reason that he gives is this : the point of one of my firs began, for the first time, to peer over an opposite roof at the beginning of summer ; but, before the growing season was over, the whole shoot of the year, and three or four joints of the body beside, became visible to him, as he sits on his form in his shop.

As the assimilation takes place, a partial vacuum is formed by the change of gas to a solid form ; and this vacuum is immediately tilled with sap rushing into it, according to the well-known law of the tendency of fluids to rush into any cavity deprived of the presence of air" ED.

      Hops are "diecious plants : hence perhaps it might be proper, though not practised, to leave purposely some male plants in every garden, that their farina might impregnate the blossoms. The female plants, without their male attendants, are not in their natural state : hence we may suppose the frequent failure of crop so incident to hop-grounds.* No other growth, cultivated by man, has such frequent and general Failures as hops.

      Two hop gardens much injured by a hail storm, (June 5,) shew now (September 2) a prodigious crop, and larger and fairer hops than any in the parish. The owners seem now to be convinced that the hail, by beating off the tops of the binds, has increased the side shoots, and improved the crop. Query, Therefore, should not the tops of hops be pinched off whe'n the binds are very gross and strong ?

      * The various mechanical contrivances by which Nature has enabled plants to diffuse their seeds, are matters of common observation, and that of the violet is not the least remarkable. The seeds of this natural order of plants are contained in a capsule of a single loculament, consisting, however, of three valves. To the inner part of each of these three valves the seeds are attached, and remain so for some time after the valves, in the process of ripening, have separated and stood open. The influence of the sun's heat, however, causes the sides of each valve to shrink and collapse ; and, in this state, the edges press firmly upon tjie seed, which, from being before apparently irregular in its arrangement, comes into a, straight line. The seeds, it may be remarked, are not only extremely smooth, polished, and shining, but regularly egg-shaped ; so that, when pressed upon by the collapsing edge of the valve, it slides gradually down the sloping part of the seed, and throws it, with a jerk, to a considerable distance.
     </p>
     <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_54050">
      There is another beautiful contrivance in the violets, (violacece,) well worthy our cidmiration. Before the seed is ripe, the capsule hangs in a drooping position, with the persisting calyx spread over it, like an umbrella, to guard it from the rain and dews, which would retard the progress of ripening; but no sooner is the ripening completed, than the capsule becomes upright, with the calyx for a support. This upright position appears to be intended by Nature to give more effect to the valvular mechanism for scattering the seeds, as it thus gains a higher elevation (in some cases more than an inch) from which to project them ; and will give it, according to the laws of projectiles, a very considerable increase of horizontal extent.

      SEED LYING DORMANT. The naked part of the Hanger is HOW covered with thistles of various kinds. The seeds of these thistles may have lain probably under the thick shade of the beeches for many years, but could not vegetate till the sun and air were admitted. When old beech trees are cleared away, the naked ground in a year or two becomes covered with strawberry plants, the seeds of which must have lain in the ground for an age at least. One of the slidders, or trenches, down the middle of the Hanger, close covered over with lofty beeches near a century old, is still called strawberry-slidder, though no strawberries have grown there in the memory of man. That sort of fruit did once, no doubt, abound there, and will again, when the obstruction is removed. *

      * Sir Thomas Dick Lauder, Bart, well known for liis zeal for science, made some very curious and interesting experiments, in 1817, on the germination of seeds, which we shall give in his own words : "A friend of mine possesses an estate in this county, a great part of which lying along the Moray Firth, was, at some period not very well ascertained, but certainly not less than sixty years ago, covered with sand, which had been blown from the westward, and overwhelmed the cultivated fields, so that the agriculturist was forced to abandon them altogether. My friend, soon after his purchase of the estate, began the arduous, but judi- cious operation of trenching down the sand, and bringing to the surface the original black mould. These operations of improvement were so productive, as to induce the very intelligent and enterprising proprietor to undertake, lately, a still more laborious task, viz. to trench down the superincumbent sand, on a part of the property where it was no less than eight feet deep.
     </p>
     <p xml:id="eco_en_000065_54130">
      " Conceiving this to be a favourable opportunity for trying some experi- ments relative to the length of time which seeds preserve their power of vegetation, even when immersed in the soil, I procured from my friend a quantity of tlie mould, taken fresh from under the sand, and carefully avoiding any mixture of the latter. This was instantly put into a jar, which was stopped up close, by means of a piece of bladder tied tightly over its mouth. Having prepared a couple of flower-pot flats, by drilling small holes in the bottom of them, so as to admit of the ascent of water, I filled the flats with some of the mould, and placing them in a very wide and shallow tub, made on purpose, I covered each of them with a large glass receiver. Each receiver, however, was provided with a brass rim, having little brass knobs on it, so as to raise its edge from the bottom of the tub, and leave a small opening for the admission of air. The whole apparatus was placed in my library, of which the door and windows were kept constantly shut.

      BEANS SOWN BY BIRDS. Many horse-beans sprang up in my field-walks in the autumn, and are now grown to a con- siderable height. As the Ewel was in beans last summer, it is most likely that these seeds came from thence ; but then the distance is too considerable for them to have been conveyed by mice. It is most probable, therefore, that they were brought by birds, and, in particular, by jays and pies, who seem to have hid them among the grass and moss, and then to have forgotten where they had stowed them. Some peas are growing also in the same situation, and probably under the same circumstances.

      WHEAT. A notion has always obtained, that, in England, hot summers are productive of fine crops of wheat ; yet in the years 1780 and 1781, though the heat was intense, the wheat was much mildewed, and the crop light. Does not severe heat, while the straw is milky, occasion its juices to exude, which being extravasated, occasion spots, discolour the stems and blades, and injure the health of the plants ?

      TRUFFLES. August. A truffle-hunter called on us, having in his pocket several large truffles found in this neighbourhood. He says, these roots are not to be found in deep woods, but in narrow hedge-rows and the skirts of coppices. Some truffles, he informed us, lie two feet within the earth, and some quite on the surface ; the latter, he added, have little or no smell, and are not so easily discovered by the dogs as those that lie deeper.

      If a frost happens, even when the ground is considerably dry, as soon as a thaw takes place, the paths and fields are all in a batter. Country people say that the frost draws mois- ture. But the true philosophy is, that the steam and vapours continually ascending from the earth, are bound in by the frost, and not suffered to escape, till released by the thaw. No wonder, then, that the surface is all in a float; since the quantity of moisture by evaporation that arises daily from every acre of ground is astonishing.

      * Fogs happen every where, caused by the upper regions of the atmosphere being colder than the lower, by which the ascent of aqueous vapour is checked, and kept arrested near the surface of the earth. But fogs are more dense about London, and probably all other great cities, than elsewhere : the reason is, because the vast quantity of fuliginous matter floating over such places mingles with the vapour, and renders the whole so thick, that darkness is sometimes produced at noonday, rendering candles and gas lights necessary for the transaction of ordinary business in the shops and public offices. Such circumstances happen frequently during winter ; but on some occasions, (as about two o'clock P. M. on the 27th December, 1831, ) this foggy darkness is truly awful. This extraordi- nary appearance is, however, caused by a very ordinary accident, namely, a change of wind. The west wind carries the smoke of the city to the westward in a long train, extending to the distance of twenty or thirty miles, as may be seen in a clear day by any person on an eminence five or six miles from the city, ED.

      HONEY DEW. June 4, 1783. Vast honey dews this week. The reason of these seems to be, that, in hot days, the effluvia of flowers are drawn up by a brisk evaporation, and then, in the night, fall down with the dews, with which they are entangled.
