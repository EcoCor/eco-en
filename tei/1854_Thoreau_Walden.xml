     When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_80">
     alone, in the woods, a mile from any neighbor, in a house which I had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_90">
     built myself, on the shore of Walden Pond, in Concord, Massachusetts,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_100">
     and earned my living by the labor of my hands only. I lived there two
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_110">
     years and two months. At present I am a sojourner in civilized life
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_120">
     again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_140">
     I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_150">
     very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_160">
     my mode of life, which some would call impertinent, though they do not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_170">
     appear to me at all impertinent, but, considering the circumstances,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_180">
     very natural and pertinent. Some have asked what I got to eat; if I did
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_190">
     not feel lonesome; if I was not afraid; and the like. Others have been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_200">
     curious to learn what portion of my income I devoted to charitable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_210">
     purposes; and some, who have large families, how many poor children I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_220">
     maintained. I will therefore ask those of my readers who feel no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_230">
     particular interest in me to pardon me if I undertake to answer some of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_240">
     these questions in this book. In most books, the _I_, or first person,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_250">
     is omitted; in this it will be retained; that, in respect to egotism,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_260">
     is the main difference. We commonly do not remember that it is, after
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_270">
     all, always the first person that is speaking. I should not talk so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_280">
     much about myself if there were anybody else whom I knew as well.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_290">
     Unfortunately, I am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_300">
     experience. Moreover, I, on my side, require of every writer, first or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_310">
     last, a simple and sincere account of his own life, and not merely what
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_320">
     he has heard of other men’s lives; some such account as he would send
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_330">
     to his kindred from a distant land; for if he has lived sincerely, it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_340">
     must have been in a distant land to me. Perhaps these pages are more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_350">
     particularly addressed to poor students. As for the rest of my readers,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_360">
     they will accept such portions as apply to them. I trust that none will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_370">
     stretch the seams in putting on the coat, for it may do good service to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_380">
     him whom it fits.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_400">
     I would fain say something, not so much concerning the Chinese and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_410">
     Sandwich Islanders as you who read these pages, who are said to live in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_420">
     New England; something about your condition, especially your outward
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_430">
     condition or circumstances in this world, in this town, what it is,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_440">
     whether it is necessary that it be as bad as it is, whether it cannot
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_450">
     be improved as well as not. I have travelled a good deal in Concord;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_460">
     and everywhere, in shops, and offices, and fields, the inhabitants have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_470">
     appeared to me to be doing penance in a thousand remarkable ways. What
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_480">
     I have heard of Brahmins sitting exposed to four fires and looking in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_490">
     the face of the sun; or hanging suspended, with their heads downward,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_500">
     over flames; or looking at the heavens over their shoulders “until it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_510">
     becomes impossible for them to resume their natural position, while
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_520">
     from the twist of the neck nothing but liquids can pass into the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_530">
     stomach;” or dwelling, chained for life, at the foot of a tree; or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_540">
     measuring with their bodies, like caterpillars, the breadth of vast
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_550">
     empires; or standing on one leg on the tops of pillars,—even these
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_560">
     forms of conscious penance are hardly more incredible and astonishing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_570">
     than the scenes which I daily witness. The twelve labors of Hercules
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_580">
     were trifling in comparison with those which my neighbors have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_590">
     undertaken; for they were only twelve, and had an end; but I could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_600">
     never see that these men slew or captured any monster or finished any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_610">
     labor. They have no friend Iolas to burn with a hot iron the root of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_620">
     the hydra’s head, but as soon as one head is crushed, two spring up.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_640">
     I see young men, my townsmen, whose misfortune it is to have inherited
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_650">
     farms, houses, barns, cattle, and farming tools; for these are more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_660">
     easily acquired than got rid of. Better if they had been born in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_670">
     open pasture and suckled by a wolf, that they might have seen with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_680">
     clearer eyes what field they were called to labor in. Who made them
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_690">
     serfs of the soil? Why should they eat their sixty acres, when man is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_700">
     condemned to eat only his peck of dirt? Why should they begin digging
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_710">
     their graves as soon as they are born? They have got to live a man’s
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_720">
     life, pushing all these things before them, and get on as well as they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_730">
     can. How many a poor immortal soul have I met well nigh crushed and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_740">
     smothered under its load, creeping down the road of life, pushing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_750">
     before it a barn seventy-five feet by forty, its Augean stables never
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_760">
     cleansed, and one hundred acres of land, tillage, mowing, pasture, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_770">
     wood-lot! The portionless, who struggle with no such unnecessary
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_780">
     inherited encumbrances, find it labor enough to subdue and cultivate a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_790">
     few cubic feet of flesh.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_810">
     But men labor under a mistake. The better part of the man is soon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_820">
     plowed into the soil for compost. By a seeming fate, commonly called
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_830">
     necessity, they are employed, as it says in an old book, laying up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_840">
     treasures which moth and rust will corrupt and thieves break through
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_850">
     and steal. It is a fool’s life, as they will find when they get to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_860">
     end of it, if not before. It is said that Deucalion and Pyrrha created
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_870">
     men by throwing stones over their heads behind them:—
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_890">
     Inde genus durum sumus, experiensque laborum,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_900">
     Et documenta damus quâ simus origine nati.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_920">
     Or, as Raleigh rhymes it in his sonorous way,—
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_940">
     “From thence our kind hard-hearted is, enduring pain and care,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_950">
     Approving that our bodies of a stony nature are.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_970">
     So much for a blind obedience to a blundering oracle, throwing the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_980">
     stones over their heads behind them, and not seeing where they fell.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_1000">
     Most men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_1010">
     ignorance and mistake, are so occupied with the factitious cares and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_1020">
     superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_1030">
     plucked by them. Their fingers, from excessive toil, are too clumsy and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_1040">
     tremble too much for that. Actually, the laboring man has not leisure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_1050">
     for a true integrity day by day; he cannot afford to sustain the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_1060">
     manliest relations to men; his labor would be depreciated in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_1070">
     market. He has no time to be anything but a machine. How can he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_1080">
     remember well his ignorance—which his growth requires—who has so often
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_1090">
     to use his knowledge? We should feed and clothe him gratuitously
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_1100">
     sometimes, and recruit him with our cordials, before we judge of him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_1110">
     The finest qualities of our nature, like the bloom on fruits, can be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_1120">
     preserved only by the most delicate handling. Yet we do not treat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_1130">
     ourselves nor one another thus tenderly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_1150">
     Some of you, we all know, are poor, find it hard to live, are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_1160">
     sometimes, as it were, gasping for breath. I have no doubt that some of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_1170">
     you who read this book are unable to pay for all the dinners which you
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_1190">
     or are already worn out, and have come to this page to spend borrowed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_1200">
     or stolen time, robbing your creditors of an hour. It is very evident

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_1210">
     what mean and sneaking lives many of you live, for my sight has been

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_2220">
     We might try our lives by a thousand simple tests; as, for instance,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_2530">
     sincerely are we compelled to live, reverencing our life, and denying

     a miracle to contemplate; but it is a miracle which is taking place
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_2570">
     every instant. Confucius said, “To know that we know what we know, and

     To many creatures there is in this sense but one necessary of life,

     Food. To the bison of the prairie it is a few inches of palatable

     Food and Shelter. The necessaries of life for man in this climate may,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_2860">
     accurately enough, be distributed under the several heads of Food,

     Shelter, Clothing, and Fuel; for not till we have secured these are we

     cooked food; and possibly from the accidental discovery of the warmth
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_2910">
     of fire, and the consequent use of it, at first a luxury, arose the
    </p>

     present necessity to sit by it. We observe cats and dogs acquiring the

     which none has been poorer in outward riches, none so rich in inward.

    </p>

     our own lives? The philosopher is in advance of his age even in the
    </p>

     outward form of his life. He is not fed, sheltered, clothed, warmed,

     like his contemporaries. How can a man be a philosopher and not

     When a man is warmed by the several modes which I have described, what

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_3790">

     to-day; that was none of my business. I have watered the red

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_4660">
     huckleberry, the sand cherry and the nettle tree, the red pine and the

     black ash, the white grape and the yellow violet, which might have

     withered else in dry seasons.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_4700">
     In short, I went on thus for a long time, I may say it without

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_4710">
     boasting, faithfully minding my business, till it became more and more

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_4720">
     evident that my townsmen would not after all admit me into the list of

     My accounts, which I can swear to have kept faithfully, I have, indeed,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_4750">
     never got audited, still less accepted, still less paid and settled.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_4760">
     However, I have not set my heart on that.

     Not long since, a strolling Indian went to sell baskets at the house of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_4790">
     a well-known lawyer in my neighborhood. “Do you wish to buy any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_4800">
     baskets?” he asked. “No, we do not want any,” was the reply. “What!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_4810">
     exclaimed the Indian as he went out the gate, “do you mean to starve
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_4820">
     us?” Having seen his industrious white neighbors so well off,—that the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_4830">
     lawyer had only to weave arguments, and by some magic, wealth and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_4840">
     standing followed, he had said to himself; I will go into business; I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_4850">
     will weave baskets; it is a thing which I can do. Thinking that when he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_4860">
     had made the baskets he would have done his part, and then it would be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_4870">
     the white man’s to buy them. He had not discovered that it was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_4880">
     necessary for him to make it worth the other’s while to buy them, or at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_4890">
     least make him think that it was so, or to make something else which it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_4900">
     would be worth his while to buy. I too had woven a kind of basket of a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_4910">
     delicate texture, but I had not made it worth any one’s while to buy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_4920">
     them. Yet not the less, in my case, did I think it worth my while to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_4930">
     weave them, and instead of studying how to make it worth men’s while to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_4940">
     buy my baskets, I studied rather how to avoid the necessity of selling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_4950">
     them. The life which men praise and regard as successful is but one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_4960">
     kind. Why should we exaggerate any one kind at the expense of the

     others?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_4990">
     Finding that my fellow-citizens were not likely to offer me any room in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5000">
     the court house, or any curacy or living any where else, but I must
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5010">
     shift for myself, I turned my face more exclusively than ever to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5020">
     woods, where I was better known. I determined to go into business at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5030">
     once, and not wait to acquire the usual capital, using such slender
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5040">
     means as I had already got. My purpose in going to Walden Pond was not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5050">
     to live cheaply nor to live dearly there, but to transact some private
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5060">
     business with the fewest obstacles; to be hindered from accomplishing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5070">
     which for want of a little common sense, a little enterprise and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5080">
     business talent, appeared not so sad as foolish.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5100">
     I have always endeavored to acquire strict business habits; they are
    </p>

     I have thought that Walden Pond would be a good place for business, not

     solely on account of the railroad and the ice trade; it offers
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5430">
     advantages which it may not be good policy to divulge; it is a good

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5450">

     Clothing, to come at once to the practical part of the question,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5550">
     perhaps we are led oftener by the love of novelty, and a regard for the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5560">
     opinions of men, in procuring it, than by a true utility. Let him who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5570">

     retain the vital heat, and secondly, in this state of society, to cover
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5590">
     nakedness, and he may judge how much of any necessary or important work
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5600">
     may be accomplished without adding to his wardrobe. Kings and queens

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5620">

     They are no better than wooden horses to hang the clean clothes on.

     the impress of the wearer’s character, until we hesitate to lay them

     aside, without such delay and medical appliances and some such
    </p>

     solemnity even as our bodies. No man ever stood the lower in my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5680">
     estimation for having a patch in his clothes; yet I am sure that there
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5690">
     is greater anxiety, commonly, to have fashionable, or at least clean
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5700">
     and unpatched clothes, than to have a sound conscience. But even if the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5710">
     rent is not mended, perhaps the worst vice betrayed is improvidence. I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5720">
     sometimes try my acquaintances by such tests as this;—who could wear a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5730">
     patch, or two extra seams only, over the knee? Most behave as if they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5740">
     believed that their prospects for life would be ruined if they should
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5750">
     do it. It would be easier for them to hobble to town with a broken leg
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5760">
     than with a broken pantaloon. Often if an accident happens to a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5770">
     gentleman’s legs, they can be mended; but if a similar accident happens
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5780">
     to the legs of his pantaloons, there is no help for it; for he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5790">
     considers, not what is truly respectable, but what is respected. We
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5830">
     and coat on a stake, I recognized the owner of the farm. He was only a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_5840">
     little more weather-beaten than when I saw him last. I have heard of a

     interesting question how far men would retain their relative rank if
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_7860">
     subject to the Massachusetts Colony, writing in 1674, says, “The best
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_7870">
     of their houses are covered very neatly, tight and warm, with barks of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_7880">
     trees, slipped from their bodies at those seasons when the sap is up,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_7890">
     and made into great flakes, with pressure of weighty timber, when they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_7900">
     are green.... The meaner sort are covered with mats which they make of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_7910">
     a kind of bulrush, and are also indifferently tight and warm, but not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_7920">
     so good as the former.... Some I have seen, sixty or a hundred feet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_7930">
     long and thirty feet broad.... I have often lodged in their wigwams,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_7940">
     and found them as warm as the best English houses.” He adds, that they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_7950">
     were commonly carpeted and lined within with well-wrought embroidered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_7960">
     mats, and were furnished with various utensils. The Indians had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_7970">
     advanced so far as to regulate the effect of the wind by a mat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_7980">
     suspended over the hole in the roof and moved by a string. Such a lodge
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_7990">
     was in the first instance constructed in a day or two at most, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8000">
     taken down and put up in a few hours; and every family owned one, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8010">
     its apartment in one.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8030">
     In the savage state every family owns a shelter as good as the best,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8040">
     and sufficient for its coarser and simpler wants; but I think that I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8050">
     speak within bounds when I say that, though the birds of the air have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8060">
     their nests, and the foxes their holes, and the savages their wigwams,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8070">
     in modern civilized society not more than one half the families own a

     shelter. In the large towns and cities, where civilization especially
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8090">
     prevails, the number of those who own a shelter is a very small

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8120">
     a village of Indian wigwams, but now helps to keep them poor as long as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8130">
     they live. I do not mean to insist here on the disadvantage of hiring
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8140">
     compared with owning, but it is evident that the savage owns his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8150">
     shelter because it costs so little, while the civilized man hires his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8160">
     commonly because he cannot afford to own it; nor can he, in the long
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8170">
     run, any better afford to hire. But, answers one, by merely paying this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8180">
     tax the poor civilized man secures an abode which is a palace compared
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8190">
     with the savage’s. An annual rent of from twenty-five to a hundred
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8200">
     dollars, these are the country rates, entitles him to the benefit of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8210">
     the improvements of centuries, spacious apartments, clean paint and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8220">
     paper, Rumford fireplace, back plastering, Venetian blinds, copper
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8230">
     pump, spring lock, a commodious cellar, and many other things. But how
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8240">
     happens it that he who is said to enjoy these things is so commonly a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8250">
     _poor_ civilized man, while the savage, who has them not, is rich as a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8260">
     savage? If it is asserted that civilization is a real advance in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8270">
     condition of man,—and I think that it is, though only the wise improve
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8280">
     their advantages,—it must be shown that it has produced better
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8290">
     dwellings without making them more costly; and the cost of a thing is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8300">
     the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8310">
     for it, immediately or in the long run. An average house in this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8320">
     neighborhood costs perhaps eight hundred dollars, and to lay up this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8330">
     sum will take from ten to fifteen years of the laborer’s life, even if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8340">
     he is not encumbered with a family;—estimating the pecuniary value of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8350">
     every man’s labor at one dollar a day, for if some receive more, others
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8360">
     receive less;—so that he must have spent more than half his life
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8370">
     commonly before _his_ wigwam will be earned. If we suppose him to pay a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8380">
     rent instead, this is but a doubtful choice of evils. Would the savage
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8390">
     have been wise to exchange his wigwam for a palace on these terms?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8410">
     It may be guessed that I reduce almost the whole advantage of holding
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8420">
     this superfluous property as a fund in store against the future, so far
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8430">
     as the individual is concerned, mainly to the defraying of funeral
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8440">
     expenses. But perhaps a man is not required to bury himself.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8450">
     Nevertheless this points to an important distinction between the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8460">
     civilized man and the savage; and, no doubt, they have designs on us
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8470">
     for our benefit, in making the life of a civilized people an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8480">
     _institution_, in which the life of the individual is to a great extent
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8490">
     absorbed, in order to preserve and perfect that of the race. But I wish
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8500">
     to show at what a sacrifice this advantage is at present obtained, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8510">
     to suggest that we may possibly so live as to secure all the advantage
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8520">
     without suffering any of the disadvantage. What mean ye by saying that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8530">
     the poor ye have always with you, or that the fathers have eaten sour
    </p>

     When I consider my neighbors, the farmers of Concord, who are at least
    </p>

     as well off as the other classes, I find that for the most part they

     have been toiling twenty, thirty, or forty years, that they may become
    </p>

     the real owners of their farms, which commonly they have inherited with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8660">
     encumbrances, or else bought with hired money,—and we may regard one
    </p>

     third of that toil as the cost of their houses,—but commonly they have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8680">
     not paid for them yet. It is true, the encumbrances sometimes outweigh
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8690">
     the value of the farm, so that the farm itself becomes one great
    </p>

     encumbrance, and still a man is found to inherit it, being well
    </p>

     acquainted with it, as he says. On applying to the assessors, I am
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8720">
     surprised to learn that they cannot at once name a dozen in the town
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8750">
     who has actually paid for his farm with labor on it is so rare that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8760">
     every neighbor can point to him. I doubt if there are three such men in

     majority, even ninety-seven in a hundred, are sure to fail, is equally
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8790">
     true of the farmers. With regard to the merchants, however, one of them
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8800">
     says pertinently that a great part of their failures are not genuine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8810">
     pecuniary failures, but merely failures to fulfil their engagements,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8820">
     because it is inconvenient; that is, it is the moral character that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8830">
     breaks down. But this puts an infinitely worse face on the matter, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_8840">
     suggests, beside, that probably not even the other three succeed in

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_10840">
     and we are still forced to cut our _spiritual_ bread far thinner than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_10850">
     our forefathers did their wheaten. Not that all architectural ornament
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_10860">
     is to be neglected even in the rudest periods; but let our houses first
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_10870">
     be lined with beauty, where they come in contact with our lives, like
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_10880">
     the tenement of the shellfish, and not overlaid with it. But, alas! I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_10890">
     have been inside one or two of them, and know what they are lined with.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_10910">
     Though we are not so degenerate but that we might possibly live in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_10920">
     cave or a wigwam or wear skins today, it certainly is better to accept
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_10930">
     the advantages, though so dearly bought, which the invention and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_10940">
     industry of mankind offer. In such a neighborhood as this, boards and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_10950">
     shingles, lime and bricks, are cheaper and more easily obtained than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_10960">
     suitable caves, or whole logs, or bark in sufficient quantities, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_10970">
     even well-tempered clay or flat stones. I speak understandingly on this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_10980">
     subject, for I have made myself acquainted with it both theoretically
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_10990">
     and practically. With a little more wit we might use these materials so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11000">
     as to become richer than the richest now are, and make our civilization
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11010">
     a blessing. The civilized man is a more experienced and wiser savage.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11020">
     But to make haste to my own experiment.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11060">
     Near the end of March, 1845, I borrowed an axe and went down to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11070">
     woods by Walden Pond, nearest to where I intended to build my house,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11080">
     and began to cut down some tall, arrowy white pines, still in their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11090">
     youth, for timber. It is difficult to begin without borrowing, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11100">
     perhaps it is the most generous course thus to permit your fellow-men
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11110">
     to have an interest in your enterprise. The owner of the axe, as he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11120">
     released his hold on it, said that it was the apple of his eye; but I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11130">
     returned it sharper than I received it. It was a pleasant hillside
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11140">
     where I worked, covered with pine woods, through which I looked out on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11150">
     the pond, and a small open field in the woods where pines and hickories
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11160">
     were springing up. The ice in the pond was not yet dissolved, though
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11170">
     there were some open spaces, and it was all dark colored and saturated
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11180">
     with water. There were some slight flurries of snow during the days
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11190">
     that I worked there; but for the most part when I came out on to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11200">
     railroad, on my way home, its yellow sand heap stretched away gleaming
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11210">
     in the hazy atmosphere, and the rails shone in the spring sun, and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11220">
     heard the lark and pewee and other birds already come to commence
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11230">
     another year with us. They were pleasant spring days, in which the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11240">
     winter of man’s discontent was thawing as well as the earth, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11250">
     life that had lain torpid began to stretch itself. One day, when my axe
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11260">
     had come off and I had cut a green hickory for a wedge, driving it with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11270">
     a stone, and had placed the whole to soak in a pond hole in order to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11280">
     swell the wood, I saw a striped snake run into the water, and he lay on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11290">
     the bottom, apparently without inconvenience, as long as I stayed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11300">
     there, or more than a quarter of an hour; perhaps because he had not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11310">
     yet fairly come out of the torpid state. It appeared to me that for a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11320">
     like reason men remain in their present low and primitive condition;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11330">
     but if they should feel the influence of the spring of springs arousing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11340">
     them, they would of necessity rise to a higher and more ethereal life.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11350">
     I had previously seen the snakes in frosty mornings in my path with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11360">
     portions of their bodies still numb and inflexible, waiting for the sun
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11370">
     to thaw them. On the 1st of April it rained and melted the ice, and in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11380">
     the early part of the day, which was very foggy, I heard a stray goose
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11390">
     groping about over the pond and cackling as if lost, or like the spirit
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11400">
     of the fog.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11420">
     So I went on for some days cutting and hewing timber, and also studs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11430">
     and rafters, all with my narrow axe, not having many communicable or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11440">
     scholar-like thoughts, singing to myself,—
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11460">
     Men say they know many things;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11470">
     But lo! they have taken wings,—
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11480">
     The arts and sciences,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11490">
     And a thousand appliances;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11500">
     The wind that blows
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11510">
     Is all that any body knows.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11530">
     I hewed the main timbers six inches square, most of the studs on two
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11540">
     sides only, and the rafters and floor timbers on one side, leaving the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11550">
     rest of the bark on, so that they were just as straight and much
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11560">
     stronger than sawed ones. Each stick was carefully mortised or tenoned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11570">
     by its stump, for I had borrowed other tools by this time. My days in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11580">
     the woods were not very long ones; yet I usually carried my dinner of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11590">
     bread and butter, and read the newspaper in which it was wrapped, at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11600">
     noon, sitting amid the green pine boughs which I had cut off, and to my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11610">
     bread was imparted some of their fragrance, for my hands were covered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11620">
     with a thick coat of pitch. Before I had done I was more the friend
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11630">
     than the foe of the pine tree, though I had cut down some of them,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11640">
     having become better acquainted with it. Sometimes a rambler in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11650">
     wood was attracted by the sound of my axe, and we chatted pleasantly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11660">
     over the chips which I had made.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11680">
     By the middle of April, for I made no haste in my work, but rather made
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11690">
     the most of it, my house was framed and ready for the raising. I had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11700">
     already bought the shanty of James Collins, an Irishman who worked on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11710">
     the Fitchburg Railroad, for boards. James Collins’ shanty was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11720">
     considered an uncommonly fine one. When I called to see it he was not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11730">
     at home. I walked about the outside, at first unobserved from within,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11740">
     the window was so deep and high. It was of small dimensions, with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11750">
     peaked cottage roof, and not much else to be seen, the dirt being
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11760">
     raised five feet all around as if it were a compost heap. The roof was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11770">
     the soundest part, though a good deal warped and made brittle by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11780">
     sun. Door-sill there was none, but a perennial passage for the hens
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11790">
     under the door board. Mrs. C. came to the door and asked me to view it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11800">
     from the inside. The hens were driven in by my approach. It was dark,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11810">
     and had a dirt floor for the most part, dank, clammy, and aguish, only
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11820">
     here a board and there a board which would not bear removal. She
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11830">
     lighted a lamp to show me the inside of the roof and the walls, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11840">
     also that the board floor extended under the bed, warning me not to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11850">
     step into the cellar, a sort of dust hole two feet deep. In her own
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11860">
     words, they were “good boards overhead, good boards all around, and a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11870">
     good window,”—of two whole squares originally, only the cat had passed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11880">
     out that way lately. There was a stove, a bed, and a place to sit, an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11890">
     infant in the house where it was born, a silk parasol, gilt-framed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11900">
     looking-glass, and a patent new coffee mill nailed to an oak sapling,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11910">
     all told. The bargain was soon concluded, for James had in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11920">
     meanwhile returned. I to pay four dollars and twenty-five cents
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11930">
     to-night, he to vacate at five to-morrow morning, selling to nobody
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11940">
     else meanwhile: I to take possession at six. It were well, he said, to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11950">
     be there early, and anticipate certain indistinct but wholly unjust
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11960">
     claims on the score of ground rent and fuel. This he assured me was the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11970">
     only encumbrance. At six I passed him and his family on the road. One
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11980">
     large bundle held their all,—bed, coffee-mill, looking-glass, hens,—all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_11990">
     but the cat, she took to the woods and became a wild cat, and, as I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_12000">
     learned afterward, trod in a trap set for woodchucks, and so became a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_12010">
     dead cat at last.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_12030">
     I took down this dwelling the same morning, drawing the nails, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_12040">
     removed it to the pond side by small cartloads, spreading the boards on

     look freshly up, unconcerned, with spring thoughts, at the devastation;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_12120">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_12160">

     gratification of every appetite and passion whatever. A general amnesty
    </p>

     is proclaimed; all malefactors may return to their town.—”
    </p>

     “On the fourth morning, the high priest, by rubbing dry wood together,

     the town is supplied with the new and pure flame.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19390">
     They then feast on the new corn and fruits, and dance and sing for

     The Mexicans also practised a similar purification at the end of every

     fifty-two years, in the belief that it was time for the world to come

     inspired directly from Heaven to do thus, though they have no biblical

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19560">
     For more than five years I maintained myself thus solely by the labor
    </p>

     of my hands, and I found, that by working about six weeks in a year, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19580">
     could meet all the expenses of living. The whole of my winters, as well
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19590">
     as most of my summers, I had free and clear for study. I have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19600">
     thoroughly tried school-keeping, and found that my expenses were in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19610">
     proportion, or rather out of proportion, to my income, for I was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19620">
     obliged to dress and train, not to say think and believe, accordingly,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19630">
     and I lost my time into the bargain. As I did not teach for the good of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19640">
     my fellow-men, but simply for a livelihood, this was a failure. I have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19650">
     tried trade; but I found that it would take ten years to get under way
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19660">
     in that, and that then I should probably be on my way to the devil. I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19670">
     was actually afraid that I might by that time be doing what is called a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19680">
     good business. When formerly I was looking about to see what I could do
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19690">
     for a living, some sad experience in conforming to the wishes of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19700">
     friends being fresh in my mind to tax my ingenuity, I thought often and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19710">
     seriously of picking huckleberries; that surely I could do, and its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19720">
     small profits might suffice,—for my greatest skill has been to want but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19730">
     little,—so little capital it required, so little distraction from my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19740">
     wonted moods, I foolishly thought. While my acquaintances went
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19750">
     unhesitatingly into trade or the professions, I contemplated this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19760">
     occupation as most like theirs; ranging the hills all summer to pick
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19770">
     the berries which came in my way, and thereafter carelessly dispose of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19780">
     them; so, to keep the flocks of Admetus. I also dreamed that I might
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19790">
     gather the wild herbs, or carry evergreens to such villagers as loved
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19800">
     to be reminded of the woods, even to the city, by hay-cart loads. But I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19810">
     have since learned that trade curses everything it handles; and though
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19820">
     you trade in messages from heaven, the whole curse of trade attaches to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19830">
     the business.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19850">
     As I preferred some things to others, and especially valued my freedom,
    </p>

     as I could fare hard and yet succeed well, I did not wish to spend my
    </p>

     time in earning rich carpets or other fine furniture, or delicate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19880">
     cookery, or a house in the Grecian or the Gothic style just yet. If
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19890">
     there are any to whom it is no interruption to acquire these things,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19900">
     and who know how to use them when acquired, I relinquish to them the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19910">
     pursuit. Some are “industrious,” and appear to love labor for its own
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19920">
     sake, or perhaps because it keeps them out of worse mischief; to such I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19930">
     have at present nothing to say. Those who would not know what to do
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19940">
     with more leisure than they now enjoy, I might advise to work twice as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19950">
     hard as they do,—work till they pay for themselves, and get their free
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19960">
     papers. For myself I found that the occupation of a day-laborer was the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19970">
     most independent of any, especially as it required only thirty or forty
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19980">
     days in a year to support one. The laborer’s day ends with the going
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_19990">
     down of the sun, and he is then free to devote himself to his chosen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_20000">
     pursuit, independent of his labor; but his employer, who speculates
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_20010">
     from month to month, has no respite from one end of the year to the

     other.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_20040">
     In short, I am convinced, both by faith and experience, that to

     Where I Lived, and What I Lived For
    </head>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_22890">
     At a certain season of our life we are accustomed to consider every
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_22900">
     spot as the possible site of a house. I have thus surveyed the country
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_22910">
     on every side within a dozen miles of where I live. In imagination I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_22920">
     have bought all the farms in succession, for all were to be bought, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_22930">
     I knew their price. I walked over each farmer’s premises, tasted his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_22940">
     wild apples, discoursed on husbandry with him, took his farm at his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_22950">
     price, at any price, mortgaging it to him in my mind; even put a higher
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_22960">
     price on it,—took everything but a deed of it,—took his word for his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_22970">
     deed, for I dearly love to talk,—cultivated it, and him too to some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_22980">
     extent, I trust, and withdrew when I had enjoyed it long enough,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_22990">
     leaving him to carry it on. This experience entitled me to be regarded
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23000">
     as a sort of real-estate broker by my friends. Wherever I sat, there I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23010">
     might live, and the landscape radiated from me accordingly. What is a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23020">
     house but a _sedes_, a seat?—better if a country seat. I discovered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23030">
     many a site for a house not likely to be soon improved, which some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23040">
     might have thought too far from the village, but to my eyes the village
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23050">
     was too far from it. Well, there I might live, I said; and there I did
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23060">
     live, for an hour, a summer and a winter life; saw how I could let the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23070">
     years run off, buffet the winter through, and see the spring come in.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23080">
     The future inhabitants of this region, wherever they may place their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23090">
     houses, may be sure that they have been anticipated. An afternoon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23100">
     sufficed to lay out the land into orchard, woodlot, and pasture, and to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23110">
     decide what fine oaks or pines should be left to stand before the door,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23120">
     and whence each blasted tree could be seen to the best advantage; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23130">
     then I let it lie, fallow perchance, for a man is rich in proportion to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23140">
     the number of things which he can afford to let alone.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23160">
     My imagination carried me so far that I even had the refusal of several
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23170">
     farms,—the refusal was all I wanted,—but I never got my fingers burned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23180">
     by actual possession. The nearest that I came to actual possession was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23190">
     when I bought the Hollowell place, and had begun to sort my seeds, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23200">
     collected materials with which to make a wheelbarrow to carry it on or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23210">
     off with; but before the owner gave me a deed of it, his wife—every man
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23220">
     has such a wife—changed her mind and wished to keep it, and he offered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23230">
     me ten dollars to release him. Now, to speak the truth, I had but ten
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23240">
     cents in the world, and it surpassed my arithmetic to tell, if I was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23250">
     that man who had ten cents, or who had a farm, or ten dollars, or all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23260">
     together. However, I let him keep the ten dollars and the farm too, for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23270">
     I had carried it far enough; or rather, to be generous, I sold him the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23280">
     farm for just what I gave for it, and, as he was not a rich man, made
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_23290">
     him a present of ten dollars, and still had my ten cents, and seeds,

     visited the year before. This was an airy and unplastered cabin, fit to

     entertain a travelling god, and where a goddess might trail her

     over the ridges of mountains, bearing the broken strains, or celestial

     a tent, which I used occasionally when making excursions in the summer,
    </p>

     substantial shelter about me, I had made some progress toward settling
    </p>

    </p>

    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24210">
     outdoors to take the air, for the atmosphere within had lost none of
    </p>

     its freshness. It was not so much within doors as behind a door where I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24230">
     sat, even in the rainiest weather. The Harivansa says, “An abode
    </p>

     for I found myself suddenly neighbor to the birds; not by having
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24260">
     imprisoned one, but having caged myself near them. I was not only
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24270">
     nearer to some of those which commonly frequent the garden and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24280">
     orchard, but to those wilder and more thrilling songsters of the forest
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24290">
     which never, or rarely, serenade a villager,—the wood-thrush, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24300">
     veery, the scarlet tanager, the field-sparrow, the whippoorwill, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24310">
     many others.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24330">
     I was seated by the shore of a small pond, about a mile and a half
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24340">
     south of the village of Concord and somewhat higher than it, in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24350">
     midst of an extensive wood between that town and Lincoln, and about two
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24360">
     miles south of that our only field known to fame, Concord Battle

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24370">
     Ground; but I was so low in the woods that the opposite shore, half a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24380">
     mile off, like the rest, covered with wood, was my most distant
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24390">
     horizon. For the first week, whenever I looked out on the pond it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24400">
     impressed me like a tarn high up on the side of a mountain, its bottom
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24410">
     far above the surface of other lakes, and, as the sun arose, I saw it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24420">
     throwing off its nightly clothing of mist, and here and there, by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24430">
     degrees, its soft ripples or its smooth reflecting surface was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24440">
     revealed, while the mists, like ghosts, were stealthily withdrawing in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24450">
     every direction into the woods, as at the breaking up of some nocturnal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24460">
     conventicle. The very dew seemed to hang upon the trees later into the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24470">
     day than usual, as on the sides of mountains.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24490">
     This small lake was of most value as a neighbor in the intervals of a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24500">
     gentle rain storm in August, when, both air and water being perfectly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24510">
     still, but the sky overcast, mid-afternoon had all the serenity of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24520">
     evening, and the wood-thrush sang around, and was heard from shore to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24530">
     shore. A lake like this is never smoother than at such a time; and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24540">
     clear portion of the air above it being shallow and darkened by clouds,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24550">
     the water, full of light and reflections, becomes a lower heaven itself
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24560">
     so much the more important. From a hill top near by, where the wood had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24570">
     been recently cut off, there was a pleasing vista southward across the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24580">
     pond, through a wide indentation in the hills which form the shore
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24590">
     there, where their opposite sides sloping toward each other suggested a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24600">
     stream flowing out in that direction through a wooded valley, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24610">
     stream there was none. That way I looked between and over the near
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24620">
     green hills to some distant and higher ones in the horizon, tinged with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24630">
     blue. Indeed, by standing on tiptoe I could catch a glimpse of some of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24640">
     the peaks of the still bluer and more distant mountain ranges in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24650">
     north-west, those true-blue coins from heaven’s own mint, and also of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24660">
     some portion of the village. But in other directions, even from this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24670">
     point, I could not see over or beyond the woods which surrounded me. It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24680">
     is well to have some water in your neighborhood, to give buoyancy to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24690">
     and float the earth. One value even of the smallest well is, that when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24700">
     you look into it you see that earth is not continent but insular. This
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24710">
     is as important as that it keeps butter cool. When I looked across the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24720">
     pond from this peak toward the Sudbury meadows, which in time of flood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24730">
     I distinguished elevated perhaps by a mirage in their seething valley,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24740">
     like a coin in a basin, all the earth beyond the pond appeared like a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24750">
     thin crust insulated and floated even by this small sheet of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24760">
     interverting water, and I was reminded that this on which I dwelt was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24770">
     but _dry land_.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24790">
     Though the view from my door was still more contracted, I did not feel
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24800">
     crowded or confined in the least. There was pasture enough for my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24810">
     imagination. The low shrub-oak plateau to which the opposite shore
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24820">
     arose, stretched away toward the prairies of the West and the steppes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24830">
     of Tartary, affording ample room for all the roving families of men.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_24840">
     “There are none happy in the world but beings who enjoy freely a vast

     horizon,”—said Damodara, when his herds required new and larger

     pastures.
    </p>

     “There was a shepherd that did live,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25040">
     As were the mounts whereon his flocks

     wandered to higher pastures than his thoughts?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25100">
     Every morning was a cheerful invitation to make my life of equal

     simplicity, and I may say innocence, with Nature herself. I have been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25120">
     as sincere a worshipper of Aurora as the Greeks. I got up early and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25130">
     bathed in the pond; that was a religious exercise, and one of the best

     sitting with door and windows open, as I could be by any trumpet that
    </p>

     cosmical about it; a standing advertisement, till forbidden, of the
    </p>

     everlasting vigor and fertility of the world. The morning, which is the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25250">
     most memorable season of the day, is the awakening hour. Then there is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25260">
     least somnolence in us; and for an hour, at least, some part of us
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25270">
     awakes which slumbers all the rest of the day and night. Little is to

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25350">
     who does not believe that each day contains an earlier, more sacred,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25360">
     and auroral hour than he has yet profaned, has despaired of life, and

     reinvigorated each day, and his Genius tries again what noble life it

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25400">
     can make. All memorable events, I should say, transpire in morning time
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25410">
     and in a morning atmosphere. The Vedas say, “All intelligences awake
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25420">
     with the morning.” Poetry and art, and the fairest and most memorable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25430">
     of the actions of men, date from such an hour. All poets and heroes,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25440">
     like Memnon, are the children of Aurora, and emit their music at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25450">
     sunrise. To him whose elastic and vigorous thought keeps pace with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25460">
     sun, the day is a perpetual morning. It matters not what the clocks say
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25470">
     or the attitudes and labors of men. Morning is when I am awake and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25480">
     there is a dawn in me. Moral reform is the effort to throw off sleep.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25490">
     Why is it that men give so poor an account of their day if they have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25500">
     not been slumbering? They are not such poor calculators. If they had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25510">
     not been overcome with drowsiness, they would have performed something.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25520">
     The millions are awake enough for physical labor; but only one in a

     in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life. To be awake is to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25550">
     alive. I have never yet met a man who was quite awake. How could I have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25560">
     looked him in the face?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25580">
     We must learn to reawaken and keep ourselves awake, not by mechanical
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25590">
     aids, but by an infinite expectation of the dawn, which does not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25600">
     forsake us in our soundest sleep. I know of no more encouraging fact
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25610">
     than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25620">
     conscious endeavor. It is something to be able to paint a particular
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25630">
     picture, or to carve a statue, and so to make a few objects beautiful;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25640">
     but it is far more glorious to carve and paint the very atmosphere and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25650">
     medium through which we look, which morally we can do. To affect the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25660">
     quality of the day, that is the highest of arts. Every man is tasked to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25670">
     make his life, even in its details, worthy of the contemplation of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25680">
     most elevated and critical hour. If we refused, or rather used up, such
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25690">
     paltry information as we get, the oracles would distinctly inform us
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25700">
     how this might be done.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25720">
     I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25730">
     only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25740">
     had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_25760">
     did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I

     to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness
    </p>

     to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be
    </p>

     of the devil or of God, and have _somewhat hastily_ concluded that it

     is the chief end of man here to “glorify God and enjoy him forever.”
    </p>

     Still we live meanly, like ants; though the fable tells us that we were

     ministers having discovered him, revealed to him what he was, and the
    </p>

     misconception of his character was removed, and he knew himself to be a

     it were, natural melody, worth importing into the wilderness. At a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_34790">
     sufficient distance over the woods this sound acquires a certain
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_34800">
     vibratory hum, as if the pine needles in the horizon were the strings
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_34810">
     of a harp which it swept. All sound heard at the greatest possible
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_34820">
     distance produces one and the same effect, a vibration of the universal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_34830">
     lyre, just as the intervening atmosphere makes a distant ridge of earth
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_34840">
     interesting to our eyes by the azure tint it imparts to it. There came
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_34850">
     to me in this case a melody which the air had strained, and which had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_34860">
     conversed with every leaf and needle of the wood, that portion of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_34870">
     sound which the elements had taken up and modulated and echoed from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_34880">
     vale to vale. The echo is, to some extent, an original sound, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_34890">
     therein is the magic and charm of it. It is not merely a repetition of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_34900">
     what was worth repeating in the bell, but partly the voice of the wood;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_34910">
     the same trivial words and notes sung by a wood-nymph.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_34930">
     At evening, the distant lowing of some cow in the horizon beyond the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_34940">
     woods sounded sweet and melodious, and at first I would mistake it for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_34950">
     the voices of certain minstrels by whom I was sometimes serenaded, who
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_34970">
     disappointed when it was prolonged into the cheap and natural music of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_34980">
     the cow. I do not mean to be satirical, but to express my appreciation
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_34990">
     of those youths’ singing, when I state that I perceived clearly that it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_35000">
     was akin to the music of the cow, and they were at length one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_35010">
     articulation of Nature.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_35030">
     Regularly at half past seven, in one part of the summer, after the
    </p>

     evening train had gone by, the whippoorwills chanted their vespers for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_35050">
     half an hour, sitting on a stump by my door, or upon the ridge pole of
    </p>

    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_35090">
     acquainted with their habits. Sometimes I heard four or five at once in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_35100">
     different parts of the wood, by accident one a bar behind another, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_35110">
     so near me that I distinguished not only the cluck after each note, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_35120">
     often that singular buzzing sound like a fly in a spider’s web, only
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_35130">
     proportionally louder. Sometimes one would circle round and round me in

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_35140">
     the woods a few feet distant as if tethered by a string, when probably

     I was near its eggs. They sang at intervals throughout the night, and

     their wailing, their doleful responses, trilled along the wood-side;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_35250">
     reminding me sometimes of music and singing birds; as if it were the
    </p>

     dark and tearful side of music, the regrets and sighs that would fain
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_36100">
     are sound, his spirits never flag. Even the sailor on the Atlantic and

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_36110">
     Pacific is awakened by his voice; but its shrill sound never roused me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_36120">
     from my slumbers. I kept neither dog, cat, cow, pig, nor hens, so that

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_36130">
     you would have said there was a deficiency of domestic sounds; neither

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_36180">

     liberty in Nature, a part of herself. As I walk along the stony shore

     dash, and some creatures lull the rest with their notes. The repose is

     the pond on the one hand, and of the fence which skirts the woodland

     I had three chairs in my house; one for solitude, two for friendship,

     innumerable apartments, their huge halls and their cellars for the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_39580">
     difficulty of getting to a sufficient distance from my guest when we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_39590">
     began to utter the big thoughts in big words. You want room for your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_39600">
     thoughts to get into sailing trim and run a course or two before they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_39610">
     make their port. The bullet of your thought must have overcome its
    </p>

     lateral and ricochet motion and fallen into its last and steady course
    </p>

     before it reaches the ear of the hearer, else it may plough out again
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_39640">
     through the side of his head. Also, our sentences wanted room to unfold
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_39650">
     and form their columns in the interval. Individuals, like nations, must
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_39660">
     have suitable broad and natural boundaries, even a considerable neutral
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_39670">
     ground, between them. I have found it a singular luxury to talk across
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_39680">
     the pond to a companion on the opposite side. In my house we were so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_39690">
     near that we could not begin to hear,—we could not speak low enough to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_39700">
     be heard; as when you throw two stones into calm water so near that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_39710">
     they break each other’s undulations. If we are merely loquacious and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_39720">
     loud talkers, then we can afford to stand very near together, cheek by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_39730">
     jowl, and feel each other’s breath; but if we speak reservedly and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_39740">
     thoughtfully, we want to be farther apart, that all animal heat and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_39750">
     moisture may have a chance to evaporate. If we would enjoy the most
    </p>

     intimate society with that in each of us which is without, or above,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_39770">
     being spoken to, we must not only be silent, but commonly so far apart
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_39780">
     bodily that we cannot possibly hear each other’s voice in any case.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_39790">
     Referred to this standard, speech is for the convenience of those who

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_39810">
     if we have to shout. As the conversation began to assume a loftier and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_39820">
     grander tone, we gradually shoved our chairs farther apart till they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_39830">
     touched the wall in opposite corners, and then commonly there was not
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_39920">
     If one guest came he sometimes partook of my frugal meal, and it was no

     watching the rising and maturing of a loaf of bread in the ashes, in

     nothing said about dinner, though there might be bread enough for two,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_39970">
     more than if eating were a forsaken habit; but we naturally practised
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_39980">
     abstinence; and this was never felt to be an offence against
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_39990">
     hospitality, but the most proper and considerate course. The waste and

     decay of physical life, which so often needs repair, seemed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40010">
     miraculously retarded in such a case, and the vital vigor stood its

     ground. I could entertain thus a thousand as well as twenty; and if any

     again. I think I shall never revisit those scenes. I should be proud to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40120">
     have for the motto of my cabin those lines of Spenser which one of my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40130">
     visitors inscribed on a yellow walnut leaf for a card:—
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40150">
     “Arrivéd there, the little house they fill,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40160">
     Ne looke for entertainment where none was;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40170">
     Rest is their feast, and all things at their will:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40180">
     The noblest mind the best contentment has.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40200">
     When Winslow, afterward governor of the Plymouth Colony, went with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40210">
     companion on a visit of ceremony to Massasoit on foot through the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40220">
     woods, and arrived tired and hungry at his lodge, they were well
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40230">
     received by the king, but nothing was said about eating that day. When
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40240">
     the night arrived, to quote their own words,—“He laid us on the bed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40250">
     with himself and his wife, they at the one end and we at the other, it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40260">
     being only planks laid a foot from the ground, and a thin mat upon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40270">
     them. Two more of his chief men, for want of room, pressed by and upon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40280">
     us; so that we were worse weary of our lodging than of our journey.” At
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40290">
     one o’clock the next day Massasoit “brought two fishes that he had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40300">
     shot,” about thrice as big as a bream; “these being boiled, there were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40310">
     at least forty looked for a share in them. The most ate of them. This
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40320">
     meal only we had in two nights and a day; and had not one of us bought
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40330">
     a partridge, we had taken our journey fasting.” Fearing that they would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40340">
     be light-headed for want of food and also sleep, owing to “the savages’
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40350">
     barbarous singing, (for they used to sing themselves asleep,)” and that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40360">
     they might get home while they had strength to travel, they departed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40370">
     As for lodging, it is true they were but poorly entertained, though
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40380">
     what they found an inconvenience was no doubt intended for an honor;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40390">
     but as far as eating was concerned, I do not see how the Indians could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40400">
     have done better. They had nothing to eat themselves, and they were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40410">
     wiser than to think that apologies could supply the place of food to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40420">
     their guests; so they drew their belts tighter and said nothing about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40430">
     it. Another time when Winslow visited them, it being a season of plenty
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40440">
     with them, there was no deficiency in this respect.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40460">
     As for men, they will hardly fail one any where. I had more visitors
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40470">
     while I lived in the woods than at any other period in my life; I mean
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40480">
     that I had some. I met several there under more favorable circumstances
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40490">
     than I could any where else. But fewer came to see me on trivial
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40500">
     business. In this respect, my company was winnowed by my mere distance
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40510">
     from town. I had withdrawn so far within the great ocean of solitude,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40520">
     into which the rivers of society empty, that for the most part, so far
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40530">
     as my needs were concerned, only the finest sediment was deposited
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40540">
     around me. Beside, there were wafted to me evidences of unexplored and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40550">
     uncultivated continents on the other side.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40570">
     Who should come to my lodge this morning but a true Homeric or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40580">
     Paphlagonian man,—he had so suitable and poetic a name that I am sorry
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40590">
     I cannot print it here,—a Canadian, a woodchopper and post-maker, who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40600">
     can hole fifty posts in a day, who made his last supper on a woodchuck
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40610">
     which his dog caught. He, too, has heard of Homer, and, “if it were not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40620">
     for books,” would “not know what to do rainy days,” though perhaps he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40630">
     has not read one wholly through for many rainy seasons. Some priest who

     could pronounce the Greek itself taught him to read his verse in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40650">
     testament in his native parish far away; and now I must translate to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40660">
     him, while he holds the book, Achilles’ reproof to Patroclus for his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40670">
     sad countenance.—“Why are you in tears, Patroclus, like a young girl?”—
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40690">
     “Or have you alone heard some news from Phthia?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40700">
     They say that Menœtius lives yet, son of Actor,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40710">
     And Peleus lives, son of Æacus, among the Myrmidons,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40720">
     Either of whom having died, we should greatly grieve.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40740">
     He says, “That’s good.” He has a great bundle of white-oak bark under
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40750">
     his arm for a sick man, gathered this Sunday morning. “I suppose
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40760">
     there’s no harm in going after such a thing to-day,” says he. To him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40770">
     Homer was a great writer, though what his writing was about he did not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40780">
     know. A more simple and natural man it would be hard to find. Vice and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40790">
     disease, which cast such a sombre moral hue over the world, seemed to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40800">
     have hardly any existence for him. He was about twenty-eight years old,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40810">
     and had left Canada and his father’s house a dozen years before to work
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40820">
     in the States, and earn money to buy a farm with at last, perhaps in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40830">
     his native country. He was cast in the coarsest mould; a stout but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40840">
     sluggish body, yet gracefully carried, with a thick sunburnt neck, dark
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40850">
     bushy hair, and dull sleepy blue eyes, which were occasionally lit up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40860">
     with expression. He wore a flat gray cloth cap, a dingy wool-colored
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40870">
     greatcoat, and cowhide boots. He was a great consumer of meat, usually
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40880">
     carrying his dinner to his work a couple of miles past my house,—for he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40890">
     chopped all summer,—in a tin pail; cold meats, often cold woodchucks,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40900">
     and coffee in a stone bottle which dangled by a string from his belt;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40910">
     and sometimes he offered me a drink. He came along early, crossing my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40920">
     bean-field, though without anxiety or haste to get to his work, such as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40930">
     Yankees exhibit. He wasn’t a-going to hurt himself. He didn’t care if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40940">
     he only earned his board. Frequently he would leave his dinner in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40950">
     bushes, when his dog had caught a woodchuck by the way, and go back a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40960">
     mile and a half to dress it and leave it in the cellar of the house
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40970">
     where he boarded, after deliberating first for half an hour whether he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40980">
     could not sink it in the pond safely till nightfall,—loving to dwell
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_40990">
     long upon these themes. He would say, as he went by in the morning,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41000">
     “How thick the pigeons are! If working every day were not my trade, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41010">
     could get all the meat I should want by hunting,—pigeons, woodchucks,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41020">
     rabbits, partridges,—by gosh! I could get all I should want for a week
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41030">
     in one day.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41050">
     He was a skilful chopper, and indulged in some flourishes and ornaments
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41060">
     in his art. He cut his trees level and close to the ground, that the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41070">
     sprouts which came up afterward might be more vigorous and a sled might
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41080">
     slide over the stumps; and instead of leaving a whole tree to support
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41090">
     his corded wood, he would pare it away to a slender stake or splinter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41100">
     which you could break off with your hand at last.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41120">
     He interested me because he was so quiet and solitary and so happy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41130">
     withal; a well of good humor and contentment which overflowed at his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41140">
     eyes. His mirth was without alloy. Sometimes I saw him at his work in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41150">
     the woods, felling trees, and he would greet me with a laugh of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41160">
     inexpressible satisfaction, and a salutation in Canadian French, though
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41170">
     he spoke English as well. When I approached him he would suspend his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41180">
     work, and with half-suppressed mirth lie along the trunk of a pine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41190">
     which he had felled, and, peeling off the inner bark, roll it up into a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41200">
     ball and chew it while he laughed and talked. Such an exuberance of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41210">
     animal spirits had he that he sometimes tumbled down and rolled on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41220">
     ground with laughter at any thing which made him think and tickled him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41230">
     Looking round upon the trees he would exclaim,—“By George! I can enjoy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41240">
     myself well enough here chopping; I want no better sport.” Sometimes,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41250">
     when at leisure, he amused himself all day in the woods with a pocket
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41260">
     pistol, firing salutes to himself at regular intervals as he walked. In
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41270">
     the winter he had a fire by which at noon he warmed his coffee in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41280">
     kettle; and as he sat on a log to eat his dinner the chickadees would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41290">
     sometimes come round and alight on his arm and peck at the potato in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41300">
     his fingers; and he said that he “liked to have the little _fellers_
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41310">
     about him.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41330">
     In him the animal man chiefly was developed. In physical endurance and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41340">
     contentment he was cousin to the pine and the rock. I asked him once if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41350">
     he was not sometimes tired at night, after working all day; and he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41360">
     answered, with a sincere and serious look, “Gorrappit, I never was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41370">
     tired in my life.” But the intellectual and what is called spiritual
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41380">
     man in him were slumbering as in an infant. He had been instructed only
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41390">
     in that innocent and ineffectual way in which the Catholic priests
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41400">
     teach the aborigines, by which the pupil is never educated to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41410">
     degree of consciousness, but only to the degree of trust and reverence,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41420">
     and a child is not made a man, but kept a child. When Nature made him,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41430">
     she gave him a strong body and contentment for his portion, and propped
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41440">
     him on every side with reverence and reliance, that he might live out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41450">
     his threescore years and ten a child. He was so genuine and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41460">
     unsophisticated that no introduction would serve to introduce him, more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41470">
     than if you introduced a woodchuck to your neighbor. He had got to find
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41480">
     him out as you did. He would not play any part. Men paid him wages for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41490">
     work, and so helped to feed and clothe him; but he never exchanged
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41500">
     opinions with them. He was so simply and naturally humble—if he can be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41510">
     called humble who never aspires—that humility was no distinct quality
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41520">
     in him, nor could he conceive of it. Wiser men were demigods to him. If
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41530">
     you told him that such a one was coming, he did as if he thought that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41540">
     any thing so grand would expect nothing of himself, but take all the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41550">
     responsibility on itself, and let him be forgotten still. He never
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41560">
     heard the sound of praise. He particularly reverenced the writer and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41570">
     the preacher. Their performances were miracles. When I told him that I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41580">
     wrote considerably, he thought for a long time that it was merely the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41590">
     handwriting which I meant, for he could write a remarkably good hand
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41600">
     himself. I sometimes found the name of his native parish handsomely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41610">
     written in the snow by the highway, with the proper French accent, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41620">
     knew that he had passed. I asked him if he ever wished to write his

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41640">
     could not, but he never tried to write thoughts,—no, he could not, he

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41650">
     could not tell what to put first, it would kill him, and then there was

     spelling to be attended to at the same time!

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41680">
     I heard that a distinguished wise man and reformer asked him if he did
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41690">
     not want the world to be changed; but he answered with a chuckle of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41700">
     surprise in his Canadian accent, not knowing that the question had ever
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41710">
     been entertained before, “No, I like it well enough.” It would have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41720">
     suggested many things to a philosopher to have dealings with him. To a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41730">
     stranger he appeared to know nothing of things in general; yet I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41740">
     sometimes saw in him a man whom I had not seen before, and I did not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41750">
     know whether he was as wise as Shakespeare or as simply ignorant as a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41760">
     child, whether to suspect him of a fine poetic consciousness or of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41770">
     stupidity. A townsman told me that when he met him sauntering through
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41780">
     the village in his small close-fitting cap, and whistling to himself,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41790">
     he reminded him of a prince in disguise.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41810">
     His only books were an almanac and an arithmetic, in which last he was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41820">
     considerably expert. The former was a sort of cyclopædia to him, which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41830">
     he supposed to contain an abstract of human knowledge, as indeed it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41840">
     does to a considerable extent. I loved to sound him on the various
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41850">
     reforms of the day, and he never failed to look at them in the most
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41860">
     simple and practical light. He had never heard of such things before.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41870">
     Could he do without factories? I asked. He had worn the home-made
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41880">
     Vermont gray, he said, and that was good. Could he dispense with tea
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41890">
     and coffee? Did this country afford any beverage beside water? He had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41900">
     soaked hemlock leaves in water and drank it, and thought that was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41910">
     better than water in warm weather. When I asked him if he could do
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41920">
     without money, he showed the convenience of money in such a way as to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41930">
     suggest and coincide with the most philosophical accounts of the origin
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41940">
     of this institution, and the very derivation of the word _pecunia_. If
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41950">
     an ox were his property, and he wished to get needles and thread at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41960">
     store, he thought it would be inconvenient and impossible soon to go on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41970">
     mortgaging some portion of the creature each time to that amount. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41980">
     could defend many institutions better than any philosopher, because, in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_41990">
     describing them as they concerned him, he gave the true reason for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42000">
     their prevalence, and speculation had not suggested to him any other.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42010">
     At another time, hearing Plato’s definition of a man,—a biped without
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42020">
     feathers,—and that one exhibited a cock plucked and called it Plato’s
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42030">
     man, he thought it an important difference that the _knees_ bent the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42040">
     wrong way. He would sometimes exclaim, “How I love to talk! By George,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42050">
     I could talk all day!” I asked him once, when I had not seen him for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42060">
     many months, if he had got a new idea this summer. “Good Lord,” said
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42070">
     he, “a man that has to work as I do, if he does not forget the ideas he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42080">
     has had, he will do well. May be the man you hoe with is inclined to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42090">
     race; then, by gorry, your mind must be there; you think of weeds.” He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42100">
     would sometimes ask me first on such occasions, if I had made any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42110">
     improvement. One winter day I asked him if he was always satisfied with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42120">
     himself, wishing to suggest a substitute within him for the priest
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42130">
     without, and some higher motive for living. “Satisfied!” said he; “some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42140">
     men are satisfied with one thing, and some with another. One man,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42150">
     perhaps, if he has got enough, will be satisfied to sit all day with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42160">
     his back to the fire and his belly to the table, by George!” Yet I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42170">
     never, by any manœuvring, could get him to take the spiritual view of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42180">
     things; the highest that he appeared to conceive of was a simple
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42190">
     expediency, such as you might expect an animal to appreciate; and this,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42200">
     practically, is true of most men. If I suggested any improvement in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42210">
     mode of life, he merely answered, without expressing any regret, that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42220">
     it was too late. Yet he thoroughly believed in honesty and the like
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42230">
     virtues.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42250">
     There was a certain positive originality, however slight, to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42260">
     detected in him, and I occasionally observed that he was thinking for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42270">
     himself and expressing his own opinion, a phenomenon so rare that I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42280">
     would any day walk ten miles to observe it, and it amounted to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42290">
     re-origination of many of the institutions of society. Though he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42300">
     hesitated, and perhaps failed to express himself distinctly, he always
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42310">
     had a presentable thought behind. Yet his thinking was so primitive and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42320">
     immersed in his animal life, that, though more promising than a merely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42330">
     learned man’s, it rarely ripened to any thing which can be reported. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42340">
     suggested that there might be men of genius in the lowest grades of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42350">
     life, however permanently humble and illiterate, who take their own
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42360">
     view always, or do not pretend to see at all; who are as bottomless
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42370">
     even as Walden Pond was thought to be, though they may be dark and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42380">
     muddy.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42420">
     Many a traveller came out of his way to see me and the inside of my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42430">
     house, and, as an excuse for calling, asked for a glass of water. I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42440">
     told them that I drank at the pond, and pointed thither, offering to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42450">
     lend them a dipper. Far off as I lived, I was not exempted from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42460">
     annual visitation which occurs, methinks, about the first of April,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42470">
     when every body is on the move; and I had my share of good luck, though
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42480">
     there were some curious specimens among my visitors. Half-witted men
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42490">
     from the almshouse and elsewhere came to see me; but I endeavored to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42500">
     make them exercise all the wit they had, and make their confessions to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42510">
     me; in such cases making wit the theme of our conversation; and so was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42520">
     compensated. Indeed, I found some of them to be wiser than the so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42530">
     called _overseers_ of the poor and selectmen of the town, and thought
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42540">
     it was time that the tables were turned. With respect to wit, I learned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42550">
     that there was not much difference between the half and the whole. One
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42560">
     day, in particular, an inoffensive, simple-minded pauper, whom with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42570">
     others I had often seen used as fencing stuff, standing or sitting on a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42580">
     bushel in the fields to keep cattle and himself from straying, visited
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42590">
     me, and expressed a wish to live as I did. He told me, with the utmost
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42600">
     simplicity and truth, quite superior, or rather _inferior_, to any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42610">
     thing that is called humility, that he was “deficient in intellect.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42620">
     These were his words. The Lord had made him so, yet he supposed the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42630">
     Lord cared as much for him as for another. “I have always been so,”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42640">
     said he, “from my childhood; I never had much mind; I was not like
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42650">
     other children; I am weak in the head. It was the Lord’s will, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42660">
     suppose.” And there he was to prove the truth of his words. He was a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42670">
     metaphysical puzzle to me. I have rarely met a fellow-man on such
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42680">
     promising ground,—it was so simple and sincere and so true all that he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42690">
     said. And, true enough, in proportion as he appeared to humble himself
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42700">
     was he exalted. I did not know at first but it was the result of a wise
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42710">
     policy. It seemed that from such a basis of truth and frankness as the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42720">
     poor weak-headed pauper had laid, our intercourse might go forward to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42730">
     something better than the intercourse of sages.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42750">
     I had some guests from those not reckoned commonly among the town’s
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42760">
     poor, but who should be; who are among the world’s poor, at any rate;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42770">
     guests who appeal, not to your hospitality, but to your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42780">
     _hospitalality_; who earnestly wish to be helped, and preface their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42790">
     appeal with the information that they are resolved, for one thing,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42800">
     never to help themselves. I require of a visitor that he be not
    </p>

     actually starving, though he may have the very best appetite in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42820">
     world, however he got it. Objects of charity are not guests. Men who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42830">
     did not know when their visit had terminated, though I went about my

     business again, answering them from greater and greater remoteness. Men
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42850">
     of almost every degree of wit called on me in the migrating season.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42860">
     Some who had more wits than they knew what to do with; runaway slaves
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42870">
     with plantation manners, who listened from time to time, like the fox
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42880">
     in the fable, as if they heard the hounds a-baying on their track, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42890">
     looked at me beseechingly, as much as to say,—

     “O Christian, will you send me back?”

     the northstar. Men of one idea, like a hen with one chicken, and that a

     duckling; men of a thousand ideas, and unkempt heads, like those hens

     which are made to take charge of a hundred chickens, all in pursuit of

     one bug, a score of them lost in every morning’s dew,—and become
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42980">
     frizzled and mangy in consequence; men of ideas instead of legs, a sort
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_42990">
     of intellectual centipede that made you crawl all over. One man
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_43000">
     proposed a book in which visitors should write their names, as at the

     White Mountains; but, alas! I have too good a memory to make that

     necessary.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_43040">
     I could not but notice some of the peculiarities of my visitors. Girls
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_43050">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_43060">
     looked in the pond and at the flowers, and improved their time. Men of
    </p>

     business, even farmers, thought only of solitude and employment, and of

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_43100">
     obvious that they did not. Restless committed men, whose time was all

     taken up in getting a living or keeping it; ministers who spoke of God

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_43180">
     much good in my position. Ay! there was the rub. The old and infirm and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_43190">
     the timid, of whatever age or sex, thought most of sickness, and sudden

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_43200">
     accident and death; to them life seemed full of danger,—what danger is

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_43210">
     there if you don’t think of any?—and they thought that a prudent man
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_43220">
     would carefully select the safest position, where Dr. B. might be on

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_43230">
     hand at a moment’s warning. To them the village was literally a

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_43240">
     _com-munity_, a league for mutual defence, and you would suppose that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_43250">
     they would not go a-huckleberrying without a medicine chest. The amount
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_43260">
     of it is, if a man is alive, there is always _danger_ that he may die,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_43270">
     though the danger must be allowed to be less in proportion as he is
    </p>

     all, who thought that I was forever singing,—

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_43370">
     These are the folks that worry the man

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_43380">
     That lives in the house that I built.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_43400">
     I did not fear the hen-harriers, for I kept no chickens; but I feared

     the men-harriers rather.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_43430">
     I had more cheering visitors than the last. Children come a-berrying,

     railroad men taking a Sunday morning walk in clean shirts, fishermen

     and hunters, poets and philosophers; in short, all honest pilgrims, who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_43460">
     came out to the woods for freedom’s sake, and really left the village

     behind, I was ready to greet with,—“Welcome, Englishmen! welcome,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_43860">
     I planted about two acres and a half of upland; and as it was only

     cattle, or hired men or boys, or improved implements of husbandry, I

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_44120">
     was much slower, and became much more intimate with my beans than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_44130">
     usual. But labor of the hands, even when pursued to the verge of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_44140">
     drudgery, is perhaps never the worst form of idleness. It has a

     from time to time with a swoop and a sound as if the heavens were rent,
    </p>

     torn at last to very rags and tatters, and yet a seamless cope

     Nature. The hawk is aerial brother of the wave which he sails over and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_44800">
     surveys, those his perfect air-inflated wings answering to the
    </p>

     of hen-hawks circling high in the sky, alternately soaring and
    </p>

     descending, approaching, and leaving one another, as if they were the

     a sluggish portentous and outlandish spotted salamander, a trace of

     information of the “trainers.” It seemed by the distant hum as if

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_45330">
     beans. When they were growing, I used to hoe from five o’clock in the

     morning till noon, and commonly spent the rest of the day about other

     various kinds of weeds,—it will bear some iteration in the account, for

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_45450">
     had sun and rain and dews on their side. Daily the beans saw me come to

     their rescue armed with a hoe, and thin the ranks of their enemies,

     dissipation. Though I gave them no manure, and did not hoe them all

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_45610">
     once, I hoed them unusually well as far as I went, and was paid for it

     The Village

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47050">
     After hoeing, or perhaps reading and writing, in the forenoon, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47060">
     usually bathed again in the pond, swimming across one of its coves for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47070">
     a stint, and washed the dust of labor from my person, or smoothed out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47080">
     the last wrinkle which study had made, and for the afternoon was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47090">
     absolutely free. Every day or two I strolled to the village to hear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47100">
     some of the gossip which is incessantly going on there, circulating
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47110">
     either from mouth to mouth, or from newspaper to newspaper, and which,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47120">
     taken in homœopathic doses, was really as refreshing in its way as the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47130">
     rustle of leaves and the peeping of frogs. As I walked in the woods to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47140">
     see the birds and squirrels, so I walked in the village to see the men
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47150">
     and boys; instead of the wind among the pines I heard the carts rattle.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47160">
     In one direction from my house there was a colony of muskrats in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47170">
     river meadows; under the grove of elms and buttonwoods in the other
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47180">
     horizon was a village of busy men, as curious to me as if they had been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47190">
     prairie dogs, each sitting at the mouth of its burrow, or running over
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47200">
     to a neighbor’s to gossip. I went there frequently to observe their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47210">
     habits. The village appeared to me a great news room; and on one side,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47220">
     to support it, as once at Redding &amp; Company’s on State Street, they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47230">
     kept nuts and raisins, or salt and meal and other groceries. Some have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47240">
     such a vast appetite for the former commodity, that is, the news, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47250">
     such sound digestive organs, that they can sit forever in public
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47260">
     avenues without stirring, and let it simmer and whisper through them
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47270">
     like the Etesian winds, or as if inhaling ether, it only producing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47280">
     numbness and insensibility to pain,—otherwise it would often be painful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47290">
     to hear,—without affecting the consciousness. I hardly ever failed,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47300">
     when I rambled through the village, to see a row of such worthies,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47310">
     either sitting on a ladder sunning themselves, with their bodies
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47320">
     inclined forward and their eyes glancing along the line this way and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47330">
     that, from time to time, with a voluptuous expression, or else leaning
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47340">
     against a barn with their hands in their pockets, like caryatides, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47350">
     if to prop it up. They, being commonly out of doors, heard whatever was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47360">
     in the wind. These are the coarsest mills, in which all gossip is first
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47370">
     rudely digested or cracked up before it is emptied into finer and more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47380">
     delicate hoppers within doors. I observed that the vitals of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47390">
     village were the grocery, the bar-room, the post-office, and the bank;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47400">
     and, as a necessary part of the machinery, they kept a bell, a big gun,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47410">
     and a fire-engine, at convenient places; and the houses were so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47420">
     arranged as to make the most of mankind, in lanes and fronting one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47430">
     another, so that every traveller had to run the gantlet, and every man,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47440">
     woman, and child might get a lick at him. Of course, those who were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47450">
     stationed nearest to the head of the line, where they could most see
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47460">
     and be seen, and have the first blow at him, paid the highest prices
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47470">
     for their places; and the few straggling inhabitants in the outskirts,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47480">
     where long gaps in the line began to occur, and the traveller could get
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47490">
     over walls or turn aside into cow paths, and so escape, paid a very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47500">
     slight ground or window tax. Signs were hung out on all sides to allure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47510">
     him; some to catch him by the appetite, as the tavern and victualling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47520">
     cellar; some by the fancy, as the dry goods store and the jeweller’s;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47530">
     and others by the hair or the feet or the skirts, as the barber, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47540">
     shoemaker, or the tailor. Besides, there was a still more terrible
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47550">
     standing invitation to call at every one of these houses, and company
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47560">
     expected about these times. For the most part I escaped wonderfully
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47570">
     from these dangers, either by proceeding at once boldly and without
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47580">
     deliberation to the goal, as is recommended to those who run the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47590">
     gantlet, or by keeping my thoughts on high things, like Orpheus, who,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47600">
     “loudly singing the praises of the gods to his lyre, drowned the voices
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47610">
     of the Sirens, and kept out of danger.” Sometimes I bolted suddenly,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47620">
     and nobody could tell my whereabouts, for I did not stand much about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47630">
     gracefulness, and never hesitated at a gap in a fence. I was even
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47640">
     accustomed to make an irruption into some houses, where I was well
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47650">
     entertained, and after learning the kernels and very last sieve-ful of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47660">
     news, what had subsided, the prospects of war and peace, and whether
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47670">
     the world was likely to hold together much longer, I was let out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47680">
     through the rear avenues, and so escaped to the woods again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47700">
     It was very pleasant, when I stayed late in town, to launch myself into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47710">
     the night, especially if it was dark and tempestuous, and set sail from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47720">
     some bright village parlor or lecture room, with a bag of rye or Indian
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47730">
     meal upon my shoulder, for my snug harbor in the woods, having made all

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47740">
     tight without and withdrawn under hatches with a merry crew of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47750">
     thoughts, leaving only my outer man at the helm, or even tying up the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47790">
     woods, even in common nights, than most suppose. I frequently had to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47800">
     look up at the opening between the trees above the path in order to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47810">
     learn my route, and, where there was no cart-path, to feel with my feet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47820">
     the faint track which I had worn, or steer by the known relation of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47830">
     particular trees which I felt with my hands, passing between two pines
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47840">
     for instance, not more than eighteen inches apart, in the midst of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47850">
     woods, invariably, in the darkest night. Sometimes, after coming home
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47860">
     thus late in a dark and muggy night, when my feet felt the path which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47870">
     my eyes could not see, dreaming and absent-minded all the way, until I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47880">
     was aroused by having to raise my hand to lift the latch, I have not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47890">
     been able to recall a single step of my walk, and I have thought that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47900">
     perhaps my body would find its way home if its master should forsake
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47910">
     it, as the hand finds its way to the mouth without assistance. Several
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47920">
     times, when a visitor chanced to stay into evening, and it proved a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47930">
     dark night, I was obliged to conduct him to the cart-path in the rear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47940">
     of the house, and then point out to him the direction he was to pursue,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47950">
     and in keeping which he was to be guided rather by his feet than his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47960">
     eyes. One very dark night I directed thus on their way two young men
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47970">
     who had been fishing in the pond. They lived about a mile off through
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47980">
     the woods, and were quite used to the route. A day or two after one of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_47990">
     them told me that they wandered about the greater part of the night,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48000">
     close by their own premises, and did not get home till toward morning,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48010">
     by which time, as there had been several heavy showers in the mean
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48020">
     while, and the leaves were very wet, they were drenched to their skins.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48030">
     I have heard of many going astray even in the village streets, when the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48040">
     darkness was so thick that you could cut it with a knife, as the saying
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48050">
     is. Some who live in the outskirts, having come to town a-shopping in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48060">
     their wagons, have been obliged to put up for the night; and gentlemen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48070">
     and ladies making a call have gone half a mile out of their way,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48080">
     feeling the sidewalk only with their feet, and not knowing when they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48090">
     turned. It is a surprising and memorable, as well as valuable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48100">
     experience, to be lost in the woods any time. Often in a snow storm,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48110">
     even by day, one will come out upon a well-known road and yet find it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48120">
     impossible to tell which way leads to the village. Though he knows that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48130">
     he has travelled it a thousand times, he cannot recognize a feature in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48140">
     it, but it is as strange to him as if it were a road in Siberia. By
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48150">
     night, of course, the perplexity is infinitely greater. In our most
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48160">
     trivial walks, we are constantly, though unconsciously, steering like
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48170">
     pilots by certain well-known beacons and headlands, and if we go beyond
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48180">
     our usual course we still carry in our minds the bearing of some

     neighboring cape; and not till we are completely lost, or turned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48200">
     round,—for a man needs only to be turned round once with his eyes shut
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48210">
     in this world to be lost,—do we appreciate the vastness and strangeness
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48220">
     of Nature. Every man has to learn the points of compass again as often
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48230">
     as he awakes, whether from sleep or any abstraction. Not till we are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48240">
     lost, in other words not till we have lost the world, do we begin to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48250">
     find ourselves, and realize where we are and the infinite extent of our
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48260">
     relations.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48280">
     One afternoon, near the end of the first summer, when I went to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48290">
     village to get a shoe from the cobbler’s, I was seized and put into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48300">
     jail, because, as I have elsewhere related, I did not pay a tax to, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48310">
     recognize the authority of, the state which buys and sells men, women,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48320">
     and children, like cattle at the door of its senate-house. I had gone
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48330">
     down to the woods for other purposes. But, wherever a man goes, men
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48340">
     will pursue and paw him with their dirty institutions, and, if they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48350">
     can, constrain him to belong to their desperate odd-fellow society. It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48360">
     is true, I might have resisted forcibly with more or less effect, might
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48370">
     have run “amok” against society; but I preferred that society should
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48380">
     run “amok” against me, it being the desperate party. However, I was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48390">
     released the next day, obtained my mended shoe, and returned to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48400">
     woods in season to get my dinner of huckleberries on Fair-Haven Hill. I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48410">
     was never molested by any person but those who represented the state. I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48420">
     had no lock nor bolt but for the desk which held my papers, not even a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48430">
     nail to put over my latch or windows. I never fastened my door night or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48440">
     day, though I was to be absent several days; not even when the next
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48450">
     fall I spent a fortnight in the woods of Maine. And yet my house was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48460">
     more respected than if it had been surrounded by a file of soldiers.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48470">
     The tired rambler could rest and warm himself by my fire, the literary

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48480">
     amuse himself with the few books on my table, or the curious, by

     opening my closet door, see what was left of my dinner, and what
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48500">
     prospect I had of a supper. Yet, though many people of every class came
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48510">
     this way to the pond, I suffered no serious inconvenience from these
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48520">
     sources, and I never missed anything but one small book, a volume of

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48530">
     Homer, which perhaps was improperly gilded, and this I trust a soldier

     unknown. These take place only in communities where some have got more

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48570">
     than is sufficient while others have not enough. The Pope’s Homers

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48770">
     supper of huckleberries and blueberries on Fair Haven Hill, and laid up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48780">
     a store for several days. The fruits do not yield their true flavor to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48790">
     the purchaser of them, nor to him who raises them for the market. There
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48800">
     is but one way to obtain it, yet few take that way. If you would know

     the flavor of huckleberries, ask the cow-boy or the partridge. It is a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48820">
     vulgar error to suppose that you have tasted huckleberries who never
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48830">
     plucked them. A huckleberry never reaches Boston; they have not been

     in the market cart, and they become mere provender. As long as Eternal

     Occasionally, after my hoeing was done for the day, I joined some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48910">
     impatient companion who had been fishing on the pond since morning, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48920">
     silent and motionless as a duck or a floating leaf, and, after
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48930">
     practising various kinds of philosophy, had concluded commonly, by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48940">
     time I arrived, that he belonged to the ancient sect of Cœnobites.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48950">
     There was one older man, an excellent fisher and skilled in all kinds
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48960">
     of woodcraft, who was pleased to look upon my house as a building
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48970">
     erected for the convenience of fishermen; and I was equally pleased
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48980">
     when he sat in my doorway to arrange his lines. Once in a while we sat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_48990">
     together on the pond, he at one end of the boat, and I at the other;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49000">
     but not many words passed between us, for he had grown deaf in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49010">
     later years, but he occasionally hummed a psalm, which harmonized well
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49020">
     enough with my philosophy. Our intercourse was thus altogether one of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49030">
     unbroken harmony, far more pleasing to remember than if it had been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49040">
     carried on by speech. When, as was commonly the case, I had none to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49050">
     commune with, I used to raise the echoes by striking with a paddle on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49060">
     the side of my boat, filling the surrounding woods with circling and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49070">
     dilating sound, stirring them up as the keeper of a menagerie his wild
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49080">
     beasts, until I elicited a growl from every wooded vale and hill-side.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49100">
     In warm evenings I frequently sat in the boat playing the flute, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49110">
     saw the perch, which I seemed to have charmed, hovering around me, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49120">
     the moon travelling over the ribbed bottom, which was strewed with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49130">
     wrecks of the forest. Formerly I had come to this pond adventurously,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49140">
     from time to time, in dark summer nights, with a companion, and making
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49150">
     a fire close to the water’s edge, which we thought attracted the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49160">
     fishes, we caught pouts with a bunch of worms strung on a thread; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49170">
     when we had done, far in the night, threw the burning brands high into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49180">
     the air like skyrockets, which, coming down into the pond, were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49190">
     quenched with a loud hissing, and we were suddenly groping in total
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49200">
     darkness. Through this, whistling a tune, we took our way to the haunts
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49210">
     of men again. But now I had made my home by the shore.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49230">
     Sometimes, after staying in a village parlor till the family had all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49240">
     retired, I have returned to the woods, and, partly with a view to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49250">
     next day’s dinner, spent the hours of midnight fishing from a boat by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49260">
     moonlight, serenaded by owls and foxes, and hearing, from time to time,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49270">
     the creaking note of some unknown bird close at hand. These experiences
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49280">
     were very memorable and valuable to me,—anchored in forty feet of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49290">
     water, and twenty or thirty rods from the shore, surrounded sometimes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49300">
     by thousands of small perch and shiners, dimpling the surface with
    </p>

     downward into this element, which was scarcely more dense. Thus I

     remarkable for its depth and purity as to merit a particular
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49520">
     description. It is a clear and deep green well, half a mile long and a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49530">
     mile and three quarters in circumference, and contains about sixty-one
    </p>

     woods, without any visible inlet or outlet except by the clouds and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49560">
     evaporation. The surrounding hills rise abruptly from the water to the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49570">
     height of forty to eighty feet, though on the south-east and east they

     respectively, within a quarter and a third of a mile. They are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49600">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49610">
     one when viewed at a distance, and another, more proper, close at hand.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49660">
     said to be blue one day and green another without any perceptible
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49670">
     change in the atmosphere. I have seen our river, when, the landscape
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49680">
     being covered with snow, both water and ice were almost as green as
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49700">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49710">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49720">
     one time and green at another, even from the same point of view. Lying
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49730">
     between the earth and the heavens, it partakes of the color of both.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49740">
     Viewed from a hill-top it reflects the color of the sky; but near at

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49760">
     sand, then a light green, which gradually deepens to a uniform dark
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49770">
     green in the body of the pond. In some lights, viewed even from a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49780">
     hill-top, it is of a vivid green next the shore. Some have referred
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49790">
     this to the reflection of the verdure; but it is equally green there
    </p>

     against the railroad sand-bank, and in the spring, before the leaves

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49810">
     are expanded, and it may be simply the result of the prevailing blue
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49820">
     mixed with the yellow of the sand. Such is the color of its iris. This
    </p>

     is that portion, also, where in the spring, the ice being warmed by the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49890">
     at a little distance of a darker blue than the sky itself; and at such

     original dark green on the opposite sides of the waves, which last
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_49950">

     colorless. How large a body of Walden water would be required to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_50020">
     reflect a green tint I have never proved. The water of our river is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_50030">
     black or a very dark brown to one looking directly down on it, and,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_50040">
     like that of most ponds, imparts to the body of one bathing in it a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_50050">
     yellowish tinge; but this water is of such crystalline purity that the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_50060">
     body of the bather appears of an alabaster whiteness, still more
    </p>

     unnatural, which, as the limbs are magnified and distorted withal,

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_50100">
     The water is so transparent that the bottom can easily be discerned at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_50110">
     the depth of twenty-five or thirty feet. Paddling over it, you may see,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_50150">
     a subsistence there. Once, in the winter, many years ago, when I had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_50160">
     been cutting holes through the ice in order to catch pickerel, as I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_50170">
     stepped ashore I tossed my axe back on to the ice, but, as if some evil
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_50180">
     genius had directed it, it slid four or five rods directly into one of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_50190">
     the holes, where the water was twenty-five feet deep. Out of curiosity,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_50200">
     I lay down on the ice and looked through the hole, until I saw the axe
    </p>

     a little on one side, standing on its head, with its helve erect and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_50220">
     gently swaying to and fro with the pulse of the pond; and there it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_50230">
     might have stood erect and swaying till in the course of time the
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_50250">
     directly over it with an ice chisel which I had, and cutting down the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_50260">
     longest birch which I could find in the neighborhood with my knife, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_50270">
     made a slip-noose, which I attached to its end, and, letting it down
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_50280">
     carefully, passed it over the knob of the handle, and drew it by a line
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_50290">
     along the birch, and so pulled the axe out again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_50310">
     The shore is composed of a belt of smooth rounded white stones like
    </p>

     paving stones, excepting one or two short sand beaches, and is so steep

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_50360">
     Some think it is bottomless. It is nowhere muddy, and a casual observer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_50370">
     would say that there were no weeds at all in it; and of noticeable

     holding a pow-wow upon a hill here, which rose as high into the heavens

     surrounding hills are remarkably full of the same kind of stones, so
    </p>

     that of some English locality,—Saffron Walden, for instance,—one might

     surface, being so smooth, betrayed where a spring welled up from the

     tails, as if one had struck the water with a brushy bough, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_53660">

     increased, and the waves began to run, and the perch leaped much higher

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_53820">
     there were many eagles about it. He came here a-fishing, and used an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_53830">
     old log canoe which he found on the shore. It was made of two
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_53840">
     white-pine logs dug out and pinned together, and was cut off square at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_53850">
     the ends. It was very clumsy, but lasted a great many years before it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_53860">
     became water-logged and perhaps sank to the bottom. He did not know
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_53870">
     whose it was; it belonged to the pond. He used to make a cable for his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_53880">
     anchor of strips of hickory bark tied together. An old man, a potter,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_53890">
     who lived by the pond before the Revolution, told him once that there
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_53900">
     was an iron chest at the bottom, and that he had seen it. Sometimes it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_53910">
     would come floating up to the shore; but when you went toward it, it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_53920">
     would go back into deep water and disappear. I was pleased to hear of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_53930">
     the old log canoe, which took the place of an Indian one of the same
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_53940">
     material but more graceful construction, which perchance had first been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_53950">
     a tree on the bank, and then, as it were, fell into the water, to float
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_53960">
     there for a generation, the most proper vessel for the lake. I remember
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_53970">
     that when I first looked into these depths there were many large trunks
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_53980">
     to be seen indistinctly lying on the bottom, which had either been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_53990">
     blown over formerly, or left on the ice at the last cutting, when wood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54000">
     was cheaper; but now they have mostly disappeared.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54020">
     When I first paddled a boat on Walden, it was completely surrounded by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54030">
     thick and lofty pine and oak woods, and in some of its coves grape
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54040">
     vines had run over the trees next the water and formed bowers under
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54050">
     which a boat could pass. The hills which form its shores are so steep,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54060">
     and the woods on them were then so high, that, as you looked down from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54070">
     the west end, it had the appearance of an amphitheatre for some kind of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54080">
     sylvan spectacle. I have spent many an hour, when I was younger,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54090">
     floating over its surface as the zephyr willed, having paddled my boat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54100">
     to the middle, and lying on my back across the seats, in a summer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54110">
     forenoon, dreaming awake, until I was aroused by the boat touching the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54120">
     sand, and I arose to see what shore my fates had impelled me to; days
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54130">
     when idleness was the most attractive and productive industry. Many a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54140">
     forenoon have I stolen away, preferring to spend thus the most valued
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54150">
     part of the day; for I was rich, if not in money, in sunny hours and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54160">
     summer days, and spent them lavishly; nor do I regret that I did not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54170">
     waste more of them in the workshop or the teacher’s desk. But since I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54180">
     left those shores the woodchoppers have still further laid them waste,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54190">
     and now for many a year there will be no more rambling through the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54200">
     aisles of the wood, with occasional vistas through which you see the
    </p>

     water. My Muse may be excused if she is silent henceforth. How can you

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54220">
     expect the birds to sing when their groves are cut down?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54240">
     Now the trunks of trees on the bottom, and the old log canoe, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54250">
     dark surrounding woods, are gone, and the villagers, who scarcely know
    </p>

     where it lies, instead of going to the pond to bathe or drink, are

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54380">
     Nevertheless, of all the characters I have known, perhaps Walden wears
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54390">
     best, and best preserves its purity. Many men have been likened to it,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54400">
     but few deserve that honor. Though the woodchoppers have laid bare

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54430">
     skimmed it once, it is itself unchanged, the same water which my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54440">
     youthful eyes fell on; all the change is in me. It has not acquired one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54450">
     permanent wrinkle after all its ripples. It is perennially young, and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54460">
     may stand and see a swallow dip apparently to pick an insect from its

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54480">
     almost daily for more than twenty years,—Why, here is Walden, the same

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54490">
     woodland lake that I discovered so many years ago; where a forest was

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54500">
     cut down last winter another is springing up by its shore as lustily as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54510">
     ever; the same thought is welling up to its surface that was then; it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54520">
     is the same liquid joy and happiness to itself and its Maker, ay, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54530">
     it _may_ be to me. It is the work of a brave man surely, in whom there
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54540">
     was no guile! He rounded this water with his hand, deepened and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54550">
     clarified it in his thought, and in his will bequeathed it to Concord.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54560">
     I see by its face that it is visited by the same reflection; and I can
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54570">
     almost say, Walden, is it you?

     It is no dream of mine,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54600">
     To ornament a line;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54610">
     I cannot come nearer to God and Heaven

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54620">
     Than I live to Walden even.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54630">
     I am its stony shore,

     And the breeze that passes o’er;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54650">
     In the hollow of my hand
    </p>

     Are its water and its sand,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54670">
     And its deepest resort
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54680">
     Lies high in my thought.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54700">

     firemen and brakemen, and those passengers who have a season ticket and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54720">
     see it often, are better men for the sight. The engineer does not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54730">
     forget at night, or his nature does not, that he has beheld this vision
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54740">
     of serenity and purity once at least during the day. Though seen but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54750">
     once, it helps to wash out State-street and the engine’s soot. One
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54760">
     proposes that it be called “God’s Drop.”

     I have said that Walden has no visible inlet nor outlet, but it is on

     the one hand distantly and indirectly related to Flint’s Pond, which is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_54800">
     more elevated, by a chain of small ponds coming from that quarter, and

     while, if only to feel the wind blow on your cheek freely, and see the

     sedgy shore, the fresh spray blowing in my face, I came upon the
    </p>

     mouldering wreck of a boat, the sides gone, and hardly more than the
    </p>

    </p>

     sharply defined, as if it were a large decayed pad, with its veins. It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_55050">
     was as impressive a wreck as one could imagine on the sea-shore, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_55060">
     had as good a moral. It is by this time mere vegetable mould and

     undistinguishable pond shore, through which rushes and flags have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_55080">
     pushed up. I used to admire the ripple marks on the sandy bottom, at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_55090">
     the north end of this pond, made firm and hard to the feet of the wader
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_55100">
     by the pressure of the water, and the rushes which grew in Indian file,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_55110">
     in waving lines, corresponding to these marks, rank behind rank, as if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_55120">
     the waves had planted them. There also I have found, in considerable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_55130">
     quantities, curious balls, composed apparently of fine grass or roots,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_55140">
     of pipewort perhaps, from half an inch to four inches in diameter, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_55150">
     perfectly spherical. These wash back and forth in shallow water on a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_55160">
     sandy bottom, and are sometimes cast on the shore. They are either
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_55170">
     solid grass, or have a little sand in the middle. At first you would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_55180">
     say that they were formed by the action of the waves, like a pebble;
    </p>

     yet the smallest are made of equally coarse materials, half an inch
    </p>

     long, and they are produced only at one season of the year. Moreover,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_55210">
     the waves, I suspect, do not so much construct as wear down a material

     the author, after speaking of Walden and White Ponds, adds: “In the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_55990">
     middle of the latter may be seen, when the water is very low, a tree
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56000">
     which appears as if it grew in the place where it now stands, although

     this tree is broken off, and at that place measures fourteen inches in

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56030">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56040">
     the pond in Sudbury, who told me that it was he who got out this tree
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56050">
     ten or fifteen years before. As near as he could remember, it stood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56060">
     twelve or fifteen rods from the shore, where the water was thirty or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56070">
     forty feet deep. It was in the winter, and he had been getting out ice
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56080">
     in the forenoon, and had resolved that in the afternoon, with the aid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56090">
     of his neighbors, he would take out the old yellow-pine. He sawed a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56100">
     channel in the ice toward the shore, and hauled it over and along and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56110">
     out on to the ice with oxen; but, before he had gone far in his work,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56120">
     he was surprised to find that it was wrong end upward, with the stumps
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56130">
     of the branches pointing down, and the small end firmly fastened in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56140">
     sandy bottom. It was about a foot in diameter at the big end, and he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56150">
     had expected to get a good saw-log, but it was so rotten as to be fit
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56160">
     only for fuel, if for that. He had some of it in his shed then. There
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56170">
     were marks of an axe and of woodpeckers on the butt. He thought that it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56180">
     might have been a dead tree on the shore, but was finally blown over
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56190">
     into the pond, and after the top had become waterlogged, while the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56200">
     butt-end was still dry and light, had drifted out and sunk wrong end

     up. His father, eighty years old, could not remember when it was not

     there. Several pretty large logs may still be seen lying on the bottom,

     like a dolphin. If it had lasted longer it might have tinged my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56890">
     employments and life. As I walked on the railroad causeway, I used to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56900">
     wonder at the halo of light around my shadow, and would fain fancy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56910">
     myself one of the elect. One who visited me declared that the shadows
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56920">
     of some Irishmen before him had no halo about them, that it was only
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56930">
     natives that were so distinguished. Benvenuto Cellini tells us in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56940">
     memoirs, that, after a certain terrible dream or vision which he had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56950">
     during his confinement in the castle of St. Angelo, a resplendent light
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56960">
     appeared over the shadow of his head at morning and evening, whether he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56970">
     was in Italy or France, and it was particularly conspicuous when the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56980">
     grass was moist with dew. This was probably the same phenomenon to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_56990">
     which I have referred, which is especially observed in the morning, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57000">
     also at other times, and even by moonlight. Though a constant one, it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57010">
     is not commonly noticed, and, in the case of an excitable imagination
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57020">
     like Cellini’s, it would be basis enough for superstition. Beside, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57030">
     tells us that he showed it to very few. But are they not indeed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57040">
     distinguished who are conscious that they are regarded at all?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57080">
     I set out one afternoon to go a-fishing to Fair-Haven, through the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57090">
     woods, to eke out my scanty fare of vegetables. My way led through
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57100">
     Pleasant Meadow, an adjunct of the Baker Farm, that retreat of which a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57110">
     poet has since sung, beginning,—
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57130">
     “Thy entry is a pleasant field,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57140">
     Which some mossy fruit trees yield
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57150">
     Partly to a ruddy brook,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57160">
     By gliding musquash undertook,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57170">
     And mercurial trout,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57180">
     Darting about.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57200">
     I thought of living there before I went to Walden. I “hooked” the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57210">
     apples, leaped the brook, and scared the musquash and the trout. It was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57220">
     one of those afternoons which seem indefinitely long before one, in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57230">
     which many events may happen, a large portion of our natural life,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57240">
     though it was already half spent when I started. By the way there came
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57250">
     up a shower, which compelled me to stand half an hour under a pine,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57260">
     piling boughs over my head, and wearing my handkerchief for a shed; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57270">
     when at length I had made one cast over the pickerel-weed, standing up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57280">
     to my middle in water, I found myself suddenly in the shadow of a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57290">
     cloud, and the thunder began to rumble with such emphasis that I could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57300">
     do no more than listen to it. The gods must be proud, thought I, with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57310">
     such forked flashes to rout a poor unarmed fisherman. So I made haste
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57320">
     for shelter to the nearest hut, which stood half a mile from any road,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57330">
     but so much the nearer to the pond, and had long been uninhabited:—
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57350">
     “And here a poet builded,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57360">
     In the completed years,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57370">
     For behold a trivial cabin
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57380">
     That to destruction steers.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57400">
     So the Muse fables. But therein, as I found, dwelt now John Field, an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57410">
     Irishman, and his wife, and several children, from the broad-faced boy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57420">
     who assisted his father at his work, and now came running by his side
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57430">
     from the bog to escape the rain, to the wrinkled, sibyl-like,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57440">
     cone-headed infant that sat upon its father’s knee as in the palaces of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57450">
     nobles, and looked out from its home in the midst of wet and hunger
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57460">
     inquisitively upon the stranger, with the privilege of infancy, not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57470">
     knowing but it was the last of a noble line, and the hope and cynosure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57480">
     of the world, instead of John Field’s poor starveling brat. There we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57490">
     sat together under that part of the roof which leaked the least, while
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57500">
     it showered and thundered without. I had sat there many times of old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57510">
     before the ship was built that floated his family to America. An
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57520">
     honest, hard-working, but shiftless man plainly was John Field; and his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57530">
     wife, she too was brave to cook so many successive dinners in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57540">
     recesses of that lofty stove; with round greasy face and bare breast,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57550">
     still thinking to improve her condition one day; with the never absent
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57560">
     mop in one hand, and yet no effects of it visible anywhere. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57570">
     chickens, which had also taken shelter here from the rain, stalked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57580">
     about the room like members of the family, too humanized methought to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57590">
     roast well. They stood and looked in my eye or pecked at my shoe
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57600">
     significantly. Meanwhile my host told me his story, how hard he worked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57610">
     “bogging” for a neighboring farmer, turning up a meadow with a spade or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57620">
     bog hoe at the rate of ten dollars an acre and the use of the land with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57630">
     manure for one year, and his little broad-faced son worked cheerfully
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57640">
     at his father’s side the while, not knowing how poor a bargain the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57650">
     latter had made. I tried to help him with my experience, telling him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57660">
     that he was one of my nearest neighbors, and that I too, who came
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57670">
     a-fishing here, and looked like a loafer, was getting my living like
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57680">
     himself; that I lived in a tight, light, and clean house, which hardly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57690">
     cost more than the annual rent of such a ruin as his commonly amounts
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57700">
     to; and how, if he chose, he might in a month or two build himself a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57710">
     palace of his own; that I did not use tea, nor coffee, nor butter, nor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57720">
     milk, nor fresh meat, and so did not have to work to get them; again,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57730">
     as I did not work hard, I did not have to eat hard, and it cost me but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57740">
     a trifle for my food; but as he began with tea, and coffee, and butter,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57750">
     and milk, and beef, he had to work hard to pay for them, and when he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57760">
     had worked hard he had to eat hard again to repair the waste of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57770">
     system,—and so it was as broad as it was long, indeed it was broader
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57780">
     than it was long, for he was discontented and wasted his life into the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57790">
     bargain; and yet he had rated it as a gain in coming to America, that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57800">
     here you could get tea, and coffee, and meat every day. But the only
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57810">
     true America is that country where you are at liberty to pursue such a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57820">
     mode of life as may enable you to do without these, and where the state
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57830">
     does not endeavor to compel you to sustain the slavery and war and
    </p>

     other superfluous expenses which directly or indirectly result from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57850">
     use of such things. For I purposely talked to him as if he were a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57860">
     philosopher, or desired to be one. I should be glad if all the meadows

    </p>

     men’s beginning to redeem themselves. A man will not need to study
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57890">
     history to find out what is best for his own culture. But alas! the

     culture of an Irishman is an enterprise to be undertaken with a sort of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57910">
     moral bog hoe. I told him, that as he worked so hard at bogging, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57920">
     required thick boots and stout clothing, which yet were soon soiled and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57930">
     worn out, but I wore light shoes and thin clothing, which cost not half
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57940">
     so much, though he might think that I was dressed like a gentleman,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57950">
     (which, however, was not the case,) and in an hour or two, without
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57960">
     labor, but as a recreation, I could, if I wished, catch as many fish as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_57970">
     I should want for two days, or earn enough money to support me a week.

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_58000">
     at this, and his wife stared with arms a-kimbo, and both appeared to be

     wondering if they had capital enough to begin such a course with, or
    </p>

     “Do you ever fish?” I asked. “Oh yes, I catch a mess now and then when

     I am lying by; good perch I catch.” “What’s your bait?” “I catch

     for a drink, hoping to get a sight of the well bottom, to complete my

     for variety. I have actually fished from the same kind of necessity

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_59430">
     about fowling, and sold my gun before I went to the woods. Not that I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_59440">
     am less humane than others, but I did not perceive that my feelings
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_59450">
     were much affected. I did not pity the fishes nor the worms. This was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_59460">
     habit. As for fowling, during the last years that I carried a gun my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_59470">
     excuse was that I was studying ornithology, and sought only new or rare
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_59480">
     birds. But I confess that I am now inclined to think that there is a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_59490">
     finer way of studying ornithology than this. It requires so much closer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_59500">
     attention to the habits of the birds, that, if for that reason only, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_59510">
     have been willing to omit the gun. Yet notwithstanding the objection on

     the score of humanity, I am compelled to doubt if equally valuable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_59530">
     sports are ever substituted for these; and when some of my friends have

     asked me anxiously about their boys, whether they should let them hunt,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_59550">
     I have answered, yes,—remembering that it was one of the best parts of
    </p>

     my education,—_make_ them hunters, though sportsmen only at first, if

     answer with respect to those youths who were bent on this pursuit,
    </p>

     distinguishes his proper objects, as a poet or naturalist it may be,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_59800">
     and leaves the gun and fish-pole behind. The mass of men are still and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_59810">
     always young in this respect. In some countries a hunting parson is no

     not think that they were lucky, or well paid for their time, unless

     purpose pure; but no doubt such a clarifying process would be going on

     Yet even they expect to go to heaven at last. If the legislature

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_60210">
     animal food in my case was its uncleanness; and, besides, when I had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_60220">
     caught and cleaned and cooked and eaten my fish, they seemed not to

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_60240">
     more than it came to. A little bread or a few potatoes would have done
    </p>

     as well, with less trouble and filth. Like many of my contemporaries, I
    </p>

     so much because of any ill effects which I had traced to them, as
    </p>

     because they were not agreeable to my imagination. The repugnance to

     animal food is not the effect of experience, but is an instinct. It

     though I never did so, I went far enough to please my imagination. I

     “a general rule, that almost all insects in this state eat much less

     that it is a part of the destiny of the human race, in its gradual

     John Farmer sat at his door one September evening, after a hard day’s

     playing on a flute, and that sound harmonized with his mood. Still he

     different sphere from that he worked in, and suggested work for certain

     the mother, as if a whirlwind had swept them away, and they so exactly

     foot in the midst of a brood, and heard the whir of the old bird as she

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63600">
     flew off, and her anxious calls and mewing, or seen her trail her wings

     dishabille, that you cannot, for a few moments, detect what kind of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63640">
     creature it is. The young squat still and flat, often running their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63650">
     heads under a leaf, and mind only their mother’s directions given from

     a distance, nor will your approach make them run again and betray
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63680">
     minute, without discovering them. I have held them in my open hand at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63690">
     such a time, and still their only care, obedient to their mother and

     their instinct, was to squat there without fear or trembling. So
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63710">
     perfect is this instinct, that once, when I had laid them on the leaves

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63720">
     again, and one accidentally fell on its side, it was found with the

     rest in exactly the same position ten minutes afterward. They are not

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63740">
     callow like the young of most birds, but more perfectly developed and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63750">
     precocious even than chickens. The remarkably adult yet innocent
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63760">
     expression of their open and serene eyes is very memorable. All
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63770">
     intelligence seems reflected in them. They suggest not merely the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63780">
     purity of infancy, but a wisdom clarified by experience. Such an eye
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63790">
     was not born when the bird was, but is coeval with the sky it reflects.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63800">
     The woods do not yield another such a gem. The traveller does not often
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63810">
     look into such a limpid well. The ignorant or reckless sportsman often
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63820">
     shoots the parent at such a time, and leaves these innocents to fall a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63830">
     prey to some prowling beast or bird, or gradually mingle with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63840">
     decaying leaves which they so much resemble. It is said that when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63850">
     hatched by a hen they will directly disperse on some alarm, and so are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63860">
     lost, for they never hear the mother’s call which gathers them again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63870">
     These were my hens and chickens.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63890">
     It is remarkable how many creatures live wild and free though secret in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63900">
     the woods, and still sustain themselves in the neighborhood of towns,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63910">
     suspected by hunters only. How retired the otter manages to live here!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63920">
     He grows to be four feet long, as big as a small boy, perhaps without
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63930">
     any human being getting a glimpse of him. I formerly saw the raccoon in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63940">
     the woods behind where my house is built, and probably still heard
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63950">
     their whinnering at night. Commonly I rested an hour or two in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63960">
     shade at noon, after planting, and ate my lunch, and read a little by a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63970">
     spring which was the source of a swamp and of a brook, oozing from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63980">
     under Brister’s Hill, half a mile from my field. The approach to this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_63990">
     was through a succession of descending grassy hollows, full of young
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64000">
     pitch-pines, into a larger wood about the swamp. There, in a very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64010">
     secluded and shaded spot, under a spreading white-pine, there was yet a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64020">
     clean, firm sward to sit on. I had dug out the spring and made a well
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64030">
     of clear gray water, where I could dip up a pailful without roiling it,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64040">
     and thither I went for this purpose almost every day in midsummer, when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64050">
     the pond was warmest. Thither, too, the wood-cock led her brood, to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64060">
     probe the mud for worms, flying but a foot above them down the bank,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64070">
     while they ran in a troop beneath; but at last, spying me, she would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64080">
     leave her young and circle round and round me, nearer and nearer till
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64090">
     within four or five feet, pretending broken wings and legs, to attract
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64100">
     my attention, and get off her young, who would already have taken up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64110">
     their march, with faint wiry peep, single file through the swamp, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64120">
     she directed. Or I heard the peep of the young when I could not see the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64130">
     parent bird. There too the turtle-doves sat over the spring, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64140">
     fluttered from bough to bough of the soft white-pines over my head; or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64150">
     the red squirrel, coursing down the nearest bough, was particularly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64160">
     familiar and inquisitive. You only need sit still long enough in some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64170">
     attractive spot in the woods that all its inhabitants may exhibit
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64180">
     themselves to you by turns.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64200">
     I was witness to events of a less peaceful character. One day when I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64210">
     went out to my wood-pile, or rather my pile of stumps, I observed two
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64220">
     large ants, the one red, the other much larger, nearly half an inch
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64230">
     long, and black, fiercely contending with one another. Having once got
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64240">
     hold they never let go, but struggled and wrestled and rolled on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64250">
     chips incessantly. Looking farther, I was surprised to find that the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64260">
     chips were covered with such combatants, that it was not a _duellum_,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64270">
     but a _bellum_, a war between two races of ants, the red always pitted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64280">
     against the black, and frequently two red ones to one black. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64290">
     legions of these Myrmidons covered all the hills and vales in my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64300">
     wood-yard, and the ground was already strewn with the dead and dying,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64310">
     both red and black. It was the only battle which I have ever witnessed,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64320">
     the only battle-field I ever trod while the battle was raging;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64330">
     internecine war; the red republicans on the one hand, and the black
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64340">
     imperialists on the other. On every side they were engaged in deadly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64350">
     combat, yet without any noise that I could hear, and human soldiers
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64360">
     never fought so resolutely. I watched a couple that were fast locked in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64370">
     each other’s embraces, in a little sunny valley amid the chips, now at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64380">
     noon-day prepared to fight till the sun went down, or life went out.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64390">
     The smaller red champion had fastened himself like a vice to his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64400">
     adversary’s front, and through all the tumblings on that field never

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64410">
     for an instant ceased to gnaw at one of his feelers near the root,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64420">
     having already caused the other to go by the board; while the stronger
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64430">
     black one dashed him from side to side, and, as I saw on looking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64440">
     nearer, had already divested him of several of his members. They fought
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64450">
     with more pertinacity than bull-dogs. Neither manifested the least
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64460">
     disposition to retreat. It was evident that their battle-cry was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64470">
     Conquer or die. In the mean while there came along a single red ant on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64480">
     the hill-side of this valley, evidently full of excitement, who either
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64490">
     had despatched his foe, or had not yet taken part in the battle;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64500">
     probably the latter, for he had lost none of his limbs; whose mother
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64510">
     had charged him to return with his shield or upon it. Or perchance he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64520">
     was some Achilles, who had nourished his wrath apart, and had now come
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64530">
     to avenge or rescue his Patroclus. He saw this unequal combat from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64540">
     afar,—for the blacks were nearly twice the size of the red,—he drew
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64550">
     near with rapid pace till he stood on his guard within half an inch of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64560">
     the combatants; then, watching his opportunity, he sprang upon the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64570">
     black warrior, and commenced his operations near the root of his right
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_64580">
     fore-leg, leaving the foe to select among his own members; and so there

     without feelers and with only the remnant of a leg, and I know not how

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65340">
     behavior, proves herself more native there than the regular
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65350">
     inhabitants. Once, when berrying, I met with a cat with young kittens
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65360">
     in the woods, quite wild, and they all, like their mother, had their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65370">
     backs up and were fiercely spitting at me. A few years before I lived

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65380">
     in the woods there was what was called a “winged cat” in one of the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65400">
     called to see her in June, 1842, she was gone a-hunting in the woods,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65410">
     as was her wont, (I am not sure whether it was a male or female, and so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65420">
     use the more common pronoun,) but her mistress told me that she came
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65430">
     into the neighborhood a little more than a year before, in April, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65440">
     was finally taken into their house; that she was of a dark
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65450">
     brownish-gray color, with a white spot on her throat, and white feet,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65460">
     and had a large bushy tail like a fox; that in the winter the fur grew
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65470">
     thick and flatted out along her sides, forming stripes ten or twelve
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65480">
     inches long by two and a half wide, and under her chin like a muff, the
    </p>

     upper side loose, the under matted like felt, and in the spring these
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65500">
     appendages dropped off. They gave me a pair of her “wings,” which I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65510">
     keep still. There is no appearance of a membrane about them. Some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65520">
     thought it was part flying-squirrel or some other wild animal, which is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65530">
     not impossible, for, according to naturalists, prolific hybrids have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65540">
     been produced by the union of the marten and domestic cat. This would

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65550">
     have been the right kind of cat for me to keep, if I had kept any; for

     why should not a poet’s cat be winged as well as his horse?

     and bathe in the pond, making the woods ring with his wild laughter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65600">
     before I had risen. At rumor of his arrival all the Mill-dam sportsmen

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65620">
     with patent rifles and conical balls and spy-glasses. They come
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65630">
     rustling through the woods like autumn leaves, at least ten men to one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65640">
     loon. Some station themselves on this side of the pond, some on that,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65650">
     for the poor bird cannot be omnipresent; if he dive here he must come
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65660">
     up there. But now the kind October wind rises, rustling the leaves and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65670">
     rippling the surface of the water, so that no loon can be heard or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65680">
     seen, though his foes sweep the pond with spy-glasses, and make the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65690">
     woods resound with their discharges. The waves generously rise and dash
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65700">
     angrily, taking sides with all water-fowl, and our sportsmen must beat

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65710">
     a retreat to town and shop and unfinished jobs. But they were too often
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65720">
     successful. When I went to get a pail of water early in the morning I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65730">
     frequently saw this stately bird sailing out of my cove within a few
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65740">
     rods. If I endeavored to overtake him in a boat, in order to see how he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65750">
     would manœuvre, he would dive and be completely lost, so that I did not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65760">
     discover him again, sometimes, till the latter part of the day. But I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65770">
     was more than a match for him on the surface. He commonly went off in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65780">
     rain.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65800">
     As I was paddling along the north shore one very calm October
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65810">
     afternoon, for such days especially they settle on to the lakes, like

     the milkweed down, having looked in vain over the pond for a loon,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65830">
     suddenly one, sailing out from the shore toward the middle a few rods
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65840">
     in front of me, set up his wild laugh and betrayed himself. I pursued
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65850">
     with a paddle and he dived, but when he came up I was nearer than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65860">
     before. He dived again, but I miscalculated the direction he would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65870">
     take, and we were fifty rods apart when he came to the surface this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65880">
     time, for I had helped to widen the interval; and again he laughed long
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65890">
     and loud, and with more reason than before. He manœuvred so cunningly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65900">
     that I could not get within half a dozen rods of him. Each time, when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65910">
     he came to the surface, turning his head this way and that, he cooly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65920">
     surveyed the water and the land, and apparently chose his course so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65930">
     that he might come up where there was the widest expanse of water and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65940">
     at the greatest distance from the boat. It was surprising how quickly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65950">
     he made up his mind and put his resolve into execution. He led me at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65960">
     once to the widest part of the pond, and could not be driven from it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65970">
     While he was thinking one thing in his brain, I was endeavoring to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65980">
     divine his thought in mine. It was a pretty game, played on the smooth
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_65990">
     surface of the pond, a man against a loon. Suddenly your adversary’s
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66000">
     checker disappears beneath the board, and the problem is to place yours
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66010">
     nearest to where his will appear again. Sometimes he would come up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66020">
     unexpectedly on the opposite side of me, having apparently passed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66030">
     directly under the boat. So long-winded was he and so unweariable, that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66040">
     when he had swum farthest he would immediately plunge again,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66050">
     nevertheless; and then no wit could divine where in the deep pond,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66060">
     beneath the smooth surface, he might be speeding his way like a fish,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66070">
     for he had time and ability to visit the bottom of the pond in its

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66080">
     deepest part. It is said that loons have been caught in the New York
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66090">
     lakes eighty feet beneath the surface, with hooks set for trout,—though
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66100">
     Walden is deeper than that. How surprised must the fishes be to see
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66110">
     this ungainly visitor from another sphere speeding his way amid their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66120">
     schools! Yet he appeared to know his course as surely under water as on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66130">
     the surface, and swam much faster there. Once or twice I saw a ripple
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66140">
     where he approached the surface, just put his head out to reconnoitre,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66150">
     and instantly dived again. I found that it was as well for me to rest
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66160">
     on my oars and wait his reappearing as to endeavor to calculate where
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66170">
     he would rise; for again and again, when I was straining my eyes over
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66180">
     the surface one way, I would suddenly be startled by his unearthly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66190">
     laugh behind me. But why, after displaying so much cunning, did he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66200">
     invariably betray himself the moment he came up by that loud laugh? Did
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66210">
     not his white breast enough betray him? He was indeed a silly loon, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66220">
     thought. I could commonly hear the splash of the water when he came up,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66230">
     and so also detected him. But after an hour he seemed as fresh as ever,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66240">
     dived as willingly and swam yet farther than at first. It was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66250">
     surprising to see how serenely he sailed off with unruffled breast when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66260">
     he came to the surface, doing all the work with his webbed feet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66270">
     beneath. His usual note was this demoniac laughter, yet somewhat like
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66280">
     that of a water-fowl; but occasionally, when he had balked me most
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66290">
     successfully and come up a long way off, he uttered a long-drawn
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66300">
     unearthly howl, probably more like that of a wolf than any bird; as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66310">
     when a beast puts his muzzle to the ground and deliberately howls. This
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66320">
     was his looning,—perhaps the wildest sound that is ever heard here,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66330">
     making the woods ring far and wide. I concluded that he laughed in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66340">
     derision of my efforts, confident of his own resources. Though the sky
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66350">
     was by this time overcast, the pond was so smooth that I could see
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66360">
     where he broke the surface when I did not hear him. His white breast,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66370">
     the stillness of the air, and the smoothness of the water were all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66380">
     against him. At length, having come up fifty rods off, he uttered one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66390">
     of those prolonged howls, as if calling on the god of loons to aid him,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66400">
     and immediately there came a wind from the east and rippled the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66410">
     surface, and filled the whole air with misty rain, and I was impressed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66420">
     as if it were the prayer of the loon answered, and his god was angry
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66430">
     with me; and so I left him disappearing far away on the tumultuous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66440">
     surface.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66460">
     For hours, in fall days, I watched the ducks cunningly tack and veer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66470">
     and hold the middle of the pond, far from the sportsman; tricks which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66480">
     they will have less need to practise in Louisiana bayous. When
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66490">
     compelled to rise they would sometimes circle round and round and over
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66500">
     the pond at a considerable height, from which they could easily see to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66510">
     other ponds and the river, like black motes in the sky; and, when I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66520">
     thought they had gone off thither long since, they would settle down by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66530">
     a slanting flight of a quarter of a mile on to a distant part which was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66540">
     left free; but what beside safety they got by sailing in the middle of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66550">
     Walden I do not know, unless they love its water for the same reason

     In October I went a-graping to the river meadows, and loaded myself
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66610">
     with clusters more precious for their beauty and fragrance than for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66620">
     food. There too I admired, though I did not gather, the cranberries,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66630">
     small waxen gems, pendants of the meadow grass, pearly and red, which

     _jammed_, to satisfy the tastes of lovers of Nature there. So butchers

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66680">
     rake the tongues of bison out of the prairie grass, regardless of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66690">
     torn and drooping plant. The barberry’s brilliant fruit was likewise
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66700">
     food for my eyes merely; but I collected a small store of wild apples
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66710">
     for coddling, which the proprietor and travellers had overlooked. When
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66720">
     chestnuts were ripe I laid up half a bushel for winter. It was very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66730">
     exciting at that season to roam the then boundless chestnut woods of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66740">
     Lincoln,—they now sleep their long sleep under the railroad,—with a bag
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66750">
     on my shoulder, and a stick to open burrs with in my hand, for I did
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66760">
     not always wait for the frost, amid the rustling of leaves and the loud
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66770">
     reproofs of the red-squirrels and the jays, whose half-consumed nuts I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66780">
     sometimes stole, for the burrs which they had selected were sure to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66790">
     contain sound ones. Occasionally I climbed and shook the trees. They
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66800">
     grew also behind my house, and one large tree, which almost
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66810">
     overshadowed it, was, when in flower, a bouquet which scented the whole
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66820">
     neighborhood, but the squirrels and the jays got most of its fruit; the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66830">
     last coming in flocks early in the morning and picking the nuts out of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66840">
     the burrs before they fell. I relinquished these trees to them and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66850">
     visited the more distant woods composed wholly of chestnut. These nuts,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66860">
     as far as they went, were a good substitute for bread. Many other
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66870">
     substitutes might, perhaps, be found. Digging one day for fish-worms, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66880">
     discovered the ground-nut (_Apios tuberosa_) on its string, the potato
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66890">
     of the aborigines, a sort of fabulous fruit, which I had begun to doubt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66900">
     if I had ever dug and eaten in childhood, as I had told, and had not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66910">
     dreamed it. I had often since seen its crimpled red velvety blossom
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66920">
     supported by the stems of other plants without knowing it to be the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66930">
     same. Cultivation has well nigh exterminated it. It has a sweetish
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66940">
     taste, much like that of a frostbitten potato, and I found it better
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66950">
     boiled than roasted. This tuber seemed like a faint promise of Nature
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66960">
     to rear her own children and feed them simply here at some future
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66970">
     period. In these days of fatted cattle and waving grain-fields this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66980">
     humble root, which was once the _totem_ of an Indian tribe, is quite
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_66990">
     forgotten, or known only by its flowering vine; but let wild Nature

     probably disappear before a myriad of foes, and without the care of man

     have brought it; but the now almost exterminated ground-nut will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67050">
     perhaps revive and flourish in spite of frosts and wildness, prove

     itself indigenous, and resume its ancient importance and dignity as the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67070">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67120">
     Already, by the first of September, I had seen two or three small

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67130">
     maples turned scarlet across the pond, beneath where the white stems of

     three aspens diverged, at the point of a promontory, next the water.

     smooth mirror of the lake. Each morning the manager of this gallery
    </p>

     substituted some new picture, distinguished by more brilliant or

     The wasps came by thousands to my lodge in October, as to winter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67220">
     quarters, and settled on my windows within and on the walls over-head,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67230">
     sometimes deterring visitors from entering. Each morning, when they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67240">
     were numbed with cold, I swept some of them out, but I did not trouble
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67250">
     myself much to get rid of them; I even felt complimented by their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67260">
     regarding my house as a desirable shelter. They never molested me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67270">
     seriously, though they bedded with me; and they gradually disappeared,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67280">
     into what crevices I do not know, avoiding winter and unspeakable cold.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67300">
     Like the wasps, before I finally went into winter quarters in November,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67310">
     I used to resort to the north-east side of Walden, which the sun,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67320">
     reflected from the pitch-pine woods and the stony shore, made the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67330">
     fire-side of the pond; it is so much pleasanter and wholesomer to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67340">
     warmed by the sun while you can be, than by an artificial fire. I thus
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67350">
     warmed myself by the still glowing embers which the summer, like a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67360">
     departed hunter, had left.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67400">
     When I came to build my chimney I studied masonry. My bricks being
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67410">
     second-hand ones required to be cleaned with a trowel, so that I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67420">
     learned more than usual of the qualities of bricks and trowels. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67430">
     mortar on them was fifty years old, and was said to be still growing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67440">
     harder; but this is one of those sayings which men love to repeat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67450">
     whether they are true or not. Such sayings themselves grow harder and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67460">
     adhere more firmly with age, and it would take many blows with a trowel
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67470">
     to clean an old wiseacre of them. Many of the villages of Mesopotamia
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67480">
     are built of second-hand bricks of a very good quality, obtained from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67490">
     the ruins of Babylon, and the cement on them is older and probably
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67500">
     harder still. However that may be, I was struck by the peculiar
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67510">
     toughness of the steel which bore so many violent blows without being
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67520">
     worn out. As my bricks had been in a chimney before, though I did not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67530">
     read the name of Nebuchadnezzar on them, I picked out as many
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67540">
     fire-place bricks as I could find, to save work and waste, and I filled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67550">
     the spaces between the bricks about the fire-place with stones from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67560">
     pond shore, and also made my mortar with the white sand from the same
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67570">
     place. I lingered most about the fireplace, as the most vital part of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67580">
     the house. Indeed, I worked so deliberately, that though I commenced at

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67590">
     the ground in the morning, a course of bricks raised a few inches above
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67600">
     the floor served for my pillow at night; yet I did not get a stiff neck

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67610">
     for it that I remember; my stiff neck is of older date. I took a poet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67620">
     to board for a fortnight about those times, which caused me to be put
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67630">
     to it for room. He brought his own knife, though I had two, and we used
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67640">
     to scour them by thrusting them into the earth. He shared with me the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67650">
     labors of cooking. I was pleased to see my work rising so square and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67660">
     solid by degrees, and reflected, that, if it proceeded slowly, it was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67670">
     calculated to endure a long time. The chimney is to some extent an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67680">
     independent structure, standing on the ground and rising through the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67690">
     house to the heavens; even after the house is burned it still stands
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67700">
     sometimes, and its importance and independence are apparent. This was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67710">
     toward the end of summer. It was now November.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67750">
     The north wind had already begun to cool the pond, though it took many
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67760">
     weeks of steady blowing to accomplish it, it is so deep. When I began
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67770">
     to have a fire at evening, before I plastered my house, the chimney
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67780">
     carried smoke particularly well, because of the numerous chinks between
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67790">
     the boards. Yet I passed some cheerful evenings in that cool and airy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67800">
     apartment, surrounded by the rough brown boards full of knots, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67810">
     rafters with the bark on high overhead. My house never pleased my eye
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67820">
     so much after it was plastered, though I was obliged to confess that it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67830">
     was more comfortable. Should not every apartment in which man dwells be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67840">
     lofty enough to create some obscurity over-head, where flickering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67850">
     shadows may play at evening about the rafters? These forms are more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67860">
     agreeable to the fancy and imagination than fresco paintings or other
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67870">
     the most expensive furniture. I now first began to inhabit my house, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67880">
     may say, when I began to use it for warmth as well as shelter. I had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67890">
     got a couple of old fire-dogs to keep the wood from the hearth, and it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67900">
     did me good to see the soot form on the back of the chimney which I had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67910">
     built, and I poked the fire with more right and more satisfaction than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67920">
     usual. My dwelling was small, and I could hardly entertain an echo in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67930">
     it; but it seemed larger for being a single apartment and remote from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67940">
     neighbors. All the attractions of a house were concentrated in one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67950">
     room; it was kitchen, chamber, parlor, and keeping-room; and whatever
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67960">
     satisfaction parent or child, master or servant, derive from living in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67970">
     a house, I enjoyed it all. Cato says, the master of a family
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67980">
     (_patremfamilias_) must have in his rustic villa “cellam oleariam,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_67990">
     vinariam, dolia multa, uti lubeat caritatem expectare, et rei, et
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68000">
     virtuti, et gloriæ erit,” that is, “an oil and wine cellar, many casks,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68010">
     so that it may be pleasant to expect hard times; it will be for his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68020">
     advantage, and virtue, and glory.” I had in my cellar a firkin of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68030">
     potatoes, about two quarts of peas with the weevil in them, and on my

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68040">
     shelf a little rice, a jug of molasses, and of rye and Indian meal a

     peck each.

     I sometimes dream of a larger and more populous house, standing in a

     golden age, of enduring materials, and without ginger-bread work, which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68090">
     shall still consist of only one room, a vast, rude, substantial,

     primitive hall, without ceiling or plastering, with bare rafters and
    </p>

     It would seem as if the very language of our parlors would lose all its

     they beat a hasty retreat rather, as if it would shake the house to its

     foundations. Nevertheless, it stood through a great many

     hasty-puddings.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68680">
     I did not plaster till it was freezing weather. I brought over some

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68690">
     whiter and cleaner sand for this purpose from the opposite shore of the
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68710">
     much farther if necessary. My house had in the mean while been shingled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68720">
     down to the ground on every side. In lathing I was pleased to be able
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68730">
     to send home each nail with a single blow of the hammer, and it was my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68740">
     ambition to transfer the plaster from the board to the wall neatly and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68750">
     rapidly. I remembered the story of a conceited fellow, who, in fine

     clothes, was wont to lounge about the village once, giving advice to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68770">
     workmen. Venturing one day to substitute deeds for words, he turned up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68780">
     his cuffs, seized a plasterer’s board, and having loaded his trowel
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68790">
     without mishap, with a complacent look toward the lathing overhead,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68800">
     made a bold gesture thitherward; and straightway, to his complete
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68810">
     discomfiture, received the whole contents in his ruffled bosom. I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68820">
     admired anew the economy and convenience of plastering, which so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68830">
     effectually shuts out the cold and takes a handsome finish, and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68840">
     learned the various casualties to which the plasterer is liable. I was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68850">
     surprised to see how thirsty the bricks were which drank up all the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68860">
     moisture in my plaster before I had smoothed it, and how many pailfuls
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68870">
     of water it takes to christen a new hearth. I had the previous winter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68880">
     made a small quantity of lime by burning the shells of the _Unio

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68900">
     so that I knew where my materials came from. I might have got good
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68910">
     limestone within a mile or two and burned it myself, if I had cared to
    </p>

     do so.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68960">
     The pond had in the mean while skimmed over in the shadiest and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_68970">
     shallowest coves, some days or even weeks before the general freezing.

     inches distant, like a picture behind a glass, and the water is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69040">

    </p>

     some of their cases in the furrows, though they are deep and broad for
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69160">
     eighth of an inch in diameter, very clear and beautiful, and you see
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69170">
     your face reflected in them through the ice. There may be thirty or
    </p>

     forty of them to a square inch. There are also already within the ice
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69190">
     narrow oblong perpendicular bubbles about half an inch long, sharp
    </p>

     cones with the apex upward; or oftener, if the ice is quite fresh,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69210">
     minute spherical bubbles one directly above another, like a string of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69220">
     beads. But these within the ice are not so numerous nor obvious as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69230">
     those beneath. I sometimes used to cast on stones to try the strength
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69240">
     of the ice, and those which broke through carried in air with them,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69250">
     which formed very large and conspicuous white bubbles beneath. One day
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69260">
     when I came to the same place forty-eight hours afterward, I found that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69270">
     those large bubbles were still perfect, though an inch more of ice had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69280">
     formed, as I could see distinctly by the seam in the edge of a cake.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69290">
     But as the last two days had been very warm, like an Indian summer, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69300">
     ice was not now transparent, showing the dark green color of the water,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69310">
     and the bottom, but opaque and whitish or gray, and though twice as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69320">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69330">
     expanded under this heat and run together, and lost their regularity;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69340">
     they were no longer one directly over another, but often like silvery
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69350">
     coins poured from a bag, one overlapping another, or in thin flakes, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69360">
     if occupying slight cleavages. The beauty of the ice was gone, and it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69370">
     was too late to study the bottom. Being curious to know what position
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69380">
     my great bubbles occupied with regard to the new ice, I broke out a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69390">
     cake containing a middling sized one, and turned it bottom upward. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69400">
     new ice had formed around and under the bubble, so that it was included
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69410">
     between the two ices. It was wholly in the lower ice, but close against
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69420">
     the upper, and was flattish, or perhaps slightly lenticular, with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69430">
     rounded edge, a quarter of an inch deep by four inches in diameter; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69440">
     I was surprised to find that directly under the bubble the ice was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69450">
     melted with great regularity in the form of a saucer reversed, to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69460">
     height of five eighths of an inch in the middle, leaving a thin
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69470">
     partition there between the water and the bubble, hardly an eighth of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69480">
     an inch thick; and in many places the small bubbles in this partition
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69490">
     had burst out downward, and probably there was no ice at all under the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69500">
     largest bubbles, which were a foot in diameter. I inferred that the

     infinite number of minute bubbles which I had first seen against the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69530">
     its degree, had operated like a burning glass on the ice beneath to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69540">
     melt and rot it. These are the little air-guns which contribute to make
    </p>

     At length the winter set in in good earnest, just as I had finished

     some flying low over the woods toward Fair Haven, bound for Mexico.

     Several times, when returning from the village at ten or eleven o’clock
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69750">
     suddenly with the scenery of winter. I withdrew yet farther into my
    </p>

     shell, and endeavored to keep a bright fire both within my house and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69770">
     within my breast. My employment out of doors now was to collect the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69780">
     dead wood in the forest, bringing it in my hands or on my shoulders, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69790">

     with the bark on, pinned together by the Irish when the railroad was

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69910">
     and then lying high six months it was perfectly sound, though
    </p>

     one end of a log fifteen feet long on my shoulder, and the other on the
    </p>

     a longer birch or alder which had a hook at the end, dragged them

     across. Though completely waterlogged and almost as heavy as lead, they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_69980">
     not only burned long, but made a very hot fire; nay, I thought that

     they burned better for the soaking, as if the pitch, being confined by

     had caught my bed, and I went in and extinguished it when it had burned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_70970">
     a place as big as my hand. But my house occupied so sunny and sheltered

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_70980">
     a position, and its roof was so low, that I could afford to let the

     on purpose to freeze myself. The animal merely makes a bed, which he

     been exposed to the rudest blasts a long time, my whole body began to

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71150">
     grow torpid, when I reached the genial atmosphere of my house I soon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71160">
     recovered my faculties and prolonged my life. But the most luxuriously

     The next winter I used a small cooking-stove for economy, since I did
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71250">
     not own the forest; but it did not keep fire so well as the open
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71260">
     fire-place. Cooking was then, for the most part, no longer a poetic,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71270">
     but merely a chemic process. It will soon be forgotten, in these days
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71280">
     of stoves, that we used to roast potatoes in the ashes, after the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71290">
     Indian fashion. The stove not only took up room and scented the house,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71300">
     but it concealed the fire, and I felt as if I had lost a companion. You
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71310">
     can always see a face in the fire. The laborer, looking into it at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71320">
     evening, purifies his thoughts of the dross and earthiness which they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71330">
     have accumulated during the day. But I could no longer sit and look
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71340">
     into the fire, and the pertinent words of a poet recurred to me with

     I weathered some merry snow storms, and spent some cheerful winter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71610">
     evenings by my fire-side, while the snow whirled wildly without, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71620">
     even the hooting of the owl was hushed. For many weeks I met no one in

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71630">
     my walks but those who came occasionally to cut wood and sled it to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71640">
     village. The elements, however, abetted me in making a path through the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71650">
     deepest snow in the woods, for when I had once gone through the wind
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71660">
     blew the oak leaves into my tracks, where they lodged, and by absorbing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71670">
     the rays of the sun melted the snow, and so not only made a dry bed for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71680">
     my feet, but in the night their dark line was my guide. For human
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71690">
     society I was obliged to conjure up the former occupants of these
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71700">
     woods. Within the memory of many of my townsmen the road near which my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71710">
     house stands resounded with the laugh and gossip of inhabitants, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71720">
     the woods which border it were notched and dotted here and there with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71730">
     their little gardens and dwellings, though it was then much more shut
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71740">
     in by the forest than now. In some places, within my own remembrance,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71750">
     the pines would scrape both sides of a chaise at once, and women and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71760">
     children who were compelled to go this way to Lincoln alone and on foot
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71770">
     did it with fear, and often ran a good part of the distance. Though
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71780">
     mainly but a humble route to neighboring villages, or for the woodman’s
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71790">
     team, it once amused the traveller more than now by its variety, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71800">
     lingered longer in his memory. Where now firm open fields stretch from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71810">
     the village to the woods, it then ran through a maple swamp on a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71820">
     foundation of logs, the remnants of which, doubtless, still underlie
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71830">
     the present dusty highway, from the Stratton, now the Alms House, Farm,
    </p>

     East of my bean-field, across the road, lived Cato Ingraham, slave of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71870">
     Duncan Ingraham, Esquire, gentleman, of Concord village, who built his
    </p>

     slave a house, and gave him permission to live in Walden Woods;—Cato,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71890">
     not Uticensis, but Concordiensis. Some say that he was a Guinea Negro.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71900">
     There are a few who remember his little patch among the walnuts, which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71910">
     he let grow up till he should be old and need them; but a younger and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71920">
     whiter speculator got them at last. He too, however, occupies an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71930">
     equally narrow house at present. Cato’s half-obliterated cellar hole
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71940">
     still remains, though known to few, being concealed from the traveller
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71950">
     by a fringe of pines. It is now filled with the smooth sumach (_Rhus
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71960">
     glabra_,) and one of the earliest species of golden-rod (_Solidago
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71970">
     stricta_) grows there luxuriantly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_71990">
     Here, by the very corner of my field, still nearer to town, Zilpha, a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72000">
     colored woman, had her little house, where she spun linen for the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72010">
     townsfolk, making the Walden Woods ring with her shrill singing, for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72020">
     she had a loud and notable voice. At length, in the war of 1812, her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72030">
     dwelling was set on fire by English soldiers, prisoners on parole, when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72040">
     she was away, and her cat and dog and hens were all burned up together.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72050">
     She led a hard life, and somewhat inhumane. One old frequenter of these
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72060">
     woods remembers, that as he passed her house one noon he heard her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72070">
     muttering to herself over her gurgling pot,—“Ye are all bones, bones!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72080">
     I have seen bricks amid the oak copse there.

     Down the road, on the right hand, on Brister’s Hill, lived Brister

     Freeman, “a handy Negro,” slave of Squire Cummings once,—there where
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72120">
     grow still the apple-trees which Brister planted and tended; large old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72130">
     trees now, but their fruit still wild and ciderish to my taste. Not

     little on one side, near the unmarked graves of some British grenadiers

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72160">
     who fell in the retreat from Concord,—where he is styled “Sippio

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72180">
     color,” as if he were discolored. It also told me, with staring
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72190">
     emphasis, when he died; which was but an indirect way of informing me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72200">
     that he ever lived. With him dwelt Fenda, his hospitable wife, who told

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72470">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72540">
     collection of English poetry without skipping. It fairly overcame my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72550">
     Nervii. I had just sunk my head on this when the bells rung fire, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72560">
     in hot haste the engines rolled that way, led by a straggling troop of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72570">
     men and boys, and I among the foremost, for I had leaped the brook. We
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72580">
     thought it was far south over the woods,—we who had run to fires
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72590">
     before,—barn, shop, or dwelling-house, or all together. “It’s Baker’s
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72600">
     barn,” cried one. “It is the Codman place,” affirmed another. And then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72610">
     fresh sparks went up above the wood, as if the roof fell in, and we all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72620">
     shouted “Concord to the rescue!” Wagons shot past with furious speed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72630">
     and crushing loads, bearing, perchance, among the rest, the agent of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72640">
     the Insurance Company, who was bound to go however far; and ever and

     anon the engine bell tinkled behind, more slow and sure; and rearmost
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72660">
     of all, as it was afterward whispered, came they who set the fire and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72670">
     gave the alarm. Thus we kept on like true idealists, rejecting the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72680">
     evidence of our senses, until at a turn in the road we heard the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72690">
     crackling and actually felt the heat of the fire from over the wall,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72700">
     and realized, alas! that we were there. The very nearness of the fire
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72710">
     but cooled our ardor. At first we thought to throw a frog-pond on to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72720">
     it; but concluded to let it burn, it was so far gone and so worthless.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72730">
     So we stood round our engine, jostled one another, expressed our
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72740">
     sentiments through speaking-trumpets, or in lower tone referred to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72750">
     great conflagrations which the world has witnessed, including Bascom’s
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72760">
     shop, and, between ourselves, we thought that, were we there in season
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72770">
     with our “tub,” and a full frog-pond by, we could turn that threatened
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72780">
     last and universal one into another flood. We finally retreated without
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72790">
     doing any mischief,—returned to sleep and Gondibert. But as for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72800">
     Gondibert, I would except that passage in the preface about wit being
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72810">
     the soul’s powder,—“but most of mankind are strangers to wit, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72820">
     Indians are to powder.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72840">
     It chanced that I walked that way across the fields the following
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72850">
     night, about the same hour, and hearing a low moaning at this spot, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72860">
     drew near in the dark, and discovered the only survivor of the family
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72870">
     that I know, the heir of both its virtues and its vices, who alone was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72880">
     interested in this burning, lying on his stomach and looking over the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72890">
     cellar wall at the still smouldering cinders beneath, muttering to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72900">
     himself, as is his wont. He had been working far off in the river
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72910">
     meadows all day, and had improved the first moments that he could call
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72920">
     his own to visit the home of his fathers and his youth. He gazed into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72930">
     the cellar from all sides and points of view by turns, always lying
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72940">
     down to it, as if there was some treasure, which he remembered,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72950">
     concealed between the stones, where there was absolutely nothing but a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72960">
     heap of bricks and ashes. The house being gone, he looked at what there
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72970">
     was left. He was soothed by the sympathy which my mere presence
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72980">
     implied, and showed me, as well as the darkness permitted, where the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_72990">
     well was covered up; which, thank Heaven, could never be burned; and he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73000">
     groped long about the wall to find the well-sweep which his father had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73010">
     cut and mounted, feeling for the iron hook or staple by which a burden
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73020">
     had been fastened to the heavy end,—all that he could now cling to,—to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73030">
     convince me that it was no common “rider.” I felt it, and still remark
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73040">
     it almost daily in my walks, for by it hangs the history of a family.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73060">
     Once more, on the left, where are seen the well and lilac bushes by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73070">
     wall, in the now open field, lived Nutting and Le Grosse. But to return
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73080">
     toward Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73100">
     Farther in the woods than any of these, where the road approaches
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73110">
     nearest to the pond, Wyman the potter squatted, and furnished his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73120">
     townsmen with earthen ware, and left descendants to succeed him.

     Neither were they rich in worldly goods, holding the land by sufferance
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73140">
     while they lived; and there often the sheriff came in vain to collect
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73150">
     the taxes, and “attached a chip,” for form’s sake, as I have read in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73160">
     his accounts, there being nothing else that he could lay his hands on.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73170">
     One day in midsummer, when I was hoeing, a man who was carrying a load
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73180">
     of pottery to market stopped his horse against my field and inquired
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73190">
     concerning Wyman the younger. He had long ago bought a potter’s wheel
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73200">
     of him, and wished to know what had become of him. I had read of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73210">
     potter’s clay and wheel in Scripture, but it had never occurred to me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73220">
     that the pots we use were not such as had come down unbroken from those
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73230">
     days, or grown on trees like gourds somewhere, and I was pleased to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73240">
     hear that so fictile an art was ever practiced in my neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73260">
     The last inhabitant of these woods before me was an Irishman, Hugh
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73270">
     Quoil (if I have spelt his name with coil enough,) who occupied Wyman’s
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73280">
     tenement,—Col. Quoil, he was called. Rumor said that he had been a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73290">
     soldier at Waterloo. If he had lived I should have made him fight his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73300">
     battles over again. His trade here was that of a ditcher. Napoleon went
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73310">
     to St. Helena; Quoil came to Walden Woods. All I know of him is tragic.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73320">
     He was a man of manners, like one who had seen the world, and was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73330">
     capable of more civil speech than you could well attend to. He wore a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73340">
     great coat in mid-summer, being affected with the trembling delirium,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73350">
     and his face was the color of carmine. He died in the road at the foot
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73360">
     of Brister’s Hill shortly after I came to the woods, so that I have not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73370">
     remembered him as a neighbor. Before his house was pulled down, when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73380">
     his comrades avoided it as “an unlucky castle,” I visited it. There lay
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73390">
     his old clothes curled up by use, as if they were himself, upon his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73400">
     raised plank bed. His pipe lay broken on the hearth, instead of a bowl
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73410">
     broken at the fountain. The last could never have been the symbol of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73420">
     his death, for he confessed to me that, though he had heard of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73430">
     Brister’s Spring, he had never seen it; and soiled cards, kings of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73440">
     diamonds spades and hearts, were scattered over the floor. One black
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73450">
     chicken which the administrator could not catch, black as night and as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73460">
     silent, not even croaking, awaiting Reynard, still went to roost in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73470">
     next apartment. In the rear there was the dim outline of a garden,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73480">
     which had been planted but had never received its first hoeing, owing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73490">
     to those terrible shaking fits, though it was now harvest time. It was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73500">
     over-run with Roman wormwood and beggar-ticks, which last stuck to my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73510">
     clothes for all fruit. The skin of a woodchuck was freshly stretched
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73520">
     upon the back of the house, a trophy of his last Waterloo; but no warm
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73530">
     cap or mittens would he want more.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_73550">
     Now only a dent in the earth marks the site of these dwellings, with

     going abroad, for I frequently tramped eight or ten miles through the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74350">
     deepest snow to keep an appointment with a beech-tree, or a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74360">
     yellow-birch, or an old acquaintance among the pines; when the ice and

    </p>

     changed the pines into fir-trees; wading to the tops of the highest

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74390">
     hills when the snow was nearly two feet deep on a level, and shaking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74400">
     down another snow-storm on my head at every step; or sometimes creeping
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74410">
     and floundering thither on my hands and knees, when the hunters had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74420">
     gone into winter quarters. One afternoon I amused myself by watching a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74430">
     barred owl (_Strix nebulosa_) sitting on one of the lower dead limbs of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74440">
     a white-pine, close to the trunk, in broad daylight, I standing within
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74450">
     a rod of him. He could hear me when I moved and cronched the snow with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74460">
     my feet, but could not plainly see me. When I made most noise he would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74470">
     stretch out his neck, and erect his neck feathers, and open his eyes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74480">
     wide; but their lids soon fell again, and he began to nod. I too felt a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74490">
     slumberous influence after watching him half an hour, as he sat thus
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74500">
     with his eyes half open, like a cat, winged brother of the cat. There
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74510">
     was only a narrow slit left between their lids, by which he preserved a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74520">
     peninsular relation to me; thus, with half-shut eyes, looking out from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74530">
     the land of dreams, and endeavoring to realize me, vague object or mote
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74540">
     that interrupted his visions. At length, on some louder noise or my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74550">
     nearer approach, he would grow uneasy and sluggishly turn about on his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74560">
     perch, as if impatient at having his dreams disturbed; and when he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74570">
     launched himself off and flapped through the pines, spreading his wings
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74580">
     to unexpected breadth, I could not hear the slightest sound from them.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74590">
     Thus, guided amid the pine boughs rather by a delicate sense of their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74600">
     neighborhood than by sight, feeling his twilight way as it were with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74610">
     his sensitive pinions, he found a new perch, where he might in peace
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74620">
     await the dawning of his day.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74640">
     As I walked over the long causeway made for the railroad through the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74650">
     meadows, I encountered many a blustering and nipping wind, for nowhere
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74660">
     has it freer play; and when the frost had smitten me on one cheek,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74670">
     heathen as I was, I turned to it the other also. Nor was it much better
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74680">
     by the carriage road from Brister’s Hill. For I came to town still,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74690">
     like a friendly Indian, when the contents of the broad open fields were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74700">
     all piled up between the walls of the Walden road, and half an hour
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74710">
     sufficed to obliterate the tracks of the last traveller. And when I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74720">
     returned new drifts would have formed, through which I floundered,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74730">
     where the busy north-west wind had been depositing the powdery snow
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74740">
     round a sharp angle in the road, and not a rabbit’s track, nor even the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74750">
     fine print, the small type, of a meadow mouse was to be seen. Yet I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74760">
     rarely failed to find, even in mid-winter, some warm and springly swamp
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74770">
     where the grass and the skunk-cabbage still put forth with perennial
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74780">
     verdure, and some hardier bird occasionally awaited the return of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74790">
     spring.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74810">
     Sometimes, notwithstanding the snow, when I returned from my walk at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74820">
     evening I crossed the deep tracks of a woodchopper leading from my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74830">
     door, and found his pile of whittlings on the hearth, and my house
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74840">
     filled with the odor of his pipe. Or on a Sunday afternoon, if I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74850">
     chanced to be at home, I heard the cronching of the snow made by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74860">
     step of a long-headed farmer, who from far through the woods sought my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74870">
     house, to have a social “crack;” one of the few of his vocation who are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74880">
     “men on their farms;” who donned a frock instead of a professor’s gown,

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74900">
     a load of manure from his barn-yard. We talked of rude and simple
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74910">
     times, when men sat about large fires in cold bracing weather, with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74920">
     clear heads; and when other dessert failed, we tried our teeth on many

    </p>

     most dismal tempests, was a poet. A farmer, a hunter, a soldier, a

     reporter, even a philosopher, may be daunted; but nothing can deter a

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_74990">
     poet, for he is actuated by pure love. Who can predict his comings and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_75000">
     goings? His business calls him out at all hours, even when doctors
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_75010">
     sleep. We made that small house ring with boisterous mirth and resound
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_75020">
     with the murmur of much sober talk, making amends then to Walden vale

     for the long silences. Broadway was still and deserted in comparison.

     might have been referred indifferently to the last uttered or the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_75060">
     forth-coming jest. We made many a “bran new” theory of life over a thin

     dish of gruel, which combined the advantages of conviviality with the

    </p>

    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_75990">
     overhung by oak woods and solemn pines bent down with snow or bristling

     For sounds in winter nights, and often in winter days, I heard the
    </p>

     forlorn but melodious note of a hooting owl indefinitely far; such a

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76080">
     _Hoo hoo hoo, hoorer, hoo,_ sounded sonorously, and the first three

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76110">
     about nine o’clock, I was startled by the loud honking of a goose, and,
    </p>

     stepping to the door, heard the sound of their wings like a tempest in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76130">
     the woods as they flew low over my house. They passed over the pond
    </p>

     toward Fair Haven, seemingly deterred from settling by my light, their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76150">
     commodore honking all the while with a regular beat. Suddenly an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76160">
     unmistakable cat-owl from very near me, with the most harsh and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76170">
     tremendous voice I ever heard from any inhabitant of the woods,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76180">
     responded at regular intervals to the goose, as if determined to expose
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76190">
     and disgrace this intruder from Hudson’s Bay by exhibiting a greater
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76200">
     compass and volume of voice in a native, and _boo-hoo_ him out of
    </p>

     Concord horizon. What do you mean by alarming the citadel at this time

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76230">
     such an hour, and that I have not got lungs and a larynx as well as
    </p>

     yourself? _Boo-hoo, boo-hoo, boo-hoo!_ It was one of the most thrilling

     discords I ever heard. And yet, if you had a discriminating ear, there
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76260">
     were in it the elements of a concord such as these plains never saw nor

     heard.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76290">
     I also heard the whooping of the ice in the pond, my great bed-fellow

     in that part of Concord, as if it were restless in its bed and would

     driven a team against my door, and in the morning would find a crack in

     moonlight nights, in search of a partridge or other game, barking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76380">
     raggedly and demoniacally like forest dogs, as if laboring with some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76390">
     anxiety, or seeking expression, struggling for light and to be dogs

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76400">
     outright and run freely in the streets; for if we take the ages into

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76430">
     standing on their defence, awaiting their transformation. Sometimes one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76440">
     came near to my window, attracted by my light, barked a vulpine curse
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76450">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76470">
     Usually the red squirrel (_Sciurus Hudsonius_) waked me in the dawn,

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76510">
     on to the snow crust by my door, and was amused by watching the motions
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76520">
     of the various animals which were baited by it. In the twilight and the
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76830">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76840">
     some longer and plumper one, considerably bigger than himself, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76850">
     skilfully balancing it, he would set out with it to the woods, like a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76860">
     tiger with a buffalo, by the same zig-zag course and frequent pauses,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76870">
     scratching along with it as if it were too heavy for him and falling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76880">
     all the while, making its fall a diagonal between a perpendicular and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76890">
     horizontal, being determined to put it through at any rate;—a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76900">
     singularly frivolous and whimsical fellow;—and so he would get off with

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76920">
     or fifty rods distant, and I would afterwards find the cobs strewn

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76930">
     about the woods in various directions.

     At length the jays arrive, whose discordant screams were heard long

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76960">
     before, as they were warily making their approach an eighth of a mile
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76970">
     off, and in a stealthy and sneaking manner they flit from tree to tree,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76980">
     nearer and nearer, and pick up the kernels which the squirrels have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_76990">
     dropped. Then, sitting on a pitch-pine bough, they attempt to swallow
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77000">
     in their haste a kernel which is too big for their throats and chokes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77010">
     them; and after great labor they disgorge it, and spend an hour in the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77020">
     endeavor to crack it by repeated blows with their bills. They were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77030">
     manifestly thieves, and I had not much respect for them; but the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77040">
     squirrels, though at first shy, went to work as if they were taking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77050">
     what was their own.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77070">
     Meanwhile also came the chickadees in flocks, which, picking up the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77080">
     crumbs the squirrels had dropped, flew to the nearest twig, and,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77090">
     placing them under their claws, hammered away at them with their little
    </p>

     bills, as if it were an insect in the bark, till they were sufficiently
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77110">
     reduced for their slender throats. A little flock of these tit-mice
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77120">
     came daily to pick a dinner out of my wood-pile, or the crumbs at my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77130">
     door, with faint flitting lisping notes, like the tinkling of icicles
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77140">
     in the grass, or else with sprightly _day day day_, or more rarely, in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77150">
     spring-like days, a wiry summery _phe-be_ from the wood-side. They were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77160">
     so familiar that at length one alighted on an armful of wood which I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77170">
     was carrying in, and pecked at the sticks without fear. I once had a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77180">
     sparrow alight upon my shoulder for a moment while I was hoeing in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77190">
     village garden, and I felt that I was more distinguished by that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77200">
     circumstance than I should have been by any epaulet I could have worn.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77210">
     The squirrels also grew at last to be quite familiar, and occasionally
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77220">
     stepped upon my shoe, when that was the nearest way.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77240">
     When the ground was not yet quite covered, and again near the end of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77250">
     winter, when the snow was melted on my south hill-side and about my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77260">
     wood-pile, the partridges came out of the woods morning and evening to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77270">
     feed there. Whichever side you walk in the woods the partridge bursts
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77280">
     away on whirring wings, jarring the snow from the dry leaves and twigs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77290">
     on high, which comes sifting down in the sun-beams like golden dust;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77300">
     for this brave bird is not to be scared by winter. It is frequently
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77310">
     covered up by drifts, and, it is said, “sometimes plunges from on wing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77320">
     into the soft snow, where it remains concealed for a day or two.” I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77330">
     used to start them in the open land also, where they had come out of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77340">
     the woods at sunset to “bud” the wild apple-trees. They will come
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77350">
     regularly every evening to particular trees, where the cunning
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77360">
     sportsman lies in wait for them, and the distant orchards next the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77370">
     woods suffer thus not a little. I am glad that the partridge gets fed,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77380">
     at any rate. It is Nature’s own bird which lives on buds and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77390">
     diet-drink.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77410">
     In dark winter mornings, or in short winter afternoons, I sometimes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77420">
     heard a pack of hounds threading all the woods with hounding cry and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77430">
     yelp, unable to resist the instinct of the chase, and the note of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77440">
     hunting horn at intervals, proving that man was in the rear. The woods
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77450">
     ring again, and yet no fox bursts forth on to the open level of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77460">
     pond, nor following pack pursuing their Actæon. And perhaps at evening
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77470">
     I see the hunters returning with a single brush trailing from their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77480">
     sleigh for a trophy, seeking their inn. They tell me that if the fox
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77490">
     would remain in the bosom of the frozen earth he would be safe, or if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77500">
     he would run in a straight line away no fox-hound could overtake him;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77510">
     but, having left his pursuers far behind, he stops to rest and listen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77520">
     till they come up, and when he runs he circles round to his old haunts,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77530">
     where the hunters await him. Sometimes, however, he will run upon a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77540">
     wall many rods, and then leap off far to one side, and he appears to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77550">
     know that water will not retain his scent. A hunter told me that he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77560">
     once saw a fox pursued by hounds burst out on to Walden when the ice
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77570">
     was covered with shallow puddles, run part way across, and then return
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77580">
     to the same shore. Ere long the hounds arrived, but here they lost the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77590">
     scent. Sometimes a pack hunting by themselves would pass my door, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77600">
     circle round my house, and yelp and hound without regarding me, as if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77610">
     afflicted by a species of madness, so that nothing could divert them
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77620">
     from the pursuit. Thus they circle until they fall upon the recent
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77630">
     trail of a fox, for a wise hound will forsake every thing else for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77640">
     this. One day a man came to my hut from Lexington to inquire after his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77650">
     hound that made a large track, and had been hunting for a week by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77660">
     himself. But I fear that he was not the wiser for all I told him, for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77670">
     every time I attempted to answer his questions he interrupted me by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77680">
     asking, “What do you do here?” He had lost a dog, but found a man.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77700">
     One old hunter who has a dry tongue, who used to come to bathe in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77710">
     Walden once every year when the water was warmest, and at such times
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77720">
     looked in upon me, told me that many years ago he took his gun one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77730">
     afternoon and went out for a cruise in Walden Wood; and as he walked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77740">
     the Wayland road he heard the cry of hounds approaching, and ere long a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77750">
     fox leaped the wall into the road, and as quick as thought leaped the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77760">
     other wall out of the road, and his swift bullet had not touched him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77770">
     Some way behind came an old hound and her three pups in full pursuit,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77780">
     hunting on their own account, and disappeared again in the woods. Late
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77790">
     in the afternoon, as he was resting in the thick woods south of Walden,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77800">
     he heard the voice of the hounds far over toward Fair Haven still
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77810">
     pursuing the fox; and on they came, their hounding cry which made all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77820">
     the woods ring sounding nearer and nearer, now from Well-Meadow, now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77830">
     from the Baker Farm. For a long time he stood still and listened to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77840">
     their music, so sweet to a hunter’s ear, when suddenly the fox
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77850">
     appeared, threading the solemn aisles with an easy coursing pace, whose
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77860">
     sound was concealed by a sympathetic rustle of the leaves, swift and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77870">
     still, keeping the ground, leaving his pursuers far behind; and,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77880">
     leaping upon a rock amid the woods, he sat erect and listening, with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77890">
     his back to the hunter. For a moment compassion restrained the latter’s
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77900">
     arm; but that was a short-lived mood, and as quick as thought can
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77910">
     follow thought his piece was levelled, and _whang!_—the fox rolling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77920">
     over the rock lay dead on the ground. The hunter still kept his place
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77930">
     and listened to the hounds. Still on they came, and now the near woods
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77940">
     resounded through all their aisles with their demoniac cry. At length
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77950">
     the old hound burst into view with muzzle to the ground, and snapping
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77960">
     the air as if possessed, and ran directly to the rock; but spying the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77970">
     dead fox she suddenly ceased her hounding as if struck dumb with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77980">
     amazement, and walked round and round him in silence; and one by one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_77990">
     her pups arrived, and, like their mother, were sobered into silence by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78000">
     the mystery. Then the hunter came forward and stood in their midst, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78010">
     the mystery was solved. They waited in silence while he skinned the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78020">
     fox, then followed the brush a while, and at length turned off into the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78030">
     woods again. That evening a Weston Squire came to the Concord hunter’s
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78040">
     cottage to inquire for his hounds, and told how for a week they had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78050">
     been hunting on their own account from Weston woods. The Concord hunter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78060">
     told him what he knew and offered him the skin; but the other declined
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78070">
     it and departed. He did not find his hounds that night, but the next
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78080">
     day learned that they had crossed the river and put up at a farm-house
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78090">
     for the night, whence, having been well fed, they took their departure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78100">
     early in the morning.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78120">
     The hunter who told me this could remember one Sam Nutting, who used to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78130">
     hunt bears on Fair Haven Ledges, and exchange their skins for rum in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78140">
     Concord village; who told him, even, that he had seen a moose there.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78150">
     Nutting had a famous fox-hound named Burgoyne,—he pronounced it

     Bugine,—which my informant used to borrow. In the “Wast Book” of an old

     which his uncle was engaged. The hunters were formerly a numerous and
    </p>

     At midnight, when there was a moon, I sometimes met with hounds in my

     afraid, and stand silent amid the bushes till I had passed.

     Squirrels and wild mice disputed for my store of nuts. There were

     scores of pitch-pines around my house, from one to four inches in

     were obliged to mix a large proportion of pine bark with their other

     another winter such were without exception dead. It is remarkable that

     a single mouse should thus be allowed a whole pine tree for its dinner,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78440">
     gnawing round instead of up and down it; but perhaps it is necessary in

     The hares (_Lepus Americanus_) were very familiar. One had her form

     under my house all winter, separated from me only by the flooring, and

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78490">
     she startled me each morning by her hasty departure when I began to

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78500">
     stir,—thump, thump, thump, striking her head against the floor timbers
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78510">
     in her hurry. They used to come round my door at dusk to nibble the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78520">
     potato parings which I had thrown out, and were so nearly the color of

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78540">
     Sometimes in the twilight I alternately lost and recovered sight of one

     sitting motionless under my window. When I opened my door in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78560">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78570">
     they only excited my pity. One evening one sat by my door two paces

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78580">
     from me, at first trembling with fear, yet unwilling to move; a poor
    </p>

     wee thing, lean and bony, with ragged ears and sharp nose, scant tail
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78600">
     and slender paws. It looked as if Nature no longer contained the breed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78610">
     of nobler bloods, but stood on her last toes. Its large eyes appeared
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78620">
     young and unhealthy, almost dropsical. I took a step, and lo, away it

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78630">
     scud with an elastic spring over the snow crust, straightening its body
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78640">
     and its limbs into graceful length, and soon put the forest between me

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78650">
     and itself,—the wild free venison, asserting its vigor and the dignity
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78660">
     of Nature. Not without reason was its slenderness. Such then was its

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78860">
     After a still winter night I awoke with the impression that some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78870">
     question had been put to me, which I had been endeavoring in vain to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78880">
     answer in my sleep, as what—how—when—where? But there was dawning
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78890">
     Nature, in whom all creatures live, looking in at my broad windows with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78900">
     serene and satisfied face, and no question on _her_ lips. I awoke to an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78910">
     answered question, to Nature and daylight. The snow lying deep on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78920">
     earth dotted with young pines, and the very slope of the hill on which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78930">
     my house is placed, seemed to say, Forward! Nature puts no question and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78940">
     answers none which we mortals ask. She has long ago taken her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78950">
     resolution. “O Prince, our eyes contemplate with admiration and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78960">
     transmit to the soul the wonderful and varied spectacle of this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78970">
     universe. The night veils without doubt a part of this glorious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78980">
     creation; but day comes to reveal to us this great work, which extends
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_78990">
     from earth even into the plains of the ether.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79010">
     Then to my morning work. First I take an axe and pail and go in search
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79020">
     of water, if that be not a dream. After a cold and snowy night it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79030">
     needed a divining rod to find it. Every winter the liquid and trembling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79040">
     surface of the pond, which was so sensitive to every breath, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79050">
     reflected every light and shadow, becomes solid to the depth of a foot
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79060">
     or a foot and a half, so that it will support the heaviest teams, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79070">
     perchance the snow covers it to an equal depth, and it is not to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79080">
     distinguished from any level field. Like the marmots in the surrounding
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79090">
     hills, it closes its eye-lids and becomes dormant for three months or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79100">
     more. Standing on the snow-covered plain, as if in a pasture amid the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79110">
     hills, I cut my way first through a foot of snow, and then a foot of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79120">
     ice, and open a window under my feet, where, kneeling to drink, I look
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79130">
     down into the quiet parlor of the fishes, pervaded by a softened light
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79140">
     as through a window of ground glass, with its bright sanded floor the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79150">
     same as in summer; there a perennial waveless serenity reigns as in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79160">
     amber twilight sky, corresponding to the cool and even temperament of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79170">
     the inhabitants. Heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79190">
     Early in the morning, while all things are crisp with frost, men come
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79200">
     with fishing reels and slender lunch, and let down their fine lines
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79210">
     through the snowy field to take pickerel and perch; wild men, who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79220">
     instinctively follow other fashions and trust other authorities than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79230">
     their townsmen, and by their goings and comings stitch towns together
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79240">
     in parts where else they would be ripped. They sit and eat their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79250">
     luncheon in stout fear-naughts on the dry oak leaves on the shore, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79260">
     wise in natural lore as the citizen is in artificial. They never
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79270">
     consulted with books, and know and can tell much less than they have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79280">
     done. The things which they practise are said not yet to be known. Here
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79290">
     is one fishing for pickerel with grown perch for bait. You look into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79300">
     his pail with wonder as into a summer pond, as if he kept summer locked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79310">
     up at home, or knew where she had retreated. How, pray, did he get
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79320">
     these in mid-winter? O, he got worms out of rotten logs since the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79330">
     ground froze, and so he caught them. His life itself passes deeper in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79340">
     Nature than the studies of the naturalist penetrate; himself a subject
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79350">
     for the naturalist. The latter raises the moss and bark gently with his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79360">
     knife in search of insects; the former lays open logs to their core
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79370">
     with his axe, and moss and bark fly far and wide. He gets his living by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79380">
     barking trees. Such a man has some right to fish, and I love to see
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79390">
     Nature carried out in him. The perch swallows the grub-worm, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79400">
     pickerel swallows the perch, and the fisher-man swallows the pickerel;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79410">
     and so all the chinks in the scale of being are filled.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79430">
     When I strolled around the pond in misty weather I was sometimes amused
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79440">
     by the primitive mode which some ruder fisherman had adopted. He would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79450">
     perhaps have placed alder branches over the narrow holes in the ice,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79460">
     which were four or five rods apart and an equal distance from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79470">
     shore, and having fastened the end of the line to a stick to prevent
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79480">
     its being pulled through, have passed the slack line over a twig of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79490">
     alder, a foot or more above the ice, and tied a dry oak leaf to it,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79500">
     which, being pulled down, would show when he had a bite. These alders
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79510">
     loomed through the mist at regular intervals as you walked half way
    </p>

     round the pond.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79540">
     Ah, the pickerel of Walden! when I see them lying on the ice, or in the

     foreign as Arabia to our Concord life. They possess a quite dazzling

     the cadaverous cod and haddock whose fame is trumpeted in our streets.

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_79630">
     like flowers and precious stones, as if they were the pearls, the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_84000">
     surprise, that when I struck the ice with the head of my axe, it
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_84030">
     when it felt the influence of the sun’s rays slanted upon it from over

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_84040">
     the hills; it stretched itself and yawned like a waking man with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_84050">
     gradually increasing tumult, which was kept up three or four hours. It

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_84110">
     could not then have been stunned by a blow on it. The fishermen say

     that the “thundering of the pond” scares the fishes and prevents their

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_84670">
     surprised to see so great a body of ice remaining. Not seeing any

     pond, and then concealed himself in the bushes on the south side, to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_84700">
     await them. The ice was melted for three or four rods from the shore,

    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_93300">

     systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I

     believe—“That government is best which governs not at all;” and when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_93340">
     men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_93350">
     will have. Government is at best but an expedient; but most governments
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_93360">
     are usually, and all governments are sometimes, inexpedient. The

     are many and weighty, and deserve to prevail, may also at last be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_93390">
     brought against a standing government. The standing army is only an arm

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_93400">
     of the standing government. The government itself, which is only the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_93410">
     mode which the people have chosen to execute their will, is equally
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_93420">
     liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_93430">
     Witness the present Mexican war, the work of comparatively a few

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_93510">
     a sort of wooden gun to the people themselves; and, if ever they should
    </p>

     use it in earnest as a real one against each other, it will surely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_93530">
     split. But it is not the less necessary for this; for the people must

     have some complicated machinery or other, and hear its din, to satisfy
    </p>

     that idea of government which they have. Governments show thus how

     successfully men can be imposed on, even impose on themselves, for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_93570">
     their own advantage. It is excellent, we must all allow; yet this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_93580">
     government never of itself furthered any enterprise, but by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_93590">
     alacrity with which it got out of its way. _It_ does not keep the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_93600">
     country free. _It_ does not settle the West. _It_ does not educate. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_93610">
     character inherent in the American people has done all that has been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_93620">
     accomplished; and it would have done somewhat more, if the government
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_93630">
     had not sometimes got in its way. For government is an expedient, by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_93640">
     which men would fain succeed in letting one another alone; and, as has
    </p>

     been said, when it is most expedient, the governed are most let alone

     never manage to bounce over obstacles which legislators are continually
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_93680">
     putting in their way; and, if one were to judge these men wholly by the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_97480">
     property. To such the State renders comparatively small service, and a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_97490">
     slight tax is wont to appear exorbitant, particularly if they are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_97500">
     obliged to earn it by special labor with their hands. If there were one

     who lived wholly without the use of money, the State itself would

     hesitate to demand it of him. But the rich man—not to make any

     invidious comparison—is always sold to the institution which makes him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_97540">
     rich. Absolutely speaking, the more money, the less virtue; for money
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_97550">
     comes between a man and his objects, and obtains them for him; it was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_97560">
     certainly no great virtue to obtain it. It puts to rest many questions
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_97570">
     which he would otherwise be taxed to answer; while the only new
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_97580">
     question which it puts is the hard but superfluous one, how to spend
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_97590">
     it. Thus his moral ground is taken from under his feet. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_97600">
     opportunities of living are diminished in proportion as what are called
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_97610">
     the “means” are increased. The best thing a man can do for his culture
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_97620">
     when he is rich is to endeavor to carry out those schemes which he

     entertained when he was poor. Christ answered the Herodians according
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_97640">
     to their condition. “Show me the tribute-money,” said he;—and one took

     a penny out of his pocket;—if you use money which has the image of

    </p>

     break through, before they could get to be as free as I was. I did nor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98330">
     for a moment feel confined, and the walls seemed a great waste of stone
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98340">
     and mortar. I felt as if I alone of all my townsmen had paid my tax.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98350">
     They plainly did not know how to treat me, but behaved like persons who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98360">
     are underbred. In every threat and in every compliment there was a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98370">
     blunder; for they thought that my chief desire was to stand the other
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98380">
     side of that stone wall. I could not but smile to see how industriously
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98390">
     they locked the door on my meditations, which followed them out again
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98400">
     without let or hindrance, and _they_ were really all that was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98410">
     dangerous. As they could not reach me, they had resolved to punish my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98420">
     body; just as boys, if they cannot come at some person against whom
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98430">
     they have a spite, will abuse his dog. I saw that the State was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98440">
     half-witted, that it was timid as a lone woman with her silver spoons,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98450">
     and that it did not know its friends from its foes, and I lost all my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98460">
     remaining respect for it, and pitied it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98480">
     Thus the state never intentionally confronts a man’s sense,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98490">
     intellectual or moral, but only his body, his senses. It is not armed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98500">
     with superior wit or honesty, but with superior physical strength. I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98510">
     was not born to be forced. I will breathe after my own fashion. Let us
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98520">
     see who is the strongest. What force has a multitude? They only can
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98530">
     force me who obey a higher law than I. They force me to become like
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98540">
     themselves. I do not hear of _men_ being _forced_ to live this way or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98550">
     that by masses of men. What sort of life were that to live? When I meet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98560">
     a government which says to me, “Your money or your life,” why should I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98570">
     be in haste to give it my money? It may be in a great strait, and not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98580">
     know what to do: I cannot help that. It must help itself; do as I do.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98590">
     It is not worth the while to snivel about it. I am not responsible for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98600">
     the successful working of the machinery of society. I am not the son of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98610">
     the engineer. I perceive that, when an acorn and a chestnut fall side
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98620">
     by side, the one does not remain inert to make way for the other, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98630">
     both obey their own laws, and spring and grow and flourish as best they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98640">
     can, till one, perchance, overshadows and destroys the other. If a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98650">
     plant cannot live according to its nature, it dies; and so a man.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98690">
     The night in prison was novel and interesting enough. The prisoners in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98700">
     their shirt-sleeves were enjoying a chat and the evening air in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98710">
     door-way, when I entered. But the jailer said, “Come, boys, it is time
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98720">
     to lock up;” and so they dispersed, and I heard the sound of their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98730">
     steps returning into the hollow apartments. My room-mate was introduced
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98740">
     to me by the jailer as “a first-rate fellow and a clever man.” When the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98750">
     door was locked, he showed me where to hang my hat, and how he managed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98760">
     matters there. The rooms were whitewashed once a month; and this one,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98770">
     at least, was the whitest, most simply furnished, and probably the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98780">
     neatest apartment in town. He naturally wanted to know where I came
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98790">
     from, and what brought me there; and, when I had told him, I asked him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98800">
     in my turn how he came there, presuming him to be an honest man, of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98810">
     course; and, as the world goes, I believe he was. “Why,” said he, “they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98820">
     accuse me of burning a barn; but I never did it.” As near as I could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98830">
     discover, he had probably gone to bed in a barn when drunk, and smoked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98840">
     his pipe there; and so a barn was burnt. He had the reputation of being
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98850">
     a clever man, had been there some three months waiting for his trial to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98860">
     come on, and would have to wait as much longer; but he was quite
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98870">
     domesticated and contented, since he got his board for nothing, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98880">
     thought that he was well treated.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98900">
     He occupied one window, and I the other; and I saw, that, if one stayed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98910">
     there long, his principal business would be to look out the window. I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98920">
     had soon read all the tracts that were left there, and examined where
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98930">
     former prisoners had broken out, and where a grate had been sawed off,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98940">
     and heard the history of the various occupants of that room; for I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98950">
     found that even here there was a history and a gossip which never
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98960">
     circulated beyond the walls of the jail. Probably this is the only
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98970">
     house in the town where verses are composed, which are afterward
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98980">
     printed in a circular form, but not published. I was shown quite a long
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_98990">
     list of verses which were composed by some young men who had been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99000">
     detected in an attempt to escape, who avenged themselves by singing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99010">
     them.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99030">
     I pumped my fellow-prisoner as dry as I could, for fear I should never
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99040">
     see him again; but at length he showed me which was my bed, and left me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99050">
     to blow out the lamp.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99070">
     It was like travelling into a far country, such as I had never expected
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99080">
     to behold, to lie there for one night. It seemed to me that I never had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99090">
     heard the town-clock strike before, nor the evening sounds of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99100">
     village; for we slept with the windows open, which were inside the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99110">
     grating. It was to see my native village in the light of the Middle
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99120">
     Ages, and our Concord was turned into a Rhine stream, and visions of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99130">
     knights and castles passed before me. They were the voices of old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99140">
     burghers that I heard in the streets. I was an involuntary spectator
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99150">
     and auditor of whatever was done and said in the kitchen of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99160">
     adjacent village-inn—a wholly new and rare experience to me. It was a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99170">
     closer view of my native town. I was fairly inside of it. I never had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99180">
     seen its institutions before. This is one of its peculiar institutions;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99190">
     for it is a shire town. I began to comprehend what its inhabitants were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99200">
     about.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99220">
     In the morning, our breakfasts were put through the hole in the door,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99230">
     in small oblong-square tin pans, made to fit, and holding a pint of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99240">
     chocolate, with brown bread, and an iron spoon. When they called for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99250">
     the vessels again, I was green enough to return what bread I had left;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99260">
     but my comrade seized it, and said that I should lay that up for lunch
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99270">
     or dinner. Soon after, he was let out to work at haying in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99280">
     neighboring field, whither he went every day, and would not be back
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99290">
     till noon; so he bade me good-day, saying that he doubted if he should
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99300">
     see me again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99320">
     When I came out of prison,—for some one interfered, and paid the tax,—I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99330">
     did not perceive that great changes had taken place on the common, such
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99340">
     as he observed who went in a youth, and emerged a gray-headed man; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99350">
     yet a change had to my eyes come over the scene,—the town, and State,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99360">
     and country,—greater than any that mere time could effect. I saw yet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99370">
     more distinctly the State in which I lived. I saw to what extent the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99380">
     people among whom I lived could be trusted as good neighbors and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99390">
     friends; that their friendship was for summer weather only; that they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99400">
     did not greatly purpose to do right; that they were a distinct race
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99410">
     from me by their prejudices and superstitions, as the Chinamen and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99420">
     Malays are; that, in their sacrifices to humanity they ran no risks,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99430">
     not even to their property; that, after all, they were not so noble but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99440">
     they treated the thief as he had treated them, and hoped, by a certain
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99450">
     outward observance and a few prayers, and by walking in a particular
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99460">
     straight though useless path from time to time, to save their souls.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99470">
     This may be to judge my neighbors harshly; for I believe that most of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99480">
     them are not aware that they have such an institution as the jail in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99490">
     their village.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99510">
     It was formerly the custom in our village, when a poor debtor came out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99520">
     of jail, for his acquaintances to salute him, looking through their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99530">
     fingers, which were crossed to represent the grating of a jail window,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99540">
     “How do ye do?” My neighbors did not thus salute me, but first looked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99550">
     at me, and then at one another, as if I had returned from a long
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99560">
     journey. I was put into jail as I was going to the shoemaker’s to get a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99570">
     shoe which was mended. When I was let out the next morning, I proceeded
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99580">
     to finish my errand, and, having put on my mended shoe, joined a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99590">
     huckleberry party, who were impatient to put themselves under my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99600">
     conduct; and in half an hour,—for the horse was soon tackled,—was in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99610">
     the midst of a huckleberry field, on one of our highest hills, two
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99620">
     miles off; and then the State was nowhere to be seen.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99640">
     This is the whole history of “My Prisons.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99680">
     I have never declined paying the highway tax, because I am as desirous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99690">
     of being a good neighbor as I am of being a bad subject; and, as for
    </p>

     supporting schools, I am doing my part to educate my fellow-countrymen

     now. It is for no particular item in the tax-bill that I refuse to pay
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99720">
     it. I simply wish to refuse allegiance to the State, to withdraw and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99730">
     stand aloof from it effectually. I do not care to trace the course of
    </p>

     my dollar, if I could, till it buys a man, or a musket to shoot one

     with,—the dollar is innocent,—but I am concerned to trace the effects
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99760">
     of my allegiance. In fact, I quietly declare war with the State, after
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99770">
     my fashion, though I will still make use and get what advantages of her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99780">
     I can, as is usual in such cases.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99800">
     If others pay the tax which is demanded of me, from a sympathy with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99810">
     State, they do but what they have already done in their own case, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99820">
     rather they abet injustice to a greater extent than the State requires.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99830">
     If they pay the tax from a mistaken interest in the individual taxed,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99840">
     to save his property or prevent his going to jail, it is because they

     interfere with the public good.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000067_99880">
     This, then, is my position at present. But one cannot be too much on
