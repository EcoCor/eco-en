    Walden, or Life in the Woods
   </p>
   <p>
    WALDEN
   </p>
   <p>
    Economy
   </p>
   <p>
    When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived
   </p>
   <p>
    alone, in the woods, a mile from any neighbor, in a house which I had
   </p>
   <p>
    built myself, on the shore of Walden Pond, in Concord, Massachusetts,
   </p>
   <p>
    and earned my living by the labor of my hands only. I lived there two
   </p>
   <p>
    years and two months. At present I am a sojourner in civilized life
   </p>
   <p>
    again.
   </p>
   <p>
    I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if
   </p>
   <p>
    very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning
   </p>
   <p>
    my mode of life, which some would call impertinent, though they do not
   </p>
   <p>
    appear to me at all impertinent, but, considering the circumstances,
   </p>
   <p>
    very natural and pertinent. Some have asked what I got to eat; if I did
   </p>
   <p>
    not feel lonesome; if I was not afraid; and the like. Others have been
   </p>
   <p>
    curious to learn what portion of my income I devoted to charitable
   </p>
   <p>
    purposes; and some, who have large families, how many poor children I
   </p>
   <p>
    maintained. I will therefore ask those of my readers who feel no
   </p>
   <p>
    particular interest in me to pardon me if I undertake to answer some of
   </p>
   <p>
    these questions in this book. In most books, the _I_, or first person,
   </p>
   <p>
    is omitted; in this it will be retained; that, in respect to egotism,
   </p>
   <p>
    is the main difference. We commonly do not remember that it is, after
   </p>
   <p>
    all, always the first person that is speaking. I should not talk so
   </p>
   <p>
    much about myself if there were anybody else whom I knew as well.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unfortunately, I am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my
   </p>
   <p>
    experience. Moreover, I, on my side, require of every writer, first or
   </p>
   <p>
    last, a simple and sincere account of his own life, and not merely what
   </p>
   <p>
    he has heard of other men’s lives; some such account as he would send
   </p>
   <p>
    to his kindred from a distant land; for if he has lived sincerely, it
   </p>
   <p>
    must have been in a distant land to me. Perhaps these pages are more
   </p>
   <p>
    particularly addressed to poor students. As for the rest of my readers,
   </p>
   <p>
    they will accept such portions as apply to them. I trust that none will
   </p>
   <p>
    stretch the seams in putting on the coat, for it may do good service to
   </p>
   <p>
    him whom it fits.
   </p>
   <p>
    I would fain say something, not so much concerning the Chinese and
   </p>
   <p>
    Sandwich Islanders as you who read these pages, who are said to live in
   </p>
   <p>
    New England; something about your condition, especially your outward
   </p>
   <p>
    condition or circumstances in this world, in this town, what it is,
   </p>
   <p>
    whether it is necessary that it be as bad as it is, whether it cannot
   </p>
   <p>
    be improved as well as not. I have travelled a good deal in Concord;
   </p>
   <p>
    and everywhere, in shops, and offices, and fields, the inhabitants have
   </p>
   <p>
    appeared to me to be doing penance in a thousand remarkable ways. What
   </p>
   <p>
    I have heard of Brahmins sitting exposed to four fires and looking in
   </p>
   <p>
    the face of the sun; or hanging suspended, with their heads downward,
   </p>
   <p>
    over flames; or looking at the heavens over their shoulders “until it
   </p>
   <p>
    becomes impossible for them to resume their natural position, while
   </p>
   <p>
    from the twist of the neck nothing but liquids can pass into the
   </p>
   <p>
    stomach;” or dwelling, chained for life, at the foot of a tree; or
   </p>
   <p>
    measuring with their bodies, like caterpillars, the breadth of vast
   </p>
   <p>
    empires; or standing on one leg on the tops of pillars,—even these
   </p>
   <p>
    forms of conscious penance are hardly more incredible and astonishing
   </p>
   <p>
    than the scenes which I daily witness. The twelve labors of Hercules
   </p>
   <p>
    were trifling in comparison with those which my neighbors have
   </p>
   <p>
    undertaken; for they were only twelve, and had an end; but I could
   </p>
   <p>
    never see that these men slew or captured any monster or finished any
   </p>
   <p>
    labor. They have no friend Iolas to burn with a hot iron the root of
   </p>
   <p>
    the hydra’s head, but as soon as one head is crushed, two spring up.
   </p>
   <p>
    I see young men, my townsmen, whose misfortune it is to have inherited
   </p>
   <p>
    farms, houses, barns, cattle, and farming tools; for these are more
   </p>
   <p>
    easily acquired than got rid of. Better if they had been born in the
   </p>
   <p>
    open pasture and suckled by a wolf, that they might have seen with
   </p>
   <p>
    clearer eyes what field they were called to labor in. Who made them
   </p>
   <p>
    serfs of the soil? Why should they eat their sixty acres, when man is
   </p>
   <p>
    condemned to eat only his peck of dirt? Why should they begin digging
   </p>
   <p>
    their graves as soon as they are born? They have got to live a man’s
   </p>
   <p>
    life, pushing all these things before them, and get on as well as they
   </p>
   <p>
    can. How many a poor immortal soul have I met well nigh crushed and
   </p>
   <p>
    smothered under its load, creeping down the road of life, pushing
   </p>
   <p>
    before it a barn seventy-five feet by forty, its Augean stables never
   </p>
   <p>
    cleansed, and one hundred acres of land, tillage, mowing, pasture, and
   </p>
   <p>
    wood-lot! The portionless, who struggle with no such unnecessary
   </p>
   <p>
    inherited encumbrances, find it labor enough to subdue and cultivate a
   </p>
   <p>
    few cubic feet of flesh.
   </p>
   <p>
    But men labor under a mistake. The better part of the man is soon
   </p>
   <p>
    plowed into the soil for compost. By a seeming fate, commonly called
   </p>
   <p>
    necessity, they are employed, as it says in an old book, laying up
   </p>
   <p>
    treasures which moth and rust will corrupt and thieves break through
   </p>
   <p>
    and steal. It is a fool’s life, as they will find when they get to the
   </p>
   <p>
    end of it, if not before. It is said that Deucalion and Pyrrha created
   </p>
   <p>
    men by throwing stones over their heads behind them:—
   </p>
   <p>
    Inde genus durum sumus, experiensque laborum,
   </p>
   <p>
    Et documenta damus quâ simus origine nati.
   </p>
   <p>
    Or, as Raleigh rhymes it in his sonorous way,—
   </p>
   <p>
    “From thence our kind hard-hearted is, enduring pain and care,
   </p>
   <p>
    Approving that our bodies of a stony nature are.”
   </p>
   <p>
    So much for a blind obedience to a blundering oracle, throwing the
   </p>
   <p>
    stones over their heads behind them, and not seeing where they fell.
   </p>
   <p>
    Most men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere
   </p>
   <p>
    ignorance and mistake, are so occupied with the factitious cares and
   </p>
   <p>
    superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be
   </p>
   <p>
    plucked by them. Their fingers, from excessive toil, are too clumsy and
   </p>
   <p>
    tremble too much for that. Actually, the laboring man has not leisure
   </p>
   <p>
    for a true integrity day by day; he cannot afford to sustain the
   </p>
   <p>
    manliest relations to men; his labor would be depreciated in the
   </p>
   <p>
    market. He has no time to be anything but a machine. How can he
   </p>
   <p>
    remember well his ignorance—which his growth requires—who has so often
   </p>
   <p>
    to use his knowledge? We should feed and clothe him gratuitously
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes, and recruit him with our cordials, before we judge of him.
   </p>
   <p>
    The finest qualities of our nature, like the bloom on fruits, can be
   </p>
   <p>
    preserved only by the most delicate handling. Yet we do not treat
   </p>
   <p>
    ourselves nor one another thus tenderly.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some of you, we all know, are poor, find it hard to live, are
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes, as it were, gasping for breath. I have no doubt that some of
   </p>
   <p>
    you who read this book are unable to pay for all the dinners which you
   </p>
   <p>
    have actually eaten, or for the coats and shoes which are fast wearing
   </p>
   <p>
    or are already worn out, and have come to this page to spend borrowed
   </p>
   <p>
    or stolen time, robbing your creditors of an hour. It is very evident
   </p>
   <p>
    what mean and sneaking lives many of you live, for my sight has been
   </p>
   <p>
    whetted by experience; always on the limits, trying to get into
   </p>
   <p>
    business and trying to get out of debt, a very ancient slough, called
   </p>
   <p>
    by the Latins _æs alienum_, another’s brass, for some of their coins
   </p>
   <p>
    were made of brass; still living, and dying, and buried by this other’s
   </p>
   <p>
    brass; always promising to pay, promising to pay, tomorrow, and dying
   </p>
   <p>
    today, insolvent; seeking to curry favor, to get custom, by how many
   </p>
   <p>
    modes, only not state-prison offences; lying, flattering, voting,
   </p>
   <p>
    contracting yourselves into a nutshell of civility or dilating into an
   </p>
   <p>
    atmosphere of thin and vaporous generosity, that you may persuade your
   </p>
   <p>
    neighbor to let you make his shoes, or his hat, or his coat, or his
   </p>
   <p>
    carriage, or import his groceries for him; making yourselves sick, that
   </p>
   <p>
    you may lay up something against a sick day, something to be tucked
   </p>
   <p>
    away in an old chest, or in a stocking behind the plastering, or, more
   </p>
   <p>
    safely, in the brick bank; no matter where, no matter how much or how
   </p>
   <p>
    little.
   </p>
   <p>
    I sometimes wonder that we can be so frivolous, I may almost say, as to
   </p>
   <p>
    attend to the gross but somewhat foreign form of servitude called Negro
   </p>
   <p>
    Slavery, there are so many keen and subtle masters that enslave both
   </p>
   <p>
    north and south. It is hard to have a southern overseer; it is worse to
   </p>
   <p>
    have a northern one; but worst of all when you are the slave-driver of
   </p>
   <p>
    yourself. Talk of a divinity in man! Look at the teamster on the
   </p>
   <p>
    highway, wending to market by day or night; does any divinity stir
   </p>
   <p>
    within him? His highest duty to fodder and water his horses! What is
   </p>
   <p>
    his destiny to him compared with the shipping interests? Does not he
   </p>
   <p>
    drive for Squire Make-a-stir? How godlike, how immortal, is he? See how
   </p>
   <p>
    he cowers and sneaks, how vaguely all the day he fears, not being
   </p>
   <p>
    immortal nor divine, but the slave and prisoner of his own opinion of
   </p>
   <p>
    himself, a fame won by his own deeds. Public opinion is a weak tyrant
   </p>
   <p>
    compared with our own private opinion. What a man thinks of himself,
   </p>
   <p>
    that it is which determines, or rather indicates, his fate.
   </p>
   <p>
    Self-emancipation even in the West Indian provinces of the fancy and
   </p>
   <p>
    imagination,—what Wilberforce is there to bring that about? Think,
   </p>
   <p>
    also, of the ladies of the land weaving toilet cushions against the
   </p>
   <p>
    last day, not to betray too green an interest in their fates! As if you
   </p>
   <p>
    could kill time without injuring eternity.
   </p>
   <p>
    The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called
   </p>
   <p>
    resignation is confirmed desperation. From the desperate city you go
   </p>
   <p>
    into the desperate country, and have to console yourself with the
   </p>
   <p>
    bravery of minks and muskrats. A stereotyped but unconscious despair is
   </p>
   <p>
    concealed even under what are called the games and amusements of
   </p>
   <p>
    mankind. There is no play in them, for this comes after work. But it is
   </p>
   <p>
    a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things.
   </p>
   <p>
    When we consider what, to use the words of the catechism, is the chief
   </p>
   <p>
    end of man, and what are the true necessaries and means of life, it
   </p>
   <p>
    appears as if men had deliberately chosen the common mode of living
   </p>
   <p>
    because they preferred it to any other. Yet they honestly think there
   </p>
   <p>
    is no choice left. But alert and healthy natures remember that the sun
   </p>
   <p>
    rose clear. It is never too late to give up our prejudices. No way of
   </p>
   <p>
    thinking or doing, however ancient, can be trusted without proof. What
   </p>
   <p>
    everybody echoes or in silence passes by as true to-day may turn out to
   </p>
   <p>
    be falsehood to-morrow, mere smoke of opinion, which some had trusted
   </p>
   <p>
    for a cloud that would sprinkle fertilizing rain on their fields. What
   </p>
   <p>
    old people say you cannot do you try and find that you can. Old deeds
   </p>
   <p>
    for old people, and new deeds for new. Old people did not know enough
   </p>
   <p>
    once, perchance, to fetch fresh fuel to keep the fire a-going; new
   </p>
   <p>
    people put a little dry wood under a pot, and are whirled round the
   </p>
   <p>
    globe with the speed of birds, in a way to kill old people, as the
   </p>
   <p>
    phrase is. Age is no better, hardly so well, qualified for an
   </p>
   <p>
    instructor as youth, for it has not profited so much as it has lost.
   </p>
   <p>
    One may almost doubt if the wisest man has learned any thing of
   </p>
   <p>
    absolute value by living. Practically, the old have no very important
   </p>
   <p>
    advice to give the young, their own experience has been so partial, and
   </p>
   <p>
    their lives have been such miserable failures, for private reasons, as
   </p>
   <p>
    they must believe; and it may be that they have some faith left which
   </p>
   <p>
    belies that experience, and they are only less young than they were. I
   </p>
   <p>
    have lived some thirty years on this planet, and I have yet to hear the
   </p>
   <p>
    first syllable of valuable or even earnest advice from my seniors. They
   </p>
   <p>
    have told me nothing, and probably cannot tell me any thing to the
   </p>
   <p>
    purpose. Here is life, an experiment to a great extent untried by me;
   </p>
   <p>
    but it does not avail me that they have tried it. If I have any
   </p>
   <p>
    experience which I think valuable, I am sure to reflect that this my
   </p>
   <p>
    Mentors said nothing about.
   </p>
   <p>
    One farmer says to me, “You cannot live on vegetable food solely, for
   </p>
   <p>
    it furnishes nothing to make bones with;” and so he religiously devotes
   </p>
   <p>
    a part of his day to supplying his system with the raw material of
   </p>
   <p>
    bones; walking all the while he talks behind his oxen, which, with
   </p>
   <p>
    vegetable-made bones, jerk him and his lumbering plough along in spite
   </p>
   <p>
    of every obstacle. Some things are really necessaries of life in some
   </p>
   <p>
    circles, the most helpless and diseased, which in others are luxuries
   </p>
   <p>
    merely, and in others still are entirely unknown.
   </p>
   <p>
    The whole ground of human life seems to some to have been gone over by
   </p>
   <p>
    their predecessors, both the heights and the valleys, and all things to
   </p>
   <p>
    have been cared for. According to Evelyn, “the wise Solomon prescribed
   </p>
   <p>
    ordinances for the very distances of trees; and the Roman prætors have
   </p>
   <p>
    decided how often you may go into your neighbor’s land to gather the
   </p>
   <p>
    acorns which fall on it without trespass, and what share belongs to
   </p>
   <p>
    that neighbor.” Hippocrates has even left directions how we should cut
   </p>
   <p>
    our nails; that is, even with the ends of the fingers, neither shorter
   </p>
   <p>
    nor longer. Undoubtedly the very tedium and ennui which presume to have
   </p>
   <p>
    exhausted the variety and the joys of life are as old as Adam. But
   </p>
   <p>
    man’s capacities have never been measured; nor are we to judge of what
   </p>
   <p>
    he can do by any precedents, so little has been tried. Whatever have
   </p>
   <p>
    been thy failures hitherto, “be not afflicted, my child, for who shall
   </p>
   <p>
    assign to thee what thou hast left undone?”
   </p>
   <p>
    We might try our lives by a thousand simple tests; as, for instance,
   </p>
   <p>
    that the same sun which ripens my beans illumines at once a system of
   </p>
   <p>
    earths like ours. If I had remembered this it would have prevented some
   </p>
   <p>
    mistakes. This was not the light in which I hoed them. The stars are
   </p>
   <p>
    the apexes of what wonderful triangles! What distant and different
   </p>
   <p>
    beings in the various mansions of the universe are contemplating the
   </p>
   <p>
    same one at the same moment! Nature and human life are as various as
   </p>
   <p>
    our several constitutions. Who shall say what prospect life offers to
   </p>
   <p>
    another? Could a greater miracle take place than for us to look through
   </p>
   <p>
    each other’s eyes for an instant? We should live in all the ages of the
   </p>
   <p>
    world in an hour; ay, in all the worlds of the ages. History, Poetry,
   </p>
   <p>
    Mythology!—I know of no reading of another’s experience so startling
   </p>
   <p>
    and informing as this would be.
   </p>
   <p>
    The greater part of what my neighbors call good I believe in my soul to
   </p>
   <p>
    be bad, and if I repent of anything, it is very likely to be my good
   </p>
   <p>
    behavior. What demon possessed me that I behaved so well? You may say
   </p>
   <p>
    the wisest thing you can, old man,—you who have lived seventy years,
   </p>
   <p>
    not without honor of a kind,—I hear an irresistible voice which invites
   </p>
   <p>
    me away from all that. One generation abandons the enterprises of
   </p>
   <p>
    another like stranded vessels.
   </p>
   <p>
    I think that we may safely trust a good deal more than we do. We may
   </p>
   <p>
    waive just so much care of ourselves as we honestly bestow elsewhere.
   </p>
   <p>
    Nature is as well adapted to our weakness as to our strength. The
   </p>
   <p>
    incessant anxiety and strain of some is a well nigh incurable form of
   </p>
   <p>
    disease. We are made to exaggerate the importance of what work we do;
   </p>
   <p>
    and yet how much is not done by us! or, what if we had been taken sick?
   </p>
   <p>
    How vigilant we are! determined not to live by faith if we can avoid
   </p>
   <p>
    it; all the day long on the alert, at night we unwillingly say our
   </p>
   <p>
    prayers and commit ourselves to uncertainties. So thoroughly and
   </p>
   <p>
    sincerely are we compelled to live, reverencing our life, and denying
   </p>
   <p>
    the possibility of change. This is the only way, we say; but there are
   </p>
   <p>
    as many ways as there can be drawn radii from one centre. All change is
   </p>
   <p>
    a miracle to contemplate; but it is a miracle which is taking place
   </p>
   <p>
    every instant. Confucius said, “To know that we know what we know, and
   </p>
   <p>
    that we do not know what we do not know, that is true knowledge.” When
   </p>
   <p>
    one man has reduced a fact of the imagination to be a fact to his
   </p>
   <p>
    understanding, I foresee that all men at length establish their lives
   </p>
   <p>
    on that basis.
   </p>
   <p>
    Let us consider for a moment what most of the trouble and anxiety which
   </p>
   <p>
    I have referred to is about, and how much it is necessary that we be
   </p>
   <p>
    troubled, or, at least, careful. It would be some advantage to live a
   </p>
   <p>
    primitive and frontier life, though in the midst of an outward
   </p>
   <p>
    civilization, if only to learn what are the gross necessaries of life
   </p>
   <p>
    and what methods have been taken to obtain them; or even to look over
   </p>
   <p>
    the old day-books of the merchants, to see what it was that men most
   </p>
   <p>
    commonly bought at the stores, what they stored, that is, what are the
   </p>
   <p>
    grossest groceries. For the improvements of ages have had but little
   </p>
   <p>
    influence on the essential laws of man’s existence; as our skeletons,
   </p>
   <p>
    probably, are not to be distinguished from those of our ancestors.
   </p>
   <p>
    By the words, _necessary of life_, I mean whatever, of all that man
   </p>
   <p>
    obtains by his own exertions, has been from the first, or from long use
   </p>
   <p>
    has become, so important to human life that few, if any, whether from
   </p>
   <p>
    savageness, or poverty, or philosophy, ever attempt to do without it.
   </p>
   <p>
    To many creatures there is in this sense but one necessary of life,
   </p>
   <p>
    Food. To the bison of the prairie it is a few inches of palatable
   </p>
   <p>
    grass, with water to drink; unless he seeks the Shelter of the forest
   </p>
   <p>
    or the mountain’s shadow. None of the brute creation requires more than
   </p>
   <p>
    Food and Shelter. The necessaries of life for man in this climate may,
   </p>
   <p>
    accurately enough, be distributed under the several heads of Food,
   </p>
   <p>
    Shelter, Clothing, and Fuel; for not till we have secured these are we
   </p>
   <p>
    prepared to entertain the true problems of life with freedom and a
   </p>
   <p>
    prospect of success. Man has invented, not only houses, but clothes and
   </p>
   <p>
    cooked food; and possibly from the accidental discovery of the warmth
   </p>
   <p>
    of fire, and the consequent use of it, at first a luxury, arose the
   </p>
   <p>
    present necessity to sit by it. We observe cats and dogs acquiring the
   </p>
   <p>
    same second nature. By proper Shelter and Clothing we legitimately
   </p>
   <p>
    retain our own internal heat; but with an excess of these, or of Fuel,
   </p>
   <p>
    that is, with an external heat greater than our own internal, may not
   </p>
   <p>
    cookery properly be said to begin? Darwin, the naturalist, says of the
   </p>
   <p>
    inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego, that while his own party, who were
   </p>
   <p>
    well clothed and sitting close to a fire, were far from too warm, these
   </p>
   <p>
    naked savages, who were farther off, were observed, to his great
   </p>
   <p>
    surprise, “to be streaming with perspiration at undergoing such a
   </p>
   <p>
    roasting.” So, we are told, the New Hollander goes naked with impunity,
   </p>
   <p>
    while the European shivers in his clothes. Is it impossible to combine
   </p>
   <p>
    the hardiness of these savages with the intellectualness of the
   </p>
   <p>
    civilized man? According to Liebig, man’s body is a stove, and food the
   </p>
   <p>
    fuel which keeps up the internal combustion in the lungs. In cold
   </p>
   <p>
    weather we eat more, in warm less. The animal heat is the result of a
   </p>
   <p>
    slow combustion, and disease and death take place when this is too
   </p>
   <p>
    rapid; or for want of fuel, or from some defect in the draught, the
   </p>
   <p>
    fire goes out. Of course the vital heat is not to be confounded with
   </p>
   <p>
    fire; but so much for analogy. It appears, therefore, from the above
   </p>
   <p>
    list, that the expression, _animal life_, is nearly synonymous with the
   </p>
   <p>
    expression, _animal heat_; for while Food may be regarded as the Fuel
   </p>
   <p>
    which keeps up the fire within us,—and Fuel serves only to prepare that
   </p>
   <p>
    Food or to increase the warmth of our bodies by addition from
   </p>
   <p>
    without,—Shelter and Clothing also serve only to retain the _heat_ thus
   </p>
   <p>
    generated and absorbed.
   </p>
   <p>
    The grand necessity, then, for our bodies, is to keep warm, to keep the
   </p>
   <p>
    vital heat in us. What pains we accordingly take, not only with our
   </p>
   <p>
    Food, and Clothing, and Shelter, but with our beds, which are our
   </p>
   <p>
    night-clothes, robbing the nests and breasts of birds to prepare this
   </p>
   <p>
    shelter within a shelter, as the mole has its bed of grass and leaves
   </p>
   <p>
    at the end of its burrow! The poor man is wont to complain that this is
   </p>
   <p>
    a cold world; and to cold, no less physical than social, we refer
   </p>
   <p>
    directly a great part of our ails. The summer, in some climates, makes
   </p>
   <p>
    possible to man a sort of Elysian life. Fuel, except to cook his Food,
   </p>
   <p>
    is then unnecessary; the sun is his fire, and many of the fruits are
   </p>
   <p>
    sufficiently cooked by its rays; while Food generally is more various,
   </p>
   <p>
    and more easily obtained, and Clothing and Shelter are wholly or half
   </p>
   <p>
    unnecessary. At the present day, and in this country, as I find by my
   </p>
   <p>
    own experience, a few implements, a knife, an axe, a spade, a
   </p>
   <p>
    wheelbarrow, &amp;c., and for the studious, lamplight, stationery, and
   </p>
   <p>
    access to a few books, rank next to necessaries, and can all be
   </p>
   <p>
    obtained at a trifling cost. Yet some, not wise, go to the other side
   </p>
   <p>
    of the globe, to barbarous and unhealthy regions, and devote themselves
   </p>
   <p>
    to trade for ten or twenty years, in order that they may live,—that is,
   </p>
   <p>
    keep comfortably warm,—and die in New England at last. The luxuriously
   </p>
   <p>
    rich are not simply kept comfortably warm, but unnaturally hot; as I
   </p>
   <p>
    implied before, they are cooked, of course _à la mode_.
   </p>
   <p>
    Most of the luxuries, and many of the so called comforts of life, are
   </p>
   <p>
    not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of
   </p>
   <p>
    mankind. With respect to luxuries and comforts, the wisest have ever
   </p>
   <p>
    lived a more simple and meagre life than the poor. The ancient
   </p>
   <p>
    philosophers, Chinese, Hindoo, Persian, and Greek, were a class than
   </p>
   <p>
    which none has been poorer in outward riches, none so rich in inward.
   </p>
   <p>
    We know not much about them. It is remarkable that _we_ know so much of
   </p>
   <p>
    them as we do. The same is true of the more modern reformers and
   </p>
   <p>
    benefactors of their race. None can be an impartial or wise observer of
   </p>
   <p>
    human life but from the vantage ground of what we should call voluntary
   </p>
   <p>
    poverty. Of a life of luxury the fruit is luxury, whether in
   </p>
   <p>
    agriculture, or commerce, or literature, or art. There are nowadays
   </p>
   <p>
    professors of philosophy, but not philosophers. Yet it is admirable to
   </p>
   <p>
    profess because it was once admirable to live. To be a philosopher is
   </p>
   <p>
    not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so
   </p>
   <p>
    to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of
   </p>
   <p>
    simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to solve some
   </p>
   <p>
    of the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically. The
   </p>
   <p>
    success of great scholars and thinkers is commonly a courtier-like
   </p>
   <p>
    success, not kingly, not manly. They make shift to live merely by
   </p>
   <p>
    conformity, practically as their fathers did, and are in no sense the
   </p>
   <p>
    progenitors of a nobler race of men. But why do men degenerate ever?
   </p>
   <p>
    What makes families run out? What is the nature of the luxury which
   </p>
   <p>
    enervates and destroys nations? Are we sure that there is none of it in
   </p>
   <p>
    our own lives? The philosopher is in advance of his age even in the
   </p>
   <p>
    outward form of his life. He is not fed, sheltered, clothed, warmed,
   </p>
   <p>
    like his contemporaries. How can a man be a philosopher and not
   </p>
   <p>
    maintain his vital heat by better methods than other men?
   </p>
   <p>
    When a man is warmed by the several modes which I have described, what
   </p>
   <p>
    does he want next? Surely not more warmth of the same kind, as more and
   </p>
   <p>
    richer food, larger and more splendid houses, finer and more abundant
   </p>
   <p>
    clothing, more numerous incessant and hotter fires, and the like. When
   </p>
   <p>
    he has obtained those things which are necessary to life, there is
   </p>
   <p>
    another alternative than to obtain the superfluities; and that is, to
   </p>
   <p>
    adventure on life now, his vacation from humbler toil having commenced.
   </p>
   <p>
    The soil, it appears, is suited to the seed, for it has sent its
   </p>
   <p>
    radicle downward, and it may now send its shoot upward also with
   </p>
   <p>
    confidence. Why has man rooted himself thus firmly in the earth, but
   </p>
   <p>
    that he may rise in the same proportion into the heavens above?—for the
   </p>
   <p>
    nobler plants are valued for the fruit they bear at last in the air and
   </p>
   <p>
    light, far from the ground, and are not treated like the humbler
   </p>
   <p>
    esculents, which, though they may be biennials, are cultivated only
   </p>
   <p>
    till they have perfected their root, and often cut down at top for this
   </p>
   <p>
    purpose, so that most would not know them in their flowering season.
   </p>
   <p>
    I do not mean to prescribe rules to strong and valiant natures, who
   </p>
   <p>
    will mind their own affairs whether in heaven or hell, and perchance
   </p>
   <p>
    build more magnificently and spend more lavishly than the richest,
   </p>
   <p>
    without ever impoverishing themselves, not knowing how they live,—if,
   </p>
   <p>
    indeed, there are any such, as has been dreamed; nor to those who find
   </p>
   <p>
    their encouragement and inspiration in precisely the present condition
   </p>
   <p>
    of things, and cherish it with the fondness and enthusiasm of
   </p>
   <p>
    lovers,—and, to some extent, I reckon myself in this number; I do not
   </p>
   <p>
    speak to those who are well employed, in whatever circumstances, and
   </p>
   <p>
    they know whether they are well employed or not;—but mainly to the mass
   </p>
   <p>
    of men who are discontented, and idly complaining of the hardness of
   </p>
   <p>
    their lot or of the times, when they might improve them. There are some
   </p>
   <p>
    who complain most energetically and inconsolably of any, because they
   </p>
   <p>
    are, as they say, doing their duty. I also have in my mind that
   </p>
   <p>
    seemingly wealthy, but most terribly impoverished class of all, who
   </p>
   <p>
    have accumulated dross, but know not how to use it, or get rid of it,
   </p>
   <p>
    and thus have forged their own golden or silver fetters.
   </p>
   <p>
    If I should attempt to tell how I have desired to spend my life in
   </p>
   <p>
    years past, it would probably surprise those of my readers who are
   </p>
   <p>
    somewhat acquainted with its actual history; it would certainly
   </p>
   <p>
    astonish those who know nothing about it. I will only hint at some of
   </p>
   <p>
    the enterprises which I have cherished.
   </p>
   <p>
    In any weather, at any hour of the day or night, I have been anxious to
   </p>
   <p>
    improve the nick of time, and notch it on my stick too; to stand on the
   </p>
   <p>
    meeting of two eternities, the past and future, which is precisely the
   </p>
   <p>
    present moment; to toe that line. You will pardon some obscurities, for
   </p>
   <p>
    there are more secrets in my trade than in most men’s, and yet not
   </p>
   <p>
    voluntarily kept, but inseparable from its very nature. I would gladly
   </p>
   <p>
    tell all that I know about it, and never paint “No Admittance” on my
   </p>
   <p>
    gate.
   </p>
   <p>
    I long ago lost a hound, a bay horse, and a turtle-dove, and am still
   </p>
   <p>
    on their trail. Many are the travellers I have spoken concerning them,
   </p>
   <p>
    describing their tracks and what calls they answered to. I have met one
   </p>
   <p>
    or two who had heard the hound, and the tramp of the horse, and even
   </p>
   <p>
    seen the dove disappear behind a cloud, and they seemed as anxious to
   </p>
   <p>
    recover them as if they had lost them themselves.
   </p>
   <p>
    To anticipate, not the sunrise and the dawn merely, but, if possible,
   </p>
   <p>
    Nature herself! How many mornings, summer and winter, before yet any
   </p>
   <p>
    neighbor was stirring about his business, have I been about mine! No
   </p>
   <p>
    doubt, many of my townsmen have met me returning from this enterprise,
   </p>
   <p>
    farmers starting for Boston in the twilight, or woodchoppers going to
   </p>
   <p>
    their work. It is true, I never assisted the sun materially in his
   </p>
   <p>
    rising, but, doubt not, it was of the last importance only to be
   </p>
   <p>
    present at it.
   </p>
   <p>
    So many autumn, ay, and winter days, spent outside the town, trying to
   </p>
   <p>
    hear what was in the wind, to hear and carry it express! I well-nigh
   </p>
   <p>
    sunk all my capital in it, and lost my own breath into the bargain,
   </p>
   <p>
    running in the face of it. If it had concerned either of the political
   </p>
   <p>
    parties, depend upon it, it would have appeared in the Gazette with the
   </p>
   <p>
    earliest intelligence. At other times watching from the observatory of
   </p>
   <p>
    some cliff or tree, to telegraph any new arrival; or waiting at evening
   </p>
   <p>
    on the hill-tops for the sky to fall, that I might catch something,
   </p>
   <p>
    though I never caught much, and that, manna-wise, would dissolve again
   </p>
   <p>
    in the sun.
   </p>
   <p>
    For a long time I was reporter to a journal, of no very wide
   </p>
   <p>
    circulation, whose editor has never yet seen fit to print the bulk of
   </p>
   <p>
    my contributions, and, as is too common with writers, I got only my
   </p>
   <p>
    labor for my pains. However, in this case my pains were their own
   </p>
   <p>
    reward.
   </p>
   <p>
    For many years I was self-appointed inspector of snow storms and rain
   </p>
   <p>
    storms, and did my duty faithfully; surveyor, if not of highways, then
   </p>
   <p>
    of forest paths and all across-lot routes, keeping them open, and
   </p>
   <p>
    ravines bridged and passable at all seasons, where the public heel had
   </p>
   <p>
    testified to their utility.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have looked after the wild stock of the town, which give a faithful
   </p>
   <p>
    herdsman a good deal of trouble by leaping fences; and I have had an
   </p>
   <p>
    eye to the unfrequented nooks and corners of the farm; though I did not
   </p>
   <p>
    always know whether Jonas or Solomon worked in a particular field
   </p>
   <p>
    to-day; that was none of my business. I have watered the red
   </p>
   <p>
    huckleberry, the sand cherry and the nettle tree, the red pine and the
   </p>
   <p>
    black ash, the white grape and the yellow violet, which might have
   </p>
   <p>
    withered else in dry seasons.
   </p>
   <p>
    In short, I went on thus for a long time, I may say it without
   </p>
   <p>
    boasting, faithfully minding my business, till it became more and more
   </p>
   <p>
    evident that my townsmen would not after all admit me into the list of
   </p>
   <p>
    town officers, nor make my place a sinecure with a moderate allowance.
   </p>
   <p>
    My accounts, which I can swear to have kept faithfully, I have, indeed,
   </p>
   <p>
    never got audited, still less accepted, still less paid and settled.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, I have not set my heart on that.
   </p>
   <p>
    Not long since, a strolling Indian went to sell baskets at the house of
   </p>
   <p>
    a well-known lawyer in my neighborhood. “Do you wish to buy any
   </p>
   <p>
    baskets?” he asked. “No, we do not want any,” was the reply. “What!”
   </p>
   <p>
    exclaimed the Indian as he went out the gate, “do you mean to starve
   </p>
   <p>
    us?” Having seen his industrious white neighbors so well off,—that the
   </p>
   <p>
    lawyer had only to weave arguments, and by some magic, wealth and
   </p>
   <p>
    standing followed, he had said to himself; I will go into business; I
   </p>
   <p>
    will weave baskets; it is a thing which I can do. Thinking that when he
   </p>
   <p>
    had made the baskets he would have done his part, and then it would be
   </p>
   <p>
    the white man’s to buy them. He had not discovered that it was
   </p>
   <p>
    necessary for him to make it worth the other’s while to buy them, or at
   </p>
   <p>
    least make him think that it was so, or to make something else which it
   </p>
   <p>
    would be worth his while to buy. I too had woven a kind of basket of a
   </p>
   <p>
    delicate texture, but I had not made it worth any one’s while to buy
   </p>
   <p>
    them. Yet not the less, in my case, did I think it worth my while to
   </p>
   <p>
    weave them, and instead of studying how to make it worth men’s while to
   </p>
   <p>
    buy my baskets, I studied rather how to avoid the necessity of selling
   </p>
   <p>
    them. The life which men praise and regard as successful is but one
   </p>
   <p>
    kind. Why should we exaggerate any one kind at the expense of the
   </p>
   <p>
    others?
   </p>
   <p>
    Finding that my fellow-citizens were not likely to offer me any room in
   </p>
   <p>
    the court house, or any curacy or living any where else, but I must
   </p>
   <p>
    shift for myself, I turned my face more exclusively than ever to the
   </p>
   <p>
    woods, where I was better known. I determined to go into business at
   </p>
   <p>
    once, and not wait to acquire the usual capital, using such slender
   </p>
   <p>
    means as I had already got. My purpose in going to Walden Pond was not
   </p>
   <p>
    to live cheaply nor to live dearly there, but to transact some private
   </p>
   <p>
    business with the fewest obstacles; to be hindered from accomplishing
   </p>
   <p>
    which for want of a little common sense, a little enterprise and
   </p>
   <p>
    business talent, appeared not so sad as foolish.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have always endeavored to acquire strict business habits; they are
   </p>
   <p>
    indispensable to every man. If your trade is with the Celestial Empire,
   </p>
   <p>
    then some small counting house on the coast, in some Salem harbor, will
   </p>
   <p>
    be fixture enough. You will export such articles as the country
   </p>
   <p>
    affords, purely native products, much ice and pine timber and a little
   </p>
   <p>
    granite, always in native bottoms. These will be good ventures. To
   </p>
   <p>
    oversee all the details yourself in person; to be at once pilot and
   </p>
   <p>
    captain, and owner and underwriter; to buy and sell and keep the
   </p>
   <p>
    accounts; to read every letter received, and write or read every letter
   </p>
   <p>
    sent; to superintend the discharge of imports night and day; to be upon
   </p>
   <p>
    many parts of the coast almost at the same time;—often the richest
   </p>
   <p>
    freight will be discharged upon a Jersey shore;—to be your own
   </p>
   <p>
    telegraph, unweariedly sweeping the horizon, speaking all passing
   </p>
   <p>
    vessels bound coastwise; to keep up a steady despatch of commodities,
   </p>
   <p>
    for the supply of such a distant and exorbitant market; to keep
   </p>
   <p>
    yourself informed of the state of the markets, prospects of war and
   </p>
   <p>
    peace every where, and anticipate the tendencies of trade and
   </p>
   <p>
    civilization,—taking advantage of the results of all exploring
   </p>
   <p>
    expeditions, using new passages and all improvements in
   </p>
   <p>
    navigation;—charts to be studied, the position of reefs and new lights
   </p>
   <p>
    and buoys to be ascertained, and ever, and ever, the logarithmic tables
   </p>
   <p>
    to be corrected, for by the error of some calculator the vessel often
   </p>
   <p>
    splits upon a rock that should have reached a friendly pier,—there is
   </p>
   <p>
    the untold fate of La Perouse;—universal science to be kept pace with,
   </p>
   <p>
    studying the lives of all great discoverers and navigators, great
   </p>
   <p>
    adventurers and merchants, from Hanno and the Phœnicians down to our
   </p>
   <p>
    day; in fine, account of stock to be taken from time to time, to know
   </p>
   <p>
    how you stand. It is a labor to task the faculties of a man,—such
   </p>
   <p>
    problems of profit and loss, of interest, of tare and tret, and gauging
   </p>
   <p>
    of all kinds in it, as demand a universal knowledge.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have thought that Walden Pond would be a good place for business, not
   </p>
   <p>
    solely on account of the railroad and the ice trade; it offers
   </p>
   <p>
    advantages which it may not be good policy to divulge; it is a good
   </p>
   <p>
    port and a good foundation. No Neva marshes to be filled; though you
   </p>
   <p>
    must every where build on piles of your own driving. It is said that a
   </p>
   <p>
    flood-tide, with a westerly wind, and ice in the Neva, would sweep St.
   </p>
   <p>
    Petersburg from the face of the earth.
   </p>
   <p>
    As this business was to be entered into without the usual capital, it
   </p>
   <p>
    may not be easy to conjecture where those means, that will still be
   </p>
   <p>
    indispensable to every such undertaking, were to be obtained. As for
   </p>
   <p>
    Clothing, to come at once to the practical part of the question,
   </p>
   <p>
    perhaps we are led oftener by the love of novelty, and a regard for the
   </p>
   <p>
    opinions of men, in procuring it, than by a true utility. Let him who
   </p>
   <p>
    has work to do recollect that the object of clothing is, first, to
   </p>
   <p>
    retain the vital heat, and secondly, in this state of society, to cover
   </p>
   <p>
    nakedness, and he may judge how much of any necessary or important work
   </p>
   <p>
    may be accomplished without adding to his wardrobe. Kings and queens
   </p>
   <p>
    who wear a suit but once, though made by some tailor or dressmaker to
   </p>
   <p>
    their majesties, cannot know the comfort of wearing a suit that fits.
   </p>
   <p>
    They are no better than wooden horses to hang the clean clothes on.
   </p>
   <p>
    Every day our garments become more assimilated to ourselves, receiving
   </p>
   <p>
    the impress of the wearer’s character, until we hesitate to lay them
   </p>
   <p>
    aside, without such delay and medical appliances and some such
   </p>
   <p>
    solemnity even as our bodies. No man ever stood the lower in my
   </p>
   <p>
    estimation for having a patch in his clothes; yet I am sure that there
   </p>
   <p>
    is greater anxiety, commonly, to have fashionable, or at least clean
   </p>
   <p>
    and unpatched clothes, than to have a sound conscience. But even if the
   </p>
   <p>
    rent is not mended, perhaps the worst vice betrayed is improvidence. I
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes try my acquaintances by such tests as this;—who could wear a
   </p>
   <p>
    patch, or two extra seams only, over the knee? Most behave as if they
   </p>
   <p>
    believed that their prospects for life would be ruined if they should
   </p>
   <p>
    do it. It would be easier for them to hobble to town with a broken leg
   </p>
   <p>
    than with a broken pantaloon. Often if an accident happens to a
   </p>
   <p>
    gentleman’s legs, they can be mended; but if a similar accident happens
   </p>
   <p>
    to the legs of his pantaloons, there is no help for it; for he
   </p>
   <p>
    considers, not what is truly respectable, but what is respected. We
   </p>
   <p>
    know but few men, a great many coats and breeches. Dress a scarecrow in
   </p>
   <p>
    your last shift, you standing shiftless by, who would not soonest
   </p>
   <p>
    salute the scarecrow? Passing a cornfield the other day, close by a hat
   </p>
   <p>
    and coat on a stake, I recognized the owner of the farm. He was only a
   </p>
   <p>
    little more weather-beaten than when I saw him last. I have heard of a
   </p>
   <p>
    dog that barked at every stranger who approached his master’s premises
   </p>
   <p>
    with clothes on, but was easily quieted by a naked thief. It is an
   </p>
   <p>
    interesting question how far men would retain their relative rank if
   </p>
   <p>
    they were divested of their clothes. Could you, in such a case, tell
   </p>
   <p>
    surely of any company of civilized men, which belonged to the most
   </p>
   <p>
    respected class? When Madam Pfeiffer, in her adventurous travels round
   </p>
   <p>
    the world, from east to west, had got so near home as Asiatic Russia,
   </p>
   <p>
    she says that she felt the necessity of wearing other than a travelling
   </p>
   <p>
    dress, when she went to meet the authorities, for she “was now in a
   </p>
   <p>
    civilized country, where —— — people are judged of by their clothes.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Even in our democratic New England towns the accidental possession of
   </p>
   <p>
    wealth, and its manifestation in dress and equipage alone, obtain for
   </p>
   <p>
    the possessor almost universal respect. But they yield such respect,
   </p>
   <p>
    numerous as they are, are so far heathen, and need to have a missionary
   </p>
   <p>
    sent to them. Beside, clothes introduced sewing, a kind of work which
   </p>
   <p>
    you may call endless; a woman’s dress, at least, is never done.
   </p>
   <p>
    A man who has at length found something to do will not need to get a
   </p>
   <p>
    new suit to do it in; for him the old will do, that has lain dusty in
   </p>
   <p>
    the garret for an indeterminate period. Old shoes will serve a hero
   </p>
   <p>
    longer than they have served his valet,—if a hero ever has a
   </p>
   <p>
    valet,—bare feet are older than shoes, and he can make them do. Only
   </p>
   <p>
    they who go to soirées and legislative halls must have new coats, coats
   </p>
   <p>
    to change as often as the man changes in them. But if my jacket and
   </p>
   <p>
    trousers, my hat and shoes, are fit to worship God in, they will do;
   </p>
   <p>
    will they not? Who ever saw his old clothes,—his old coat, actually
   </p>
   <p>
    worn out, resolved into its primitive elements, so that it was not a
   </p>
   <p>
    deed of charity to bestow it on some poor boy, by him perchance to be
   </p>
   <p>
    bestowed on some poorer still, or shall we say richer, who could do
   </p>
   <p>
    with less? I say, beware of all enterprises that require new clothes,
   </p>
   <p>
    and not rather a new wearer of clothes. If there is not a new man, how
   </p>
   <p>
    can the new clothes be made to fit? If you have any enterprise before
   </p>
   <p>
    you, try it in your old clothes. All men want, not something to _do
   </p>
   <p>
    with_, but something to _do_, or rather something to _be_. Perhaps we
   </p>
   <p>
    should never procure a new suit, however ragged or dirty the old, until
   </p>
   <p>
    we have so conducted, so enterprised or sailed in some way, that we
   </p>
   <p>
    feel like new men in the old, and that to retain it would be like
   </p>
   <p>
    keeping new wine in old bottles. Our moulting season, like that of the
   </p>
   <p>
    fowls, must be a crisis in our lives. The loon retires to solitary
   </p>
   <p>
    ponds to spend it. Thus also the snake casts its slough, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    caterpillar its wormy coat, by an internal industry and expansion; for
   </p>
   <p>
    clothes are but our outmost cuticle and mortal coil. Otherwise we shall
   </p>
   <p>
    be found sailing under false colors, and be inevitably cashiered at
   </p>
   <p>
    last by our own opinion, as well as that of mankind.
   </p>
   <p>
    We don garment after garment, as if we grew like exogenous plants by
   </p>
   <p>
    addition without. Our outside and often thin and fanciful clothes are
   </p>
   <p>
    our epidermis, or false skin, which partakes not of our life, and may
   </p>
   <p>
    be stripped off here and there without fatal injury; our thicker
   </p>
   <p>
    garments, constantly worn, are our cellular integument, or cortex; but
   </p>
   <p>
    our shirts are our liber or true bark, which cannot be removed without
   </p>
   <p>
    girdling and so destroying the man. I believe that all races at some
   </p>
   <p>
    seasons wear something equivalent to the shirt. It is desirable that a
   </p>
   <p>
    man be clad so simply that he can lay his hands on himself in the dark,
   </p>
   <p>
    and that he live in all respects so compactly and preparedly, that, if
   </p>
   <p>
    an enemy take the town, he can, like the old philosopher, walk out the
   </p>
   <p>
    gate empty-handed without anxiety. While one thick garment is, for most
   </p>
   <p>
    purposes, as good as three thin ones, and cheap clothing can be
   </p>
   <p>
    obtained at prices really to suit customers; while a thick coat can be
   </p>
   <p>
    bought for five dollars, which will last as many years, thick
   </p>
   <p>
    pantaloons for two dollars, cowhide boots for a dollar and a half a
   </p>
   <p>
    pair, a summer hat for a quarter of a dollar, and a winter cap for
   </p>
   <p>
    sixty-two and a half cents, or a better be made at home at a nominal
   </p>
   <p>
    cost, where is he so poor that, clad in such a suit, of _his own
   </p>
   <p>
    earning_, there will not be found wise men to do him reverence?
   </p>
   <p>
    When I ask for a garment of a particular form, my tailoress tells me
   </p>
   <p>
    gravely, “They do not make them so now,” not emphasizing the “They” at
   </p>
   <p>
    all, as if she quoted an authority as impersonal as the Fates, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    find it difficult to get made what I want, simply because she cannot
   </p>
   <p>
    believe that I mean what I say, that I am so rash. When I hear this
   </p>
   <p>
    oracular sentence, I am for a moment absorbed in thought, emphasizing
   </p>
   <p>
    to myself each word separately that I may come at the meaning of it,
   </p>
   <p>
    that I may find out by what degree of consanguinity _They_ are related
   </p>
   <p>
    to _me_, and what authority they may have in an affair which affects me
   </p>
   <p>
    so nearly; and, finally, I am inclined to answer her with equal
   </p>
   <p>
    mystery, and without any more emphasis of the “they,”—“It is true, they
   </p>
   <p>
    did not make them so recently, but they do now.” Of what use this
   </p>
   <p>
    measuring of me if she does not measure my character, but only the
   </p>
   <p>
    breadth of my shoulders, as it were a peg to hang the coat on? We
   </p>
   <p>
    worship not the Graces, nor the Parcæ, but Fashion. She spins and
   </p>
   <p>
    weaves and cuts with full authority. The head monkey at Paris puts on a
   </p>
   <p>
    traveller’s cap, and all the monkeys in America do the same. I
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes despair of getting anything quite simple and honest done in
   </p>
   <p>
    this world by the help of men. They would have to be passed through a
   </p>
   <p>
    powerful press first, to squeeze their old notions out of them, so that
   </p>
   <p>
    they would not soon get upon their legs again, and then there would be
   </p>
   <p>
    some one in the company with a maggot in his head, hatched from an egg
   </p>
   <p>
    deposited there nobody knows when, for not even fire kills these
   </p>
   <p>
    things, and you would have lost your labor. Nevertheless, we will not
   </p>
   <p>
    forget that some Egyptian wheat was handed down to us by a mummy.
   </p>
   <p>
    On the whole, I think that it cannot be maintained that dressing has in
   </p>
   <p>
    this or any country risen to the dignity of an art. At present men make
   </p>
   <p>
    shift to wear what they can get. Like shipwrecked sailors, they put on
   </p>
   <p>
    what they can find on the beach, and at a little distance, whether of
   </p>
   <p>
    space or time, laugh at each other’s masquerade. Every generation
   </p>
   <p>
    laughs at the old fashions, but follows religiously the new. We are
   </p>
   <p>
    amused at beholding the costume of Henry VIII., or Queen Elizabeth, as
   </p>
   <p>
    much as if it was that of the King and Queen of the Cannibal Islands.
   </p>
   <p>
    All costume off a man is pitiful or grotesque. It is only the serious
   </p>
   <p>
    eye peering from and the sincere life passed within it, which restrain
   </p>
   <p>
    laughter and consecrate the costume of any people. Let Harlequin be
   </p>
   <p>
    taken with a fit of the colic and his trappings will have to serve that
   </p>
   <p>
    mood too. When the soldier is hit by a cannon ball rags are as becoming
   </p>
   <p>
    as purple.
   </p>
   <p>
    The childish and savage taste of men and women for new patterns keeps
   </p>
   <p>
    how many shaking and squinting through kaleidoscopes that they may
   </p>
   <p>
    discover the particular figure which this generation requires today.
   </p>
   <p>
    The manufacturers have learned that this taste is merely whimsical. Of
   </p>
   <p>
    two patterns which differ only by a few threads more or less of a
   </p>
   <p>
    particular color, the one will be sold readily, the other lie on the
   </p>
   <p>
    shelf, though it frequently happens that after the lapse of a season
   </p>
   <p>
    the latter becomes the most fashionable. Comparatively, tattooing is
   </p>
   <p>
    not the hideous custom which it is called. It is not barbarous merely
   </p>
   <p>
    because the printing is skin-deep and unalterable.
   </p>
   <p>
    I cannot believe that our factory system is the best mode by which men
   </p>
   <p>
    may get clothing. The condition of the operatives is becoming every day
   </p>
   <p>
    more like that of the English; and it cannot be wondered at, since, as
   </p>
   <p>
    far as I have heard or observed, the principal object is, not that
   </p>
   <p>
    mankind may be well and honestly clad, but, unquestionably, that
   </p>
   <p>
    corporations may be enriched. In the long run men hit only what they
   </p>
   <p>
    aim at. Therefore, though they should fail immediately, they had better
   </p>
   <p>
    aim at something high.
   </p>
   <p>
    As for a Shelter, I will not deny that this is now a necessary of life,
   </p>
   <p>
    though there are instances of men having done without it for long
   </p>
   <p>
    periods in colder countries than this. Samuel Laing says that “the
   </p>
   <p>
    Laplander in his skin dress, and in a skin bag which he puts over his
   </p>
   <p>
    head and shoulders, will sleep night after night on the snow—in a
   </p>
   <p>
    degree of cold which would extinguish the life of one exposed to it in
   </p>
   <p>
    any woollen clothing.” He had seen them asleep thus. Yet he adds, “They
   </p>
   <p>
    are not hardier than other people.” But, probably, man did not live
   </p>
   <p>
    long on the earth without discovering the convenience which there is in
   </p>
   <p>
    a house, the domestic comforts, which phrase may have originally
   </p>
   <p>
    signified the satisfactions of the house more than of the family;
   </p>
   <p>
    though these must be extremely partial and occasional in those climates
   </p>
   <p>
    where the house is associated in our thoughts with winter or the rainy
   </p>
   <p>
    season chiefly, and two thirds of the year, except for a parasol, is
   </p>
   <p>
    unnecessary. In our climate, in the summer, it was formerly almost
   </p>
   <p>
    solely a covering at night. In the Indian gazettes a wigwam was the
   </p>
   <p>
    symbol of a day’s march, and a row of them cut or painted on the bark
   </p>
   <p>
    of a tree signified that so many times they had camped. Man was not
   </p>
   <p>
    made so large limbed and robust but that he must seek to narrow his
   </p>
   <p>
    world, and wall in a space such as fitted him. He was at first bare and
   </p>
   <p>
    out of doors; but though this was pleasant enough in serene and warm
   </p>
   <p>
    weather, by daylight, the rainy season and the winter, to say nothing
   </p>
   <p>
    of the torrid sun, would perhaps have nipped his race in the bud if he
   </p>
   <p>
    had not made haste to clothe himself with the shelter of a house. Adam
   </p>
   <p>
    and Eve, according to the fable, wore the bower before other clothes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Man wanted a home, a place of warmth, or comfort, first of physical
   </p>
   <p>
    warmth, then the warmth of the affections.
   </p>
   <p>
    We may imagine a time when, in the infancy of the human race, some
   </p>
   <p>
    enterprising mortal crept into a hollow in a rock for shelter. Every
   </p>
   <p>
    child begins the world again, to some extent, and loves to stay out
   </p>
   <p>
    doors, even in wet and cold. It plays house, as well as horse, having
   </p>
   <p>
    an instinct for it. Who does not remember the interest with which when
   </p>
   <p>
    young he looked at shelving rocks, or any approach to a cave? It was
   </p>
   <p>
    the natural yearning of that portion of our most primitive ancestor
   </p>
   <p>
    which still survived in us. From the cave we have advanced to roofs of
   </p>
   <p>
    palm leaves, of bark and boughs, of linen woven and stretched, of grass
   </p>
   <p>
    and straw, of boards and shingles, of stones and tiles. At last, we
   </p>
   <p>
    know not what it is to live in the open air, and our lives are domestic
   </p>
   <p>
    in more senses than we think. From the hearth to the field is a great
   </p>
   <p>
    distance. It would be well perhaps if we were to spend more of our days
   </p>
   <p>
    and nights without any obstruction between us and the celestial bodies,
   </p>
   <p>
    if the poet did not speak so much from under a roof, or the saint dwell
   </p>
   <p>
    there so long. Birds do not sing in caves, nor do doves cherish their
   </p>
   <p>
    innocence in dovecots.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, if one designs to construct a dwelling house, it behooves him
   </p>
   <p>
    to exercise a little Yankee shrewdness, lest after all he find himself
   </p>
   <p>
    in a workhouse, a labyrinth without a clue, a museum, an almshouse, a
   </p>
   <p>
    prison, or a splendid mausoleum instead. Consider first how slight a
   </p>
   <p>
    shelter is absolutely necessary. I have seen Penobscot Indians, in this
   </p>
   <p>
    town, living in tents of thin cotton cloth, while the snow was nearly a
   </p>
   <p>
    foot deep around them, and I thought that they would be glad to have it
   </p>
   <p>
    deeper to keep out the wind. Formerly, when how to get my living
   </p>
   <p>
    honestly, with freedom left for my proper pursuits, was a question
   </p>
   <p>
    which vexed me even more than it does now, for unfortunately I am
   </p>
   <p>
    become somewhat callous, I used to see a large box by the railroad, six
   </p>
   <p>
    feet long by three wide, in which the laborers locked up their tools at
   </p>
   <p>
    night, and it suggested to me that every man who was hard pushed might
   </p>
   <p>
    get such a one for a dollar, and, having bored a few auger holes in it,
   </p>
   <p>
    to admit the air at least, get into it when it rained and at night, and
   </p>
   <p>
    hook down the lid, and so have freedom in his love, and in his soul be
   </p>
   <p>
    free. This did not appear the worst, nor by any means a despicable
   </p>
   <p>
    alternative. You could sit up as late as you pleased, and, whenever you
   </p>
   <p>
    got up, go abroad without any landlord or house-lord dogging you for
   </p>
   <p>
    rent. Many a man is harassed to death to pay the rent of a larger and
   </p>
   <p>
    more luxurious box who would not have frozen to death in such a box as
   </p>
   <p>
    this. I am far from jesting. Economy is a subject which admits of being
   </p>
   <p>
    treated with levity, but it cannot so be disposed of. A comfortable
   </p>
   <p>
    house for a rude and hardy race, that lived mostly out of doors, was
   </p>
   <p>
    once made here almost entirely of such materials as Nature furnished
   </p>
   <p>
    ready to their hands. Gookin, who was superintendent of the Indians
   </p>
   <p>
    subject to the Massachusetts Colony, writing in 1674, says, “The best
   </p>
   <p>
    of their houses are covered very neatly, tight and warm, with barks of
   </p>
   <p>
    trees, slipped from their bodies at those seasons when the sap is up,
   </p>
   <p>
    and made into great flakes, with pressure of weighty timber, when they
   </p>
   <p>
    are green.... The meaner sort are covered with mats which they make of
   </p>
   <p>
    a kind of bulrush, and are also indifferently tight and warm, but not
   </p>
   <p>
    so good as the former.... Some I have seen, sixty or a hundred feet
   </p>
   <p>
    long and thirty feet broad.... I have often lodged in their wigwams,
   </p>
   <p>
    and found them as warm as the best English houses.” He adds, that they
   </p>
   <p>
    were commonly carpeted and lined within with well-wrought embroidered
   </p>
   <p>
    mats, and were furnished with various utensils. The Indians had
   </p>
   <p>
    advanced so far as to regulate the effect of the wind by a mat
   </p>
   <p>
    suspended over the hole in the roof and moved by a string. Such a lodge
   </p>
   <p>
    was in the first instance constructed in a day or two at most, and
   </p>
   <p>
    taken down and put up in a few hours; and every family owned one, or
   </p>
   <p>
    its apartment in one.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the savage state every family owns a shelter as good as the best,
   </p>
   <p>
    and sufficient for its coarser and simpler wants; but I think that I
   </p>
   <p>
    speak within bounds when I say that, though the birds of the air have
   </p>
   <p>
    their nests, and the foxes their holes, and the savages their wigwams,
   </p>
   <p>
    in modern civilized society not more than one half the families own a
   </p>
   <p>
    shelter. In the large towns and cities, where civilization especially
   </p>
   <p>
    prevails, the number of those who own a shelter is a very small
   </p>
   <p>
    fraction of the whole. The rest pay an annual tax for this outside
   </p>
   <p>
    garment of all, become indispensable summer and winter, which would buy
   </p>
   <p>
    a village of Indian wigwams, but now helps to keep them poor as long as
   </p>
   <p>
    they live. I do not mean to insist here on the disadvantage of hiring
   </p>
   <p>
    compared with owning, but it is evident that the savage owns his
   </p>
   <p>
    shelter because it costs so little, while the civilized man hires his
   </p>
   <p>
    commonly because he cannot afford to own it; nor can he, in the long
   </p>
   <p>
    run, any better afford to hire. But, answers one, by merely paying this
   </p>
   <p>
    tax the poor civilized man secures an abode which is a palace compared
   </p>
   <p>
    with the savage’s. An annual rent of from twenty-five to a hundred
   </p>
   <p>
    dollars, these are the country rates, entitles him to the benefit of
   </p>
   <p>
    the improvements of centuries, spacious apartments, clean paint and
   </p>
   <p>
    paper, Rumford fireplace, back plastering, Venetian blinds, copper
   </p>
   <p>
    pump, spring lock, a commodious cellar, and many other things. But how
   </p>
   <p>
    happens it that he who is said to enjoy these things is so commonly a
   </p>
   <p>
    _poor_ civilized man, while the savage, who has them not, is rich as a
   </p>
   <p>
    savage? If it is asserted that civilization is a real advance in the
   </p>
   <p>
    condition of man,—and I think that it is, though only the wise improve
   </p>
   <p>
    their advantages,—it must be shown that it has produced better
   </p>
   <p>
    dwellings without making them more costly; and the cost of a thing is
   </p>
   <p>
    the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged
   </p>
   <p>
    for it, immediately or in the long run. An average house in this
   </p>
   <p>
    neighborhood costs perhaps eight hundred dollars, and to lay up this
   </p>
   <p>
    sum will take from ten to fifteen years of the laborer’s life, even if
   </p>
   <p>
    he is not encumbered with a family;—estimating the pecuniary value of
   </p>
   <p>
    every man’s labor at one dollar a day, for if some receive more, others
   </p>
   <p>
    receive less;—so that he must have spent more than half his life
   </p>
   <p>
    commonly before _his_ wigwam will be earned. If we suppose him to pay a
   </p>
   <p>
    rent instead, this is but a doubtful choice of evils. Would the savage
   </p>
   <p>
    have been wise to exchange his wigwam for a palace on these terms?
   </p>
   <p>
    It may be guessed that I reduce almost the whole advantage of holding
   </p>
   <p>
    this superfluous property as a fund in store against the future, so far
   </p>
   <p>
    as the individual is concerned, mainly to the defraying of funeral
   </p>
   <p>
    expenses. But perhaps a man is not required to bury himself.
   </p>
   <p>
    Nevertheless this points to an important distinction between the
   </p>
   <p>
    civilized man and the savage; and, no doubt, they have designs on us
   </p>
   <p>
    for our benefit, in making the life of a civilized people an
   </p>
   <p>
    _institution_, in which the life of the individual is to a great extent
   </p>
   <p>
    absorbed, in order to preserve and perfect that of the race. But I wish
   </p>
   <p>
    to show at what a sacrifice this advantage is at present obtained, and
   </p>
   <p>
    to suggest that we may possibly so live as to secure all the advantage
   </p>
   <p>
    without suffering any of the disadvantage. What mean ye by saying that
   </p>
   <p>
    the poor ye have always with you, or that the fathers have eaten sour
   </p>
   <p>
    grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge?
   </p>
   <p>
    “As I live, saith the Lord God, ye shall not have occasion any more to
   </p>
   <p>
    use this proverb in Israel.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Behold all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul
   </p>
   <p>
    of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.”
   </p>
   <p>
    When I consider my neighbors, the farmers of Concord, who are at least
   </p>
   <p>
    as well off as the other classes, I find that for the most part they
   </p>
   <p>
    have been toiling twenty, thirty, or forty years, that they may become
   </p>
   <p>
    the real owners of their farms, which commonly they have inherited with
   </p>
   <p>
    encumbrances, or else bought with hired money,—and we may regard one
   </p>
   <p>
    third of that toil as the cost of their houses,—but commonly they have
   </p>
   <p>
    not paid for them yet. It is true, the encumbrances sometimes outweigh
   </p>
   <p>
    the value of the farm, so that the farm itself becomes one great
   </p>
   <p>
    encumbrance, and still a man is found to inherit it, being well
   </p>
   <p>
    acquainted with it, as he says. On applying to the assessors, I am
   </p>
   <p>
    surprised to learn that they cannot at once name a dozen in the town
   </p>
   <p>
    who own their farms free and clear. If you would know the history of
   </p>
   <p>
    these homesteads, inquire at the bank where they are mortgaged. The man
   </p>
   <p>
    who has actually paid for his farm with labor on it is so rare that
   </p>
   <p>
    every neighbor can point to him. I doubt if there are three such men in
   </p>
   <p>
    Concord. What has been said of the merchants, that a very large
   </p>
   <p>
    majority, even ninety-seven in a hundred, are sure to fail, is equally
   </p>
   <p>
    true of the farmers. With regard to the merchants, however, one of them
   </p>
   <p>
    says pertinently that a great part of their failures are not genuine
   </p>
   <p>
    pecuniary failures, but merely failures to fulfil their engagements,
   </p>
   <p>
    because it is inconvenient; that is, it is the moral character that
   </p>
   <p>
    breaks down. But this puts an infinitely worse face on the matter, and
   </p>
   <p>
    suggests, beside, that probably not even the other three succeed in
   </p>
   <p>
    saving their souls, but are perchance bankrupt in a worse sense than
   </p>
   <p>
    they who fail honestly. Bankruptcy and repudiation are the springboards
   </p>
   <p>
    from which much of our civilization vaults and turns its somersets, but
   </p>
   <p>
    the savage stands on the unelastic plank of famine. Yet the Middlesex
   </p>
   <p>
    Cattle Show goes off here with _éclat_ annually, as if all the joints
   </p>
   <p>
    of the agricultural machine were suent.
   </p>
   <p>
    The farmer is endeavoring to solve the problem of a livelihood by a
   </p>
   <p>
    formula more complicated than the problem itself. To get his
   </p>
   <p>
    shoestrings he speculates in herds of cattle. With consummate skill he
   </p>
   <p>
    has set his trap with a hair spring to catch comfort and independence,
   </p>
   <p>
    and then, as he turned away, got his own leg into it. This is the
   </p>
   <p>
    reason he is poor; and for a similar reason we are all poor in respect
   </p>
   <p>
    to a thousand savage comforts, though surrounded by luxuries. As
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapman sings,—
   </p>
   <p>
    “The false society of men—
   </p>
   <p>
    —for earthly greatness
   </p>
   <p>
    All heavenly comforts rarefies to air.”
   </p>
   <p>
    And when the farmer has got his house, he may not be the richer but the
   </p>
   <p>
    poorer for it, and it be the house that has got him. As I understand
   </p>
   <p>
    it, that was a valid objection urged by Momus against the house which
   </p>
   <p>
    Minerva made, that she “had not made it movable, by which means a bad
   </p>
   <p>
    neighborhood might be avoided;” and it may still be urged, for our
   </p>
   <p>
    houses are such unwieldy property that we are often imprisoned rather
   </p>
   <p>
    than housed in them; and the bad neighborhood to be avoided is our own
   </p>
   <p>
    scurvy selves. I know one or two families, at least, in this town, who,
   </p>
   <p>
    for nearly a generation, have been wishing to sell their houses in the
   </p>
   <p>
    outskirts and move into the village, but have not been able to
   </p>
   <p>
    accomplish it, and only death will set them free.
   </p>
   <p>
    Granted that the _majority_ are able at last either to own or hire the
   </p>
   <p>
    modern house with all its improvements. While civilization has been
   </p>
   <p>
    improving our houses, it has not equally improved the men who are to
   </p>
   <p>
    inhabit them. It has created palaces, but it was not so easy to create
   </p>
   <p>
    noblemen and kings. And _if the civilized man’s pursuits are no
   </p>
   <p>
    worthier than the savage’s, if he is employed the greater part of his
   </p>
   <p>
    life in obtaining gross necessaries and comforts merely, why should he
   </p>
   <p>
    have a better dwelling than the former?_
   </p>
   <p>
    But how do the poor minority fare? Perhaps it will be found, that just
   </p>
   <p>
    in proportion as some have been placed in outward circumstances above
   </p>
   <p>
    the savage, others have been degraded below him. The luxury of one
   </p>
   <p>
    class is counterbalanced by the indigence of another. On the one side
   </p>
   <p>
    is the palace, on the other are the almshouse and “silent poor.” The
   </p>
   <p>
    myriads who built the pyramids to be the tombs of the Pharaohs were fed
   </p>
   <p>
    on garlic, and it may be were not decently buried themselves. The mason
   </p>
   <p>
    who finishes the cornice of the palace returns at night perchance to a
   </p>
   <p>
    hut not so good as a wigwam. It is a mistake to suppose that, in a
   </p>
   <p>
    country where the usual evidences of civilization exist, the condition
   </p>
   <p>
    of a very large body of the inhabitants may not be as degraded as that
   </p>
   <p>
    of savages. I refer to the degraded poor, not now to the degraded rich.
   </p>
   <p>
    To know this I should not need to look farther than to the shanties
   </p>
   <p>
    which every where border our railroads, that last improvement in
   </p>
   <p>
    civilization; where I see in my daily walks human beings living in
   </p>
   <p>
    sties, and all winter with an open door, for the sake of light, without
   </p>
   <p>
    any visible, often imaginable, wood pile, and the forms of both old and
   </p>
   <p>
    young are permanently contracted by the long habit of shrinking from
   </p>
   <p>
    cold and misery, and the development of all their limbs and faculties
   </p>
   <p>
    is checked. It certainly is fair to look at that class by whose labor
   </p>
   <p>
    the works which distinguish this generation are accomplished. Such too,
   </p>
   <p>
    to a greater or less extent, is the condition of the operatives of
   </p>
   <p>
    every denomination in England, which is the great workhouse of the
   </p>
   <p>
    world. Or I could refer you to Ireland, which is marked as one of the
   </p>
   <p>
    white or enlightened spots on the map. Contrast the physical condition
   </p>
   <p>
    of the Irish with that of the North American Indian, or the South Sea
   </p>
   <p>
    Islander, or any other savage race before it was degraded by contact
   </p>
   <p>
    with the civilized man. Yet I have no doubt that that people’s rulers
   </p>
   <p>
    are as wise as the average of civilized rulers. Their condition only
   </p>
   <p>
    proves what squalidness may consist with civilization. I hardly need
   </p>
   <p>
    refer now to the laborers in our Southern States who produce the staple
   </p>
   <p>
    exports of this country, and are themselves a staple production of the
   </p>
   <p>
    South. But to confine myself to those who are said to be in _moderate_
   </p>
   <p>
    circumstances.
   </p>
   <p>
    Most men appear never to have considered what a house is, and are
   </p>
   <p>
    actually though needlessly poor all their lives because they think that
   </p>
   <p>
    they must have such a one as their neighbors have. As if one were to
   </p>
   <p>
    wear any sort of coat which the tailor might cut out for him, or,
   </p>
   <p>
    gradually leaving off palmleaf hat or cap of woodchuck skin, complain
   </p>
   <p>
    of hard times because he could not afford to buy him a crown! It is
   </p>
   <p>
    possible to invent a house still more convenient and luxurious than we
   </p>
   <p>
    have, which yet all would admit that man could not afford to pay for.
   </p>
   <p>
    Shall we always study to obtain more of these things, and not sometimes
   </p>
   <p>
    to be content with less? Shall the respectable citizen thus gravely
   </p>
   <p>
    teach, by precept and example, the necessity of the young man’s
   </p>
   <p>
    providing a certain number of superfluous glow-shoes, and umbrellas,
   </p>
   <p>
    and empty guest chambers for empty guests, before he dies? Why should
   </p>
   <p>
    not our furniture be as simple as the Arab’s or the Indian’s? When I
   </p>
   <p>
    think of the benefactors of the race, whom we have apotheosized as
   </p>
   <p>
    messengers from heaven, bearers of divine gifts to man, I do not see in
   </p>
   <p>
    my mind any retinue at their heels, any car-load of fashionable
   </p>
   <p>
    furniture. Or what if I were to allow—would it not be a singular
   </p>
   <p>
    allowance?—that our furniture should be more complex than the Arab’s,
   </p>
   <p>
    in proportion as we are morally and intellectually his superiors! At
   </p>
   <p>
    present our houses are cluttered and defiled with it, and a good
   </p>
   <p>
    housewife would sweep out the greater part into the dust hole, and not
   </p>
   <p>
    leave her morning’s work undone. Morning work! By the blushes of Aurora
   </p>
   <p>
    and the music of Memnon, what should be man’s _morning work_ in this
   </p>
   <p>
    world? I had three pieces of limestone on my desk, but I was terrified
   </p>
   <p>
    to find that they required to be dusted daily, when the furniture of my
   </p>
   <p>
    mind was all undusted still, and I threw them out the window in
   </p>
   <p>
    disgust. How, then, could I have a furnished house? I would rather sit
   </p>
   <p>
    in the open air, for no dust gathers on the grass, unless where man has
   </p>
   <p>
    broken ground.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is the luxurious and dissipated who set the fashions which the herd
   </p>
   <p>
    so diligently follow. The traveller who stops at the best houses, so
   </p>
   <p>
    called, soon discovers this, for the publicans presume him to be a
   </p>
   <p>
    Sardanapalus, and if he resigned himself to their tender mercies he
   </p>
   <p>
    would soon be completely emasculated. I think that in the railroad car
   </p>
   <p>
    we are inclined to spend more on luxury than on safety and convenience,
   </p>
   <p>
    and it threatens without attaining these to become no better than a
   </p>
   <p>
    modern drawing room, with its divans, and ottomans, and sun-shades, and
   </p>
   <p>
    a hundred other oriental things, which we are taking west with us,
   </p>
   <p>
    invented for the ladies of the harem and the effeminate natives of the
   </p>
   <p>
    Celestial Empire, which Jonathan should be ashamed to know the names
   </p>
   <p>
    of. I would rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself than be
   </p>
   <p>
    crowded on a velvet cushion. I would rather ride on earth in an ox cart
   </p>
   <p>
    with a free circulation, than go to heaven in the fancy car of an
   </p>
   <p>
    excursion train and breathe a _malaria_ all the way.
   </p>
   <p>
    The very simplicity and nakedness of man’s life in the primitive ages
   </p>
   <p>
    imply this advantage at least, that they left him still but a sojourner
   </p>
   <p>
    in nature. When he was refreshed with food and sleep he contemplated
   </p>
   <p>
    his journey again. He dwelt, as it were, in a tent in this world, and
   </p>
   <p>
    was either threading the valleys, or crossing the plains, or climbing
   </p>
   <p>
    the mountain tops. But lo! men have become the tools of their tools.
   </p>
   <p>
    The man who independently plucked the fruits when he was hungry is
   </p>
   <p>
    become a farmer; and he who stood under a tree for shelter, a
   </p>
   <p>
    housekeeper. We now no longer camp as for a night, but have settled
   </p>
   <p>
    down on earth and forgotten heaven. We have adopted Christianity merely
   </p>
   <p>
    as an improved method of _agri_-culture. We have built for this world a
   </p>
   <p>
    family mansion, and for the next a family tomb. The best works of art
   </p>
   <p>
    are the expression of man’s struggle to free himself from this
   </p>
   <p>
    condition, but the effect of our art is merely to make this low state
   </p>
   <p>
    comfortable and that higher state to be forgotten. There is actually no
   </p>
   <p>
    place in this village for a work of _fine_ art, if any had come down to
   </p>
   <p>
    us, to stand, for our lives, our houses and streets, furnish no proper
   </p>
   <p>
    pedestal for it. There is not a nail to hang a picture on, nor a shelf
   </p>
   <p>
    to receive the bust of a hero or a saint. When I consider how our
   </p>
   <p>
    houses are built and paid for, or not paid for, and their internal
   </p>
   <p>
    economy managed and sustained, I wonder that the floor does not give
   </p>
   <p>
    way under the visitor while he is admiring the gewgaws upon the
   </p>
   <p>
    mantel-piece, and let him through into the cellar, to some solid and
   </p>
   <p>
    honest though earthy foundation. I cannot but perceive that this so
   </p>
   <p>
    called rich and refined life is a thing jumped at, and I do not get on
   </p>
   <p>
    in the enjoyment of the _fine_ arts which adorn it, my attention being
   </p>
   <p>
    wholly occupied with the jump; for I remember that the greatest genuine
   </p>
   <p>
    leap, due to human muscles alone, on record, is that of certain
   </p>
   <p>
    wandering Arabs, who are said to have cleared twenty-five feet on level
   </p>
   <p>
    ground. Without factitious support, man is sure to come to earth again
   </p>
   <p>
    beyond that distance. The first question which I am tempted to put to
   </p>
   <p>
    the proprietor of such great impropriety is, Who bolsters you? Are you
   </p>
   <p>
    one of the ninety-seven who fail, or of the three who succeed? Answer
   </p>
   <p>
    me these questions, and then perhaps I may look at your bawbles and
   </p>
   <p>
    find them ornamental. The cart before the horse is neither beautiful
   </p>
   <p>
    nor useful. Before we can adorn our houses with beautiful objects the
   </p>
   <p>
    walls must be stripped, and our lives must be stripped, and beautiful
   </p>
   <p>
    housekeeping and beautiful living be laid for a foundation: now, a
   </p>
   <p>
    taste for the beautiful is most cultivated out of doors, where there is
   </p>
   <p>
    no house and no housekeeper.
   </p>
   <p>
    Old Johnson, in his “Wonder-Working Providence,” speaking of the first
   </p>
   <p>
    settlers of this town, with whom he was contemporary, tells us that
   </p>
   <p>
    “they burrow themselves in the earth for their first shelter under some
   </p>
   <p>
    hillside, and, casting the soil aloft upon timber, they make a smoky
   </p>
   <p>
    fire against the earth, at the highest side.” They did not “provide
   </p>
   <p>
    them houses,” says he, “till the earth, by the Lord’s blessing, brought
   </p>
   <p>
    forth bread to feed them,” and the first year’s crop was so light that
   </p>
   <p>
    “they were forced to cut their bread very thin for a long season.” The
   </p>
   <p>
    secretary of the Province of New Netherland, writing in Dutch, in 1650,
   </p>
   <p>
    for the information of those who wished to take up land there, states
   </p>
   <p>
    more particularly that “those in New Netherland, and especially in New
   </p>
   <p>
    England, who have no means to build farmhouses at first according to
   </p>
   <p>
    their wishes, dig a square pit in the ground, cellar fashion, six or
   </p>
   <p>
    seven feet deep, as long and as broad as they think proper, case the
   </p>
   <p>
    earth inside with wood all round the wall, and line the wood with the
   </p>
   <p>
    bark of trees or something else to prevent the caving in of the earth;
   </p>
   <p>
    floor this cellar with plank, and wainscot it overhead for a ceiling,
   </p>
   <p>
    raise a roof of spars clear up, and cover the spars with bark or green
   </p>
   <p>
    sods, so that they can live dry and warm in these houses with their
   </p>
   <p>
    entire families for two, three, and four years, it being understood
   </p>
   <p>
    that partitions are run through those cellars which are adapted to the
   </p>
   <p>
    size of the family. The wealthy and principal men in New England, in
   </p>
   <p>
    the beginning of the colonies, commenced their first dwelling houses in
   </p>
   <p>
    this fashion for two reasons; firstly, in order not to waste time in
   </p>
   <p>
    building, and not to want food the next season; secondly, in order not
   </p>
   <p>
    to discourage poor laboring people whom they brought over in numbers
   </p>
   <p>
    from Fatherland. In the course of three or four years, when the country
   </p>
   <p>
    became adapted to agriculture, they built themselves handsome houses,
   </p>
   <p>
    spending on them several thousands.”
   </p>
   <p>
    In this course which our ancestors took there was a show of prudence at
   </p>
   <p>
    least, as if their principle were to satisfy the more pressing wants
   </p>
   <p>
    first. But are the more pressing wants satisfied now? When I think of
   </p>
   <p>
    acquiring for myself one of our luxurious dwellings, I am deterred,
   </p>
   <p>
    for, so to speak, the country is not yet adapted to _human_ culture,
   </p>
   <p>
    and we are still forced to cut our _spiritual_ bread far thinner than
   </p>
   <p>
    our forefathers did their wheaten. Not that all architectural ornament
   </p>
   <p>
    is to be neglected even in the rudest periods; but let our houses first
   </p>
   <p>
    be lined with beauty, where they come in contact with our lives, like
   </p>
   <p>
    the tenement of the shellfish, and not overlaid with it. But, alas! I
   </p>
   <p>
    have been inside one or two of them, and know what they are lined with.
   </p>
   <p>
    Though we are not so degenerate but that we might possibly live in a
   </p>
   <p>
    cave or a wigwam or wear skins today, it certainly is better to accept
   </p>
   <p>
    the advantages, though so dearly bought, which the invention and
   </p>
   <p>
    industry of mankind offer. In such a neighborhood as this, boards and
   </p>
   <p>
    shingles, lime and bricks, are cheaper and more easily obtained than
   </p>
   <p>
    suitable caves, or whole logs, or bark in sufficient quantities, or
   </p>
   <p>
    even well-tempered clay or flat stones. I speak understandingly on this
   </p>
   <p>
    subject, for I have made myself acquainted with it both theoretically
   </p>
   <p>
    and practically. With a little more wit we might use these materials so
   </p>
   <p>
    as to become richer than the richest now are, and make our civilization
   </p>
   <p>
    a blessing. The civilized man is a more experienced and wiser savage.
   </p>
   <p>
    But to make haste to my own experiment.
   </p>
   <p>
    Near the end of March, 1845, I borrowed an axe and went down to the
   </p>
   <p>
    woods by Walden Pond, nearest to where I intended to build my house,
   </p>
   <p>
    and began to cut down some tall, arrowy white pines, still in their
   </p>
   <p>
    youth, for timber. It is difficult to begin without borrowing, but
   </p>
   <p>
    perhaps it is the most generous course thus to permit your fellow-men
   </p>
   <p>
    to have an interest in your enterprise. The owner of the axe, as he
   </p>
   <p>
    released his hold on it, said that it was the apple of his eye; but I
   </p>
   <p>
    returned it sharper than I received it. It was a pleasant hillside
   </p>
   <p>
    where I worked, covered with pine woods, through which I looked out on
   </p>
   <p>
    the pond, and a small open field in the woods where pines and hickories
   </p>
   <p>
    were springing up. The ice in the pond was not yet dissolved, though
   </p>
   <p>
    there were some open spaces, and it was all dark colored and saturated
   </p>
   <p>
    with water. There were some slight flurries of snow during the days
   </p>
   <p>
    that I worked there; but for the most part when I came out on to the
   </p>
   <p>
    railroad, on my way home, its yellow sand heap stretched away gleaming
   </p>
   <p>
    in the hazy atmosphere, and the rails shone in the spring sun, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    heard the lark and pewee and other birds already come to commence
   </p>
   <p>
    another year with us. They were pleasant spring days, in which the
   </p>
   <p>
    winter of man’s discontent was thawing as well as the earth, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    life that had lain torpid began to stretch itself. One day, when my axe
   </p>
   <p>
    had come off and I had cut a green hickory for a wedge, driving it with
   </p>
   <p>
    a stone, and had placed the whole to soak in a pond hole in order to
   </p>
   <p>
    swell the wood, I saw a striped snake run into the water, and he lay on
   </p>
   <p>
    the bottom, apparently without inconvenience, as long as I stayed
   </p>
   <p>
    there, or more than a quarter of an hour; perhaps because he had not
   </p>
   <p>
    yet fairly come out of the torpid state. It appeared to me that for a
   </p>
   <p>
    like reason men remain in their present low and primitive condition;
   </p>
   <p>
    but if they should feel the influence of the spring of springs arousing
   </p>
   <p>
    them, they would of necessity rise to a higher and more ethereal life.
   </p>
   <p>
    I had previously seen the snakes in frosty mornings in my path with
   </p>
   <p>
    portions of their bodies still numb and inflexible, waiting for the sun
   </p>
   <p>
    to thaw them. On the 1st of April it rained and melted the ice, and in
   </p>
   <p>
    the early part of the day, which was very foggy, I heard a stray goose
   </p>
   <p>
    groping about over the pond and cackling as if lost, or like the spirit
   </p>
   <p>
    of the fog.
   </p>
   <p>
    So I went on for some days cutting and hewing timber, and also studs
   </p>
   <p>
    and rafters, all with my narrow axe, not having many communicable or
   </p>
   <p>
    scholar-like thoughts, singing to myself,—
   </p>
   <p>
    Men say they know many things;
   </p>
   <p>
    But lo! they have taken wings,—
   </p>
   <p>
    The arts and sciences,
   </p>
   <p>
    And a thousand appliances;
   </p>
   <p>
    The wind that blows
   </p>
   <p>
    Is all that any body knows.
   </p>
   <p>
    I hewed the main timbers six inches square, most of the studs on two
   </p>
   <p>
    sides only, and the rafters and floor timbers on one side, leaving the
   </p>
   <p>
    rest of the bark on, so that they were just as straight and much
   </p>
   <p>
    stronger than sawed ones. Each stick was carefully mortised or tenoned
   </p>
   <p>
    by its stump, for I had borrowed other tools by this time. My days in
   </p>
   <p>
    the woods were not very long ones; yet I usually carried my dinner of
   </p>
   <p>
    bread and butter, and read the newspaper in which it was wrapped, at
   </p>
   <p>
    noon, sitting amid the green pine boughs which I had cut off, and to my
   </p>
   <p>
    bread was imparted some of their fragrance, for my hands were covered
   </p>
   <p>
    with a thick coat of pitch. Before I had done I was more the friend
   </p>
   <p>
    than the foe of the pine tree, though I had cut down some of them,
   </p>
   <p>
    having become better acquainted with it. Sometimes a rambler in the
   </p>
   <p>
    wood was attracted by the sound of my axe, and we chatted pleasantly
   </p>
   <p>
    over the chips which I had made.
   </p>
   <p>
    By the middle of April, for I made no haste in my work, but rather made
   </p>
   <p>
    the most of it, my house was framed and ready for the raising. I had
   </p>
   <p>
    already bought the shanty of James Collins, an Irishman who worked on
   </p>
   <p>
    the Fitchburg Railroad, for boards. James Collins’ shanty was
   </p>
   <p>
    considered an uncommonly fine one. When I called to see it he was not
   </p>
   <p>
    at home. I walked about the outside, at first unobserved from within,
   </p>
   <p>
    the window was so deep and high. It was of small dimensions, with a
   </p>
   <p>
    peaked cottage roof, and not much else to be seen, the dirt being
   </p>
   <p>
    raised five feet all around as if it were a compost heap. The roof was
   </p>
   <p>
    the soundest part, though a good deal warped and made brittle by the
   </p>
   <p>
    sun. Door-sill there was none, but a perennial passage for the hens
   </p>
   <p>
    under the door board. Mrs. C. came to the door and asked me to view it
   </p>
   <p>
    from the inside. The hens were driven in by my approach. It was dark,
   </p>
   <p>
    and had a dirt floor for the most part, dank, clammy, and aguish, only
   </p>
   <p>
    here a board and there a board which would not bear removal. She
   </p>
   <p>
    lighted a lamp to show me the inside of the roof and the walls, and
   </p>
   <p>
    also that the board floor extended under the bed, warning me not to
   </p>
   <p>
    step into the cellar, a sort of dust hole two feet deep. In her own
   </p>
   <p>
    words, they were “good boards overhead, good boards all around, and a
   </p>
   <p>
    good window,”—of two whole squares originally, only the cat had passed
   </p>
   <p>
    out that way lately. There was a stove, a bed, and a place to sit, an
   </p>
   <p>
    infant in the house where it was born, a silk parasol, gilt-framed
   </p>
   <p>
    looking-glass, and a patent new coffee mill nailed to an oak sapling,
   </p>
   <p>
    all told. The bargain was soon concluded, for James had in the
   </p>
   <p>
    meanwhile returned. I to pay four dollars and twenty-five cents
   </p>
   <p>
    to-night, he to vacate at five to-morrow morning, selling to nobody
   </p>
   <p>
    else meanwhile: I to take possession at six. It were well, he said, to
   </p>
   <p>
    be there early, and anticipate certain indistinct but wholly unjust
   </p>
   <p>
    claims on the score of ground rent and fuel. This he assured me was the
   </p>
   <p>
    only encumbrance. At six I passed him and his family on the road. One
   </p>
   <p>
    large bundle held their all,—bed, coffee-mill, looking-glass, hens,—all
   </p>
   <p>
    but the cat, she took to the woods and became a wild cat, and, as I
   </p>
   <p>
    learned afterward, trod in a trap set for woodchucks, and so became a
   </p>
   <p>
    dead cat at last.
   </p>
   <p>
    I took down this dwelling the same morning, drawing the nails, and
   </p>
   <p>
    removed it to the pond side by small cartloads, spreading the boards on
   </p>
   <p>
    the grass there to bleach and warp back again in the sun. One early
   </p>
   <p>
    thrush gave me a note or two as I drove along the woodland path. I was
   </p>
   <p>
    informed treacherously by a young Patrick that neighbor Seeley, an
   </p>
   <p>
    Irishman, in the intervals of the carting, transferred the still
   </p>
   <p>
    tolerable, straight, and drivable nails, staples, and spikes to his
   </p>
   <p>
    pocket, and then stood when I came back to pass the time of day, and
   </p>
   <p>
    look freshly up, unconcerned, with spring thoughts, at the devastation;
   </p>
   <p>
    there being a dearth of work, as he said. He was there to represent
   </p>
   <p>
    spectatordom, and help make this seemingly insignificant event one with
   </p>
   <p>
    the removal of the gods of Troy.
   </p>
   <p>
    I dug my cellar in the side of a hill sloping to the south, where a
   </p>
   <p>
    woodchuck had formerly dug his burrow, down through sumach and
   </p>
   <p>
    blackberry roots, and the lowest stain of vegetation, six feet square
   </p>
   <p>
    by seven deep, to a fine sand where potatoes would not freeze in any
   </p>
   <p>
    winter. The sides were left shelving, and not stoned; but the sun
   </p>
   <p>
    having never shone on them, the sand still keeps its place. It was but
   </p>
   <p>
    two hours’ work. I took particular pleasure in this breaking of ground,
   </p>
   <p>
    for in almost all latitudes men dig into the earth for an equable
   </p>
   <p>
    temperature. Under the most splendid house in the city is still to be
   </p>
   <p>
    found the cellar where they store their roots as of old, and long after
   </p>
   <p>
    the superstructure has disappeared posterity remark its dent in the
   </p>
   <p>
    earth. The house is still but a sort of porch at the entrance of a
   </p>
   <p>
    burrow.
   </p>
   <p>
    At length, in the beginning of May, with the help of some of my
   </p>
   <p>
    acquaintances, rather to improve so good an occasion for neighborliness
   </p>
   <p>
    than from any necessity, I set up the frame of my house. No man was
   </p>
   <p>
    ever more honored in the character of his raisers than I. They are
   </p>
   <p>
    destined, I trust, to assist at the raising of loftier structures one
   </p>
   <p>
    day. I began to occupy my house on the 4th of July, as soon as it was
   </p>
   <p>
    boarded and roofed, for the boards were carefully feather-edged and
   </p>
   <p>
    lapped, so that it was perfectly impervious to rain; but before
   </p>
   <p>
    boarding I laid the foundation of a chimney at one end, bringing two
   </p>
   <p>
    cartloads of stones up the hill from the pond in my arms. I built the
   </p>
   <p>
    chimney after my hoeing in the fall, before a fire became necessary for
   </p>
   <p>
    warmth, doing my cooking in the mean while out of doors on the ground,
   </p>
   <p>
    early in the morning: which mode I still think is in some respects more
   </p>
   <p>
    convenient and agreeable than the usual one. When it stormed before my
   </p>
   <p>
    bread was baked, I fixed a few boards over the fire, and sat under them
   </p>
   <p>
    to watch my loaf, and passed some pleasant hours in that way. In those
   </p>
   <p>
    days, when my hands were much employed, I read but little, but the
   </p>
   <p>
    least scraps of paper which lay on the ground, my holder, or
   </p>
   <p>
    tablecloth, afforded me as much entertainment, in fact answered the
   </p>
   <p>
    same purpose as the Iliad.
   </p>
   <p>
    It would be worth the while to build still more deliberately than I
   </p>
   <p>
    did, considering, for instance, what foundation a door, a window, a
   </p>
   <p>
    cellar, a garret, have in the nature of man, and perchance never
   </p>
   <p>
    raising any superstructure until we found a better reason for it than
   </p>
   <p>
    our temporal necessities even. There is some of the same fitness in a
   </p>
   <p>
    man’s building his own house that there is in a bird’s building its own
   </p>
   <p>
    nest. Who knows but if men constructed their dwellings with their own
   </p>
   <p>
    hands, and provided food for themselves and families simply and
   </p>
   <p>
    honestly enough, the poetic faculty would be universally developed, as
   </p>
   <p>
    birds universally sing when they are so engaged? But alas! we do like
   </p>
   <p>
    cowbirds and cuckoos, which lay their eggs in nests which other birds
   </p>
   <p>
    have built, and cheer no traveller with their chattering and unmusical
   </p>
   <p>
    notes. Shall we forever resign the pleasure of construction to the
   </p>
   <p>
    carpenter? What does architecture amount to in the experience of the
   </p>
   <p>
    mass of men? I never in all my walks came across a man engaged in so
   </p>
   <p>
    simple and natural an occupation as building his house. We belong to
   </p>
   <p>
    the community. It is not the tailor alone who is the ninth part of a
   </p>
   <p>
    man; it is as much the preacher, and the merchant, and the farmer.
   </p>
   <p>
    Where is this division of labor to end? and what object does it finally
   </p>
   <p>
    serve? No doubt another _may_ also think for me; but it is not
   </p>
   <p>
    therefore desirable that he should do so to the exclusion of my
   </p>
   <p>
    thinking for myself.
   </p>
   <p>
    True, there are architects so called in this country, and I have heard
   </p>
   <p>
    of one at least possessed with the idea of making architectural
   </p>
   <p>
    ornaments have a core of truth, a necessity, and hence a beauty, as if
   </p>
   <p>
    it were a revelation to him. All very well perhaps from his point of
   </p>
   <p>
    view, but only a little better than the common dilettantism. A
   </p>
   <p>
    sentimental reformer in architecture, he began at the cornice, not at
   </p>
   <p>
    the foundation. It was only how to put a core of truth within the
   </p>
   <p>
    ornaments, that every sugar plum in fact might have an almond or
   </p>
   <p>
    caraway seed in it,—though I hold that almonds are most wholesome
   </p>
   <p>
    without the sugar,—and not how the inhabitant, the indweller, might
   </p>
   <p>
    build truly within and without, and let the ornaments take care of
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves. What reasonable man ever supposed that ornaments were
   </p>
   <p>
    something outward and in the skin merely,—that the tortoise got his
   </p>
   <p>
    spotted shell, or the shellfish its mother-o’-pearl tints, by such a
   </p>
   <p>
    contract as the inhabitants of Broadway their Trinity Church? But a man
   </p>
   <p>
    has no more to do with the style of architecture of his house than a
   </p>
   <p>
    tortoise with that of its shell: nor need the soldier be so idle as to
   </p>
   <p>
    try to paint the precise color of his virtue on his standard. The enemy
   </p>
   <p>
    will find it out. He may turn pale when the trial comes. This man
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed to me to lean over the cornice, and timidly whisper his half
   </p>
   <p>
    truth to the rude occupants who really knew it better than he. What of
   </p>
   <p>
    architectural beauty I now see, I know has gradually grown from within
   </p>
   <p>
    outward, out of the necessities and character of the indweller, who is
   </p>
   <p>
    the only builder,—out of some unconscious truthfulness, and nobleness,
   </p>
   <p>
    without ever a thought for the appearance and whatever additional
   </p>
   <p>
    beauty of this kind is destined to be produced will be preceded by a
   </p>
   <p>
    like unconscious beauty of life. The most interesting dwellings in this
   </p>
   <p>
    country, as the painter knows, are the most unpretending, humble log
   </p>
   <p>
    huts and cottages of the poor commonly; it is the life of the
   </p>
   <p>
    inhabitants whose shells they are, and not any peculiarity in their
   </p>
   <p>
    surfaces merely, which makes them _picturesque;_ and equally
   </p>
   <p>
    interesting will be the citizen’s suburban box, when his life shall be
   </p>
   <p>
    as simple and as agreeable to the imagination, and there is as little
   </p>
   <p>
    straining after effect in the style of his dwelling. A great proportion
   </p>
   <p>
    of architectural ornaments are literally hollow, and a September gale
   </p>
   <p>
    would strip them off, like borrowed plumes, without injury to the
   </p>
   <p>
    substantials. They can do without _architecture_ who have no olives nor
   </p>
   <p>
    wines in the cellar. What if an equal ado were made about the ornaments
   </p>
   <p>
    of style in literature, and the architects of our bibles spent as much
   </p>
   <p>
    time about their cornices as the architects of our churches do? So are
   </p>
   <p>
    made the _belles-lettres_ and the _beaux-arts_ and their professors.
   </p>
   <p>
    Much it concerns a man, forsooth, how a few sticks are slanted over him
   </p>
   <p>
    or under him, and what colors are daubed upon his box. It would signify
   </p>
   <p>
    somewhat, if, in any earnest sense, _he_ slanted them and daubed it;
   </p>
   <p>
    but the spirit having departed out of the tenant, it is of a piece with
   </p>
   <p>
    constructing his own coffin,—the architecture of the grave, and
   </p>
   <p>
    “carpenter” is but another name for “coffin-maker.” One man says, in
   </p>
   <p>
    his despair or indifference to life, take up a handful of the earth at
   </p>
   <p>
    your feet, and paint your house that color. Is he thinking of his last
   </p>
   <p>
    and narrow house? Toss up a copper for it as well. What an abundance of
   </p>
   <p>
    leisure he must have! Why do you take up a handful of dirt? Better
   </p>
   <p>
    paint your house your own complexion; let it turn pale or blush for
   </p>
   <p>
    you. An enterprise to improve the style of cottage architecture! When
   </p>
   <p>
    you have got my ornaments ready I will wear them.
   </p>
   <p>
    Before winter I built a chimney, and shingled the sides of my house,
   </p>
   <p>
    which were already impervious to rain, with imperfect and sappy
   </p>
   <p>
    shingles made of the first slice of the log, whose edges I was obliged
   </p>
   <p>
    to straighten with a plane.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have thus a tight shingled and plastered house, ten feet wide by
   </p>
   <p>
    fifteen long, and eight-feet posts, with a garret and a closet, a large
   </p>
   <p>
    window on each side, two trap doors, one door at the end, and a brick
   </p>
   <p>
    fireplace opposite. The exact cost of my house, paying the usual price
   </p>
   <p>
    for such materials as I used, but not counting the work, all of which
   </p>
   <p>
    was done by myself, was as follows; and I give the details because very
   </p>
   <p>
    few are able to tell exactly what their houses cost, and fewer still,
   </p>
   <p>
    if any, the separate cost of the various materials which compose them:—
   </p>
   <p>
    Boards.......................... $ 8.03½, mostly shanty boards.
   </p>
   <p>
    Refuse shingles for roof sides,..  4.00
   </p>
   <p>
    Laths,...........................  1.25
   </p>
   <p>
    Two second-hand windows
   </p>
   <p>
    with glass,...................  2.43
   </p>
   <p>
    One thousand old brick,..........  4.00
   </p>
   <p>
    Two casks of lime,...............  2.40  That was high.
   </p>
   <p>
    Hair,............................  0.31  More than I needed.
   </p>
   <p>
    Mantle-tree iron,................  0.15
   </p>
   <p>
    Nails,...........................  3.90
   </p>
   <p>
    Hinges and screws,...............  0.14
   </p>
   <p>
    Latch,...........................  0.10
   </p>
   <p>
    Chalk,...........................  0.01
   </p>
   <p>
    Transportation,..................  1.40  I carried a good part
   </p>
   <p>
    ———— on my back.
   </p>
   <p>
    In all,..................... $28.12½
   </p>
   <p>
    These are all the materials excepting the timber stones and sand, which
   </p>
   <p>
    I claimed by squatter’s right. I have also a small wood-shed adjoining,
   </p>
   <p>
    made chiefly of the stuff which was left after building the house.
   </p>
   <p>
    I intend to build me a house which will surpass any on the main street
   </p>
   <p>
    in Concord in grandeur and luxury, as soon as it pleases me as much and
   </p>
   <p>
    will cost me no more than my present one.
   </p>
   <p>
    I thus found that the student who wishes for a shelter can obtain one
   </p>
   <p>
    for a lifetime at an expense not greater than the rent which he now
   </p>
   <p>
    pays annually. If I seem to boast more than is becoming, my excuse is
   </p>
   <p>
    that I brag for humanity rather than for myself; and my shortcomings
   </p>
   <p>
    and inconsistencies do not affect the truth of my statement.
   </p>
   <p>
    Notwithstanding much cant and hypocrisy,—chaff which I find it
   </p>
   <p>
    difficult to separate from my wheat, but for which I am as sorry as any
   </p>
   <p>
    man,—I will breathe freely and stretch myself in this respect, it is
   </p>
   <p>
    such a relief to both the moral and physical system; and I am resolved
   </p>
   <p>
    that I will not through humility become the devil’s attorney. I will
   </p>
   <p>
    endeavor to speak a good word for the truth. At Cambridge College the
   </p>
   <p>
    mere rent of a student’s room, which is only a little larger than my
   </p>
   <p>
    own, is thirty dollars each year, though the corporation had the
   </p>
   <p>
    advantage of building thirty-two side by side and under one roof, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the occupant suffers the inconvenience of many and noisy neighbors, and
   </p>
   <p>
    perhaps a residence in the fourth story. I cannot but think that if we
   </p>
   <p>
    had more true wisdom in these respects, not only less education would
   </p>
   <p>
    be needed, because, forsooth, more would already have been acquired,
   </p>
   <p>
    but the pecuniary expense of getting an education would in a great
   </p>
   <p>
    measure vanish. Those conveniences which the student requires at
   </p>
   <p>
    Cambridge or elsewhere cost him or somebody else ten times as great a
   </p>
   <p>
    sacrifice of life as they would with proper management on both sides.
   </p>
   <p>
    Those things for which the most money is demanded are never the things
   </p>
   <p>
    which the student most wants. Tuition, for instance, is an important
   </p>
   <p>
    item in the term bill, while for the far more valuable education which
   </p>
   <p>
    he gets by associating with the most cultivated of his contemporaries
   </p>
   <p>
    no charge is made. The mode of founding a college is, commonly, to get
   </p>
   <p>
    up a subscription of dollars and cents, and then following blindly the
   </p>
   <p>
    principles of a division of labor to its extreme, a principle which
   </p>
   <p>
    should never be followed but with circumspection,—to call in a
   </p>
   <p>
    contractor who makes this a subject of speculation, and he employs
   </p>
   <p>
    Irishmen or other operatives actually to lay the foundations, while the
   </p>
   <p>
    students that are to be are said to be fitting themselves for it; and
   </p>
   <p>
    for these oversights successive generations have to pay. I think that
   </p>
   <p>
    it would be _better than this_, for the students, or those who desire
   </p>
   <p>
    to be benefited by it, even to lay the foundation themselves. The
   </p>
   <p>
    student who secures his coveted leisure and retirement by
   </p>
   <p>
    systematically shirking any labor necessary to man obtains but an
   </p>
   <p>
    ignoble and unprofitable leisure, defrauding himself of the experience
   </p>
   <p>
    which alone can make leisure fruitful. “But,” says one, “you do not
   </p>
   <p>
    mean that the students should go to work with their hands instead of
   </p>
   <p>
    their heads?” I do not mean that exactly, but I mean something which he
   </p>
   <p>
    might think a good deal like that; I mean that they should not _play_
   </p>
   <p>
    life, or _study_ it merely, while the community supports them at this
   </p>
   <p>
    expensive game, but earnestly _live_ it from beginning to end. How
   </p>
   <p>
    could youths better learn to live than by at once trying the experiment
   </p>
   <p>
    of living? Methinks this would exercise their minds as much as
   </p>
   <p>
    mathematics. If I wished a boy to know something about the arts and
   </p>
   <p>
    sciences, for instance, I would not pursue the common course, which is
   </p>
   <p>
    merely to send him into the neighborhood of some professor, where any
   </p>
   <p>
    thing is professed and practised but the art of life;—to survey the
   </p>
   <p>
    world through a telescope or a microscope, and never with his natural
   </p>
   <p>
    eye; to study chemistry, and not learn how his bread is made, or
   </p>
   <p>
    mechanics, and not learn how it is earned; to discover new satellites
   </p>
   <p>
    to Neptune, and not detect the motes in his eyes, or to what vagabond
   </p>
   <p>
    he is a satellite himself; or to be devoured by the monsters that swarm
   </p>
   <p>
    all around him, while contemplating the monsters in a drop of vinegar.
   </p>
   <p>
    Which would have advanced the most at the end of a month,—the boy who
   </p>
   <p>
    had made his own jackknife from the ore which he had dug and smelted,
   </p>
   <p>
    reading as much as would be necessary for this,—or the boy who had
   </p>
   <p>
    attended the lectures on metallurgy at the Institute in the mean while,
   </p>
   <p>
    and had received a Rodgers’ penknife from his father? Which would be
   </p>
   <p>
    most likely to cut his fingers?... To my astonishment I was informed on
   </p>
   <p>
    leaving college that I had studied navigation!—why, if I had taken one
   </p>
   <p>
    turn down the harbor I should have known more about it. Even the _poor_
   </p>
   <p>
    student studies and is taught only _political_ economy, while that
   </p>
   <p>
    economy of living which is synonymous with philosophy is not even
   </p>
   <p>
    sincerely professed in our colleges. The consequence is, that while he
   </p>
   <p>
    is reading Adam Smith, Ricardo, and Say, he runs his father in debt
   </p>
   <p>
    irretrievably.
   </p>
   <p>
    As with our colleges, so with a hundred “modern improvements”; there is
   </p>
   <p>
    an illusion about them; there is not always a positive advance. The
   </p>
   <p>
    devil goes on exacting compound interest to the last for his early
   </p>
   <p>
    share and numerous succeeding investments in them. Our inventions are
   </p>
   <p>
    wont to be pretty toys, which distract our attention from serious
   </p>
   <p>
    things. They are but improved means to an unimproved end, an end which
   </p>
   <p>
    it was already but too easy to arrive at; as railroads lead to Boston
   </p>
   <p>
    or New York. We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph
   </p>
   <p>
    from Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing
   </p>
   <p>
    important to communicate. Either is in such a predicament as the man
   </p>
   <p>
    who was earnest to be introduced to a distinguished deaf woman, but
   </p>
   <p>
    when he was presented, and one end of her ear trumpet was put into his
   </p>
   <p>
    hand, had nothing to say. As if the main object were to talk fast and
   </p>
   <p>
    not to talk sensibly. We are eager to tunnel under the Atlantic and
   </p>
   <p>
    bring the old world some weeks nearer to the new; but perchance the
   </p>
   <p>
    first news that will leak through into the broad, flapping American ear
   </p>
   <p>
    will be that the Princess Adelaide has the whooping cough. After all,
   </p>
   <p>
    the man whose horse trots a mile in a minute does not carry the most
   </p>
   <p>
    important messages; he is not an evangelist, nor does he come round
   </p>
   <p>
    eating locusts and wild honey. I doubt if Flying Childers ever carried
   </p>
   <p>
    a peck of corn to mill.
   </p>
   <p>
    One says to me, “I wonder that you do not lay up money; you love to
   </p>
   <p>
    travel; you might take the cars and go to Fitchburg to-day and see the
   </p>
   <p>
    country.” But I am wiser than that. I have learned that the swiftest
   </p>
   <p>
    traveller is he that goes afoot. I say to my friend, Suppose we try who
   </p>
   <p>
    will get there first. The distance is thirty miles; the fare ninety
   </p>
   <p>
    cents. That is almost a day’s wages. I remember when wages were sixty
   </p>
   <p>
    cents a day for laborers on this very road. Well, I start now on foot,
   </p>
   <p>
    and get there before night; I have travelled at that rate by the week
   </p>
   <p>
    together. You will in the mean while have earned your fare, and arrive
   </p>
   <p>
    there some time to-morrow, or possibly this evening, if you are lucky
   </p>
   <p>
    enough to get a job in season. Instead of going to Fitchburg, you will
   </p>
   <p>
    be working here the greater part of the day. And so, if the railroad
   </p>
   <p>
    reached round the world, I think that I should keep ahead of you; and
   </p>
   <p>
    as for seeing the country and getting experience of that kind, I should
   </p>
   <p>
    have to cut your acquaintance altogether.
   </p>
   <p>
    Such is the universal law, which no man can ever outwit, and with
   </p>
   <p>
    regard to the railroad even we may say it is as broad as it is long. To
   </p>
   <p>
    make a railroad round the world available to all mankind is equivalent
   </p>
   <p>
    to grading the whole surface of the planet. Men have an indistinct
   </p>
   <p>
    notion that if they keep up this activity of joint stocks and spades
   </p>
   <p>
    long enough all will at length ride somewhere, in next to no time, and
   </p>
   <p>
    for nothing; but though a crowd rushes to the depot, and the conductor
   </p>
   <p>
    shouts “All aboard!” when the smoke is blown away and the vapor
   </p>
   <p>
    condensed, it will be perceived that a few are riding, but the rest are
   </p>
   <p>
    run over,—and it will be called, and will be, “A melancholy accident.”
   </p>
   <p>
    No doubt they can ride at last who shall have earned their fare, that
   </p>
   <p>
    is, if they survive so long, but they will probably have lost their
   </p>
   <p>
    elasticity and desire to travel by that time. This spending of the best
   </p>
   <p>
    part of one’s life earning money in order to enjoy a questionable
   </p>
   <p>
    liberty during the least valuable part of it, reminds me of the
   </p>
   <p>
    Englishman who went to India to make a fortune first, in order that he
   </p>
   <p>
    might return to England and live the life of a poet. He should have
   </p>
   <p>
    gone up garret at once. “What!” exclaim a million Irishmen starting up
   </p>
   <p>
    from all the shanties in the land, “is not this railroad which we have
   </p>
   <p>
    built a good thing?” Yes, I answer, _comparatively_ good, that is, you
   </p>
   <p>
    might have done worse; but I wish, as you are brothers of mine, that
   </p>
   <p>
    you could have spent your time better than digging in this dirt.
   </p>
   <p>
    Before I finished my house, wishing to earn ten or twelve dollars by
   </p>
   <p>
    some honest and agreeable method, in order to meet my unusual expenses,
   </p>
   <p>
    I planted about two acres and a half of light and sandy soil near it
   </p>
   <p>
    chiefly with beans, but also a small part with potatoes, corn, peas,
   </p>
   <p>
    and turnips. The whole lot contains eleven acres, mostly growing up to
   </p>
   <p>
    pines and hickories, and was sold the preceding season for eight
   </p>
   <p>
    dollars and eight cents an acre. One farmer said that it was “good for
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing but to raise cheeping squirrels on.” I put no manure whatever
   </p>
   <p>
    on this land, not being the owner, but merely a squatter, and not
   </p>
   <p>
    expecting to cultivate so much again, and I did not quite hoe it all
   </p>
   <p>
    once. I got out several cords of stumps in ploughing, which supplied me
   </p>
   <p>
    with fuel for a long time, and left small circles of virgin mould,
   </p>
   <p>
    easily distinguishable through the summer by the greater luxuriance of
   </p>
   <p>
    the beans there. The dead and for the most part unmerchantable wood
   </p>
   <p>
    behind my house, and the driftwood from the pond, have supplied the
   </p>
   <p>
    remainder of my fuel. I was obliged to hire a team and a man for the
   </p>
   <p>
    ploughing, though I held the plough myself. My farm outgoes for the
   </p>
   <p>
    first season were, for implements, seed, work, &amp;c., $14.72½. The seed
   </p>
   <p>
    corn was given me. This never costs anything to speak of, unless you
   </p>
   <p>
    plant more than enough. I got twelve bushels of beans, and eighteen
   </p>
   <p>
    bushels of potatoes, beside some peas and sweet corn. The yellow corn
   </p>
   <p>
    and turnips were too late to come to any thing. My whole income from
   </p>
   <p>
    the farm was
   </p>
   <p>
    $ 23.44
   </p>
   <p>
    Deducting the outgoes,...........  14.72½
   </p>
   <p>
    ————
   </p>
   <p>
    There are left,................. $  8.71½,
   </p>
   <p>
    beside produce consumed and on hand at the time this estimate was made
   </p>
   <p>
    of the value of $4.50,—the amount on hand much more than balancing a
   </p>
   <p>
    little grass which I did not raise. All things considered, that is,
   </p>
   <p>
    considering the importance of a man’s soul and of to-day,
   </p>
   <p>
    notwithstanding the short time occupied by my experiment, nay, partly
   </p>
   <p>
    even because of its transient character, I believe that that was doing
   </p>
   <p>
    better than any farmer in Concord did that year.
   </p>
   <p>
    The next year I did better still, for I spaded up all the land which I
   </p>
   <p>
    required, about a third of an acre, and I learned from the experience
   </p>
   <p>
    of both years, not being in the least awed by many celebrated works on
   </p>
   <p>
    husbandry, Arthur Young among the rest, that if one would live simply
   </p>
   <p>
    and eat only the crop which he raised, and raise no more than he ate,
   </p>
   <p>
    and not exchange it for an insufficient quantity of more luxurious and
   </p>
   <p>
    expensive things, he would need to cultivate only a few rods of ground,
   </p>
   <p>
    and that it would be cheaper to spade up that than to use oxen to
   </p>
   <p>
    plough it, and to select a fresh spot from time to time than to manure
   </p>
   <p>
    the old, and he could do all his necessary farm work as it were with
   </p>
   <p>
    his left hand at odd hours in the summer; and thus he would not be tied
   </p>
   <p>
    to an ox, or horse, or cow, or pig, as at present. I desire to speak
   </p>
   <p>
    impartially on this point, and as one not interested in the success or
   </p>
   <p>
    failure of the present economical and social arrangements. I was more
   </p>
   <p>
    independent than any farmer in Concord, for I was not anchored to a
   </p>
   <p>
    house or farm, but could follow the bent of my genius, which is a very
   </p>
   <p>
    crooked one, every moment. Beside being better off than they already,
   </p>
   <p>
    if my house had been burned or my crops had failed, I should have been
   </p>
   <p>
    nearly as well off as before.
   </p>
   <p>
    I am wont to think that men are not so much the keepers of herds as
   </p>
   <p>
    herds are the keepers of men, the former are so much the freer. Men and
   </p>
   <p>
    oxen exchange work; but if we consider necessary work only, the oxen
   </p>
   <p>
    will be seen to have greatly the advantage, their farm is so much the
   </p>
   <p>
    larger. Man does some of his part of the exchange work in his six weeks
   </p>
   <p>
    of haying, and it is no boy’s play. Certainly no nation that lived
   </p>
   <p>
    simply in all respects, that is, no nation of philosophers, would
   </p>
   <p>
    commit so great a blunder as to use the labor of animals. True, there
   </p>
   <p>
    never was and is not likely soon to be a nation of philosophers, nor am
   </p>
   <p>
    I certain it is desirable that there should be. However, _I_ should
   </p>
   <p>
    never have broken a horse or bull and taken him to board for any work
   </p>
   <p>
    he might do for me, for fear I should become a horse-man or a herds-man
   </p>
   <p>
    merely; and if society seems to be the gainer by so doing, are we
   </p>
   <p>
    certain that what is one man’s gain is not another’s loss, and that the
   </p>
   <p>
    stable-boy has equal cause with his master to be satisfied? Granted
   </p>
   <p>
    that some public works would not have been constructed without this
   </p>
   <p>
    aid, and let man share the glory of such with the ox and horse; does it
   </p>
   <p>
    follow that he could not have accomplished works yet more worthy of
   </p>
   <p>
    himself in that case? When men begin to do, not merely unnecessary or
   </p>
   <p>
    artistic, but luxurious and idle work, with their assistance, it is
   </p>
   <p>
    inevitable that a few do all the exchange work with the oxen, or, in
   </p>
   <p>
    other words, become the slaves of the strongest. Man thus not only
   </p>
   <p>
    works for the animal within him, but, for a symbol of this, he works
   </p>
   <p>
    for the animal without him. Though we have many substantial houses of
   </p>
   <p>
    brick or stone, the prosperity of the farmer is still measured by the
   </p>
   <p>
    degree to which the barn overshadows the house. This town is said to
   </p>
   <p>
    have the largest houses for oxen, cows, and horses hereabouts, and it
   </p>
   <p>
    is not behindhand in its public buildings; but there are very few halls
   </p>
   <p>
    for free worship or free speech in this county. It should not be by
   </p>
   <p>
    their architecture, but why not even by their power of abstract
   </p>
   <p>
    thought, that nations should seek to commemorate themselves? How much
   </p>
   <p>
    more admirable the Bhagvat-Geeta than all the ruins of the East! Towers
   </p>
   <p>
    and temples are the luxury of princes. A simple and independent mind
   </p>
   <p>
    does not toil at the bidding of any prince. Genius is not a retainer to
   </p>
   <p>
    any emperor, nor is its material silver, or gold, or marble, except to
   </p>
   <p>
    a trifling extent. To what end, pray, is so much stone hammered? In
   </p>
   <p>
    Arcadia, when I was there, I did not see any hammering stone. Nations
   </p>
   <p>
    are possessed with an insane ambition to perpetuate the memory of
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves by the amount of hammered stone they leave. What if equal
   </p>
   <p>
    pains were taken to smooth and polish their manners? One piece of good
   </p>
   <p>
    sense would be more memorable than a monument as high as the moon. I
   </p>
   <p>
    love better to see stones in place. The grandeur of Thebes was a vulgar
   </p>
   <p>
    grandeur. More sensible is a rod of stone wall that bounds an honest
   </p>
   <p>
    man’s field than a hundred-gated Thebes that has wandered farther from
   </p>
   <p>
    the true end of life. The religion and civilization which are barbaric
   </p>
   <p>
    and heathenish build splendid temples; but what you might call
   </p>
   <p>
    Christianity does not. Most of the stone a nation hammers goes toward
   </p>
   <p>
    its tomb only. It buries itself alive. As for the Pyramids, there is
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing to wonder at in them so much as the fact that so many men could
   </p>
   <p>
    be found degraded enough to spend their lives constructing a tomb for
   </p>
   <p>
    some ambitious booby, whom it would have been wiser and manlier to have
   </p>
   <p>
    drowned in the Nile, and then given his body to the dogs. I might
   </p>
   <p>
    possibly invent some excuse for them and him, but I have no time for
   </p>
   <p>
    it. As for the religion and love of art of the builders, it is much the
   </p>
   <p>
    same all the world over, whether the building be an Egyptian temple or
   </p>
   <p>
    the United States Bank. It costs more than it comes to. The mainspring
   </p>
   <p>
    is vanity, assisted by the love of garlic and bread and butter. Mr.
   </p>
   <p>
    Balcom, a promising young architect, designs it on the back of his
   </p>
   <p>
    Vitruvius, with hard pencil and ruler, and the job is let out to Dobson
   </p>
   <p>
    &amp; Sons, stonecutters. When the thirty centuries begin to look down on
   </p>
   <p>
    it, mankind begin to look up at it. As for your high towers and
   </p>
   <p>
    monuments, there was a crazy fellow once in this town who undertook to
   </p>
   <p>
    dig through to China, and he got so far that, as he said, he heard the
   </p>
   <p>
    Chinese pots and kettles rattle; but I think that I shall not go out of
   </p>
   <p>
    my way to admire the hole which he made. Many are concerned about the
   </p>
   <p>
    monuments of the West and the East,—to know who built them. For my
   </p>
   <p>
    part, I should like to know who in those days did not build them,—who
   </p>
   <p>
    were above such trifling. But to proceed with my statistics.
   </p>
   <p>
    By surveying, carpentry, and day-labor of various other kinds in the
   </p>
   <p>
    village in the mean while, for I have as many trades as fingers, I had
   </p>
   <p>
    earned $13.34. The expense of food for eight months, namely, from July
   </p>
   <p>
    4th to March 1st, the time when these estimates were made, though I
   </p>
   <p>
    lived there more than two years,—not counting potatoes, a little green
   </p>
   <p>
    corn, and some peas, which I had raised, nor considering the value of
   </p>
   <p>
    what was on hand at the last date, was
   </p>
   <p>
    Rice,................... $ 1.73½
   </p>
   <p>
    Molasses,................  1.73     Cheapest form of the
   </p>
   <p>
    saccharine.
   </p>
   <p>
    Rye meal,................  1.04¾
   </p>
   <p>
    Indian meal,.............  0.99¾     Cheaper than rye.
   </p>
   <p>
    Pork,....................  0.22
   </p>
   <p>
    All experiments which failed:
   </p>
   <p>
    Flour,...................  0.88  Costs more than Indian meal,
   </p>
   <p>
    both money and trouble.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sugar,...................  0.80
   </p>
   <p>
    Lard,....................  0.65

    Dried apple,.............  0.22
   </p>
   <p>
    Sweet potatoes,..........  0.10
   </p>
   <p>
    One pumpkin,.............  0.06
   </p>
   <p>
    One watermelon,..........  0.02
   </p>
   <p>
    Salt,....................  0.03
   </p>
   <p>
    Yes, I did eat $8.74, all told; but I should not thus unblushingly
   </p>
   <p>
    publish my guilt, if I did not know that most of my readers were
   </p>
   <p>
    equally guilty with myself, and that their deeds would look no better
   </p>
   <p>
    in print. The next year I sometimes caught a mess of fish for my
   </p>
   <p>
    dinner, and once I went so far as to slaughter a woodchuck which
   </p>
   <p>
    ravaged my bean-field,—effect his transmigration, as a Tartar would
   </p>
   <p>
    say,—and devour him, partly for experiment’s sake; but though it
   </p>
   <p>
    afforded me a momentary enjoyment, notwithstanding a musky flavor, I
   </p>
   <p>
    saw that the longest use would not make that a good practice, however
   </p>
   <p>
    it might seem to have your woodchucks ready dressed by the village
   </p>
   <p>
    butcher.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clothing and some incidental expenses within the same dates, though
   </p>
   <p>
    little can be inferred from this item, amounted to
   </p>
   <p>
    $8.40¾
   </p>
   <p>
    Oil and some household utensils,.......  2.00
   </p>
   <p>
    So that all the pecuniary outgoes, excepting for washing and mending,
   </p>
   <p>
    which for the most part were done out of the house, and their bills
   </p>
   <p>
    have not yet been received,—and these are all and more than all the
   </p>
   <p>
    ways by which money necessarily goes out in this part of the
   </p>
   <p>
    world,—were
   </p>
   <p>
    House,................................ $ 28.12½
   </p>
   <p>
    Farm one year,.......................... 14.72½
   </p>
   <p>
    Food eight months,......................  8.74
   </p>
   <p>
    Clothing, etc., eight months,...........  8.40¾
   </p>
   <p>
    Oil, &amp;c., eight months,.................  2.00
   </p>
   <p>
    ——————
   </p>
   <p>
    In all,........................... $ 61.99¾
   </p>
   <p>
    I address myself now to those of my readers who have a living to get.
   </p>
   <p>
    And to meet this I have for farm produce sold
   </p>
   <p>
    $23.44
   </p>
   <p>
    Earned by day-labor,...................  13.34
   </p>
   <p>
    ——————
   </p>
   <p>
    In all,............................ $36.78,
   </p>
   <p>
    which subtracted from the sum of the outgoes leaves a balance of
   </p>
   <p>
    $25.21¾ on the one side,—this being very nearly the means with which I
   </p>
   <p>
    started, and the measure of expenses to be incurred,—and on the other,
   </p>
   <p>
    beside the leisure and independence and health thus secured, a
   </p>
   <p>
    comfortable house for me as long as I choose to occupy it.
   </p>
   <p>
    These statistics, however accidental and therefore uninstructive they
   </p>
   <p>
    may appear, as they have a certain completeness, have a certain value
   </p>
   <p>
    also. Nothing was given me of which I have not rendered some account.
   </p>
   <p>
    It appears from the above estimate, that my food alone cost me in money
   </p>
   <p>
    about twenty-seven cents a week. It was, for nearly two years after
   </p>
   <p>
    this, rye and Indian meal without yeast, potatoes, rice, a very little
   </p>
   <p>
    salt pork, molasses, and salt, and my drink water. It was fit that I
   </p>
   <p>
    should live on rice, mainly, who loved so well the philosophy of India.
   </p>
   <p>
    To meet the objections of some inveterate cavillers, I may as well
   </p>
   <p>
    state, that if I dined out occasionally, as I always had done, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    trust shall have opportunities to do again, it was frequently to the
   </p>
   <p>
    detriment of my domestic arrangements. But the dining out, being, as I
   </p>
   <p>
    have stated, a constant element, does not in the least affect a
   </p>
   <p>
    comparative statement like this.
   </p>
   <p>
    I learned from my two years’ experience that it would cost incredibly
   </p>
   <p>
    little trouble to obtain one’s necessary food, even in this latitude;
   </p>
   <p>
    that a man may use as simple a diet as the animals, and yet retain
   </p>
   <p>
    health and strength. I have made a satisfactory dinner, satisfactory on
   </p>
   <p>
    several accounts, simply off a dish of purslane (_Portulaca oleracea_)
   </p>
   <p>
    which I gathered in my cornfield, boiled and salted. I give the Latin
   </p>
   <p>
    on account of the savoriness of the trivial name. And pray what more
   </p>
   <p>
    can a reasonable man desire, in peaceful times, in ordinary noons, than
   </p>
   <p>
    a sufficient number of ears of green sweet-corn boiled, with the
   </p>
   <p>
    addition of salt? Even the little variety which I used was a yielding
   </p>
   <p>
    to the demands of appetite, and not of health. Yet men have come to
   </p>
   <p>
    such a pass that they frequently starve, not for want of necessaries,
   </p>
   <p>
    but for want of luxuries; and I know a good woman who thinks that her
   </p>
   <p>
    son lost his life because he took to drinking water only.
   </p>
   <p>
    The reader will perceive that I am treating the subject rather from an
   </p>
   <p>
    economic than a dietetic point of view, and he will not venture to put
   </p>
   <p>
    my abstemiousness to the test unless he has a well-stocked larder.
   </p>
   <p>
    Bread I at first made of pure Indian meal and salt, genuine hoe-cakes,
   </p>
   <p>
    which I baked before my fire out of doors on a shingle or the end of a
   </p>
   <p>
    stick of timber sawed off in building my house; but it was wont to get
   </p>
   <p>
    smoked and to have a piny flavor. I tried flour also; but have at last
   </p>
   <p>
    found a mixture of rye and Indian meal most convenient and agreeable.
   </p>
   <p>
    In cold weather it was no little amusement to bake several small loaves
   </p>
   <p>
    of this in succession, tending and turning them as carefully as an
   </p>
   <p>
    Egyptian his hatching eggs. They were a real cereal fruit which I
   </p>
   <p>
    ripened, and they had to my senses a fragrance like that of other noble
   </p>
   <p>
    fruits, which I kept in as long as possible by wrapping them in cloths.
   </p>
   <p>
    I made a study of the ancient and indispensable art of bread-making,
   </p>
   <p>
    consulting such authorities as offered, going back to the primitive
   </p>
   <p>
    days and first invention of the unleavened kind, when from the wildness
   </p>
   <p>
    of nuts and meats men first reached the mildness and refinement of this
   </p>
   <p>
    diet, and travelling gradually down in my studies through that
   </p>
   <p>
    accidental souring of the dough which, it is supposed, taught the
   </p>
   <p>
    leavening process, and through the various fermentations thereafter,
   </p>
   <p>
    till I came to “good, sweet, wholesome bread,” the staff of life.
   </p>
   <p>
    Leaven, which some deem the soul of bread, the _spiritus_ which fills
   </p>
   <p>
    its cellular tissue, which is religiously preserved like the vestal
   </p>
   <p>
    fire,—some precious bottle-full, I suppose, first brought over in the
   </p>
   <p>
    Mayflower, did the business for America, and its influence is still
   </p>
   <p>
    rising, swelling, spreading, in cerealian billows over the land,—this
   </p>
   <p>
    seed I regularly and faithfully procured from the village, till at
   </p>
   <p>
    length one morning I forgot the rules, and scalded my yeast; by which
   </p>
   <p>
    accident I discovered that even this was not indispensable,—for my
   </p>
   <p>
    discoveries were not by the synthetic but analytic process,—and I have
   </p>
   <p>
    gladly omitted it since, though most housewives earnestly assured me
   </p>
   <p>
    that safe and wholesome bread without yeast might not be, and elderly
   </p>
   <p>
    people prophesied a speedy decay of the vital forces. Yet I find it not
   </p>
   <p>
    to be an essential ingredient, and after going without it for a year am
   </p>
   <p>
    still in the land of the living; and I am glad to escape the
   </p>
   <p>
    trivialness of carrying a bottle-full in my pocket, which would
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes pop and discharge its contents to my discomfiture. It is
   </p>
   <p>
    simpler and more respectable to omit it. Man is an animal who more than
   </p>
   <p>
    any other can adapt himself to all climates and circumstances. Neither
   </p>
   <p>
    did I put any sal soda, or other acid or alkali, into my bread. It
   </p>
   <p>
    would seem that I made it according to the recipe which Marcus Porcius
   </p>
   <p>
    Cato gave about two centuries before Christ. “Panem depsticium sic
   </p>
   <p>
    facito. Manus mortariumque bene lavato. Farinam in mortarium indito,
   </p>
   <p>
    aquæ paulatim addito, subigitoque pulchre. Ubi bene subegeris,
   </p>
   <p>
    defingito, coquitoque sub testu.” Which I take to mean—“Make kneaded
   </p>
   <p>
    bread thus. Wash your hands and trough well. Put the meal into the
   </p>
   <p>
    trough, add water gradually, and knead it thoroughly. When you have
   </p>
   <p>
    kneaded it well, mould it, and bake it under a cover,” that is, in a
   </p>
   <p>
    baking-kettle. Not a word about leaven. But I did not always use this
   </p>
   <p>
    staff of life. At one time, owing to the emptiness of my purse, I saw
   </p>
   <p>
    none of it for more than a month.
   </p>
   <p>
    Every New Englander might easily raise all his own breadstuffs in this
   </p>
   <p>
    land of rye and Indian corn, and not depend on distant and fluctuating
   </p>
   <p>
    markets for them. Yet so far are we from simplicity and independence
   </p>
   <p>
    that, in Concord, fresh and sweet meal is rarely sold in the shops, and
   </p>
   <p>
    hominy and corn in a still coarser form are hardly used by any. For the
   </p>
   <p>
    most part the farmer gives to his cattle and hogs the grain of his own
   </p>
   <p>
    producing, and buys flour, which is at least no more wholesome, at a
   </p>
   <p>
    greater cost, at the store. I saw that I could easily raise my bushel
   </p>
   <p>
    or two of rye and Indian corn, for the former will grow on the poorest
   </p>
   <p>
    land, and the latter does not require the best, and grind them in a
   </p>
   <p>
    hand-mill, and so do without rice and pork; and if I must have some
   </p>
   <p>
    concentrated sweet, I found by experiment that I could make a very good
   </p>
   <p>
    molasses either of pumpkins or beets, and I knew that I needed only to
   </p>
   <p>
    set out a few maples to obtain it more easily still, and while these
   </p>
   <p>
    were growing I could use various substitutes beside those which I have
   </p>
   <p>
    named. “For,” as the Forefathers sang,—
   </p>
   <p>
    “we can make liquor to sweeten our lips
   </p>
   <p>
    Of pumpkins and parsnips and walnut-tree chips.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Finally, as for salt, that grossest of groceries, to obtain this might
   </p>
   <p>
    be a fit occasion for a visit to the seashore, or, if I did without it
   </p>
   <p>
    altogether, I should probably drink the less water. I do not learn that
   </p>
   <p>
    the Indians ever troubled themselves to go after it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus I could avoid all trade and barter, so far as my food was
   </p>
   <p>
    concerned, and having a shelter already, it would only remain to get
   </p>
   <p>
    clothing and fuel. The pantaloons which I now wear were woven in a
   </p>
   <p>
    farmer’s family,—thank Heaven there is so much virtue still in man; for
   </p>
   <p>
    I think the fall from the farmer to the operative as great and
   </p>
   <p>
    memorable as that from the man to the farmer;—and in a new country,
   </p>
   <p>
    fuel is an encumbrance. As for a habitat, if I were not permitted still
   </p>
   <p>
    to squat, I might purchase one acre at the same price for which the
   </p>
   <p>
    land I cultivated was sold—namely, eight dollars and eight cents. But
   </p>
   <p>
    as it was, I considered that I enhanced the value of the land by
   </p>
   <p>
    squatting on it.
   </p>
   <p>
    There is a certain class of unbelievers who sometimes ask me such
   </p>
   <p>
    questions as, if I think that I can live on vegetable food alone; and
   </p>
   <p>
    to strike at the root of the matter at once,—for the root is faith,—I
   </p>
   <p>
    am accustomed to answer such, that I can live on board nails. If they
   </p>
   <p>
    cannot understand that, they cannot understand much that I have to say.
   </p>
   <p>
    For my part, I am glad to hear of experiments of this kind being tried;
   </p>
   <p>
    as that a young man tried for a fortnight to live on hard, raw corn on
   </p>
   <p>
    the ear, using his teeth for all mortar. The squirrel tribe tried the
   </p>
   <p>
    same and succeeded. The human race is interested in these experiments,
   </p>
   <p>
    though a few old women who are incapacitated for them, or who own their
   </p>
   <p>
    thirds in mills, may be alarmed.
   </p>
   <p>
    My furniture, part of which I made myself, and the rest cost me nothing
   </p>
   <p>
    of which I have not rendered an account, consisted of a bed, a table, a
   </p>
   <p>
    desk, three chairs, a looking-glass three inches in diameter, a pair of
   </p>
   <p>
    tongs and andirons, a kettle, a skillet, and a frying-pan, a dipper, a
   </p>
   <p>
    wash-bowl, two knives and forks, three plates, one cup, one spoon, a
   </p>
   <p>
    jug for oil, a jug for molasses, and a japanned lamp. None is so poor
   </p>
   <p>
    that he need sit on a pumpkin. That is shiftlessness. There is a plenty
   </p>
   <p>
    of such chairs as I like best in the village garrets to be had for
   </p>
   <p>
    taking them away. Furniture! Thank God, I can sit and I can stand
   </p>
   <p>
    without the aid of a furniture warehouse. What man but a philosopher
   </p>
   <p>
    would not be ashamed to see his furniture packed in a cart and going up
   </p>
   <p>
    country exposed to the light of heaven and the eyes of men, a beggarly
   </p>
   <p>
    account of empty boxes? That is Spaulding’s furniture. I could never
   </p>
   <p>
    tell from inspecting such a load whether it belonged to a so called
   </p>
   <p>
    rich man or a poor one; the owner always seemed poverty-stricken.
   </p>
   <p>
    Indeed, the more you have of such things the poorer you are. Each load
   </p>
   <p>
    looks as if it contained the contents of a dozen shanties; and if one
   </p>
   <p>
    shanty is poor, this is a dozen times as poor. Pray, for what do we
   </p>
   <p>
    _move_ ever but to get rid of our furniture, our _exuviæ_; at last to
   </p>
   <p>
    go from this world to another newly furnished, and leave this to be
   </p>
   <p>
    burned? It is the same as if all these traps were buckled to a man’s
   </p>
   <p>
    belt, and he could not move over the rough country where our lines are
   </p>
   <p>
    cast without dragging them,—dragging his trap. He was a lucky fox that
   </p>
   <p>
    left his tail in the trap. The muskrat will gnaw his third leg off to
   </p>
   <p>
    be free. No wonder man has lost his elasticity. How often he is at a
   </p>
   <p>
    dead set! “Sir, if I may be so bold, what do you mean by a dead set?”
   </p>
   <p>
    If you are a seer, whenever you meet a man you will see all that he
   </p>
   <p>
    owns, ay, and much that he pretends to disown, behind him, even to his
   </p>
   <p>
    kitchen furniture and all the trumpery which he saves and will not
   </p>
   <p>
    burn, and he will appear to be harnessed to it and making what headway
   </p>
   <p>
    he can. I think that the man is at a dead set who has got through a
   </p>
   <p>
    knot hole or gateway where his sledge load of furniture cannot follow
   </p>
   <p>
    him. I cannot but feel compassion when I hear some trig,
   </p>
   <p>
    compact-looking man, seemingly free, all girded and ready, speak of his
   </p>
   <p>
    “furniture,” as whether it is insured or not. “But what shall I do with
   </p>
   <p>
    my furniture?” My gay butterfly is entangled in a spider’s web then.
   </p>
   <p>
    Even those who seem for a long while not to have any, if you inquire
   </p>
   <p>
    more narrowly you will find have some stored in somebody’s barn. I look
   </p>
   <p>
    upon England to-day as an old gentleman who is travelling with a great
   </p>
   <p>
    deal of baggage, trumpery which has accumulated from long housekeeping,
   </p>
   <p>
    which he has not the courage to burn; great trunk, little trunk,
   </p>
   <p>
    bandbox and bundle. Throw away the first three at least. It would
   </p>
   <p>
    surpass the powers of a well man nowadays to take up his bed and walk,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I should certainly advise a sick one to lay down his bed and run.
   </p>
   <p>
    When I have met an immigrant tottering under a bundle which contained
   </p>
   <p>
    his all—looking like an enormous wen which had grown out of the nape of
   </p>
   <p>
    his neck—I have pitied him, not because that was his all, but because
   </p>
   <p>
    he had all _that_ to carry. If I have got to drag my trap, I will take
   </p>
   <p>
    care that it be a light one and do not nip me in a vital part. But
   </p>
   <p>
    perchance it would be wisest never to put one’s paw into it.
   </p>
   <p>
    I would observe, by the way, that it costs me nothing for curtains, for
   </p>
   <p>
    I have no gazers to shut out but the sun and moon, and I am willing
   </p>
   <p>
    that they should look in. The moon will not sour milk nor taint meat of
   </p>
   <p>
    mine, nor will the sun injure my furniture or fade my carpet, and if he
   </p>
   <p>
    is sometimes too warm a friend, I find it still better economy to
   </p>
   <p>
    retreat behind some curtain which nature has provided, than to add a
   </p>
   <p>
    single item to the details of housekeeping. A lady once offered me a
   </p>
   <p>
    mat, but as I had no room to spare within the house, nor time to spare
   </p>
   <p>
    within or without to shake it, I declined it, preferring to wipe my
   </p>
   <p>
    feet on the sod before my door. It is best to avoid the beginnings of
   </p>
   <p>
    evil.
   </p>
   <p>
    Not long since I was present at the auction of a deacon’s effects, for
   </p>
   <p>
    his life had not been ineffectual:—
   </p>
   <p>
    “The evil that men do lives after them.”
   </p>
   <p>
    As usual, a great proportion was trumpery which had begun to accumulate
   </p>
   <p>
    in his father’s day. Among the rest was a dried tapeworm. And now,
   </p>
   <p>
    after lying half a century in his garret and other dust holes, these
   </p>
   <p>
    things were not burned; instead of a _bonfire_, or purifying
   </p>
   <p>
    destruction of them, there was an _auction_, or increasing of them. The
   </p>
   <p>
    neighbors eagerly collected to view them, bought them all, and
   </p>
   <p>
    carefully transported them to their garrets and dust holes, to lie
   </p>
   <p>
    there till their estates are settled, when they will start again. When
   </p>
   <p>
    a man dies he kicks the dust.
   </p>
   <p>
    The customs of some savage nations might, perchance, be profitably
   </p>
   <p>
    imitated by us, for they at least go through the semblance of casting
   </p>
   <p>
    their slough annually; they have the idea of the thing, whether they
   </p>
   <p>
    have the reality or not. Would it not be well if we were to celebrate
   </p>
   <p>
    such a “busk,” or “feast of first fruits,” as Bartram describes to have
   </p>
   <p>
    been the custom of the Mucclasse Indians? “When a town celebrates the
   </p>
   <p>
    busk,” says he, “having previously provided themselves with new
   </p>
   <p>
    clothes, new pots, pans, and other household utensils and furniture,
   </p>
   <p>
    they collect all their worn out clothes and other despicable things,
   </p>
   <p>
    sweep and cleanse their houses, squares, and the whole town of their
   </p>
   <p>
    filth, which with all the remaining grain and other old provisions they
   </p>
   <p>
    cast together into one common heap, and consume it with fire. After
   </p>
   <p>
    having taken medicine, and fasted for three days, all the fire in the
   </p>
   <p>
    town is extinguished. During this fast they abstain from the
   </p>
   <p>
    gratification of every appetite and passion whatever. A general amnesty
   </p>
   <p>
    is proclaimed; all malefactors may return to their town.—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “On the fourth morning, the high priest, by rubbing dry wood together,
   </p>
   <p>
    produces new fire in the public square, from whence every habitation in
   </p>
   <p>
    the town is supplied with the new and pure flame.”
   </p>
   <p>
    They then feast on the new corn and fruits, and dance and sing for
   </p>
   <p>
    three days, “and the four following days they receive visits and
   </p>
   <p>
    rejoice with their friends from neighboring towns who have in like
   </p>
   <p>
    manner purified and prepared themselves.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The Mexicans also practised a similar purification at the end of every
   </p>
   <p>
    fifty-two years, in the belief that it was time for the world to come
   </p>
   <p>
    to an end.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have scarcely heard of a truer sacrament, that is, as the dictionary
   </p>
   <p>
    defines it, “outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual
   </p>
   <p>
    grace,” than this, and I have no doubt that they were originally
   </p>
   <p>
    inspired directly from Heaven to do thus, though they have no biblical
   </p>
   <p>
    record of the revelation.
   </p>
   <p>
    For more than five years I maintained myself thus solely by the labor
   </p>
   <p>
    of my hands, and I found, that by working about six weeks in a year, I
   </p>
   <p>
    could meet all the expenses of living. The whole of my winters, as well
   </p>
   <p>
    as most of my summers, I had free and clear for study. I have
   </p>
   <p>
    thoroughly tried school-keeping, and found that my expenses were in
   </p>
   <p>
    proportion, or rather out of proportion, to my income, for I was
   </p>
   <p>
    obliged to dress and train, not to say think and believe, accordingly,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I lost my time into the bargain. As I did not teach for the good of
   </p>
   <p>
    my fellow-men, but simply for a livelihood, this was a failure. I have
   </p>
   <p>
    tried trade; but I found that it would take ten years to get under way
   </p>
   <p>
    in that, and that then I should probably be on my way to the devil. I
   </p>
   <p>
    was actually afraid that I might by that time be doing what is called a
   </p>
   <p>
    good business. When formerly I was looking about to see what I could do
   </p>
   <p>
    for a living, some sad experience in conforming to the wishes of
   </p>
   <p>
    friends being fresh in my mind to tax my ingenuity, I thought often and
   </p>
   <p>
    seriously of picking huckleberries; that surely I could do, and its
   </p>
   <p>
    small profits might suffice,—for my greatest skill has been to want but
   </p>
   <p>
    little,—so little capital it required, so little distraction from my
   </p>
   <p>
    wonted moods, I foolishly thought. While my acquaintances went
   </p>
   <p>
    unhesitatingly into trade or the professions, I contemplated this
   </p>
   <p>
    occupation as most like theirs; ranging the hills all summer to pick
   </p>
   <p>
    the berries which came in my way, and thereafter carelessly dispose of
   </p>
   <p>
    them; so, to keep the flocks of Admetus. I also dreamed that I might
   </p>
   <p>
    gather the wild herbs, or carry evergreens to such villagers as loved
   </p>
   <p>
    to be reminded of the woods, even to the city, by hay-cart loads. But I
   </p>
   <p>
    have since learned that trade curses everything it handles; and though
   </p>
   <p>
    you trade in messages from heaven, the whole curse of trade attaches to
   </p>
   <p>
    the business.
   </p>
   <p>
    As I preferred some things to others, and especially valued my freedom,
   </p>
   <p>
    as I could fare hard and yet succeed well, I did not wish to spend my
   </p>
   <p>
    time in earning rich carpets or other fine furniture, or delicate
   </p>
   <p>
    cookery, or a house in the Grecian or the Gothic style just yet. If
   </p>
   <p>
    there are any to whom it is no interruption to acquire these things,
   </p>
   <p>
    and who know how to use them when acquired, I relinquish to them the
   </p>
   <p>
    pursuit. Some are “industrious,” and appear to love labor for its own
   </p>
   <p>
    sake, or perhaps because it keeps them out of worse mischief; to such I
   </p>
   <p>
    have at present nothing to say. Those who would not know what to do
   </p>
   <p>
    with more leisure than they now enjoy, I might advise to work twice as
   </p>
   <p>
    hard as they do,—work till they pay for themselves, and get their free
   </p>
   <p>
    papers. For myself I found that the occupation of a day-laborer was the
   </p>
   <p>
    most independent of any, especially as it required only thirty or forty
   </p>
   <p>
    days in a year to support one. The laborer’s day ends with the going
   </p>
   <p>
    down of the sun, and he is then free to devote himself to his chosen
   </p>
   <p>
    pursuit, independent of his labor; but his employer, who speculates
   </p>
   <p>
    from month to month, has no respite from one end of the year to the
   </p>
   <p>
    other.
   </p>
   <p>
    In short, I am convinced, both by faith and experience, that to
   </p>
   <p>
    maintain one’s self on this earth is not a hardship but a pastime, if
   </p>
   <p>
    we will live simply and wisely; as the pursuits of the simpler nations
   </p>
   <p>
    are still the sports of the more artificial. It is not necessary that a
   </p>
   <p>
    man should earn his living by the sweat of his brow, unless he sweats
   </p>
   <p>
    easier than I do.
   </p>
   <p>
    One young man of my acquaintance, who has inherited some acres, told me
   </p>
   <p>
    that he thought he should live as I did, _if he had the means_. I would
   </p>
   <p>
    not have any one adopt _my_ mode of living on any account; for, beside
   </p>
   <p>
    that before he has fairly learned it I may have found out another for
   </p>
   <p>
    myself, I desire that there may be as many different persons in the
   </p>
   <p>
    world as possible; but I would have each one be very careful to find
   </p>
   <p>
    out and pursue _his own_ way, and not his father’s or his mother’s or
   </p>
   <p>
    his neighbor’s instead. The youth may build or plant or sail, only let
   </p>
   <p>
    him not be hindered from doing that which he tells me he would like to
   </p>
   <p>
    do. It is by a mathematical point only that we are wise, as the sailor
   </p>
   <p>
    or the fugitive slave keeps the polestar in his eye; but that is
   </p>
   <p>
    sufficient guidance for all our life. We may not arrive at our port
   </p>
   <p>
    within a calculable period, but we would preserve the true course.
   </p>
   <p>
    Undoubtedly, in this case, what is true for one is truer still for a
   </p>
   <p>
    thousand, as a large house is not proportionally more expensive than a
   </p>
   <p>
    small one, since one roof may cover, one cellar underlie, and one wall
   </p>
   <p>
    separate several apartments. But for my part, I preferred the solitary
   </p>
   <p>
    dwelling. Moreover, it will commonly be cheaper to build the whole
   </p>
   <p>
    yourself than to convince another of the advantage of the common wall;
   </p>
   <p>
    and when you have done this, the common partition, to be much cheaper,
   </p>
   <p>
    must be a thin one, and that other may prove a bad neighbor, and also
   </p>
   <p>
    not keep his side in repair. The only coöperation which is commonly
   </p>
   <p>
    possible is exceedingly partial and superficial; and what little true
   </p>
   <p>
    coöperation there is, is as if it were not, being a harmony inaudible
   </p>
   <p>
    to men. If a man has faith, he will coöperate with equal faith
   </p>
   <p>
    everywhere; if he has not faith, he will continue to live like the rest
   </p>
   <p>
    of the world, whatever company he is joined to. To coöperate, in the
   </p>
   <p>
    highest as well as the lowest sense, means _to get our living
   </p>
   <p>
    together_. I heard it proposed lately that two young men should travel
   </p>
   <p>
    together over the world, the one without money, earning his means as he
   </p>
   <p>
    went, before the mast and behind the plow, the other carrying a bill of
   </p>
   <p>
    exchange in his pocket. It was easy to see that they could not long be
   </p>
   <p>
    companions or coöperate, since one would not _operate_ at all. They
   </p>
   <p>
    would part at the first interesting crisis in their adventures. Above
   </p>
   <p>
    all, as I have implied, the man who goes alone can start to-day; but he
   </p>
   <p>
    who travels with another must wait till that other is ready, and it may
   </p>
   <p>
    be a long time before they get off.
   </p>
   <p>
    But all this is very selfish, I have heard some of my townsmen say. I
   </p>
   <p>
    confess that I have hitherto indulged very little in philanthropic
   </p>
   <p>
    enterprises. I have made some sacrifices to a sense of duty, and among
   </p>
   <p>
    others have sacrificed this pleasure also. There are those who have
   </p>
   <p>
    used all their arts to persuade me to undertake the support of some
   </p>
   <p>
    poor family in the town; and if I had nothing to do,—for the devil
   </p>
   <p>
    finds employment for the idle,—I might try my hand at some such pastime
   </p>
   <p>
    as that. However, when I have thought to indulge myself in this
   </p>
   <p>
    respect, and lay their Heaven under an obligation by maintaining
   </p>
   <p>
    certain poor persons in all respects as comfortably as I maintain
   </p>
   <p>
    myself, and have even ventured so far as to make them the offer, they
   </p>
   <p>
    have one and all unhesitatingly preferred to remain poor. While my
   </p>
   <p>
    townsmen and women are devoted in so many ways to the good of their
   </p>
   <p>
    fellows, I trust that one at least may be spared to other and less
   </p>
   <p>
    humane pursuits. You must have a genius for charity as well as for any
   </p>
   <p>
    thing else. As for Doing-good, that is one of the professions which are
   </p>
   <p>
    full. Moreover, I have tried it fairly, and, strange as it may seem, am
   </p>
   <p>
    satisfied that it does not agree with my constitution. Probably I
   </p>
   <p>
    should not consciously and deliberately forsake my particular calling
   </p>
   <p>
    to do the good which society demands of me, to save the universe from
   </p>
   <p>
    annihilation; and I believe that a like but infinitely greater
   </p>
   <p>
    steadfastness elsewhere is all that now preserves it. But I would not
   </p>
   <p>
    stand between any man and his genius; and to him who does this work,
   </p>
   <p>
    which I decline, with his whole heart and soul and life, I would say,
   </p>
   <p>
    Persevere, even if the world call it doing evil, as it is most likely
   </p>
   <p>
    they will.
   </p>
   <p>
    I am far from supposing that my case is a peculiar one; no doubt many
   </p>
   <p>
    of my readers would make a similar defence. At doing something,—I will
   </p>
   <p>
    not engage that my neighbors shall pronounce it good,—I do not hesitate
   </p>
   <p>
    to say that I should be a capital fellow to hire; but what that is, it
   </p>
   <p>
    is for my employer to find out. What _good_ I do, in the common sense
   </p>
   <p>
    of that word, must be aside from my main path, and for the most part
   </p>
   <p>
    wholly unintended. Men say, practically, Begin where you are and such
   </p>
   <p>
    as you are, without aiming mainly to become of more worth, and with
   </p>
   <p>
    kindness aforethought go about doing good. If I were to preach at all
   </p>
   <p>
    in this strain, I should say rather, Set about being good. As if the
   </p>
   <p>
    sun should stop when he had kindled his fires up to the splendor of a
   </p>
   <p>
    moon or a star of the sixth magnitude, and go about like a Robin
   </p>
   <p>
    Goodfellow, peeping in at every cottage window, inspiring lunatics, and
   </p>
   <p>
    tainting meats, and making darkness visible, instead of steadily
   </p>
   <p>
    increasing his genial heat and beneficence till he is of such
   </p>
   <p>
    brightness that no mortal can look him in the face, and then, and in
   </p>
   <p>
    the mean while too, going about the world in his own orbit, doing it
   </p>
   <p>
    good, or rather, as a truer philosophy has discovered, the world going
   </p>
   <p>
    about him getting good. When Phaeton, wishing to prove his heavenly
   </p>
   <p>
    birth by his beneficence, had the sun’s chariot but one day, and drove
   </p>
   <p>
    out of the beaten track, he burned several blocks of houses in the
   </p>
   <p>
    lower streets of heaven, and scorched the surface of the earth, and
   </p>
   <p>
    dried up every spring, and made the great desert of Sahara, till at
   </p>
   <p>
    length Jupiter hurled him headlong to the earth with a thunderbolt, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the sun, through grief at his death, did not shine for a year.
   </p>
   <p>
    There is no odor so bad as that which arises from goodness tainted. It
   </p>
   <p>
    is human, it is divine, carrion. If I knew for a certainty that a man
   </p>
   <p>
    was coming to my house with the conscious design of doing me good, I
   </p>
   <p>
    should run for my life, as from that dry and parching wind of the
   </p>
   <p>
    African deserts called the simoom, which fills the mouth and nose and
   </p>
   <p>
    ears and eyes with dust till you are suffocated, for fear that I should
   </p>
   <p>
    get some of his good done to me,—some of its virus mingled with my
   </p>
   <p>
    blood. No,—in this case I would rather suffer evil the natural way. A
   </p>
   <p>
    man is not a good _man_ to me because he will feed me if I should be
   </p>
   <p>
    starving, or warm me if I should be freezing, or pull me out of a ditch
   </p>
   <p>
    if I should ever fall into one. I can find you a Newfoundland dog that
   </p>
   <p>
    will do as much. Philanthropy is not love for one’s fellow-man in the
   </p>
   <p>
    broadest sense. Howard was no doubt an exceedingly kind and worthy man
   </p>
   <p>
    in his way, and has his reward; but, comparatively speaking, what are a
   </p>
   <p>
    hundred Howards to _us_, if their philanthropy do not help _us_ in our
   </p>
   <p>
    best estate, when we are most worthy to be helped? I never heard of a
   </p>
   <p>
    philanthropic meeting in which it was sincerely proposed to do any good
   </p>
   <p>
    to me, or the like of me.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Jesuits were quite balked by those Indians who, being burned at the
   </p>
   <p>
    stake, suggested new modes of torture to their tormentors. Being
   </p>
   <p>
    superior to physical suffering, it sometimes chanced that they were
   </p>
   <p>
    superior to any consolation which the missionaries could offer; and the
   </p>
   <p>
    law to do as you would be done by fell with less persuasiveness on the
   </p>
   <p>
    ears of those who, for their part, did not care how they were done by,
   </p>
   <p>
    who loved their enemies after a new fashion, and came very near freely
   </p>
   <p>
    forgiving them all they did.
   </p>
   <p>
    Be sure that you give the poor the aid they most need, though it be
   </p>
   <p>
    your example which leaves them far behind. If you give money, spend
   </p>
   <p>
    yourself with it, and do not merely abandon it to them. We make curious
   </p>
   <p>
    mistakes sometimes. Often the poor man is not so cold and hungry as he
   </p>
   <p>
    is dirty and ragged and gross. It is partly his taste, and not merely
   </p>
   <p>
    his misfortune. If you give him money, he will perhaps buy more rags
   </p>
   <p>
    with it. I was wont to pity the clumsy Irish laborers who cut ice on
   </p>
   <p>
    the pond, in such mean and ragged clothes, while I shivered in my more
   </p>
   <p>
    tidy and somewhat more fashionable garments, till, one bitter cold day,
   </p>
   <p>
    one who had slipped into the water came to my house to warm him, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    saw him strip off three pairs of pants and two pairs of stockings ere
   </p>
   <p>
    he got down to the skin, though they were dirty and ragged enough, it
   </p>
   <p>
    is true, and that he could afford to refuse the _extra_ garments which
   </p>
   <p>
    I offered him, he had so many _intra_ ones. This ducking was the very
   </p>
   <p>
    thing he needed. Then I began to pity myself, and I saw that it would
   </p>
   <p>
    be a greater charity to bestow on me a flannel shirt than a whole
   </p>
   <p>
    slop-shop on him. There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil
   </p>
   <p>
    to one who is striking at the root, and it may be that he who bestows
   </p>
   <p>
    the largest amount of time and money on the needy is doing the most by
   </p>
   <p>
    his mode of life to produce that misery which he strives in vain to
   </p>
   <p>
    relieve. It is the pious slave-breeder devoting the proceeds of every
   </p>
   <p>
    tenth slave to buy a Sunday’s liberty for the rest. Some show their
   </p>
   <p>
    kindness to the poor by employing them in their kitchens. Would they
   </p>
   <p>
    not be kinder if they employed themselves there? You boast of spending
   </p>
   <p>
    a tenth part of your income in charity; maybe you should spend the nine
   </p>
   <p>
    tenths so, and done with it. Society recovers only a tenth part of the
   </p>
   <p>
    property then. Is this owing to the generosity of him in whose
   </p>
   <p>
    possession it is found, or to the remissness of the officers of
   </p>
   <p>
    justice?
   </p>
   <p>
    Philanthropy is almost the only virtue which is sufficiently
   </p>
   <p>
    appreciated by mankind. Nay, it is greatly overrated; and it is our
   </p>
   <p>
    selfishness which overrates it. A robust poor man, one sunny day here
   </p>
   <p>
    in Concord, praised a fellow-townsman to me, because, as he said, he
   </p>
   <p>
    was kind to the poor; meaning himself. The kind uncles and aunts of the
   </p>
   <p>
    race are more esteemed than its true spiritual fathers and mothers. I
   </p>
   <p>
    once heard a reverend lecturer on England, a man of learning and
   </p>
   <p>
    intelligence, after enumerating her scientific, literary, and political
   </p>
   <p>
    worthies, Shakespeare, Bacon, Cromwell, Milton, Newton, and others,
   </p>
   <p>
    speak next of her Christian heroes, whom, as if his profession required
   </p>
   <p>
    it of him, he elevated to a place far above all the rest, as the
   </p>
   <p>
    greatest of the great. They were Penn, Howard, and Mrs. Fry. Every one
   </p>
   <p>
    must feel the falsehood and cant of this. The last were not England’s
   </p>
   <p>
    best men and women; only, perhaps, her best philanthropists.
   </p>
   <p>
    I would not subtract any thing from the praise that is due to
   </p>
   <p>
    philanthropy, but merely demand justice for all who by their lives and
   </p>
   <p>
    works are a blessing to mankind. I do not value chiefly a man’s
   </p>
   <p>
    uprightness and benevolence, which are, as it were, his stem and
   </p>
   <p>
    leaves. Those plants of whose greenness withered we make herb tea for
   </p>
   <p>
    the sick, serve but a humble use, and are most employed by quacks. I
   </p>
   <p>
    want the flower and fruit of a man; that some fragrance be wafted over
   </p>
   <p>
    from him to me, and some ripeness flavor our intercourse. His goodness
   </p>
   <p>
    must not be a partial and transitory act, but a constant superfluity,
   </p>
   <p>
    which costs him nothing and of which he is unconscious. This is a
   </p>
   <p>
    charity that hides a multitude of sins. The philanthropist too often
   </p>
   <p>
    surrounds mankind with the remembrance of his own cast-off griefs as an
   </p>
   <p>
    atmosphere, and calls it sympathy. We should impart our courage, and
   </p>
   <p>
    not our despair, our health and ease, and not our disease, and take
   </p>
   <p>
    care that this does not spread by contagion. From what southern plains
   </p>
   <p>
    comes up the voice of wailing? Under what latitudes reside the heathen
   </p>
   <p>
    to whom we would send light? Who is that intemperate and brutal man
   </p>
   <p>
    whom we would redeem? If any thing ail a man, so that he does not
   </p>
   <p>
    perform his functions, if he have a pain in his bowels even,—for that
   </p>
   <p>
    is the seat of sympathy,—he forthwith sets about reforming—the world.
   </p>
   <p>
    Being a microcosm himself, he discovers, and it is a true discovery,
   </p>
   <p>
    and he is the man to make it,—that the world has been eating green
   </p>
   <p>
    apples; to his eyes, in fact, the globe itself is a great green apple,
   </p>
   <p>
    which there is danger awful to think of that the children of men will
   </p>
   <p>
    nibble before it is ripe; and straightway his drastic philanthropy
   </p>
   <p>
    seeks out the Esquimaux and the Patagonian, and embraces the populous
   </p>
   <p>
    Indian and Chinese villages; and thus, by a few years of philanthropic
   </p>
   <p>
    activity, the powers in the mean while using him for their own ends, no
   </p>
   <p>
    doubt, he cures himself of his dyspepsia, the globe acquires a faint
   </p>
   <p>
    blush on one or both of its cheeks, as if it were beginning to be ripe,
   </p>
   <p>
    and life loses its crudity and is once more sweet and wholesome to
   </p>
   <p>
    live. I never dreamed of any enormity greater than I have committed. I
   </p>
   <p>
    never knew, and never shall know, a worse man than myself.
   </p>
   <p>
    I believe that what so saddens the reformer is not his sympathy with
   </p>
   <p>
    his fellows in distress, but, though he be the holiest son of God, is
   </p>
   <p>
    his private ail. Let this be righted, let the spring come to him, the
   </p>
   <p>
    morning rise over his couch, and he will forsake his generous
   </p>
   <p>
    companions without apology. My excuse for not lecturing against the use
   </p>
   <p>
    of tobacco is, that I never chewed it; that is a penalty which reformed
   </p>
   <p>
    tobacco-chewers have to pay; though there are things enough I have
   </p>
   <p>
    chewed, which I could lecture against. If you should ever be betrayed
   </p>
   <p>
    into any of these philanthropies, do not let your left hand know what
   </p>
   <p>
    your right hand does, for it is not worth knowing. Rescue the drowning
   </p>
   <p>
    and tie your shoe-strings. Take your time, and set about some free
   </p>
   <p>
    labor.
   </p>
   <p>
    Our manners have been corrupted by communication with the saints. Our
   </p>
   <p>
    hymn-books resound with a melodious cursing of God and enduring him
   </p>
   <p>
    forever. One would say that even the prophets and redeemers had rather
   </p>
   <p>
    consoled the fears than confirmed the hopes of man. There is nowhere
   </p>
   <p>
    recorded a simple and irrepressible satisfaction with the gift of life,
   </p>
   <p>
    any memorable praise of God. All health and success does me good,
   </p>
   <p>
    however far off and withdrawn it may appear; all disease and failure
   </p>
   <p>
    helps to make me sad and does me evil, however much sympathy it may
   </p>
   <p>
    have with me or I with it. If, then, we would indeed restore mankind by
   </p>
   <p>
    truly Indian, botanic, magnetic, or natural means, let us first be as
   </p>
   <p>
    simple and well as Nature ourselves, dispel the clouds which hang over
   </p>
   <p>
    our own brows, and take up a little life into our pores. Do not stay to
   </p>
   <p>
    be an overseer of the poor, but endeavor to become one of the worthies
   </p>
   <p>
    of the world.
   </p>
   <p>
    I read in the Gulistan, or Flower Garden, of Sheik Sadi of Shiraz, that
   </p>
   <p>
    “They asked a wise man, saying; Of the many celebrated trees which the
   </p>
   <p>
    Most High God has created lofty and umbrageous, they call none azad, or
   </p>
   <p>
    free, excepting the cypress, which bears no fruit; what mystery is
   </p>
   <p>
    there in this? He replied; Each has its appropriate produce, and
   </p>
   <p>
    appointed season, during the continuance of which it is fresh and
   </p>
   <p>
    blooming, and during their absence dry and withered; to neither of
   </p>
   <p>
    which states is the cypress exposed, being always flourishing; and of
   </p>
   <p>
    this nature are the azads, or religious independents.—Fix not thy heart
   </p>
   <p>
    on that which is transitory; for the Dijlah, or Tigris, will continue
   </p>
   <p>
    to flow through Bagdad after the race of caliphs is extinct: if thy
   </p>
   <p>
    hand has plenty, be liberal as the date tree; but if it affords nothing
   </p>
   <p>
    to give away, be an azad, or free man, like the cypress.”

   <p>
    Where I Lived, and What I Lived For
   </p>
   <p>
    At a certain season of our life we are accustomed to consider every
   </p>
   <p>
    spot as the possible site of a house. I have thus surveyed the country
   </p>
   <p>
    on every side within a dozen miles of where I live. In imagination I
   </p>
   <p>
    have bought all the farms in succession, for all were to be bought, and
   </p>
   <p>
    I knew their price. I walked over each farmer’s premises, tasted his
   </p>
   <p>
    wild apples, discoursed on husbandry with him, took his farm at his
   </p>
   <p>
    price, at any price, mortgaging it to him in my mind; even put a higher
   </p>
   <p>
    price on it,—took everything but a deed of it,—took his word for his
   </p>
   <p>
    deed, for I dearly love to talk,—cultivated it, and him too to some
   </p>
   <p>
    extent, I trust, and withdrew when I had enjoyed it long enough,
   </p>
   <p>
    leaving him to carry it on. This experience entitled me to be regarded
   </p>
   <p>
    as a sort of real-estate broker by my friends. Wherever I sat, there I
   </p>
   <p>
    might live, and the landscape radiated from me accordingly. What is a
   </p>
   <p>
    house but a _sedes_, a seat?—better if a country seat. I discovered
   </p>
   <p>
    many a site for a house not likely to be soon improved, which some
   </p>
   <p>
    might have thought too far from the village, but to my eyes the village
   </p>
   <p>
    was too far from it. Well, there I might live, I said; and there I did
   </p>
   <p>
    live, for an hour, a summer and a winter life; saw how I could let the
   </p>
   <p>
    years run off, buffet the winter through, and see the spring come in.
   </p>
   <p>
    The future inhabitants of this region, wherever they may place their
   </p>
   <p>
    houses, may be sure that they have been anticipated. An afternoon
   </p>
   <p>
    sufficed to lay out the land into orchard, woodlot, and pasture, and to
   </p>
   <p>
    decide what fine oaks or pines should be left to stand before the door,
   </p>
   <p>
    and whence each blasted tree could be seen to the best advantage; and
   </p>
   <p>
    then I let it lie, fallow perchance, for a man is rich in proportion to
   </p>
   <p>
    the number of things which he can afford to let alone.
   </p>
   <p>
    My imagination carried me so far that I even had the refusal of several
   </p>
   <p>
    farms,—the refusal was all I wanted,—but I never got my fingers burned
   </p>
   <p>
    by actual possession. The nearest that I came to actual possession was
   </p>
   <p>
    when I bought the Hollowell place, and had begun to sort my seeds, and
   </p>
   <p>
    collected materials with which to make a wheelbarrow to carry it on or
   </p>
   <p>
    off with; but before the owner gave me a deed of it, his wife—every man
   </p>
   <p>
    has such a wife—changed her mind and wished to keep it, and he offered
   </p>
   <p>
    me ten dollars to release him. Now, to speak the truth, I had but ten
   </p>
   <p>
    cents in the world, and it surpassed my arithmetic to tell, if I was
   </p>
   <p>
    that man who had ten cents, or who had a farm, or ten dollars, or all
   </p>
   <p>
    together. However, I let him keep the ten dollars and the farm too, for
   </p>
   <p>
    I had carried it far enough; or rather, to be generous, I sold him the
   </p>
   <p>
    farm for just what I gave for it, and, as he was not a rich man, made
   </p>
   <p>
    him a present of ten dollars, and still had my ten cents, and seeds,
   </p>
   <p>
    and materials for a wheelbarrow left. I found thus that I had been a
   </p>
   <p>
    rich man without any damage to my poverty. But I retained the
   </p>
   <p>
    landscape, and I have since annually carried off what it yielded
   </p>
   <p>
    without a wheelbarrow. With respect to landscapes,—
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am monarch of all I _survey_,
   </p>
   <p>
    My right there is none to dispute.”
   </p>
   <p>
    I have frequently seen a poet withdraw, having enjoyed the most
   </p>
   <p>
    valuable part of a farm, while the crusty farmer supposed that he had
   </p>
   <p>
    got a few wild apples only. Why, the owner does not know it for many
   </p>
   <p>
    years when a poet has put his farm in rhyme, the most admirable kind of
   </p>
   <p>
    invisible fence, has fairly impounded it, milked it, skimmed it, and
   </p>
   <p>
    got all the cream, and left the farmer only the skimmed milk.
   </p>
   <p>
    The real attractions of the Hollowell farm, to me, were; its complete
   </p>
   <p>
    retirement, being, about two miles from the village, half a mile from
   </p>
   <p>
    the nearest neighbor, and separated from the highway by a broad field;
   </p>
   <p>
    its bounding on the river, which the owner said protected it by its
   </p>
   <p>
    fogs from frosts in the spring, though that was nothing to me; the gray
   </p>
   <p>
    color and ruinous state of the house and barn, and the dilapidated
   </p>
   <p>
    fences, which put such an interval between me and the last occupant;
   </p>
   <p>
    the hollow and lichen-covered apple trees, gnawed by rabbits, showing
   </p>
   <p>
    what kind of neighbors I should have; but above all, the recollection I
   </p>
   <p>
    had of it from my earliest voyages up the river, when the house was
   </p>
   <p>
    concealed behind a dense grove of red maples, through which I heard the
   </p>
   <p>
    house-dog bark. I was in haste to buy it, before the proprietor
   </p>
   <p>
    finished getting out some rocks, cutting down the hollow apple trees,
   </p>
   <p>
    and grubbing up some young birches which had sprung up in the pasture,
   </p>
   <p>
    or, in short, had made any more of his improvements. To enjoy these
   </p>
   <p>
    advantages I was ready to carry it on; like Atlas, to take the world on
   </p>
   <p>
    my shoulders,—I never heard what compensation he received for that,—and
   </p>
   <p>
    do all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I
   </p>
   <p>
    might pay for it and be unmolested in my possession of it; for I knew
   </p>
   <p>
    all the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I
   </p>
   <p>
    wanted if I could only afford to let it alone. But it turned out as I
   </p>
   <p>
    have said.
   </p>
   <p>
    All that I could say, then, with respect to farming on a large scale,
   </p>
   <p>
    (I have always cultivated a garden,) was, that I had had my seeds
   </p>
   <p>
    ready. Many think that seeds improve with age. I have no doubt that
   </p>
   <p>
    time discriminates between the good and the bad; and when at last I
   </p>
   <p>
    shall plant, I shall be less likely to be disappointed. But I would say
   </p>
   <p>
    to my fellows, once for all, As long as possible live free and
   </p>
   <p>
    uncommitted. It makes but little difference whether you are committed
   </p>
   <p>
    to a farm or the county jail.
   </p>
   <p>
    Old Cato, whose “De Re Rusticâ” is my “Cultivator,” says, and the only
   </p>
   <p>
    translation I have seen makes sheer nonsense of the passage, “When you
   </p>
   <p>
    think of getting a farm, turn it thus in your mind, not to buy
   </p>
   <p>
    greedily; nor spare your pains to look at it, and do not think it
   </p>
   <p>
    enough to go round it once. The oftener you go there the more it will
   </p>
   <p>
    please you, if it is good.” I think I shall not buy greedily, but go
   </p>
   <p>
    round and round it as long as I live, and be buried in it first, that
   </p>
   <p>
    it may please me the more at last.
   </p>
   <p>
    The present was my next experiment of this kind, which I purpose to
   </p>
   <p>
    describe more at length; for convenience, putting the experience of two
   </p>
   <p>
    years into one. As I have said, I do not propose to write an ode to
   </p>
   <p>
    dejection, but to brag as lustily as chanticleer in the morning,
   </p>
   <p>
    standing on his roost, if only to wake my neighbors up.
   </p>
   <p>
    When first I took up my abode in the woods, that is, began to spend my
   </p>
   <p>
    nights as well as days there, which, by accident, was on Independence
   </p>
   <p>
    Day, or the Fourth of July, 1845, my house was not finished for winter,
   </p>
   <p>
    but was merely a defence against the rain, without plastering or
   </p>
   <p>
    chimney, the walls being of rough, weather-stained boards, with wide
   </p>
   <p>
    chinks, which made it cool at night. The upright white hewn studs and
   </p>
   <p>
    freshly planed door and window casings gave it a clean and airy look,
   </p>
   <p>
    especially in the morning, when its timbers were saturated with dew, so
   </p>
   <p>
    that I fancied that by noon some sweet gum would exude from them. To my
   </p>
   <p>
    imagination it retained throughout the day more or less of this auroral
   </p>
   <p>
    character, reminding me of a certain house on a mountain which I had
   </p>
   <p>
    visited the year before. This was an airy and unplastered cabin, fit to
   </p>
   <p>
    entertain a travelling god, and where a goddess might trail her
   </p>
   <p>
    garments. The winds which passed over my dwelling were such as sweep
   </p>
   <p>
    over the ridges of mountains, bearing the broken strains, or celestial
   </p>
   <p>
    parts only, of terrestrial music. The morning wind forever blows, the
   </p>
   <p>
    poem of creation is uninterrupted; but few are the ears that hear it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Olympus is but the outside of the earth every where.
   </p>
   <p>
    The only house I had been the owner of before, if I except a boat, was
   </p>
   <p>
    a tent, which I used occasionally when making excursions in the summer,
   </p>
   <p>
    and this is still rolled up in my garret; but the boat, after passing
   </p>
   <p>
    from hand to hand, has gone down the stream of time. With this more
   </p>
   <p>
    substantial shelter about me, I had made some progress toward settling
   </p>
   <p>
    in the world. This frame, so slightly clad, was a sort of
   </p>
   <p>
    crystallization around me, and reacted on the builder. It was
   </p>
   <p>
    suggestive somewhat as a picture in outlines. I did not need to go
   </p>
   <p>
    outdoors to take the air, for the atmosphere within had lost none of
   </p>
   <p>
    its freshness. It was not so much within doors as behind a door where I
   </p>
   <p>
    sat, even in the rainiest weather. The Harivansa says, “An abode
   </p>
   <p>
    without birds is like a meat without seasoning.” Such was not my abode,
   </p>
   <p>
    for I found myself suddenly neighbor to the birds; not by having
   </p>
   <p>
    imprisoned one, but having caged myself near them. I was not only
   </p>
   <p>
    nearer to some of those which commonly frequent the garden and the
   </p>
   <p>
    orchard, but to those wilder and more thrilling songsters of the forest
   </p>
   <p>
    which never, or rarely, serenade a villager,—the wood-thrush, the
   </p>
   <p>
    veery, the scarlet tanager, the field-sparrow, the whippoorwill, and
   </p>
   <p>
    many others.
   </p>
   <p>
    I was seated by the shore of a small pond, about a mile and a half
   </p>
   <p>
    south of the village of Concord and somewhat higher than it, in the
   </p>
   <p>
    midst of an extensive wood between that town and Lincoln, and about two
   </p>
   <p>
    miles south of that our only field known to fame, Concord Battle
   </p>
   <p>
    Ground; but I was so low in the woods that the opposite shore, half a
   </p>
   <p>
    mile off, like the rest, covered with wood, was my most distant
   </p>
   <p>
    horizon. For the first week, whenever I looked out on the pond it
   </p>
   <p>
    impressed me like a tarn high up on the side of a mountain, its bottom
   </p>
   <p>
    far above the surface of other lakes, and, as the sun arose, I saw it
   </p>
   <p>
    throwing off its nightly clothing of mist, and here and there, by
   </p>
   <p>
    degrees, its soft ripples or its smooth reflecting surface was
   </p>
   <p>
    revealed, while the mists, like ghosts, were stealthily withdrawing in
   </p>
   <p>
    every direction into the woods, as at the breaking up of some nocturnal
   </p>
   <p>
    conventicle. The very dew seemed to hang upon the trees later into the
   </p>
   <p>
    day than usual, as on the sides of mountains.
   </p>
   <p>
    This small lake was of most value as a neighbor in the intervals of a
   </p>
   <p>
    gentle rain storm in August, when, both air and water being perfectly
   </p>
   <p>
    still, but the sky overcast, mid-afternoon had all the serenity of
   </p>
   <p>
    evening, and the wood-thrush sang around, and was heard from shore to
   </p>
   <p>
    shore. A lake like this is never smoother than at such a time; and the
   </p>
   <p>
    clear portion of the air above it being shallow and darkened by clouds,
   </p>
   <p>
    the water, full of light and reflections, becomes a lower heaven itself
   </p>
   <p>
    so much the more important. From a hill top near by, where the wood had
   </p>
   <p>
    been recently cut off, there was a pleasing vista southward across the
   </p>
   <p>
    pond, through a wide indentation in the hills which form the shore
   </p>
   <p>
    there, where their opposite sides sloping toward each other suggested a
   </p>
   <p>
    stream flowing out in that direction through a wooded valley, but
   </p>
   <p>
    stream there was none. That way I looked between and over the near
   </p>
   <p>
    green hills to some distant and higher ones in the horizon, tinged with
   </p>
   <p>
    blue. Indeed, by standing on tiptoe I could catch a glimpse of some of
   </p>
   <p>
    the peaks of the still bluer and more distant mountain ranges in the
   </p>
   <p>
    north-west, those true-blue coins from heaven’s own mint, and also of
   </p>
   <p>
    some portion of the village. But in other directions, even from this
   </p>
   <p>
    point, I could not see over or beyond the woods which surrounded me. It
   </p>
   <p>
    is well to have some water in your neighborhood, to give buoyancy to
   </p>
   <p>
    and float the earth. One value even of the smallest well is, that when
   </p>
   <p>
    you look into it you see that earth is not continent but insular. This
   </p>
   <p>
    is as important as that it keeps butter cool. When I looked across the
   </p>
   <p>
    pond from this peak toward the Sudbury meadows, which in time of flood
   </p>
   <p>
    I distinguished elevated perhaps by a mirage in their seething valley,
   </p>
   <p>
    like a coin in a basin, all the earth beyond the pond appeared like a
   </p>
   <p>
    thin crust insulated and floated even by this small sheet of
   </p>
   <p>
    interverting water, and I was reminded that this on which I dwelt was
   </p>
   <p>
    but _dry land_.
   </p>
   <p>
    Though the view from my door was still more contracted, I did not feel
   </p>
   <p>
    crowded or confined in the least. There was pasture enough for my
   </p>
   <p>
    imagination. The low shrub-oak plateau to which the opposite shore
   </p>
   <p>
    arose, stretched away toward the prairies of the West and the steppes
   </p>
   <p>
    of Tartary, affording ample room for all the roving families of men.
   </p>
   <p>
    “There are none happy in the world but beings who enjoy freely a vast
   </p>
   <p>
    horizon,”—said Damodara, when his herds required new and larger
   </p>
   <p>
    pastures.
   </p>
   <p>
    Both place and time were changed, and I dwelt nearer to those parts of
   </p>
   <p>
    the universe and to those eras in history which had most attracted me.
   </p>
   <p>
    Where I lived was as far off as many a region viewed nightly by
   </p>
   <p>
    astronomers. We are wont to imagine rare and delectable places in some
   </p>
   <p>
    remote and more celestial corner of the system, behind the
   </p>
   <p>
    constellation of Cassiopeia’s Chair, far from noise and disturbance. I
   </p>
   <p>
    discovered that my house actually had its site in such a withdrawn, but
   </p>
   <p>
    forever new and unprofaned, part of the universe. If it were worth the
   </p>
   <p>
    while to settle in those parts near to the Pleiades or the Hyades, to
   </p>
   <p>
    Aldebaran or Altair, then I was really there, or at an equal remoteness
   </p>
   <p>
    from the life which I had left behind, dwindled and twinkling with as
   </p>
   <p>
    fine a ray to my nearest neighbor, and to be seen only in moonless
   </p>
   <p>
    nights by him. Such was that part of creation where I had squatted;—
   </p>
   <p>
    “There was a shepherd that did live,
   </p>
   <p>
    And held his thoughts as high
   </p>
   <p>
    As were the mounts whereon his flocks
   </p>
   <p>
    Did hourly feed him by.”
   </p>
   <p>
    What should we think of the shepherd’s life if his flocks always
   </p>
   <p>
    wandered to higher pastures than his thoughts?
   </p>
   <p>
    Every morning was a cheerful invitation to make my life of equal
   </p>
   <p>
    simplicity, and I may say innocence, with Nature herself. I have been
   </p>
   <p>
    as sincere a worshipper of Aurora as the Greeks. I got up early and
   </p>
   <p>
    bathed in the pond; that was a religious exercise, and one of the best
   </p>
   <p>
    things which I did. They say that characters were engraven on the
   </p>
   <p>
    bathing tub of king Tching-thang to this effect: “Renew thyself
   </p>
   <p>
    completely each day; do it again, and again, and forever again.” I can
   </p>
   <p>
    understand that. Morning brings back the heroic ages. I was as much
   </p>
   <p>
    affected by the faint hum of a mosquito making its invisible and
   </p>
   <p>
    unimaginable tour through my apartment at earliest dawn, when I was
   </p>
   <p>
    sitting with door and windows open, as I could be by any trumpet that
   </p>
   <p>
    ever sang of fame. It was Homer’s requiem; itself an Iliad and Odyssey
   </p>
   <p>
    in the air, singing its own wrath and wanderings. There was something
   </p>
   <p>
    cosmical about it; a standing advertisement, till forbidden, of the
   </p>
   <p>
    everlasting vigor and fertility of the world. The morning, which is the
   </p>
   <p>
    most memorable season of the day, is the awakening hour. Then there is
   </p>
   <p>
    least somnolence in us; and for an hour, at least, some part of us
   </p>
   <p>
    awakes which slumbers all the rest of the day and night. Little is to
   </p>
   <p>
    be expected of that day, if it can be called a day, to which we are not
   </p>
   <p>
    awakened by our Genius, but by the mechanical nudgings of some
   </p>
   <p>
    servitor, are not awakened by our own newly-acquired force and
   </p>
   <p>
    aspirations from within, accompanied by the undulations of celestial
   </p>
   <p>
    music, instead of factory bells, and a fragrance filling the air—to a
   </p>
   <p>
    higher life than we fell asleep from; and thus the darkness bear its
   </p>
   <p>
    fruit, and prove itself to be good, no less than the light. That man
   </p>
   <p>
    who does not believe that each day contains an earlier, more sacred,
   </p>
   <p>
    and auroral hour than he has yet profaned, has despaired of life, and
   </p>
   <p>
    is pursuing a descending and darkening way. After a partial cessation
   </p>
   <p>
    of his sensuous life, the soul of man, or its organs rather, are
   </p>
   <p>
    reinvigorated each day, and his Genius tries again what noble life it
   </p>
   <p>
    can make. All memorable events, I should say, transpire in morning time
   </p>
   <p>
    and in a morning atmosphere. The Vedas say, “All intelligences awake
   </p>
   <p>
    with the morning.” Poetry and art, and the fairest and most memorable
   </p>
   <p>
    of the actions of men, date from such an hour. All poets and heroes,
   </p>
   <p>
    like Memnon, are the children of Aurora, and emit their music at
   </p>
   <p>
    sunrise. To him whose elastic and vigorous thought keeps pace with the
   </p>
   <p>
    sun, the day is a perpetual morning. It matters not what the clocks say
   </p>
   <p>
    or the attitudes and labors of men. Morning is when I am awake and
   </p>
   <p>
    there is a dawn in me. Moral reform is the effort to throw off sleep.
   </p>
   <p>
    Why is it that men give so poor an account of their day if they have
   </p>
   <p>
    not been slumbering? They are not such poor calculators. If they had
   </p>
   <p>
    not been overcome with drowsiness, they would have performed something.
   </p>
   <p>
    The millions are awake enough for physical labor; but only one in a
   </p>
   <p>
    million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one
   </p>
   <p>
    in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life. To be awake is to be
   </p>
   <p>
    alive. I have never yet met a man who was quite awake. How could I have
   </p>
   <p>
    looked him in the face?
   </p>
   <p>
    We must learn to reawaken and keep ourselves awake, not by mechanical
   </p>
   <p>
    aids, but by an infinite expectation of the dawn, which does not
   </p>
   <p>
    forsake us in our soundest sleep. I know of no more encouraging fact
   </p>
   <p>
    than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a
   </p>
   <p>
    conscious endeavor. It is something to be able to paint a particular
   </p>
   <p>
    picture, or to carve a statue, and so to make a few objects beautiful;
   </p>
   <p>
    but it is far more glorious to carve and paint the very atmosphere and
   </p>
   <p>
    medium through which we look, which morally we can do. To affect the
   </p>
   <p>
    quality of the day, that is the highest of arts. Every man is tasked to
   </p>
   <p>
    make his life, even in its details, worthy of the contemplation of his
   </p>
   <p>
    most elevated and critical hour. If we refused, or rather used up, such
   </p>
   <p>
    paltry information as we get, the oracles would distinctly inform us
   </p>
   <p>
    how this might be done.
   </p>
   <p>
    I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front
   </p>
   <p>
    only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it
   </p>
   <p>
    had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not
   </p>
   <p>
    lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor
   </p>
   <p>
    did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I
   </p>
   <p>
    wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so
   </p>
   <p>
    sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to
   </p>
   <p>
    cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and
   </p>
   <p>
    reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then
   </p>
   <p>
    to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness
   </p>
   <p>
    to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be
   </p>
   <p>
    able to give a true account of it in my next excursion. For most men,
   </p>
   <p>
    it appears to me, are in a strange uncertainty about it, whether it is
   </p>
   <p>
    of the devil or of God, and have _somewhat hastily_ concluded that it
   </p>
   <p>
    is the chief end of man here to “glorify God and enjoy him forever.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Still we live meanly, like ants; though the fable tells us that we were
   </p>
   <p>
    long ago changed into men; like pygmies we fight with cranes; it is
   </p>
   <p>
    error upon error, and clout upon clout, and our best virtue has for its
   </p>
   <p>
    occasion a superfluous and evitable wretchedness. Our life is frittered
   </p>
   <p>
    away by detail. An honest man has hardly need to count more than his
   </p>
   <p>
    ten fingers, or in extreme cases he may add his ten toes, and lump the
   </p>
   <p>
    rest. Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity! I say, let your affairs be as
   </p>
   <p>
    two or three, and not a hundred or a thousand; instead of a million
   </p>
   <p>
    count half a dozen, and keep your accounts on your thumb nail. In the
   </p>
   <p>
    midst of this chopping sea of civilized life, such are the clouds and
   </p>
   <p>
    storms and quicksands and thousand-and-one items to be allowed for,
   </p>
   <p>
    that a man has to live, if he would not founder and go to the bottom
   </p>
   <p>
    and not make his port at all, by dead reckoning, and he must be a great
   </p>
   <p>
    calculator indeed who succeeds. Simplify, simplify. Instead of three
   </p>
   <p>
    meals a day, if it be necessary eat but one; instead of a hundred
   </p>
   <p>
    dishes, five; and reduce other things in proportion. Our life is like a
   </p>
   <p>
    German Confederacy, made up of petty states, with its boundary forever
   </p>
   <p>
    fluctuating, so that even a German cannot tell you how it is bounded at
   </p>
   <p>
    any moment. The nation itself, with all its so called internal
   </p>
   <p>
    improvements, which, by the way are all external and superficial, is
   </p>
   <p>
    just such an unwieldy and overgrown establishment, cluttered with
   </p>
   <p>
    furniture and tripped up by its own traps, ruined by luxury and
   </p>
   <p>
    heedless expense, by want of calculation and a worthy aim, as the
   </p>
   <p>
    million households in the land; and the only cure for it as for them is
   </p>
   <p>
    in a rigid economy, a stern and more than Spartan simplicity of life
   </p>
   <p>
    and elevation of purpose. It lives too fast. Men think that it is
   </p>
   <p>
    essential that the _Nation_ have commerce, and export ice, and talk
   </p>
   <p>
    through a telegraph, and ride thirty miles an hour, without a doubt,
   </p>
   <p>
    whether _they_ do or not; but whether we should live like baboons or
   </p>
   <p>
    like men, is a little uncertain. If we do not get out sleepers, and
   </p>
   <p>
    forge rails, and devote days and nights to the work, but go to
   </p>
   <p>
    tinkering upon our _lives_ to improve _them_, who will build railroads?
   </p>
   <p>
    And if railroads are not built, how shall we get to heaven in season?
   </p>
   <p>
    But if we stay at home and mind our business, who will want railroads?
   </p>
   <p>
    We do not ride on the railroad; it rides upon us. Did you ever think
   </p>
   <p>
    what those sleepers are that underlie the railroad? Each one is a man,
   </p>
   <p>
    an Irish-man, or a Yankee man. The rails are laid on them, and they are
   </p>
   <p>
    covered with sand, and the cars run smoothly over them. They are sound
   </p>
   <p>
    sleepers, I assure you. And every few years a new lot is laid down and
   </p>
   <p>
    run over; so that, if some have the pleasure of riding on a rail,
   </p>
   <p>
    others have the misfortune to be ridden upon. And when they run over a
   </p>
   <p>
    man that is walking in his sleep, a supernumerary sleeper in the wrong
   </p>
   <p>
    position, and wake him up, they suddenly stop the cars, and make a hue
   </p>
   <p>
    and cry about it, as if this were an exception. I am glad to know that
   </p>
   <p>
    it takes a gang of men for every five miles to keep the sleepers down
   </p>
   <p>
    and level in their beds as it is, for this is a sign that they may
   </p>
   <p>
    sometime get up again.
   </p>
   <p>
    Why should we live with such hurry and waste of life? We are determined
   </p>
   <p>
    to be starved before we are hungry. Men say that a stitch in time saves
   </p>
   <p>
    nine, and so they take a thousand stitches to-day to save nine
   </p>
   <p>
    to-morrow. As for _work_, we haven’t any of any consequence. We have
   </p>
   <p>
    the Saint Vitus’ dance, and cannot possibly keep our heads still. If I
   </p>
   <p>
    should only give a few pulls at the parish bell-rope, as for a fire,
   </p>
   <p>
    that is, without setting the bell, there is hardly a man on his farm in
   </p>
   <p>
    the outskirts of Concord, notwithstanding that press of engagements
   </p>
   <p>
    which was his excuse so many times this morning, nor a boy, nor a
   </p>
   <p>
    woman, I might almost say, but would forsake all and follow that sound,
   </p>
   <p>
    not mainly to save property from the flames, but, if we will confess
   </p>
   <p>
    the truth, much more to see it burn, since burn it must, and we, be it
   </p>
   <p>
    known, did not set it on fire,—or to see it put out, and have a hand in
   </p>
   <p>
    it, if that is done as handsomely; yes, even if it were the parish
   </p>
   <p>
    church itself. Hardly a man takes a half hour’s nap after dinner, but
   </p>
   <p>
    when he wakes he holds up his head and asks, “What’s the news?” as if
   </p>
   <p>
    the rest of mankind had stood his sentinels. Some give directions to be
   </p>
   <p>
    waked every half hour, doubtless for no other purpose; and then, to pay
   </p>
   <p>
    for it, they tell what they have dreamed. After a night’s sleep the
   </p>
   <p>
    news is as indispensable as the breakfast. “Pray tell me any thing new
   </p>
   <p>
    that has happened to a man any where on this globe,”—and he reads it
   </p>
   <p>
    over his coffee and rolls, that a man has had his eyes gouged out this
   </p>
   <p>
    morning on the Wachito River; never dreaming the while that he lives in
   </p>
   <p>
    the dark unfathomed mammoth cave of this world, and has but the
   </p>
   <p>
    rudiment of an eye himself.
   </p>
   <p>
    For my part, I could easily do without the post-office. I think that
   </p>
   <p>
    there are very few important communications made through it. To speak
   </p>
   <p>
    critically, I never received more than one or two letters in my life—I
   </p>
   <p>
    wrote this some years ago—that were worth the postage. The penny-post
   </p>
   <p>
    is, commonly, an institution through which you seriously offer a man
   </p>
   <p>
    that penny for his thoughts which is so often safely offered in jest.
   </p>
   <p>
    And I am sure that I never read any memorable news in a newspaper. If
   </p>
   <p>
    we read of one man robbed, or murdered, or killed by accident, or one
   </p>
   <p>
    house burned, or one vessel wrecked, or one steamboat blown up, or one
   </p>
   <p>
    cow run over on the Western Railroad, or one mad dog killed, or one lot
   </p>
   <p>
    of grasshoppers in the winter,—we never need read of another. One is
   </p>
   <p>
    enough. If you are acquainted with the principle, what do you care for
   </p>
   <p>
    a myriad instances and applications? To a philosopher all _news_, as it
   </p>
   <p>
    is called, is gossip, and they who edit and read it are old women over
   </p>
   <p>
    their tea. Yet not a few are greedy after this gossip. There was such a
   </p>
   <p>
    rush, as I hear, the other day at one of the offices to learn the
   </p>
   <p>
    foreign news by the last arrival, that several large squares of plate
   </p>
   <p>
    glass belonging to the establishment were broken by the pressure,—news
   </p>
   <p>
    which I seriously think a ready wit might write a twelve-month, or
   </p>
   <p>
    twelve years, beforehand with sufficient accuracy. As for Spain, for
   </p>
   <p>
    instance, if you know how to throw in Don Carlos and the Infanta, and
   </p>
   <p>
    Don Pedro and Seville and Granada, from time to time in the right
   </p>
   <p>
    proportions,—they may have changed the names a little since I saw the
   </p>
   <p>
    papers,—and serve up a bull-fight when other entertainments fail, it
   </p>
   <p>
    will be true to the letter, and give us as good an idea of the exact
   </p>
   <p>
    state or ruin of things in Spain as the most succinct and lucid reports
   </p>
   <p>
    under this head in the newspapers: and as for England, almost the last
   </p>
   <p>
    significant scrap of news from that quarter was the revolution of 1649;
   </p>
   <p>
    and if you have learned the history of her crops for an average year,
   </p>
   <p>
    you never need attend to that thing again, unless your speculations are
   </p>
   <p>
    of a merely pecuniary character. If one may judge who rarely looks into
   </p>
   <p>
    the newspapers, nothing new does ever happen in foreign parts, a French
   </p>
   <p>
    revolution not excepted.
   </p>
   <p>
    What news! how much more important to know what that is which was never
   </p>
   <p>
    old! “Kieou-he-yu (great dignitary of the state of Wei) sent a man to
   </p>
   <p>
    Khoung-tseu to know his news. Khoung-tseu caused the messenger to be
   </p>
   <p>
    seated near him, and questioned him in these terms: What is your master
   </p>
   <p>
    doing? The messenger answered with respect: My master desires to
   </p>
   <p>
    diminish the number of his faults, but he cannot come to the end of
   </p>
   <p>
    them. The messenger being gone, the philosopher remarked: What a worthy
   </p>
   <p>
    messenger! What a worthy messenger!” The preacher, instead of vexing
   </p>
   <p>
    the ears of drowsy farmers on their day of rest at the end of the
   </p>
   <p>
    week,—for Sunday is the fit conclusion of an ill-spent week, and not
   </p>
   <p>
    the fresh and brave beginning of a new one,—with this one other
   </p>
   <p>
    draggle-tail of a sermon, should shout with thundering voice, “Pause!
   </p>
   <p>
    Avast! Why so seeming fast, but deadly slow?”
   </p>
   <p>
    Shams and delusions are esteemed for soundest truths, while reality is
   </p>
   <p>
    fabulous. If men would steadily observe realities only, and not allow
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves to be deluded, life, to compare it with such things as we
   </p>
   <p>
    know, would be like a fairy tale and the Arabian Nights’
   </p>
   <p>
    Entertainments. If we respected only what is inevitable and has a right
   </p>
   <p>
    to be, music and poetry would resound along the streets. When we are
   </p>
   <p>
    unhurried and wise, we perceive that only great and worthy things have
   </p>
   <p>
    any permanent and absolute existence,—that petty fears and petty
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasures are but the shadow of the reality. This is always
   </p>
   <p>
    exhilarating and sublime. By closing the eyes and slumbering, and
   </p>
   <p>
    consenting to be deceived by shows, men establish and confirm their
   </p>
   <p>
    daily life of routine and habit everywhere, which still is built on
   </p>
   <p>
    purely illusory foundations. Children, who play life, discern its true
   </p>
   <p>
    law and relations more clearly than men, who fail to live it worthily,
   </p>
   <p>
    but who think that they are wiser by experience, that is, by failure. I
   </p>
   <p>
    have read in a Hindoo book, that “there was a king’s son, who, being
   </p>
   <p>
    expelled in infancy from his native city, was brought up by a forester,
   </p>
   <p>
    and, growing up to maturity in that state, imagined himself to belong
   </p>
   <p>
    to the barbarous race with which he lived. One of his father’s
   </p>
   <p>
    ministers having discovered him, revealed to him what he was, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    misconception of his character was removed, and he knew himself to be a
   </p>
   <p>
    prince. So soul,” continues the Hindoo philosopher, “from the
   </p>
   <p>
    circumstances in which it is placed, mistakes its own character, until
   </p>
   <p>
    the truth is revealed to it by some holy teacher, and then it knows
   </p>
   <p>
    itself to be _Brahme_.” I perceive that we inhabitants of New England
   </p>
   <p>
    live this mean life that we do because our vision does not penetrate
   </p>
   <p>
    the surface of things. We think that that _is_ which _appears_ to be.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a man should walk through this town and see only the reality, where,
   </p>
   <p>
    think you, would the “Mill-dam” go to? If he should give us an account
   </p>
   <p>
    of the realities he beheld there, we should not recognize the place in
   </p>
   <p>
    his description. Look at a meeting-house, or a court-house, or a jail,
   </p>
   <p>
    or a shop, or a dwelling-house, and say what that thing really is
   </p>
   <p>
    before a true gaze, and they would all go to pieces in your account of
   </p>
   <p>
    them. Men esteem truth remote, in the outskirts of the system, behind
   </p>
   <p>
    the farthest star, before Adam and after the last man. In eternity
   </p>
   <p>
    there is indeed something true and sublime. But all these times and
   </p>
   <p>
    places and occasions are now and here. God himself culminates in the
   </p>
   <p>
    present moment, and will never be more divine in the lapse of all the
   </p>
   <p>
    ages. And we are enabled to apprehend at all what is sublime and noble
   </p>
   <p>
    only by the perpetual instilling and drenching of the reality that
   </p>
   <p>
    surrounds us. The universe constantly and obediently answers to our
   </p>
   <p>
    conceptions; whether we travel fast or slow, the track is laid for us.
   </p>
   <p>
    Let us spend our lives in conceiving then. The poet or the artist never
   </p>
   <p>
    yet had so fair and noble a design but some of his posterity at least
   </p>
   <p>
    could accomplish it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Let us spend one day as deliberately as Nature, and not be thrown off
   </p>
   <p>
    the track by every nutshell and mosquito’s wing that falls on the
   </p>
   <p>
    rails. Let us rise early and fast, or break fast, gently and without
   </p>
   <p>
    perturbation; let company come and let company go, let the bells ring
   </p>
   <p>
    and the children cry,—determined to make a day of it. Why should we
   </p>
   <p>
    knock under and go with the stream? Let us not be upset and overwhelmed
   </p>
   <p>
    in that terrible rapid and whirlpool called a dinner, situated in the
   </p>
   <p>
    meridian shallows. Weather this danger and you are safe, for the rest
   </p>
   <p>
    of the way is down hill. With unrelaxed nerves, with morning vigor,
   </p>
   <p>
    sail by it, looking another way, tied to the mast like Ulysses. If the
   </p>
   <p>
    engine whistles, let it whistle till it is hoarse for its pains. If the
   </p>
   <p>
    bell rings, why should we run? We will consider what kind of music they
   </p>
   <p>
    are like. Let us settle ourselves, and work and wedge our feet downward
   </p>
   <p>
    through the mud and slush of opinion, and prejudice, and tradition, and
   </p>
   <p>
    delusion, and appearance, that alluvion which covers the globe, through
   </p>
   <p>
    Paris and London, through New York and Boston and Concord, through
   </p>
   <p>
    church and state, through poetry and philosophy and religion, till we
   </p>
   <p>
    come to a hard bottom and rocks in place, which we can call _reality_,
   </p>
   <p>
    and say, This is, and no mistake; and then begin, having a _point
   </p>
   <p>
    d’appui_, below freshet and frost and fire, a place where you might
   </p>
   <p>
    found a wall or a state, or set a lamp-post safely, or perhaps a gauge,
   </p>
   <p>
    not a Nilometer, but a Realometer, that future ages might know how deep
   </p>
   <p>
    a freshet of shams and appearances had gathered from time to time. If
   </p>
   <p>
    you stand right fronting and face to face to a fact, you will see the
   </p>
   <p>
    sun glimmer on both its surfaces, as if it were a cimeter, and feel its
   </p>
   <p>
    sweet edge dividing you through the heart and marrow, and so you will
   </p>
   <p>
    happily conclude your mortal career. Be it life or death, we crave only
   </p>
   <p>
    reality. If we are really dying, let us hear the rattle in our throats
   </p>
   <p>
    and feel cold in the extremities; if we are alive, let us go about our
   </p>
   <p>
    business.
   </p>
   <p>
    Time is but the stream I go a-fishing in. I drink at it; but while I
   </p>
   <p>
    drink I see the sandy bottom and detect how shallow it is. Its thin
   </p>
   <p>
    current slides away, but eternity remains. I would drink deeper; fish
   </p>
   <p>
    in the sky, whose bottom is pebbly with stars. I cannot count one. I
   </p>
   <p>
    know not the first letter of the alphabet. I have always been
   </p>
   <p>
    regretting that I was not as wise as the day I was born. The intellect
   </p>
   <p>
    is a cleaver; it discerns and rifts its way into the secret of things.
   </p>
   <p>
    I do not wish to be any more busy with my hands than is necessary. My
   </p>
   <p>
    head is hands and feet. I feel all my best faculties concentrated in
   </p>
   <p>
    it. My instinct tells me that my head is an organ for burrowing, as
   </p>
   <p>
    some creatures use their snout and fore-paws, and with it I would mine
   </p>
   <p>
    and burrow my way through these hills. I think that the richest vein is
   </p>
   <p>
    somewhere hereabouts; so by the divining-rod and thin rising vapors I
   </p>
   <p>
    judge; and here I will begin to mine.
   </p>
   <p>
    Reading
   </p>
   <p>
    With a little more deliberation in the choice of their pursuits, all
   </p>
   <p>
    men would perhaps become essentially students and observers, for
   </p>
   <p>
    certainly their nature and destiny are interesting to all alike. In
   </p>
   <p>
    accumulating property for ourselves or our posterity, in founding a
   </p>
   <p>
    family or a state, or acquiring fame even, we are mortal; but in
   </p>
   <p>
    dealing with truth we are immortal, and need fear no change nor
   </p>
   <p>
    accident. The oldest Egyptian or Hindoo philosopher raised a corner of
   </p>
   <p>
    the veil from the statue of the divinity; and still the trembling robe
   </p>
   <p>
    remains raised, and I gaze upon as fresh a glory as he did, since it
   </p>
   <p>
    was I in him that was then so bold, and it is he in me that now reviews
   </p>
   <p>
    the vision. No dust has settled on that robe; no time has elapsed since
   </p>
   <p>
    that divinity was revealed. That time which we really improve, or which
   </p>
   <p>
    is improvable, is neither past, present, nor future.
   </p>
   <p>
    My residence was more favorable, not only to thought, but to serious
   </p>
   <p>
    reading, than a university; and though I was beyond the range of the
   </p>
   <p>
    ordinary circulating library, I had more than ever come within the
   </p>
   <p>
    influence of those books which circulate round the world, whose
   </p>
   <p>
    sentences were first written on bark, and are now merely copied from
   </p>
   <p>
    time to time on to linen paper. Says the poet Mîr Camar Uddîn Mast,
   </p>
   <p>
    “Being seated to run through the region of the spiritual world; I have
   </p>
   <p>
    had this advantage in books. To be intoxicated by a single glass of
   </p>
   <p>
    wine; I have experienced this pleasure when I have drunk the liquor of
   </p>
   <p>
    the esoteric doctrines.” I kept Homer’s Iliad on my table through the
   </p>
   <p>
    summer, though I looked at his page only now and then. Incessant labor
   </p>
   <p>
    with my hands, at first, for I had my house to finish and my beans to
   </p>
   <p>
    hoe at the same time, made more study impossible. Yet I sustained
   </p>
   <p>
    myself by the prospect of such reading in future. I read one or two
   </p>
   <p>
    shallow books of travel in the intervals of my work, till that
   </p>
   <p>
    employment made me ashamed of myself, and I asked where it was then
   </p>
   <p>
    that _I_ lived.
   </p>
   <p>
    The student may read Homer or Æschylus in the Greek without danger of
   </p>
   <p>
    dissipation or luxuriousness, for it implies that he in some measure
   </p>
   <p>
    emulate their heroes, and consecrate morning hours to their pages. The
   </p>
   <p>
    heroic books, even if printed in the character of our mother tongue,
   </p>
   <p>
    will always be in a language dead to degenerate times; and we must
   </p>
   <p>
    laboriously seek the meaning of each word and line, conjecturing a
   </p>
   <p>
    larger sense than common use permits out of what wisdom and valor and
   </p>
   <p>
    generosity we have. The modern cheap and fertile press, with all its
   </p>
   <p>
    translations, has done little to bring us nearer to the heroic writers
   </p>
   <p>
    of antiquity. They seem as solitary, and the letter in which they are
   </p>
   <p>
    printed as rare and curious, as ever. It is worth the expense of
   </p>
   <p>
    youthful days and costly hours, if you learn only some words of an
   </p>
   <p>
    ancient language, which are raised out of the trivialness of the
   </p>
   <p>
    street, to be perpetual suggestions and provocations. It is not in vain
   </p>
   <p>
    that the farmer remembers and repeats the few Latin words which he has
   </p>
   <p>
    heard. Men sometimes speak as if the study of the classics would at
   </p>
   <p>
    length make way for more modern and practical studies; but the
   </p>
   <p>
    adventurous student will always study classics, in whatever language
   </p>
   <p>
    they may be written and however ancient they may be. For what are the
   </p>
   <p>
    classics but the noblest recorded thoughts of man? They are the only
   </p>
   <p>
    oracles which are not decayed, and there are such answers to the most
   </p>
   <p>
    modern inquiry in them as Delphi and Dodona never gave. We might as
   </p>
   <p>
    well omit to study Nature because she is old. To read well, that is, to
   </p>
   <p>
    read true books in a true spirit, is a noble exercise, and one that
   </p>
   <p>
    will task the reader more than any exercise which the customs of the
   </p>
   <p>
    day esteem. It requires a training such as the athletes underwent, the
   </p>
   <p>
    steady intention almost of the whole life to this object. Books must be
   </p>
   <p>
    read as deliberately and reservedly as they were written. It is not
   </p>
   <p>
    enough even to be able to speak the language of that nation by which
   </p>
   <p>
    they are written, for there is a memorable interval between the spoken
   </p>
   <p>
    and the written language, the language heard and the language read. The
   </p>
   <p>
    one is commonly transitory, a sound, a tongue, a dialect merely, almost
   </p>
   <p>
    brutish, and we learn it unconsciously, like the brutes, of our
   </p>
   <p>
    mothers. The other is the maturity and experience of that; if that is
   </p>
   <p>
    our mother tongue, this is our father tongue, a reserved and select
   </p>
   <p>
    expression, too significant to be heard by the ear, which we must be
   </p>
   <p>
    born again in order to speak. The crowds of men who merely _spoke_ the
   </p>
   <p>
    Greek and Latin tongues in the middle ages were not entitled by the
   </p>
   <p>
    accident of birth to _read_ the works of genius written in those
   </p>
   <p>
    languages; for these were not written in that Greek or Latin which they
   </p>
   <p>
    knew, but in the select language of literature. They had not learned
   </p>
   <p>
    the nobler dialects of Greece and Rome, but the very materials on which
   </p>
   <p>
    they were written were waste paper to them, and they prized instead a
   </p>
   <p>
    cheap contemporary literature. But when the several nations of Europe
   </p>
   <p>
    had acquired distinct though rude written languages of their own,
   </p>
   <p>
    sufficient for the purposes of their rising literatures, then first
   </p>
   <p>
    learning revived, and scholars were enabled to discern from that
   </p>
   <p>
    remoteness the treasures of antiquity. What the Roman and Grecian
   </p>
   <p>
    multitude could not _hear_, after the lapse of ages a few scholars
   </p>
   <p>
    _read_, and a few scholars only are still reading it.
   </p>
   <p>
    However much we may admire the orator’s occasional bursts of eloquence,
   </p>
   <p>
    the noblest written words are commonly as far behind or above the
   </p>
   <p>
    fleeting spoken language as the firmament with its stars is behind the
   </p>
   <p>
    clouds. _There_ are the stars, and they who can may read them. The
   </p>
   <p>
    astronomers forever comment on and observe them. They are not
   </p>
   <p>
    exhalations like our daily colloquies and vaporous breath. What is
   </p>
   <p>
    called eloquence in the forum is commonly found to be rhetoric in the
   </p>
   <p>
    study. The orator yields to the inspiration of a transient occasion,
   </p>
   <p>
    and speaks to the mob before him, to those who can _hear_ him; but the
   </p>
   <p>
    writer, whose more equable life is his occasion, and who would be
   </p>
   <p>
    distracted by the event and the crowd which inspire the orator, speaks
   </p>
   <p>
    to the intellect and health of mankind, to all in any age who can
   </p>
   <p>
    _understand_ him.
   </p>
   <p>
    No wonder that Alexander carried the Iliad with him on his expeditions
   </p>
   <p>
    in a precious casket. A written word is the choicest of relics. It is
   </p>
   <p>
    something at once more intimate with us and more universal than any
   </p>
   <p>
    other work of art. It is the work of art nearest to life itself. It may
   </p>
   <p>
    be translated into every language, and not only be read but actually
   </p>
   <p>
    breathed from all human lips;—not be represented on canvas or in marble
   </p>
   <p>
    only, but be carved out of the breath of life itself. The symbol of an
   </p>
   <p>
    ancient man’s thought becomes a modern man’s speech. Two thousand
   </p>
   <p>
    summers have imparted to the monuments of Grecian literature, as to her
   </p>
   <p>
    marbles, only a maturer golden and autumnal tint, for they have carried
   </p>
   <p>
    their own serene and celestial atmosphere into all lands to protect
   </p>
   <p>
    them against the corrosion of time. Books are the treasured wealth of
   </p>
   <p>
    the world and the fit inheritance of generations and nations. Books,
   </p>
   <p>
    the oldest and the best, stand naturally and rightfully on the shelves
   </p>
   <p>
    of every cottage. They have no cause of their own to plead, but while
   </p>
   <p>
    they enlighten and sustain the reader his common sense will not refuse
   </p>
   <p>
    them. Their authors are a natural and irresistible aristocracy in every
   </p>
   <p>
    society, and, more than kings or emperors, exert an influence on
   </p>
   <p>
    mankind. When the illiterate and perhaps scornful trader has earned by
   </p>
   <p>
    enterprise and industry his coveted leisure and independence, and is
   </p>
   <p>
    admitted to the circles of wealth and fashion, he turns inevitably at
   </p>
   <p>
    last to those still higher but yet inaccessible circles of intellect
   </p>
   <p>
    and genius, and is sensible only of the imperfection of his culture and
   </p>
   <p>
    the vanity and insufficiency of all his riches, and further proves his
   </p>
   <p>
    good sense by the pains which he takes to secure for his children that
   </p>
   <p>
    intellectual culture whose want he so keenly feels; and thus it is that
   </p>
   <p>
    he becomes the founder of a family.
   </p>
   <p>
    Those who have not learned to read the ancient classics in the language
   </p>
   <p>
    in which they were written must have a very imperfect knowledge of the
   </p>
   <p>
    history of the human race; for it is remarkable that no transcript of
   </p>
   <p>
    them has ever been made into any modern tongue, unless our civilization
   </p>
   <p>
    itself may be regarded as such a transcript. Homer has never yet been
   </p>
   <p>
    printed in English, nor Æschylus, nor Virgil even—works as refined, as
   </p>
   <p>
    solidly done, and as beautiful almost as the morning itself; for later
   </p>
   <p>
    writers, say what we will of their genius, have rarely, if ever,
   </p>
   <p>
    equalled the elaborate beauty and finish and the lifelong and heroic
   </p>
   <p>
    literary labors of the ancients. They only talk of forgetting them who
   </p>
   <p>
    never knew them. It will be soon enough to forget them when we have the
   </p>
   <p>
    learning and the genius which will enable us to attend to and
   </p>
   <p>
    appreciate them. That age will be rich indeed when those relics which
   </p>
   <p>
    we call Classics, and the still older and more than classic but even
   </p>
   <p>
    less known Scriptures of the nations, shall have still further
   </p>
   <p>
    accumulated, when the Vaticans shall be filled with Vedas and
   </p>
   <p>
    Zendavestas and Bibles, with Homers and Dantes and Shakespeares, and
   </p>
   <p>
    all the centuries to come shall have successively deposited their
   </p>
   <p>
    trophies in the forum of the world. By such a pile we may hope to scale
   </p>
   <p>
    heaven at last.
   </p>
   <p>
    The works of the great poets have never yet been read by mankind, for
   </p>
   <p>
    only great poets can read them. They have only been read as the
   </p>
   <p>
    multitude read the stars, at most astrologically, not astronomically.
   </p>
   <p>
    Most men have learned to read to serve a paltry convenience, as they
   </p>
   <p>
    have learned to cipher in order to keep accounts and not be cheated in
   </p>
   <p>
    trade; but of reading as a noble intellectual exercise they know little
   </p>
   <p>
    or nothing; yet this only is reading, in a high sense, not that which
   </p>
   <p>
    lulls us as a luxury and suffers the nobler faculties to sleep the
   </p>
   <p>
    while, but what we have to stand on tip-toe to read and devote our most
   </p>
   <p>
    alert and wakeful hours to.
   </p>
   <p>
    I think that having learned our letters we should read the best that is
   </p>
   <p>
    in literature, and not be forever repeating our a b abs, and words of
   </p>
   <p>
    one syllable, in the fourth or fifth classes, sitting on the lowest and
   </p>
   <p>
    foremost form all our lives. Most men are satisfied if they read or
   </p>
   <p>
    hear read, and perchance have been convicted by the wisdom of one good
   </p>
   <p>
    book, the Bible, and for the rest of their lives vegetate and dissipate
   </p>
   <p>
    their faculties in what is called easy reading. There is a work in
   </p>
   <p>
    several volumes in our Circulating Library entitled Little Reading,
   </p>
   <p>
    which I thought referred to a town of that name which I had not been
   </p>
   <p>
    to. There are those who, like cormorants and ostriches, can digest all
   </p>
   <p>
    sorts of this, even after the fullest dinner of meats and vegetables,
   </p>
   <p>
    for they suffer nothing to be wasted. If others are the machines to
   </p>
   <p>
    provide this provender, they are the machines to read it. They read the
   </p>
   <p>
    nine thousandth tale about Zebulon and Sephronia, and how they loved as
   </p>
   <p>
    none had ever loved before, and neither did the course of their true
   </p>
   <p>
    love run smooth,—at any rate, how it did run and stumble, and get up
   </p>
   <p>
    again and go on! how some poor unfortunate got up on to a steeple, who
   </p>
   <p>
    had better never have gone up as far as the belfry; and then, having
   </p>
   <p>
    needlessly got him up there, the happy novelist rings the bell for all
   </p>
   <p>
    the world to come together and hear, O dear! how he did get down again!
   </p>
   <p>
    For my part, I think that they had better metamorphose all such
   </p>
   <p>
    aspiring heroes of universal noveldom into man weathercocks, as they
   </p>
   <p>
    used to put heroes among the constellations, and let them swing round
   </p>
   <p>
    there till they are rusty, and not come down at all to bother honest
   </p>
   <p>
    men with their pranks. The next time the novelist rings the bell I will
   </p>
   <p>
    not stir though the meeting-house burn down. “The Skip of the
   </p>
   <p>
    Tip-Toe-Hop, a Romance of the Middle Ages, by the celebrated author of
   </p>
   <p>
    ‘Tittle-Tol-Tan,’ to appear in monthly parts; a great rush; don’t all
   </p>
   <p>
    come together.” All this they read with saucer eyes, and erect and
   </p>
   <p>
    primitive curiosity, and with unwearied gizzard, whose corrugations
   </p>
   <p>
    even yet need no sharpening, just as some little four-year-old bencher
   </p>
   <p>
    his two-cent gilt-covered edition of Cinderella,—without any
   </p>
   <p>
    improvement, that I can see, in the pronunciation, or accent, or
   </p>
   <p>
    emphasis, or any more skill in extracting or inserting the moral. The
   </p>
   <p>
    result is dulness of sight, a stagnation of the vital circulations, and
   </p>
   <p>
    a general deliquium and sloughing off of all the intellectual
   </p>
   <p>
    faculties. This sort of gingerbread is baked daily and more sedulously
   </p>
   <p>
    than pure wheat or rye-and-Indian in almost every oven, and finds a
   </p>
   <p>
    surer market.
   </p>
   <p>
    The best books are not read even by those who are called good readers.
   </p>
   <p>
    What does our Concord culture amount to? There is in this town, with a
   </p>
   <p>
    very few exceptions, no taste for the best or for very good books even
   </p>
   <p>
    in English literature, whose words all can read and spell. Even the
   </p>
   <p>
    college-bred and so called liberally educated men here and elsewhere
   </p>
   <p>
    have really little or no acquaintance with the English classics; and as
   </p>
   <p>
    for the recorded wisdom of mankind, the ancient classics and Bibles,
   </p>
   <p>
    which are accessible to all who will know of them, there are the
   </p>
   <p>
    feeblest efforts any where made to become acquainted with them. I know
   </p>
   <p>
    a woodchopper, of middle age, who takes a French paper, not for news as
   </p>
   <p>
    he says, for he is above that, but to “keep himself in practice,” he
   </p>
   <p>
    being a Canadian by birth; and when I ask him what he considers the
   </p>
   <p>
    best thing he can do in this world, he says, beside this, to keep up
   </p>
   <p>
    and add to his English. This is about as much as the college bred
   </p>
   <p>
    generally do or aspire to do, and they take an English paper for the
   </p>
   <p>
    purpose. One who has just come from reading perhaps one of the best
   </p>
   <p>
    English books will find how many with whom he can converse about it? Or
   </p>
   <p>
    suppose he comes from reading a Greek or Latin classic in the original,
   </p>
   <p>
    whose praises are familiar even to the so called illiterate; he will
   </p>
   <p>
    find nobody at all to speak to, but must keep silence about it. Indeed,
   </p>
   <p>
    there is hardly the professor in our colleges, who, if he has mastered
   </p>
   <p>
    the difficulties of the language, has proportionally mastered the
   </p>
   <p>
    difficulties of the wit and poetry of a Greek poet, and has any
   </p>
   <p>
    sympathy to impart to the alert and heroic reader; and as for the
   </p>
   <p>
    sacred Scriptures, or Bibles of mankind, who in this town can tell me
   </p>
   <p>
    even their titles? Most men do not know that any nation but the Hebrews
   </p>
   <p>
    have had a scripture. A man, any man, will go considerably out of his
   </p>
   <p>
    way to pick up a silver dollar; but here are golden words, which the
   </p>
   <p>
    wisest men of antiquity have uttered, and whose worth the wise of every
   </p>
   <p>
    succeeding age have assured us of;—and yet we learn to read only as far
   </p>
   <p>
    as Easy Reading, the primers and class-books, and when we leave school,
   </p>
   <p>
    the “Little Reading,” and story books, which are for boys and
   </p>
   <p>
    beginners; and our reading, our conversation and thinking, are all on a
   </p>
   <p>
    very low level, worthy only of pygmies and manikins.
   </p>
   <p>
    I aspire to be acquainted with wiser men than this our Concord soil has
   </p>
   <p>
    produced, whose names are hardly known here. Or shall I hear the name
   </p>
   <p>
    of Plato and never read his book? As if Plato were my townsman and I
   </p>
   <p>
    never saw him,—my next neighbor and I never heard him speak or attended
   </p>
   <p>
    to the wisdom of his words. But how actually is it? His Dialogues,
   </p>
   <p>
    which contain what was immortal in him, lie on the next shelf, and yet
   </p>
   <p>
    I never read them. We are underbred and low-lived and illiterate; and
   </p>
   <p>
    in this respect I confess I do not make any very broad distinction
   </p>
   <p>
    between the illiterateness of my townsman who cannot read at all, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the illiterateness of him who has learned to read only what is for
   </p>
   <p>
    children and feeble intellects. We should be as good as the worthies of
   </p>
   <p>
    antiquity, but partly by first knowing how good they were. We are a
   </p>
   <p>
    race of tit-men, and soar but little higher in our intellectual flights
   </p>
   <p>
    than the columns of the daily paper.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is not all books that are as dull as their readers. There are
   </p>
   <p>
    probably words addressed to our condition exactly, which, if we could
   </p>
   <p>
    really hear and understand, would be more salutary than the morning or
   </p>
   <p>
    the spring to our lives, and possibly put a new aspect on the face of
   </p>
   <p>
    things for us. How many a man has dated a new era in his life from the
   </p>
   <p>
    reading of a book. The book exists for us perchance which will explain
   </p>
   <p>
    our miracles and reveal new ones. The at present unutterable things we
   </p>
   <p>
    may find somewhere uttered. These same questions that disturb and
   </p>
   <p>
    puzzle and confound us have in their turn occurred to all the wise men;
   </p>
   <p>
    not one has been omitted; and each has answered them, according to his
   </p>
   <p>
    ability, by his words and his life. Moreover, with wisdom we shall
   </p>
   <p>
    learn liberality. The solitary hired man on a farm in the outskirts of
   </p>
   <p>
    Concord, who has had his second birth and peculiar religious
   </p>
   <p>
    experience, and is driven as he believes into the silent gravity and
   </p>
   <p>
    exclusiveness by his faith, may think it is not true; but Zoroaster,
   </p>
   <p>
    thousands of years ago, travelled the same road and had the same
   </p>
   <p>
    experience; but he, being wise, knew it to be universal, and treated
   </p>
   <p>
    his neighbors accordingly, and is even said to have invented and
   </p>
   <p>
    established worship among men. Let him humbly commune with Zoroaster
   </p>
   <p>
    then, and through the liberalizing influence of all the worthies, with
   </p>
   <p>
    Jesus Christ himself, and let “our church” go by the board.
   </p>
   <p>
    We boast that we belong to the nineteenth century and are making the
   </p>
   <p>
    most rapid strides of any nation. But consider how little this village
   </p>
   <p>
    does for its own culture. I do not wish to flatter my townsmen, nor to
   </p>
   <p>
    be flattered by them, for that will not advance either of us. We need
   </p>
   <p>
    to be provoked,—goaded like oxen, as we are, into a trot. We have a
   </p>
   <p>
    comparatively decent system of common schools, schools for infants
   </p>
   <p>
    only; but excepting the half-starved Lyceum in the winter, and latterly
   </p>
   <p>
    the puny beginning of a library suggested by the state, no school for
   </p>
   <p>
    ourselves. We spend more on almost any article of bodily aliment or
   </p>
   <p>
    ailment than on our mental aliment. It is time that we had uncommon
   </p>
   <p>
    schools, that we did not leave off our education when we begin to be
   </p>
   <p>
    men and women. It is time that villages were universities, and their
   </p>
   <p>
    elder inhabitants the fellows of universities, with leisure—if they are
   </p>
   <p>
    indeed so well off—to pursue liberal studies the rest of their lives.
   </p>
   <p>
    Shall the world be confined to one Paris or one Oxford forever? Cannot
   </p>
   <p>
    students be boarded here and get a liberal education under the skies of
   </p>
   <p>
    Concord? Can we not hire some Abelard to lecture to us? Alas! what with
   </p>
   <p>
    foddering the cattle and tending the store, we are kept from school too
   </p>
   <p>
    long, and our education is sadly neglected. In this country, the
   </p>
   <p>
    village should in some respects take the place of the nobleman of
   </p>
   <p>
    Europe. It should be the patron of the fine arts. It is rich enough. It
   </p>
   <p>
    wants only the magnanimity and refinement. It can spend money enough on
   </p>
   <p>
    such things as farmers and traders value, but it is thought Utopian to
   </p>
   <p>
    propose spending money for things which more intelligent men know to be
   </p>
   <p>
    of far more worth. This town has spent seventeen thousand dollars on a
   </p>
   <p>
    town-house, thank fortune or politics, but probably it will not spend
   </p>
   <p>
    so much on living wit, the true meat to put into that shell, in a
   </p>
   <p>
    hundred years. The one hundred and twenty-five dollars annually
   </p>
   <p>
    subscribed for a Lyceum in the winter is better spent than any other
   </p>
   <p>
    equal sum raised in the town. If we live in the nineteenth century, why
   </p>
   <p>
    should we not enjoy the advantages which the nineteenth century offers?
   </p>
   <p>
    Why should our life be in any respect provincial? If we will read
   </p>
   <p>
    newspapers, why not skip the gossip of Boston and take the best
   </p>
   <p>
    newspaper in the world at once?—not be sucking the pap of “neutral
   </p>
   <p>
    family” papers, or browsing “Olive-Branches” here in New England. Let
   </p>
   <p>
    the reports of all the learned societies come to us, and we will see if
   </p>
   <p>
    they know any thing. Why should we leave it to Harper &amp; Brothers and
   </p>
   <p>
    Redding &amp; Co. to select our reading? As the nobleman of cultivated
   </p>
   <p>
    taste surrounds himself with whatever conduces to his
   </p>
   <p>
    culture,—genius—learning—wit—books—paintings—statuary—music—
   </p>
   <p>
    philosophical instruments, and the like; so let the village do,—not
   </p>
   <p>
    stop short at a pedagogue, a parson, a sexton, a parish library, and
   </p>
   <p>
    three selectmen, because our pilgrim forefathers got through a cold
   </p>
   <p>
    winter once on a bleak rock with these. To act collectively is
   </p>
   <p>
    according to the spirit of our institutions; and I am confident that,
   </p>
   <p>
    as our circumstances are more flourishing, our means are greater than
   </p>
   <p>
    the nobleman’s. New England can hire all the wise men in the world to
   </p>
   <p>
    come and teach her, and board them round the while, and not be
   </p>
   <p>
    provincial at all. That is the _uncommon_ school we want. Instead of
   </p>
   <p>
    noblemen, let us have noble villages of men. If it is necessary, omit
   </p>
   <p>
    one bridge over the river, go round a little there, and throw one arch
   </p>
   <p>
    at least over the darker gulf of ignorance which surrounds us.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sounds
   </p>
   <p>
    But while we are confined to books, though the most select and classic,
   </p>
   <p>
    and read only particular written languages, which are themselves but
   </p>
   <p>
    dialects and provincial, we are in danger of forgetting the language
   </p>
   <p>
    which all things and events speak without metaphor, which alone is
   </p>
   <p>
    copious and standard. Much is published, but little printed. The rays
   </p>
   <p>
    which stream through the shutter will be no longer remembered when the
   </p>
   <p>
    shutter is wholly removed. No method nor discipline can supersede the
   </p>
   <p>
    necessity of being forever on the alert. What is a course of history,
   </p>
   <p>
    or philosophy, or poetry, no matter how well selected, or the best
   </p>
   <p>
    society, or the most admirable routine of life, compared with the
   </p>
   <p>
    discipline of looking always at what is to be seen? Will you be a
   </p>
   <p>
    reader, a student merely, or a seer? Read your fate, see what is before
   </p>
   <p>
    you, and walk on into futurity.
   </p>
   <p>
    I did not read books the first summer; I hoed beans. Nay, I often did
   </p>
   <p>
    better than this. There were times when I could not afford to sacrifice
   </p>
   <p>
    the bloom of the present moment to any work, whether of the head or
   </p>
   <p>
    hands. I love a broad margin to my life. Sometimes, in a summer
   </p>
   <p>
    morning, having taken my accustomed bath, I sat in my sunny doorway
   </p>
   <p>
    from sunrise till noon, rapt in a revery, amidst the pines and
   </p>
   <p>
    hickories and sumachs, in undisturbed solitude and stillness, while the
   </p>
   <p>
    birds sing around or flitted noiseless through the house, until by the
   </p>
   <p>
    sun falling in at my west window, or the noise of some traveller’s
   </p>
   <p>
    wagon on the distant highway, I was reminded of the lapse of time. I
   </p>
   <p>
    grew in those seasons like corn in the night, and they were far better
   </p>
   <p>
    than any work of the hands would have been. They were not time
   </p>
   <p>
    subtracted from my life, but so much over and above my usual allowance.
   </p>
   <p>
    I realized what the Orientals mean by contemplation and the forsaking
   </p>
   <p>
    of works. For the most part, I minded not how the hours went. The day
   </p>
   <p>
    advanced as if to light some work of mine; it was morning, and lo, now
   </p>
   <p>
    it is evening, and nothing memorable is accomplished. Instead of
   </p>
   <p>
    singing like the birds, I silently smiled at my incessant good fortune.
   </p>
   <p>
    As the sparrow had its trill, sitting on the hickory before my door, so
   </p>
   <p>
    had I my chuckle or suppressed warble which he might hear out of my
   </p>
   <p>
    nest. My days were not days of the week, bearing the stamp of any
   </p>
   <p>
    heathen deity, nor were they minced into hours and fretted by the
   </p>
   <p>
    ticking of a clock; for I lived like the Puri Indians, of whom it is
   </p>
   <p>
    said that “for yesterday, to-day, and to-morrow they have only one
   </p>
   <p>
    word, and they express the variety of meaning by pointing backward for
   </p>
   <p>
    yesterday, forward for to-morrow, and overhead for the passing day.”
   </p>
   <p>
    This was sheer idleness to my fellow-townsmen, no doubt; but if the
   </p>
   <p>
    birds and flowers had tried me by their standard, I should not have
   </p>
   <p>
    been found wanting. A man must find his occasions in himself, it is
   </p>
   <p>
    true. The natural day is very calm, and will hardly reprove his
   </p>
   <p>
    indolence.
   </p>
   <p>
    I had this advantage, at least, in my mode of life, over those who were
   </p>
   <p>
    obliged to look abroad for amusement, to society and the theatre, that
   </p>
   <p>
    my life itself was become my amusement and never ceased to be novel. It
   </p>
   <p>
    was a drama of many scenes and without an end. If we were always indeed
   </p>
   <p>
    getting our living, and regulating our lives according to the last and
   </p>
   <p>
    best mode we had learned, we should never be troubled with ennui.
   </p>
   <p>
    Follow your genius closely enough, and it will not fail to show you a
   </p>
   <p>
    fresh prospect every hour. Housework was a pleasant pastime. When my
   </p>
   <p>
    floor was dirty, I rose early, and, setting all my furniture out of
   </p>
   <p>
    doors on the grass, bed and bedstead making but one budget, dashed
   </p>
   <p>
    water on the floor, and sprinkled white sand from the pond on it, and
   </p>
   <p>
    then with a broom scrubbed it clean and white; and by the time the
   </p>
   <p>
    villagers had broken their fast the morning sun had dried my house
   </p>
   <p>
    sufficiently to allow me to move in again, and my meditations were
   </p>
   <p>
    almost uninterupted. It was pleasant to see my whole household effects
   </p>
   <p>
    out on the grass, making a little pile like a gypsy’s pack, and my
   </p>
   <p>
    three-legged table, from which I did not remove the books and pen and
   </p>
   <p>
    ink, standing amid the pines and hickories. They seemed glad to get out
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves, and as if unwilling to be brought in. I was sometimes
   </p>
   <p>
    tempted to stretch an awning over them and take my seat there. It was
   </p>
   <p>
    worth the while to see the sun shine on these things, and hear the free
   </p>
   <p>
    wind blow on them; so much more interesting most familiar objects look
   </p>
   <p>
    out of doors than in the house. A bird sits on the next bough,
   </p>
   <p>
    life-everlasting grows under the table, and blackberry vines run round
   </p>
   <p>
    its legs; pine cones, chestnut burs, and strawberry leaves are strewn
   </p>
   <p>
    about. It looked as if this was the way these forms came to be
   </p>
   <p>
    transferred to our furniture, to tables, chairs, and bedsteads,—because
   </p>
   <p>
    they once stood in their midst.
   </p>
   <p>
    My house was on the side of a hill, immediately on the edge of the
   </p>
   <p>
    larger wood, in the midst of a young forest of pitch pines and
   </p>
   <p>
    hickories, and half a dozen rods from the pond, to which a narrow
   </p>
   <p>
    footpath led down the hill. In my front yard grew the strawberry,
   </p>
   <p>
    blackberry, and life-everlasting, johnswort and goldenrod, shrub-oaks
   </p>
   <p>
    and sand-cherry, blueberry and groundnut. Near the end of May, the
   </p>
   <p>
    sand-cherry (_Cerasus pumila_,) adorned the sides of the path with its
   </p>
   <p>
    delicate flowers arranged in umbels cylindrically about its short
   </p>
   <p>
    stems, which last, in the fall, weighed down with good sized and
   </p>
   <p>
    handsome cherries, fell over in wreaths like rays on every side. I
   </p>
   <p>
    tasted them out of compliment to Nature, though they were scarcely
   </p>
   <p>
    palatable. The sumach (_Rhus glabra_,) grew luxuriantly about the
   </p>
   <p>
    house, pushing up through the embankment which I had made, and growing
   </p>
   <p>
    five or six feet the first season. Its broad pinnate tropical leaf was
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasant though strange to look on. The large buds, suddenly pushing
   </p>
   <p>
    out late in the spring from dry sticks which had seemed to be dead,
   </p>
   <p>
    developed themselves as by magic into graceful green and tender boughs,
   </p>
   <p>
    an inch in diameter; and sometimes, as I sat at my window, so
   </p>
   <p>
    heedlessly did they grow and tax their weak joints, I heard a fresh and
   </p>
   <p>
    tender bough suddenly fall like a fan to the ground, when there was not
   </p>
   <p>
    a breath of air stirring, broken off by its own weight. In August, the
   </p>
   <p>
    large masses of berries, which, when in flower, had attracted many wild
   </p>
   <p>
    bees, gradually assumed their bright velvety crimson hue, and by their
   </p>
   <p>
    weight again bent down and broke the tender limbs.
   </p>
   <p>
    As I sit at my window this summer afternoon, hawks are circling about
   </p>
   <p>
    my clearing; the tantivy of wild pigeons, flying by twos and threes
   </p>
   <p>
    athwart my view, or perching restless on the white-pine boughs behind
   </p>
   <p>
    my house, gives a voice to the air; a fishhawk dimples the glassy
   </p>
   <p>
    surface of the pond and brings up a fish; a mink steals out of the
   </p>
   <p>
    marsh before my door and seizes a frog by the shore; the sedge is
   </p>
   <p>
    bending under the weight of the reed-birds flitting hither and thither;
   </p>
   <p>
    and for the last half hour I have heard the rattle of railroad cars,
   </p>
   <p>
    now dying away and then reviving like the beat of a partridge,
   </p>
   <p>
    conveying travellers from Boston to the country. For I did not live so
   </p>
   <p>
    out of the world as that boy who, as I hear, was put out to a farmer in
   </p>
   <p>
    the east part of the town, but ere long ran away and came home again,
   </p>
   <p>
    quite down at the heel and homesick. He had never seen such a dull and
   </p>
   <p>
    out-of-the-way place; the folks were all gone off; why, you couldn’t
   </p>
   <p>
    even hear the whistle! I doubt if there is such a place in
   </p>
   <p>
    Massachusetts now:—
   </p>
   <p>
    “In truth, our village has become a butt
   </p>
   <p>
    For one of those fleet railroad shafts, and o’er
   </p>
   <p>
    Our peaceful plain its soothing sound is—Concord.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The Fitchburg Railroad touches the pond about a hundred rods south of
   </p>
   <p>
    where I dwell. I usually go to the village along its causeway, and am,
   </p>
   <p>
    as it were, related to society by this link. The men on the freight
   </p>
   <p>
    trains, who go over the whole length of the road, bow to me as to an
   </p>
   <p>
    old acquaintance, they pass me so often, and apparently they take me
   </p>
   <p>
    for an employee; and so I am. I too would fain be a track-repairer
   </p>
   <p>
    somewhere in the orbit of the earth.
   </p>
   <p>
    The whistle of the locomotive penetrates my woods summer and winter,
   </p>
   <p>
    sounding like the scream of a hawk sailing over some farmer’s yard,
   </p>
   <p>
    informing me that many restless city merchants are arriving within the
   </p>
   <p>
    circle of the town, or adventurous country traders from the other side.
   </p>
   <p>
    As they come under one horizon, they shout their warning to get off the
   </p>
   <p>
    track to the other, heard sometimes through the circles of two towns.
   </p>
   <p>
    Here come your groceries, country; your rations, countrymen! Nor is
   </p>
   <p>
    there any man so independent on his farm that he can say them nay. And
   </p>
   <p>
    here’s your pay for them! screams the countryman’s whistle; timber like
   </p>
   <p>
    long battering rams going twenty miles an hour against the city’s
   </p>
   <p>
    walls, and chairs enough to seat all the weary and heavy laden that
   </p>
   <p>
    dwell within them. With such huge and lumbering civility the country
   </p>
   <p>
    hands a chair to the city. All the Indian huckleberry hills are
   </p>
   <p>
    stripped, all the cranberry meadows are raked into the city. Up comes
   </p>
   <p>
    the cotton, down goes the woven cloth; up comes the silk, down goes the
   </p>
   <p>
    woollen; up come the books, but down goes the wit that writes them.
   </p>
   <p>
    When I meet the engine with its train of cars moving off with planetary
   </p>
   <p>
    motion,—or, rather, like a comet, for the beholder knows not if with
   </p>
   <p>
    that velocity and with that direction it will ever revisit this system,
   </p>
   <p>
    since its orbit does not look like a returning curve,—with its steam
   </p>
   <p>
    cloud like a banner streaming behind in golden and silver wreaths, like
   </p>
   <p>
    many a downy cloud which I have seen, high in the heavens, unfolding
   </p>
   <p>
    its masses to the light,—as if this travelling demigod, this
   </p>
   <p>
    cloud-compeller, would ere long take the sunset sky for the livery of
   </p>
   <p>
    his train; when I hear the iron horse make the hills echo with his
   </p>
   <p>
    snort like thunder, shaking the earth with his feet, and breathing fire
   </p>
   <p>
    and smoke from his nostrils, (what kind of winged horse or fiery dragon
   </p>
   <p>
    they will put into the new Mythology I don’t know), it seems as if the
   </p>
   <p>
    earth had got a race now worthy to inhabit it. If all were as it seems,
   </p>
   <p>
    and men made the elements their servants for noble ends! If the cloud
   </p>
   <p>
    that hangs over the engine were the perspiration of heroic deeds, or as
   </p>
   <p>
    beneficent as that which floats over the farmer’s fields, then the
   </p>
   <p>
    elements and Nature herself would cheerfully accompany men on their
   </p>
   <p>
    errands and be their escort.
   </p>
   <p>
    I watch the passage of the morning cars with the same feeling that I do
   </p>
   <p>
    the rising of the sun, which is hardly more regular. Their train of
   </p>
   <p>
    clouds stretching far behind and rising higher and higher, going to
   </p>
   <p>
    heaven while the cars are going to Boston, conceals the sun for a
   </p>
   <p>
    minute and casts my distant field into the shade, a celestial train
   </p>
   <p>
    beside which the petty train of cars which hugs the earth is but the
   </p>
   <p>
    barb of the spear. The stabler of the iron horse was up early this
   </p>
   <p>
    winter morning by the light of the stars amid the mountains, to fodder
   </p>
   <p>
    and harness his steed. Fire, too, was awakened thus early to put the
   </p>
   <p>
    vital heat in him and get him off. If the enterprise were as innocent
   </p>
   <p>
    as it is early! If the snow lies deep, they strap on his snow-shoes,
   </p>
   <p>
    and with the giant plow, plow a furrow from the mountains to the
   </p>
   <p>
    seaboard, in which the cars, like a following drill-barrow, sprinkle
   </p>
   <p>
    all the restless men and floating merchandise in the country for seed.
   </p>
   <p>
    All day the fire-steed flies over the country, stopping only that his
   </p>
   <p>
    master may rest, and I am awakened by his tramp and defiant snort at
   </p>
   <p>
    midnight, when in some remote glen in the woods he fronts the elements
   </p>
   <p>
    incased in ice and snow; and he will reach his stall only with the
   </p>
   <p>
    morning star, to start once more on his travels without rest or
   </p>
   <p>
    slumber. Or perchance, at evening, I hear him in his stable blowing off
   </p>
   <p>
    the superfluous energy of the day, that he may calm his nerves and cool
   </p>
   <p>
    his liver and brain for a few hours of iron slumber. If the enterprise
   </p>
   <p>
    were as heroic and commanding as it is protracted and unwearied!
   </p>
   <p>
    Far through unfrequented woods on the confines of towns, where once
   </p>
   <p>
    only the hunter penetrated by day, in the darkest night dart these
   </p>
   <p>
    bright saloons without the knowledge of their inhabitants; this moment
   </p>
   <p>
    stopping at some brilliant station-house in town or city, where a
   </p>
   <p>
    social crowd is gathered, the next in the Dismal Swamp, scaring the owl
   </p>
   <p>
    and fox. The startings and arrivals of the cars are now the epochs in
   </p>
   <p>
    the village day. They go and come with such regularity and precision,
   </p>
   <p>
    and their whistle can be heard so far, that the farmers set their
   </p>
   <p>
    clocks by them, and thus one well conducted institution regulates a
   </p>
   <p>
    whole country. Have not men improved somewhat in punctuality since the
   </p>
   <p>
    railroad was invented? Do they not talk and think faster in the depot
   </p>
   <p>
    than they did in the stage-office? There is something electrifying in
   </p>
   <p>
    the atmosphere of the former place. I have been astonished at the
   </p>
   <p>
    miracles it has wrought; that some of my neighbors, who, I should have
   </p>
   <p>
    prophesied, once for all, would never get to Boston by so prompt a
   </p>
   <p>
    conveyance, are on hand when the bell rings. To do things “railroad
   </p>
   <p>
    fashion” is now the by-word; and it is worth the while to be warned so
   </p>
   <p>
    often and so sincerely by any power to get off its track. There is no
   </p>
   <p>
    stopping to read the riot act, no firing over the heads of the mob, in
   </p>
   <p>
    this case. We have constructed a fate, an _Atropos_, that never turns
   </p>
   <p>
    aside. (Let that be the name of your engine.) Men are advertised that
   </p>
   <p>
    at a certain hour and minute these bolts will be shot toward particular
   </p>
   <p>
    points of the compass; yet it interferes with no man’s business, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the children go to school on the other track. We live the steadier for
   </p>
   <p>
    it. We are all educated thus to be sons of Tell. The air is full of
   </p>
   <p>
    invisible bolts. Every path but your own is the path of fate. Keep on
   </p>
   <p>
    your own track, then.
   </p>
   <p>
    What recommends commerce to me is its enterprise and bravery. It does
   </p>
   <p>
    not clasp its hands and pray to Jupiter. I see these men every day go
   </p>
   <p>
    about their business with more or less courage and content, doing more
   </p>
   <p>
    even than they suspect, and perchance better employed than they could
   </p>
   <p>
    have consciously devised. I am less affected by their heroism who stood
   </p>
   <p>
    up for half an hour in the front line at Buena Vista, than by the
   </p>
   <p>
    steady and cheerful valor of the men who inhabit the snow-plough for
   </p>
   <p>
    their winter quarters; who have not merely the three-o’-clock in the
   </p>
   <p>
    morning courage, which Bonaparte thought was the rarest, but whose
   </p>
   <p>
    courage does not go to rest so early, who go to sleep only when the
   </p>
   <p>
    storm sleeps or the sinews of their iron steed are frozen. On this
   </p>
   <p>
    morning of the Great Snow, perchance, which is still raging and
   </p>
   <p>
    chilling men’s blood, I hear the muffled tone of their engine bell from
   </p>
   <p>
    out the fog bank of their chilled breath, which announces that the cars
   </p>
   <p>
    _are coming_, without long delay, notwithstanding the veto of a New
   </p>
   <p>
    England north-east snow storm, and I behold the ploughmen covered with
   </p>
   <p>
    snow and rime, their heads peering, above the mould-board which is
   </p>
   <p>
    turning down other than daisies and the nests of field-mice, like
   </p>
   <p>
    bowlders of the Sierra Nevada, that occupy an outside place in the
   </p>
   <p>
    universe.
   </p>
   <p>
    Commerce is unexpectedly confident and serene, alert, adventurous, and
   </p>
   <p>
    unwearied. It is very natural in its methods withal, far more so than
   </p>
   <p>
    many fantastic enterprises and sentimental experiments, and hence its
   </p>
   <p>
    singular success. I am refreshed and expanded when the freight train
   </p>
   <p>
    rattles past me, and I smell the stores which go dispensing their odors
   </p>
   <p>
    all the way from Long Wharf to Lake Champlain, reminding me of foreign
   </p>
   <p>
    parts, of coral reefs, and Indian oceans, and tropical climes, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    extent of the globe. I feel more like a citizen of the world at the
   </p>
   <p>
    sight of the palm-leaf which will cover so many flaxen New England
   </p>
   <p>
    heads the next summer, the Manilla hemp and cocoa-nut husks, the old
   </p>
   <p>
    junk, gunny bags, scrap iron, and rusty nails. This car-load of torn
   </p>
   <p>
    sails is more legible and interesting now than if they should be
   </p>
   <p>
    wrought into paper and printed books. Who can write so graphically the
   </p>
   <p>
    history of the storms they have weathered as these rents have done?
   </p>
   <p>
    They are proof-sheets which need no correction. Here goes lumber from
   </p>
   <p>
    the Maine woods, which did not go out to sea in the last freshet, risen
   </p>
   <p>
    four dollars on the thousand because of what did go out or was split
   </p>
   <p>
    up; pine, spruce, cedar,—first, second, third, and fourth qualities, so
   </p>
   <p>
    lately all of one quality, to wave over the bear, and moose, and
   </p>
   <p>
    caribou. Next rolls Thomaston lime, a prime lot, which will get far
   </p>
   <p>
    among the hills before it gets slacked. These rags in bales, of all
   </p>
   <p>
    hues and qualities, the lowest condition to which cotton and linen
   </p>
   <p>
    descend, the final result of dress,—of patterns which are now no longer
   </p>
   <p>
    cried up, unless it be in Milwaukie, as those splendid articles,
   </p>
   <p>
    English, French, or American prints, ginghams, muslins, &amp;c., gathered
   </p>
   <p>
    from all quarters both of fashion and poverty, going to become paper of
   </p>
   <p>
    one color or a few shades only, on which forsooth will be written tales
   </p>
   <p>
    of real life, high and low, and founded on fact! This closed car smells
   </p>
   <p>
    of salt fish, the strong New England and commercial scent, reminding me
   </p>
   <p>
    of the Grand Banks and the fisheries. Who has not seen a salt fish,
   </p>
   <p>
    thoroughly cured for this world, so that nothing can spoil it, and
   </p>
   <p>
    putting the perseverance of the saints to the blush? with which you may
   </p>
   <p>
    sweep or pave the streets, and split your kindlings, and the teamster
   </p>
   <p>
    shelter himself and his lading against sun wind and rain behind it,—and
   </p>
   <p>
    the trader, as a Concord trader once did, hang it up by his door for a
   </p>
   <p>
    sign when he commences business, until at last his oldest customer
   </p>
   <p>
    cannot tell surely whether it be animal, vegetable, or mineral, and yet
   </p>
   <p>
    it shall be as pure as a snowflake, and if it be put into a pot and
   </p>
   <p>
    boiled, will come out an excellent dun fish for a Saturday’s dinner.
   </p>
   <p>
    Next Spanish hides, with the tails still preserving their twist and the
   </p>
   <p>
    angle of elevation they had when the oxen that wore them were careering
   </p>
   <p>
    over the pampas of the Spanish main,—a type of all obstinacy, and
   </p>
   <p>
    evincing how almost hopeless and incurable are all constitutional
   </p>
   <p>
    vices. I confess, that practically speaking, when I have learned a
   </p>
   <p>
    man’s real disposition, I have no hopes of changing it for the better
   </p>
   <p>
    or worse in this state of existence. As the Orientals say, “A cur’s
   </p>
   <p>
    tail may be warmed, and pressed, and bound round with ligatures, and
   </p>
   <p>
    after a twelve years’ labor bestowed upon it, still it will retain its
   </p>
   <p>
    natural form.” The only effectual cure for such inveteracies as these
   </p>
   <p>
    tails exhibit is to make glue of them, which I believe is what is
   </p>
   <p>
    usually done with them, and then they will stay put and stick. Here is
   </p>
   <p>
    a hogshead of molasses or of brandy directed to John Smith,
   </p>
   <p>
    Cuttingsville, Vermont, some trader among the Green Mountains, who
   </p>
   <p>
    imports for the farmers near his clearing, and now perchance stands
   </p>
   <p>
    over his bulk-head and thinks of the last arrivals on the coast, how
   </p>
   <p>
    they may affect the price for him, telling his customers this moment,
   </p>
   <p>
    as he has told them twenty times before this morning, that he expects
   </p>
   <p>
    some by the next train of prime quality. It is advertised in the
   </p>
   <p>
    Cuttingsville Times.
   </p>
   <p>
    While these things go up other things come down. Warned by the whizzing
   </p>
   <p>
    sound, I look up from my book and see some tall pine, hewn on far
   </p>
   <p>
    northern hills, which has winged its way over the Green Mountains and
   </p>
   <p>
    the Connecticut, shot like an arrow through the township within ten
   </p>
   <p>
    minutes, and scarce another eye beholds it; going
   </p>
   <p>
    “to be the mast
   </p>
   <p>
    Of some great ammiral.”
   </p>
   <p>
    And hark! here comes the cattle-train bearing the cattle of a thousand
   </p>
   <p>
    hills, sheepcots, stables, and cow-yards in the air, drovers with their
   </p>
   <p>
    sticks, and shepherd boys in the midst of their flocks, all but the
   </p>
   <p>
    mountain pastures, whirled along like leaves blown from the mountains
   </p>
   <p>
    by the September gales. The air is filled with the bleating of calves
   </p>
   <p>
    and sheep, and the hustling of oxen, as if a pastoral valley were going
   </p>
   <p>
    by. When the old bell-wether at the head rattles his bell, the
   </p>
   <p>
    mountains do indeed skip like rams and the little hills like lambs. A
   </p>
   <p>
    car-load of drovers, too, in the midst, on a level with their droves
   </p>
   <p>
    now, their vocation gone, but still clinging to their useless sticks as
   </p>
   <p>
    their badge of office. But their dogs, where are they? It is a stampede
   </p>
   <p>
    to them; they are quite thrown out; they have lost the scent. Methinks
   </p>
   <p>
    I hear them barking behind the Peterboro’ Hills, or panting up the
   </p>
   <p>
    western slope of the Green Mountains. They will not be in at the death.
   </p>
   <p>
    Their vocation, too, is gone. Their fidelity and sagacity are below par
   </p>
   <p>
    now. They will slink back to their kennels in disgrace, or perchance
   </p>
   <p>
    run wild and strike a league with the wolf and the fox. So is your
   </p>
   <p>
    pastoral life whirled past and away. But the bell rings, and I must get
   </p>
   <p>
    off the track and let the cars go by;—
   </p>
   <p>
    What’s the railroad to me?
   </p>
   <p>
    I never go to see
   </p>
   <p>
    Where it ends.
   </p>
   <p>
    It fills a few hollows,
   </p>
   <p>
    And makes banks for the swallows,
   </p>
   <p>
    It sets the sand a-blowing,
   </p>
   <p>
    And the blackberries a-growing,
   </p>
   <p>
    but I cross it like a cart-path in the woods. I will not have my eyes
   </p>
   <p>
    put out and my ears spoiled by its smoke and steam and hissing.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now that the cars are gone by and all the restless world with them, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the fishes in the pond no longer feel their rumbling, I am more alone
   </p>
   <p>
    than ever. For the rest of the long afternoon, perhaps, my meditations
   </p>
   <p>
    are interrupted only by the faint rattle of a carriage or team along
   </p>
   <p>
    the distant highway.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sometimes, on Sundays, I heard the bells, the Lincoln, Acton, Bedford,
   </p>
   <p>
    or Concord bell, when the wind was favorable, a faint, sweet, and, as
   </p>
   <p>
    it were, natural melody, worth importing into the wilderness. At a
   </p>
   <p>
    sufficient distance over the woods this sound acquires a certain
   </p>
   <p>
    vibratory hum, as if the pine needles in the horizon were the strings
   </p>
   <p>
    of a harp which it swept. All sound heard at the greatest possible
   </p>
   <p>
    distance produces one and the same effect, a vibration of the universal
   </p>
   <p>
    lyre, just as the intervening atmosphere makes a distant ridge of earth
   </p>
   <p>
    interesting to our eyes by the azure tint it imparts to it. There came
   </p>
   <p>
    to me in this case a melody which the air had strained, and which had
   </p>
   <p>
    conversed with every leaf and needle of the wood, that portion of the
   </p>
   <p>
    sound which the elements had taken up and modulated and echoed from
   </p>
   <p>
    vale to vale. The echo is, to some extent, an original sound, and
   </p>
   <p>
    therein is the magic and charm of it. It is not merely a repetition of
   </p>
   <p>
    what was worth repeating in the bell, but partly the voice of the wood;
   </p>
   <p>
    the same trivial words and notes sung by a wood-nymph.
   </p>
   <p>
    At evening, the distant lowing of some cow in the horizon beyond the
   </p>
   <p>
    woods sounded sweet and melodious, and at first I would mistake it for
   </p>
   <p>
    the voices of certain minstrels by whom I was sometimes serenaded, who
   </p>
   <p>
    might be straying over hill and dale; but soon I was not unpleasantly
   </p>
   <p>
    disappointed when it was prolonged into the cheap and natural music of
   </p>
   <p>
    the cow. I do not mean to be satirical, but to express my appreciation
   </p>
   <p>
    of those youths’ singing, when I state that I perceived clearly that it
   </p>
   <p>
    was akin to the music of the cow, and they were at length one
   </p>
   <p>
    articulation of Nature.
   </p>
   <p>
    Regularly at half past seven, in one part of the summer, after the
   </p>
   <p>
    evening train had gone by, the whippoorwills chanted their vespers for
   </p>
   <p>
    half an hour, sitting on a stump by my door, or upon the ridge pole of
   </p>
   <p>
    the house. They would begin to sing almost with as much precision as a
   </p>
   <p>
    clock, within five minutes of a particular time, referred to the
   </p>
   <p>
    setting of the sun, every evening. I had a rare opportunity to become
   </p>
   <p>
    acquainted with their habits. Sometimes I heard four or five at once in
   </p>
   <p>
    different parts of the wood, by accident one a bar behind another, and
   </p>
   <p>
    so near me that I distinguished not only the cluck after each note, but
   </p>
   <p>
    often that singular buzzing sound like a fly in a spider’s web, only
   </p>
   <p>
    proportionally louder. Sometimes one would circle round and round me in
   </p>
   <p>
    the woods a few feet distant as if tethered by a string, when probably
   </p>
   <p>
    I was near its eggs. They sang at intervals throughout the night, and
   </p>
   <p>
    were again as musical as ever just before and about dawn.
   </p>
   <p>
    When other birds are still the screech owls take up the strain, like
   </p>
   <p>
    mourning women their ancient u-lu-lu. Their dismal scream is truly Ben
   </p>
   <p>
    Jonsonian. Wise midnight hags! It is no honest and blunt tu-whit tu-who
   </p>
   <p>
    of the poets, but, without jesting, a most solemn graveyard ditty, the
   </p>
   <p>
    mutual consolations of suicide lovers remembering the pangs and the
   </p>
   <p>
    delights of supernal love in the infernal groves. Yet I love to hear
   </p>
   <p>
    their wailing, their doleful responses, trilled along the wood-side;
   </p>
   <p>
    reminding me sometimes of music and singing birds; as if it were the
   </p>
   <p>
    dark and tearful side of music, the regrets and sighs that would fain
   </p>
   <p>
    be sung. They are the spirits, the low spirits and melancholy
   </p>
   <p>
    forebodings, of fallen souls that once in human shape night-walked the
   </p>
   <p>
    earth and did the deeds of darkness, now expiating their sins with
   </p>
   <p>
    their wailing hymns or threnodies in the scenery of their
   </p>
   <p>
    transgressions. They give me a new sense of the variety and capacity of
   </p>
   <p>
    that nature which is our common dwelling. _Oh-o-o-o-o that I never had
   </p>
   <p>
    been bor-r-r-r-n!_ sighs one on this side of the pond, and circles with
   </p>
   <p>
    the restlessness of despair to some new perch on the gray oaks.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then—_that I never had been bor-r-r-r-n!_ echoes another on the farther
   </p>
   <p>
    side with tremulous sincerity, and—_bor-r-r-r-n!_ comes faintly from
   </p>
   <p>
    far in the Lincoln woods.
   </p>
   <p>
    I was also serenaded by a hooting owl. Near at hand you could fancy it
   </p>
   <p>
    the most melancholy sound in Nature, as if she meant by this to
   </p>
   <p>
    stereotype and make permanent in her choir the dying moans of a human
   </p>
   <p>
    being,—some poor weak relic of mortality who has left hope behind, and
   </p>
   <p>
    howls like an animal, yet with human sobs, on entering the dark valley,
   </p>
   <p>
    made more awful by a certain gurgling melodiousness,—I find myself
   </p>
   <p>
    beginning with the letters gl when I try to imitate it,—expressive of a
   </p>
   <p>
    mind which has reached the gelatinous mildewy stage in the
   </p>
   <p>
    mortification of all healthy and courageous thought. It reminded me of
   </p>
   <p>
    ghouls and idiots and insane howlings. But now one answers from far
   </p>
   <p>
    woods in a strain made really melodious by distance,—_Hoo hoo hoo,
   </p>
   <p>
    hoorer hoo_; and indeed for the most part it suggested only pleasing
   </p>
   <p>
    associations, whether heard by day or night, summer or winter.
   </p>
   <p>
    I rejoice that there are owls. Let them do the idiotic and maniacal
   </p>
   <p>
    hooting for men. It is a sound admirably suited to swamps and twilight
   </p>
   <p>
    woods which no day illustrates, suggesting a vast and undeveloped
   </p>
   <p>
    nature which men have not recognized. They represent the stark twilight
   </p>
   <p>
    and unsatisfied thoughts which all have. All day the sun has shone on
   </p>
   <p>
    the surface of some savage swamp, where the single spruce stands hung
   </p>
   <p>
    with usnea lichens, and small hawks circulate above, and the chickadee
   </p>
   <p>
    lisps amid the evergreens, and the partridge and rabbit skulk beneath;
   </p>
   <p>
    but now a more dismal and fitting day dawns, and a different race of
   </p>
   <p>
    creatures awakes to express the meaning of Nature there.
   </p>
   <p>
    Late in the evening I heard the distant rumbling of wagons over
   </p>
   <p>
    bridges,—a sound heard farther than almost any other at night,—the
   </p>
   <p>
    baying of dogs, and sometimes again the lowing of some disconsolate cow
   </p>
   <p>
    in a distant barn-yard. In the mean while all the shore rang with the
   </p>
   <p>
    trump of bullfrogs, the sturdy spirits of ancient wine-bibbers and
   </p>
   <p>
    wassailers, still unrepentant, trying to sing a catch in their Stygian
   </p>
   <p>
    lake,—if the Walden nymphs will pardon the comparison, for though there
   </p>
   <p>
    are almost no weeds, there are frogs there,—who would fain keep up the
   </p>
   <p>
    hilarious rules of their old festal tables, though their voices have
   </p>
   <p>
    waxed hoarse and solemnly grave, mocking at mirth, and the wine has
   </p>
   <p>
    lost its flavor, and become only liquor to distend their paunches, and
   </p>
   <p>
    sweet intoxication never comes to drown the memory of the past, but
   </p>
   <p>
    mere saturation and waterloggedness and distention. The most
   </p>
   <p>
    aldermanic, with his chin upon a heart-leaf, which serves for a napkin
   </p>
   <p>
    to his drooling chaps, under this northern shore quaffs a deep draught
   </p>
   <p>
    of the once scorned water, and passes round the cup with the
   </p>
   <p>
    ejaculation _tr-r-r-oonk, tr-r-r-oonk, tr-r-r-oonk!_ and straightway
   </p>
   <p>
    comes over the water from some distant cove the same password repeated,
   </p>
   <p>
    where the next in seniority and girth has gulped down to his mark; and
   </p>
   <p>
    when this observance has made the circuit of the shores, then
   </p>
   <p>
    ejaculates the master of ceremonies, with satisfaction, _tr-r-r-oonk!_
   </p>
   <p>
    and each in his turn repeats the same down to the least distended,
   </p>
   <p>
    leakiest, and flabbiest paunched, that there be no mistake; and then
   </p>
   <p>
    the bowl goes round again and again, until the sun disperses the
   </p>
   <p>
    morning mist, and only the patriarch is not under the pond, but vainly
   </p>
   <p>
    bellowing _troonk_ from time to time, and pausing for a reply.
   </p>
   <p>
    I am not sure that I ever heard the sound of cock-crowing from my
   </p>
   <p>
    clearing, and I thought that it might be worth the while to keep a
   </p>
   <p>
    cockerel for his music merely, as a singing bird. The note of this once
   </p>
   <p>
    wild Indian pheasant is certainly the most remarkable of any bird’s,
   </p>
   <p>
    and if they could be naturalized without being domesticated, it would
   </p>
   <p>
    soon become the most famous sound in our woods, surpassing the clangor
   </p>
   <p>
    of the goose and the hooting of the owl; and then imagine the cackling
   </p>
   <p>
    of the hens to fill the pauses when their lords’ clarions rested! No
   </p>
   <p>
    wonder that man added this bird to his tame stock,—to say nothing of
   </p>
   <p>
    the eggs and drumsticks. To walk in a winter morning in a wood where
   </p>
   <p>
    these birds abounded, their native woods, and hear the wild cockerels
   </p>
   <p>
    crow on the trees, clear and shrill for miles over the resounding
   </p>
   <p>
    earth, drowning the feebler notes of other birds,—think of it! It would
   </p>
   <p>
    put nations on the alert. Who would not be early to rise, and rise
   </p>
   <p>
    earlier and earlier every successive day of his life, till he became
   </p>
   <p>
    unspeakably healthy, wealthy, and wise? This foreign bird’s note is
   </p>
   <p>
    celebrated by the poets of all countries along with the notes of their
   </p>
   <p>
    native songsters. All climates agree with brave Chanticleer. He is more
   </p>
   <p>
    indigenous even than the natives. His health is ever good, his lungs
   </p>
   <p>
    are sound, his spirits never flag. Even the sailor on the Atlantic and
   </p>
   <p>
    Pacific is awakened by his voice; but its shrill sound never roused me
   </p>
   <p>
    from my slumbers. I kept neither dog, cat, cow, pig, nor hens, so that
   </p>
   <p>
    you would have said there was a deficiency of domestic sounds; neither
   </p>
   <p>
    the churn, nor the spinning wheel, nor even the singing of the kettle,
   </p>
   <p>
    nor the hissing of the urn, nor children crying, to comfort one. An
   </p>
   <p>
    old-fashioned man would have lost his senses or died of ennui before
   </p>
   <p>
    this. Not even rats in the wall, for they were starved out, or rather
   </p>
   <p>
    were never baited in,—only squirrels on the roof and under the floor, a
   </p>
   <p>
    whippoorwill on the ridge pole, a blue-jay screaming beneath the
   </p>
   <p>
    window, a hare or woodchuck under the house, a screech-owl or a cat-owl
   </p>
   <p>
    behind it, a flock of wild geese or a laughing loon on the pond, and a
   </p>
   <p>
    fox to bark in the night. Not even a lark or an oriole, those mild
   </p>
   <p>
    plantation birds, ever visited my clearing. No cockerels to crow nor
   </p>
   <p>
    hens to cackle in the yard. No yard! but unfenced Nature reaching up to
   </p>
   <p>
    your very sills. A young forest growing up under your meadows, and wild
   </p>
   <p>
    sumachs and blackberry vines breaking through into your cellar; sturdy
   </p>
   <p>
    pitch pines rubbing and creaking against the shingles for want of room,
   </p>
   <p>
    their roots reaching quite under the house. Instead of a scuttle or a
   </p>
   <p>
    blind blown off in the gale,—a pine tree snapped off or torn up by the
   </p>
   <p>
    roots behind your house for fuel. Instead of no path to the front-yard
   </p>
   <p>
    gate in the Great Snow,—no gate,—no front-yard,—and no path to the
   </p>
   <p>
    civilized world!
   </p>
   <p>
    Solitude
   </p>
   <p>
    This is a delicious evening, when the whole body is one sense, and
   </p>
   <p>
    imbibes delight through every pore. I go and come with a strange
   </p>
   <p>
    liberty in Nature, a part of herself. As I walk along the stony shore
   </p>
   <p>
    of the pond in my shirt sleeves, though it is cool as well as cloudy
   </p>
   <p>
    and windy, and I see nothing special to attract me, all the elements
   </p>
   <p>
    are unusually congenial to me. The bullfrogs trump to usher in the
   </p>
   <p>
    night, and the note of the whippoorwill is borne on the rippling wind
   </p>
   <p>
    from over the water. Sympathy with the fluttering alder and poplar
   </p>
   <p>
    leaves almost takes away my breath; yet, like the lake, my serenity is
   </p>
   <p>
    rippled but not ruffled. These small waves raised by the evening wind
   </p>
   <p>
    are as remote from storm as the smooth reflecting surface. Though it is
   </p>
   <p>
    now dark, the wind still blows and roars in the wood, the waves still
   </p>
   <p>
    dash, and some creatures lull the rest with their notes. The repose is
   </p>
   <p>
    never complete. The wildest animals do not repose, but seek their prey
   </p>
   <p>
    now; the fox, and skunk, and rabbit, now roam the fields and woods
   </p>
   <p>
    without fear. They are Nature’s watchmen,—links which connect the days
   </p>
   <p>
    of animated life.
   </p>
   <p>
    When I return to my house I find that visitors have been there and left
   </p>
   <p>
    their cards, either a bunch of flowers, or a wreath of evergreen, or a
   </p>
   <p>
    name in pencil on a yellow walnut leaf or a chip. They who come rarely
   </p>
   <p>
    to the woods take some little piece of the forest into their hands to
   </p>
   <p>
    play with by the way, which they leave, either intentionally or
   </p>
   <p>
    accidentally. One has peeled a willow wand, woven it into a ring, and
   </p>
   <p>
    dropped it on my table. I could always tell if visitors had called in
   </p>
   <p>
    my absence, either by the bended twigs or grass, or the print of their
   </p>
   <p>
    shoes, and generally of what sex or age or quality they were by some
   </p>
   <p>
    slight trace left, as a flower dropped, or a bunch of grass plucked and
   </p>
   <p>
    thrown away, even as far off as the railroad, half a mile distant, or
   </p>
   <p>
    by the lingering odor of a cigar or pipe. Nay, I was frequently
   </p>
   <p>
    notified of the passage of a traveller along the highway sixty rods off
   </p>
   <p>
    by the scent of his pipe.
   </p>
   <p>
    There is commonly sufficient space about us. Our horizon is never quite
   </p>
   <p>
    at our elbows. The thick wood is not just at our door, nor the pond,
   </p>
   <p>
    but somewhat is always clearing, familiar and worn by us, appropriated
   </p>
   <p>
    and fenced in some way, and reclaimed from Nature. For what reason have
   </p>
   <p>
    I this vast range and circuit, some square miles of unfrequented
   </p>
   <p>
    forest, for my privacy, abandoned to me by men? My nearest neighbor is
   </p>
   <p>
    a mile distant, and no house is visible from any place but the
   </p>
   <p>
    hill-tops within half a mile of my own. I have my horizon bounded by
   </p>
   <p>
    woods all to myself; a distant view of the railroad where it touches
   </p>
   <p>
    the pond on the one hand, and of the fence which skirts the woodland
   </p>
   <p>
    road on the other. But for the most part it is as solitary where I live
   </p>
   <p>
    as on the prairies. It is as much Asia or Africa as New England. I
   </p>
   <p>
    have, as it were, my own sun and moon and stars, and a little world all
   </p>
   <p>
    to myself. At night there was never a traveller passed my house, or
   </p>
   <p>
    knocked at my door, more than if I were the first or last man; unless
   </p>
   <p>
    it were in the spring, when at long intervals some came from the
   </p>
   <p>
    village to fish for pouts,—they plainly fished much more in the Walden
   </p>
   <p>
    Pond of their own natures, and baited their hooks with darkness,—but
   </p>
   <p>
    they soon retreated, usually with light baskets, and left “the world to
   </p>
   <p>
    darkness and to me,” and the black kernel of the night was never
   </p>
   <p>
    profaned by any human neighborhood. I believe that men are generally
   </p>
   <p>
    still a little afraid of the dark, though the witches are all hung, and
   </p>
   <p>
    Christianity and candles have been introduced.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet I experienced sometimes that the most sweet and tender, the most
   </p>
   <p>
    innocent and encouraging society may be found in any natural object,
   </p>
   <p>
    even for the poor misanthrope and most melancholy man. There can be no
   </p>
   <p>
    very black melancholy to him who lives in the midst of Nature and has
   </p>
   <p>
    his senses still. There was never yet such a storm but it was Æolian
   </p>
   <p>
    music to a healthy and innocent ear. Nothing can rightly compel a
   </p>
   <p>
    simple and brave man to a vulgar sadness. While I enjoy the friendship
   </p>
   <p>
    of the seasons I trust that nothing can make life a burden to me. The
   </p>
   <p>
    gentle rain which waters my beans and keeps me in the house to-day is
   </p>
   <p>
    not drear and melancholy, but good for me too. Though it prevents my
   </p>
   <p>
    hoeing them, it is of far more worth than my hoeing. If it should
   </p>
   <p>
    continue so long as to cause the seeds to rot in the ground and destroy
   </p>
   <p>
    the potatoes in the low lands, it would still be good for the grass on
   </p>
   <p>
    the uplands, and, being good for the grass, it would be good for me.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sometimes, when I compare myself with other men, it seems as if I were
   </p>
   <p>
    more favored by the gods than they, beyond any deserts that I am
   </p>
   <p>
    conscious of; as if I had a warrant and surety at their hands which my
   </p>
   <p>
    fellows have not, and were especially guided and guarded. I do not
   </p>
   <p>
    flatter myself, but if it be possible they flatter me. I have never
   </p>
   <p>
    felt lonesome, or in the least oppressed by a sense of solitude, but
   </p>
   <p>
    once, and that was a few weeks after I came to the woods, when, for an
   </p>
   <p>
    hour, I doubted if the near neighborhood of man was not essential to a
   </p>
   <p>
    serene and healthy life. To be alone was something unpleasant. But I
   </p>
   <p>
    was at the same time conscious of a slight insanity in my mood, and
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed to foresee my recovery. In the midst of a gentle rain while
   </p>
   <p>
    these thoughts prevailed, I was suddenly sensible of such sweet and
   </p>
   <p>
    beneficent society in Nature, in the very pattering of the drops, and
   </p>
   <p>
    in every sound and sight around my house, an infinite and unaccountable
   </p>
   <p>
    friendliness all at once like an atmosphere sustaining me, as made the
   </p>
   <p>
    fancied advantages of human neighborhood insignificant, and I have
   </p>
   <p>
    never thought of them since. Every little pine needle expanded and
   </p>
   <p>
    swelled with sympathy and befriended me. I was so distinctly made aware
   </p>
   <p>
    of the presence of something kindred to me, even in scenes which we are
   </p>
   <p>
    accustomed to call wild and dreary, and also that the nearest of blood
   </p>
   <p>
    to me and humanest was not a person nor a villager, that I thought no
   </p>
   <p>
    place could ever be strange to me again.—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Mourning untimely consumes the sad;
   </p>
   <p>
    Few are their days in the land of the living,
   </p>
   <p>
    Beautiful daughter of Toscar.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Some of my pleasantest hours were during the long rain storms in the
   </p>
   <p>
    spring or fall, which confined me to the house for the afternoon as
   </p>
   <p>
    well as the forenoon, soothed by their ceaseless roar and pelting; when
   </p>
   <p>
    an early twilight ushered in a long evening in which many thoughts had
   </p>
   <p>
    time to take root and unfold themselves. In those driving north-east
   </p>
   <p>
    rains which tried the village houses so, when the maids stood ready
   </p>
   <p>
    with mop and pail in front entries to keep the deluge out, I sat behind
   </p>
   <p>
    my door in my little house, which was all entry, and thoroughly enjoyed
   </p>
   <p>
    its protection. In one heavy thunder shower the lightning struck a
   </p>
   <p>
    large pitch-pine across the pond, making a very conspicuous and
   </p>
   <p>
    perfectly regular spiral groove from top to bottom, an inch or more
   </p>
   <p>
    deep, and four or five inches wide, as you would groove a
   </p>
   <p>
    walking-stick. I passed it again the other day, and was struck with awe
   </p>
   <p>
    on looking up and beholding that mark, now more distinct than ever,
   </p>
   <p>
    where a terrific and resistless bolt came down out of the harmless sky
   </p>
   <p>
    eight years ago. Men frequently say to me, “I should think you would
   </p>
   <p>
    feel lonesome down there, and want to be nearer to folks, rainy and
   </p>
   <p>
    snowy days and nights especially.” I am tempted to reply to such,—This
   </p>
   <p>
    whole earth which we inhabit is but a point in space. How far apart,
   </p>
   <p>
    think you, dwell the two most distant inhabitants of yonder star, the
   </p>
   <p>
    breadth of whose disk cannot be appreciated by our instruments? Why
   </p>
   <p>
    should I feel lonely? is not our planet in the Milky Way? This which
   </p>
   <p>
    you put seems to me not to be the most important question. What sort of
   </p>
   <p>
    space is that which separates a man from his fellows and makes him
   </p>
   <p>
    solitary? I have found that no exertion of the legs can bring two minds
   </p>
   <p>
    much nearer to one another. What do we want most to dwell near to? Not
   </p>
   <p>
    to many men surely, the depot, the post-office, the bar-room, the
   </p>
   <p>
    meeting-house, the school-house, the grocery, Beacon Hill, or the Five
   </p>
   <p>
    Points, where men most congregate, but to the perennial source of our
   </p>
   <p>
    life, whence in all our experience we have found that to issue, as the
   </p>
   <p>
    willow stands near the water and sends out its roots in that direction.
   </p>
   <p>
    This will vary with different natures, but this is the place where a
   </p>
   <p>
    wise man will dig his cellar.... I one evening overtook one of my
   </p>
   <p>
    townsmen, who has accumulated what is called “a handsome
   </p>
   <p>
    property,”—though I never got a _fair_ view of it,—on the Walden road,
   </p>
   <p>
    driving a pair of cattle to market, who inquired of me how I could
   </p>
   <p>
    bring my mind to give up so many of the comforts of life. I answered
   </p>
   <p>
    that I was very sure I liked it passably well; I was not joking. And so
   </p>
   <p>
    I went home to my bed, and left him to pick his way through the
   </p>
   <p>
    darkness and the mud to Brighton,—or Bright-town,—which place he would
   </p>
   <p>
    reach some time in the morning.
   </p>
   <p>
    Any prospect of awakening or coming to life to a dead man makes
   </p>
   <p>
    indifferent all times and places. The place where that may occur is
   </p>
   <p>
    always the same, and indescribably pleasant to all our senses. For the
   </p>
   <p>
    most part we allow only outlying and transient circumstances to make
   </p>
   <p>
    our occasions. They are, in fact, the cause of our distraction. Nearest
   </p>
   <p>
    to all things is that power which fashions their being. _Next_ to us
   </p>
   <p>
    the grandest laws are continually being executed. _Next_ to us is not
   </p>
   <p>
    the workman whom we have hired, with whom we love so well to talk, but
   </p>
   <p>
    the workman whose work we are.
   </p>
   <p>
    “How vast and profound is the influence of the subtile powers of Heaven
   </p>
   <p>
    and of Earth!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “We seek to perceive them, and we do not see them; we seek to hear
   </p>
   <p>
    them, and we do not hear them; identified with the substance of things,
   </p>
   <p>
    they cannot be separated from them.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “They cause that in all the universe men purify and sanctify their
   </p>
   <p>
    hearts, and clothe themselves in their holiday garments to offer
   </p>
   <p>
    sacrifices and oblations to their ancestors. It is an ocean of subtile
   </p>
   <p>
    intelligences. They are every where, above us, on our left, on our
   </p>
   <p>
    right; they environ us on all sides.”
   </p>
   <p>
    We are the subjects of an experiment which is not a little interesting
   </p>
   <p>
    to me. Can we not do without the society of our gossips a little while
   </p>
   <p>
    under these circumstances,—have our own thoughts to cheer us? Confucius
   </p>
   <p>
    says truly, “Virtue does not remain as an abandoned orphan; it must of
   </p>
   <p>
    necessity have neighbors.”
   </p>
   <p>
    With thinking we may be beside ourselves in a sane sense. By a
   </p>
   <p>
    conscious effort of the mind we can stand aloof from actions and their
   </p>
   <p>
    consequences; and all things, good and bad, go by us like a torrent. We
   </p>
   <p>
    are not wholly involved in Nature. I may be either the drift-wood in
   </p>
   <p>
    the stream, or Indra in the sky looking down on it. I _may_ be affected
   </p>
   <p>
    by a theatrical exhibition; on the other hand, I _may not_ be affected
   </p>
   <p>
    by an actual event which appears to concern me much more. I only know
   </p>
   <p>
    myself as a human entity; the scene, so to speak, of thoughts and
   </p>
   <p>
    affections; and am sensible of a certain doubleness by which I can
   </p>
   <p>
    stand as remote from myself as from another. However intense my
   </p>
   <p>
    experience, I am conscious of the presence and criticism of a part of
   </p>
   <p>
    me, which, as it were, is not a part of me, but spectator, sharing no
   </p>
   <p>
    experience, but taking note of it; and that is no more I than it is
   </p>
   <p>
    you. When the play, it may be the tragedy, of life is over, the
   </p>
   <p>
    spectator goes his way. It was a kind of fiction, a work of the
   </p>
   <p>
    imagination only, so far as he was concerned. This doubleness may
   </p>
   <p>
    easily make us poor neighbors and friends sometimes.
   </p>
   <p>
    I find it wholesome to be alone the greater part of the time. To be in
   </p>
   <p>
    company, even with the best, is soon wearisome and dissipating. I love
   </p>
   <p>
    to be alone. I never found the companion that was so companionable as
   </p>
   <p>
    solitude. We are for the most part more lonely when we go abroad among
   </p>
   <p>
    men than when we stay in our chambers. A man thinking or working is
   </p>
   <p>
    always alone, let him be where he will. Solitude is not measured by the
   </p>
   <p>
    miles of space that intervene between a man and his fellows. The really
   </p>
   <p>
    diligent student in one of the crowded hives of Cambridge College is as
   </p>
   <p>
    solitary as a dervish in the desert. The farmer can work alone in the
   </p>
   <p>
    field or the woods all day, hoeing or chopping, and not feel lonesome,
   </p>
   <p>
    because he is employed; but when he comes home at night he cannot sit
   </p>
   <p>
    down in a room alone, at the mercy of his thoughts, but must be where
   </p>
   <p>
    he can “see the folks,” and recreate, and as he thinks remunerate
   </p>
   <p>
    himself for his day’s solitude; and hence he wonders how the student
   </p>
   <p>
    can sit alone in the house all night and most of the day without ennui
   </p>
   <p>
    and “the blues;” but he does not realize that the student, though in
   </p>
   <p>
    the house, is still at work in _his_ field, and chopping in _his_
   </p>
   <p>
    woods, as the farmer in his, and in turn seeks the same recreation and
   </p>
   <p>
    society that the latter does, though it may be a more condensed form of
   </p>
   <p>
    it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Society is commonly too cheap. We meet at very short intervals, not
   </p>
   <p>
    having had time to acquire any new value for each other. We meet at
   </p>
   <p>
    meals three times a day, and give each other a new taste of that old
   </p>
   <p>
    musty cheese that we are. We have had to agree on a certain set of
   </p>
   <p>
    rules, called etiquette and politeness, to make this frequent meeting
   </p>
   <p>
    tolerable and that we need not come to open war. We meet at the
   </p>
   <p>
    post-office, and at the sociable, and about the fireside every night;
   </p>
   <p>
    we live thick and are in each other’s way, and stumble over one
   </p>
   <p>
    another, and I think that we thus lose some respect for one another.
   </p>
   <p>
    Certainly less frequency would suffice for all important and hearty
   </p>
   <p>
    communications. Consider the girls in a factory,—never alone, hardly in
   </p>
   <p>
    their dreams. It would be better if there were but one inhabitant to a
   </p>
   <p>
    square mile, as where I live. The value of a man is not in his skin,
   </p>
   <p>
    that we should touch him.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have heard of a man lost in the woods and dying of famine and
   </p>
   <p>
    exhaustion at the foot of a tree, whose loneliness was relieved by the
   </p>
   <p>
    grotesque visions with which, owing to bodily weakness, his diseased
   </p>
   <p>
    imagination surrounded him, and which he believed to be real. So also,
   </p>
   <p>
    owing to bodily and mental health and strength, we may be continually
   </p>
   <p>
    cheered by a like but more normal and natural society, and come to know
   </p>
   <p>
    that we are never alone.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have a great deal of company in my house; especially in the morning,
   </p>
   <p>
    when nobody calls. Let me suggest a few comparisons, that some one may
   </p>
   <p>
    convey an idea of my situation. I am no more lonely than the loon in
   </p>
   <p>
    the pond that laughs so loud, or than Walden Pond itself. What company
   </p>
   <p>
    has that lonely lake, I pray? And yet it has not the blue devils, but
   </p>
   <p>
    the blue angels in it, in the azure tint of its waters. The sun is
   </p>
   <p>
    alone, except in thick weather, when there sometimes appear to be two,
   </p>
   <p>
    but one is a mock sun. God is alone,—but the devil, he is far from
   </p>
   <p>
    being alone; he sees a great deal of company; he is legion. I am no
   </p>
   <p>
    more lonely than a single mullein or dandelion in a pasture, or a bean
   </p>
   <p>
    leaf, or sorrel, or a horse-fly, or a bumble-bee. I am no more lonely
   </p>
   <p>
    than the Mill Brook, or a weathercock, or the north star, or the south
   </p>
   <p>
    wind, or an April shower, or a January thaw, or the first spider in a
   </p>
   <p>
    new house.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have occasional visits in the long winter evenings, when the snow
   </p>
   <p>
    falls fast and the wind howls in the wood, from an old settler and
   </p>
   <p>
    original proprietor, who is reported to have dug Walden Pond, and
   </p>
   <p>
    stoned it, and fringed it with pine woods; who tells me stories of old
   </p>
   <p>
    time and of new eternity; and between us we manage to pass a cheerful
   </p>
   <p>
    evening with social mirth and pleasant views of things, even without
   </p>
   <p>
    apples or cider,—a most wise and humorous friend, whom I love much, who
   </p>
   <p>
    keeps himself more secret than ever did Goffe or Whalley; and though he
   </p>
   <p>
    is thought to be dead, none can show where he is buried. An elderly
   </p>
   <p>
    dame, too, dwells in my neighborhood, invisible to most persons, in
   </p>
   <p>
    whose odorous herb garden I love to stroll sometimes, gathering simples
   </p>
   <p>
    and listening to her fables; for she has a genius of unequalled
   </p>
   <p>
    fertility, and her memory runs back farther than mythology, and she can
   </p>
   <p>
    tell me the original of every fable, and on what fact every one is
   </p>
   <p>
    founded, for the incidents occurred when she was young. A ruddy and
   </p>
   <p>
    lusty old dame, who delights in all weathers and seasons, and is likely
   </p>
   <p>
    to outlive all her children yet.
   </p>
   <p>
    The indescribable innocence and beneficence of Nature,—of sun and wind
   </p>
   <p>
    and rain, of summer and winter,—such health, such cheer, they afford
   </p>
   <p>
    forever! and such sympathy have they ever with our race, that all
   </p>
   <p>
    Nature would be affected, and the sun’s brightness fade, and the winds
   </p>
   <p>
    would sigh humanely, and the clouds rain tears, and the woods shed
   </p>
   <p>
    their leaves and put on mourning in midsummer, if any man should ever
   </p>
   <p>
    for a just cause grieve. Shall I not have intelligence with the earth?
   </p>
   <p>
    Am I not partly leaves and vegetable mould myself?
   </p>
   <p>
    What is the pill which will keep us well, serene, contented? Not my or
   </p>
   <p>
    thy great-grandfather’s, but our great-grandmother Nature’s universal,
   </p>
   <p>
    vegetable, botanic medicines, by which she has kept herself young
   </p>
   <p>
    always, outlived so many old Parrs in her day, and fed her health with
   </p>
   <p>
    their decaying fatness. For my panacea, instead of one of those quack
   </p>
   <p>
    vials of a mixture dipped from Acheron and the Dead Sea, which come out
   </p>
   <p>
    of those long shallow black-schooner looking wagons which we sometimes
   </p>
   <p>
    see made to carry bottles, let me have a draught of undiluted morning
   </p>
   <p>
    air. Morning air! If men will not drink of this at the fountain-head of
   </p>
   <p>
    the day, why, then, we must even bottle up some and sell it in the
   </p>
   <p>
    shops, for the benefit of those who have lost their subscription ticket
   </p>
   <p>
    to morning time in this world. But remember, it will not keep quite
   </p>
   <p>
    till noon-day even in the coolest cellar, but drive out the stopples
   </p>
   <p>
    long ere that and follow westward the steps of Aurora. I am no
   </p>
   <p>
    worshipper of Hygeia, who was the daughter of that old herb-doctor
   </p>
   <p>
    Æsculapius, and who is represented on monuments holding a serpent in
   </p>
   <p>
    one hand, and in the other a cup out of which the serpent sometimes
   </p>
   <p>
    drinks; but rather of Hebe, cupbearer to Jupiter, who was the daughter
   </p>
   <p>
    of Juno and wild lettuce, and who had the power of restoring gods and
   </p>
   <p>
    men to the vigor of youth. She was probably the only thoroughly
   </p>
   <p>
    sound-conditioned, healthy, and robust young lady that ever walked the
   </p>
   <p>
    globe, and wherever she came it was spring.
   </p>
   <p>
    Visitors
   </p>
   <p>
    I think that I love society as much as most, and am ready enough to
   </p>
   <p>
    fasten myself like a bloodsucker for the time to any full-blooded man
   </p>
   <p>
    that comes in my way. I am naturally no hermit, but might possibly sit
   </p>
   <p>
    out the sturdiest frequenter of the bar-room, if my business called me
   </p>
   <p>
    thither.
   </p>
   <p>
    I had three chairs in my house; one for solitude, two for friendship,
   </p>
   <p>
    three for society. When visitors came in larger and unexpected numbers
   </p>
   <p>
    there was but the third chair for them all, but they generally
   </p>
   <p>
    economized the room by standing up. It is surprising how many great men
   </p>
   <p>
    and women a small house will contain. I have had twenty-five or thirty
   </p>
   <p>
    souls, with their bodies, at once under my roof, and yet we often
   </p>
   <p>
    parted without being aware that we had come very near to one another.
   </p>
   <p>
    Many of our houses, both public and private, with their almost
   </p>
   <p>
    innumerable apartments, their huge halls and their cellars for the
   </p>
   <p>
    storage of wines and other munitions of peace, appear to me
   </p>
   <p>
    extravagantly large for their inhabitants. They are so vast and
   </p>
   <p>
    magnificent that the latter seem to be only vermin which infest them. I
   </p>
   <p>
    am surprised when the herald blows his summons before some Tremont or
   </p>
   <p>
    Astor or Middlesex House, to see come creeping out over the piazza for
   </p>
   <p>
    all inhabitants a ridiculous mouse, which soon again slinks into some
   </p>
   <p>
    hole in the pavement.
   </p>
   <p>
    One inconvenience I sometimes experienced in so small a house, the
   </p>
   <p>
    difficulty of getting to a sufficient distance from my guest when we
   </p>
   <p>
    began to utter the big thoughts in big words. You want room for your
   </p>
   <p>
    thoughts to get into sailing trim and run a course or two before they
   </p>
   <p>
    make their port. The bullet of your thought must have overcome its
   </p>
   <p>
    lateral and ricochet motion and fallen into its last and steady course
   </p>
   <p>
    before it reaches the ear of the hearer, else it may plough out again
   </p>
   <p>
    through the side of his head. Also, our sentences wanted room to unfold
   </p>
   <p>
    and form their columns in the interval. Individuals, like nations, must
   </p>
   <p>
    have suitable broad and natural boundaries, even a considerable neutral
   </p>
   <p>
    ground, between them. I have found it a singular luxury to talk across
   </p>
   <p>
    the pond to a companion on the opposite side. In my house we were so
   </p>
   <p>
    near that we could not begin to hear,—we could not speak low enough to
   </p>
   <p>
    be heard; as when you throw two stones into calm water so near that
   </p>
   <p>
    they break each other’s undulations. If we are merely loquacious and
   </p>
   <p>
    loud talkers, then we can afford to stand very near together, cheek by
   </p>
   <p>
    jowl, and feel each other’s breath; but if we speak reservedly and
   </p>
   <p>
    thoughtfully, we want to be farther apart, that all animal heat and
   </p>
   <p>
    moisture may have a chance to evaporate. If we would enjoy the most
   </p>
   <p>
    intimate society with that in each of us which is without, or above,
   </p>
   <p>
    being spoken to, we must not only be silent, but commonly so far apart
   </p>
   <p>
    bodily that we cannot possibly hear each other’s voice in any case.
   </p>
   <p>
    Referred to this standard, speech is for the convenience of those who
   </p>
   <p>
    are hard of hearing; but there are many fine things which we cannot say
   </p>
   <p>
    if we have to shout. As the conversation began to assume a loftier and
   </p>
   <p>
    grander tone, we gradually shoved our chairs farther apart till they
   </p>
   <p>
    touched the wall in opposite corners, and then commonly there was not
   </p>
   <p>
    room enough.
   </p>
   <p>
    My “best” room, however, my withdrawing room, always ready for company,
   </p>
   <p>
    on whose carpet the sun rarely fell, was the pine wood behind my house.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thither in summer days, when distinguished guests came, I took them,
   </p>
   <p>
    and a priceless domestic swept the floor and dusted the furniture and
   </p>
   <p>
    kept the things in order.
   </p>
   <p>
    If one guest came he sometimes partook of my frugal meal, and it was no
   </p>
   <p>
    interruption to conversation to be stirring a hasty-pudding, or
   </p>
   <p>
    watching the rising and maturing of a loaf of bread in the ashes, in
   </p>
   <p>
    the mean while. But if twenty came and sat in my house there was
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing said about dinner, though there might be bread enough for two,
   </p>
   <p>
    more than if eating were a forsaken habit; but we naturally practised
   </p>
   <p>
    abstinence; and this was never felt to be an offence against
   </p>
   <p>
    hospitality, but the most proper and considerate course. The waste and
   </p>
   <p>
    decay of physical life, which so often needs repair, seemed
   </p>
   <p>
    miraculously retarded in such a case, and the vital vigor stood its
   </p>
   <p>
    ground. I could entertain thus a thousand as well as twenty; and if any
   </p>
   <p>
    ever went away disappointed or hungry from my house when they found me
   </p>
   <p>
    at home, they may depend upon it that I sympathized with them at least.
   </p>
   <p>
    So easy is it, though many housekeepers doubt it, to establish new and
   </p>
   <p>
    better customs in the place of the old. You need not rest your
   </p>
   <p>
    reputation on the dinners you give. For my own part, I was never so
   </p>
   <p>
    effectually deterred from frequenting a man’s house, by any kind of
   </p>
   <p>
    Cerberus whatever, as by the parade one made about dining me, which I
   </p>
   <p>
    took to be a very polite and roundabout hint never to trouble him so
   </p>
   <p>
    again. I think I shall never revisit those scenes. I should be proud to
   </p>
   <p>
    have for the motto of my cabin those lines of Spenser which one of my
   </p>
   <p>
    visitors inscribed on a yellow walnut leaf for a card:—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Arrivéd there, the little house they fill,
   </p>
   <p>
    Ne looke for entertainment where none was;
   </p>
   <p>
    Rest is their feast, and all things at their will:
   </p>
   <p>
    The noblest mind the best contentment has.”
   </p>
   <p>
    When Winslow, afterward governor of the Plymouth Colony, went with a
   </p>
   <p>
    companion on a visit of ceremony to Massasoit on foot through the
   </p>
   <p>
    woods, and arrived tired and hungry at his lodge, they were well
   </p>
   <p>
    received by the king, but nothing was said about eating that day. When
   </p>
   <p>
    the night arrived, to quote their own words,—“He laid us on the bed
   </p>
   <p>
    with himself and his wife, they at the one end and we at the other, it
   </p>
   <p>
    being only planks laid a foot from the ground, and a thin mat upon
   </p>
   <p>
    them. Two more of his chief men, for want of room, pressed by and upon
   </p>
   <p>
    us; so that we were worse weary of our lodging than of our journey.” At
   </p>
   <p>
    one o’clock the next day Massasoit “brought two fishes that he had
   </p>
   <p>
    shot,” about thrice as big as a bream; “these being boiled, there were
   </p>
   <p>
    at least forty looked for a share in them. The most ate of them. This
   </p>
   <p>
    meal only we had in two nights and a day; and had not one of us bought
   </p>
   <p>
    a partridge, we had taken our journey fasting.” Fearing that they would
   </p>
   <p>
    be light-headed for want of food and also sleep, owing to “the savages’
   </p>
   <p>
    barbarous singing, (for they used to sing themselves asleep,)” and that
   </p>
   <p>
    they might get home while they had strength to travel, they departed.
   </p>
   <p>
    As for lodging, it is true they were but poorly entertained, though
   </p>
   <p>
    what they found an inconvenience was no doubt intended for an honor;
   </p>
   <p>
    but as far as eating was concerned, I do not see how the Indians could
   </p>
   <p>
    have done better. They had nothing to eat themselves, and they were
   </p>
   <p>
    wiser than to think that apologies could supply the place of food to
   </p>
   <p>
    their guests; so they drew their belts tighter and said nothing about
   </p>
   <p>
    it. Another time when Winslow visited them, it being a season of plenty
   </p>
   <p>
    with them, there was no deficiency in this respect.
   </p>
   <p>
    As for men, they will hardly fail one any where. I had more visitors
   </p>
   <p>
    while I lived in the woods than at any other period in my life; I mean
   </p>
   <p>
    that I had some. I met several there under more favorable circumstances
   </p>
   <p>
    than I could any where else. But fewer came to see me on trivial
   </p>
   <p>
    business. In this respect, my company was winnowed by my mere distance
   </p>
   <p>
    from town. I had withdrawn so far within the great ocean of solitude,
   </p>
   <p>
    into which the rivers of society empty, that for the most part, so far
   </p>
   <p>
    as my needs were concerned, only the finest sediment was deposited
   </p>
   <p>
    around me. Beside, there were wafted to me evidences of unexplored and
   </p>
   <p>
    uncultivated continents on the other side.
   </p>
   <p>
    Who should come to my lodge this morning but a true Homeric or
   </p>
   <p>
    Paphlagonian man,—he had so suitable and poetic a name that I am sorry
   </p>
   <p>
    I cannot print it here,—a Canadian, a woodchopper and post-maker, who
   </p>
   <p>
    can hole fifty posts in a day, who made his last supper on a woodchuck
   </p>
   <p>
    which his dog caught. He, too, has heard of Homer, and, “if it were not
   </p>
   <p>
    for books,” would “not know what to do rainy days,” though perhaps he
   </p>
   <p>
    has not read one wholly through for many rainy seasons. Some priest who
   </p>
   <p>
    could pronounce the Greek itself taught him to read his verse in the
   </p>
   <p>
    testament in his native parish far away; and now I must translate to
   </p>
   <p>
    him, while he holds the book, Achilles’ reproof to Patroclus for his
   </p>
   <p>
    sad countenance.—“Why are you in tears, Patroclus, like a young girl?”—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Or have you alone heard some news from Phthia?
   </p>
   <p>
    They say that Menœtius lives yet, son of Actor,
   </p>
   <p>
    And Peleus lives, son of Æacus, among the Myrmidons,
   </p>
   <p>
    Either of whom having died, we should greatly grieve.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He says, “That’s good.” He has a great bundle of white-oak bark under
   </p>
   <p>
    his arm for a sick man, gathered this Sunday morning. “I suppose
   </p>
   <p>
    there’s no harm in going after such a thing to-day,” says he. To him
   </p>
   <p>
    Homer was a great writer, though what his writing was about he did not
   </p>
   <p>
    know. A more simple and natural man it would be hard to find. Vice and
   </p>
   <p>
    disease, which cast such a sombre moral hue over the world, seemed to
   </p>
   <p>
    have hardly any existence for him. He was about twenty-eight years old,
   </p>
   <p>
    and had left Canada and his father’s house a dozen years before to work
   </p>
   <p>
    in the States, and earn money to buy a farm with at last, perhaps in
   </p>
   <p>
    his native country. He was cast in the coarsest mould; a stout but
   </p>
   <p>
    sluggish body, yet gracefully carried, with a thick sunburnt neck, dark
   </p>
   <p>
    bushy hair, and dull sleepy blue eyes, which were occasionally lit up
   </p>
   <p>
    with expression. He wore a flat gray cloth cap, a dingy wool-colored
   </p>
   <p>
    greatcoat, and cowhide boots. He was a great consumer of meat, usually
   </p>
   <p>
    carrying his dinner to his work a couple of miles past my house,—for he
   </p>
   <p>
    chopped all summer,—in a tin pail; cold meats, often cold woodchucks,
   </p>
   <p>
    and coffee in a stone bottle which dangled by a string from his belt;
   </p>
   <p>
    and sometimes he offered me a drink. He came along early, crossing my
   </p>
   <p>
    bean-field, though without anxiety or haste to get to his work, such as
   </p>
   <p>
    Yankees exhibit. He wasn’t a-going to hurt himself. He didn’t care if
   </p>
   <p>
    he only earned his board. Frequently he would leave his dinner in the
   </p>
   <p>
    bushes, when his dog had caught a woodchuck by the way, and go back a
   </p>
   <p>
    mile and a half to dress it and leave it in the cellar of the house
   </p>
   <p>
    where he boarded, after deliberating first for half an hour whether he
   </p>
   <p>
    could not sink it in the pond safely till nightfall,—loving to dwell
   </p>
   <p>
    long upon these themes. He would say, as he went by in the morning,
   </p>
   <p>
    “How thick the pigeons are! If working every day were not my trade, I
   </p>
   <p>
    could get all the meat I should want by hunting,—pigeons, woodchucks,
   </p>
   <p>
    rabbits, partridges,—by gosh! I could get all I should want for a week
   </p>
   <p>
    in one day.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He was a skilful chopper, and indulged in some flourishes and ornaments
   </p>
   <p>
    in his art. He cut his trees level and close to the ground, that the
   </p>
   <p>
    sprouts which came up afterward might be more vigorous and a sled might
   </p>
   <p>
    slide over the stumps; and instead of leaving a whole tree to support
   </p>
   <p>
    his corded wood, he would pare it away to a slender stake or splinter
   </p>
   <p>
    which you could break off with your hand at last.
   </p>
   <p>
    He interested me because he was so quiet and solitary and so happy
   </p>
   <p>
    withal; a well of good humor and contentment which overflowed at his
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes. His mirth was without alloy. Sometimes I saw him at his work in
   </p>
   <p>
    the woods, felling trees, and he would greet me with a laugh of
   </p>
   <p>
    inexpressible satisfaction, and a salutation in Canadian French, though
   </p>
   <p>
    he spoke English as well. When I approached him he would suspend his
   </p>
   <p>
    work, and with half-suppressed mirth lie along the trunk of a pine
   </p>
   <p>
    which he had felled, and, peeling off the inner bark, roll it up into a
   </p>
   <p>
    ball and chew it while he laughed and talked. Such an exuberance of
   </p>
   <p>
    animal spirits had he that he sometimes tumbled down and rolled on the
   </p>
   <p>
    ground with laughter at any thing which made him think and tickled him.
   </p>
   <p>
    Looking round upon the trees he would exclaim,—“By George! I can enjoy
   </p>
   <p>
    myself well enough here chopping; I want no better sport.” Sometimes,
   </p>
   <p>
    when at leisure, he amused himself all day in the woods with a pocket
   </p>
   <p>
    pistol, firing salutes to himself at regular intervals as he walked. In
   </p>
   <p>
    the winter he had a fire by which at noon he warmed his coffee in a
   </p>
   <p>
    kettle; and as he sat on a log to eat his dinner the chickadees would
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes come round and alight on his arm and peck at the potato in
   </p>
   <p>
    his fingers; and he said that he “liked to have the little _fellers_
   </p>
   <p>
    about him.”
   </p>
   <p>
    In him the animal man chiefly was developed. In physical endurance and
   </p>
   <p>
    contentment he was cousin to the pine and the rock. I asked him once if
   </p>
   <p>
    he was not sometimes tired at night, after working all day; and he
   </p>
   <p>
    answered, with a sincere and serious look, “Gorrappit, I never was
   </p>
   <p>
    tired in my life.” But the intellectual and what is called spiritual
   </p>
   <p>
    man in him were slumbering as in an infant. He had been instructed only
   </p>
   <p>
    in that innocent and ineffectual way in which the Catholic priests
   </p>
   <p>
    teach the aborigines, by which the pupil is never educated to the
   </p>
   <p>
    degree of consciousness, but only to the degree of trust and reverence,
   </p>
   <p>
    and a child is not made a man, but kept a child. When Nature made him,
   </p>
   <p>
    she gave him a strong body and contentment for his portion, and propped
   </p>
   <p>
    him on every side with reverence and reliance, that he might live out
   </p>
   <p>
    his threescore years and ten a child. He was so genuine and
   </p>
   <p>
    unsophisticated that no introduction would serve to introduce him, more
   </p>
   <p>
    than if you introduced a woodchuck to your neighbor. He had got to find
   </p>
   <p>
    him out as you did. He would not play any part. Men paid him wages for
   </p>
   <p>
    work, and so helped to feed and clothe him; but he never exchanged
   </p>
   <p>
    opinions with them. He was so simply and naturally humble—if he can be
   </p>
   <p>
    called humble who never aspires—that humility was no distinct quality
   </p>
   <p>
    in him, nor could he conceive of it. Wiser men were demigods to him. If
   </p>
   <p>
    you told him that such a one was coming, he did as if he thought that
   </p>
   <p>
    any thing so grand would expect nothing of himself, but take all the
   </p>
   <p>
    responsibility on itself, and let him be forgotten still. He never
   </p>
   <p>
    heard the sound of praise. He particularly reverenced the writer and
   </p>
   <p>
    the preacher. Their performances were miracles. When I told him that I
   </p>
   <p>
    wrote considerably, he thought for a long time that it was merely the
   </p>
   <p>
    handwriting which I meant, for he could write a remarkably good hand
   </p>
   <p>
    himself. I sometimes found the name of his native parish handsomely
   </p>
   <p>
    written in the snow by the highway, with the proper French accent, and
   </p>
   <p>
    knew that he had passed. I asked him if he ever wished to write his
   </p>
   <p>
    thoughts. He said that he had read and written letters for those who
   </p>
   <p>
    could not, but he never tried to write thoughts,—no, he could not, he
   </p>
   <p>
    could not tell what to put first, it would kill him, and then there was
   </p>
   <p>
    spelling to be attended to at the same time!
   </p>
   <p>
    I heard that a distinguished wise man and reformer asked him if he did
   </p>
   <p>
    not want the world to be changed; but he answered with a chuckle of
   </p>
   <p>
    surprise in his Canadian accent, not knowing that the question had ever
   </p>
   <p>
    been entertained before, “No, I like it well enough.” It would have
   </p>
   <p>
    suggested many things to a philosopher to have dealings with him. To a
   </p>
   <p>
    stranger he appeared to know nothing of things in general; yet I
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes saw in him a man whom I had not seen before, and I did not
   </p>
   <p>
    know whether he was as wise as Shakespeare or as simply ignorant as a
   </p>
   <p>
    child, whether to suspect him of a fine poetic consciousness or of
   </p>
   <p>
    stupidity. A townsman told me that when he met him sauntering through
   </p>
   <p>
    the village in his small close-fitting cap, and whistling to himself,
   </p>
   <p>
    he reminded him of a prince in disguise.
   </p>
   <p>
    His only books were an almanac and an arithmetic, in which last he was
   </p>
   <p>
    considerably expert. The former was a sort of cyclopædia to him, which
   </p>
   <p>
    he supposed to contain an abstract of human knowledge, as indeed it
   </p>
   <p>
    does to a considerable extent. I loved to sound him on the various
   </p>
   <p>
    reforms of the day, and he never failed to look at them in the most
   </p>
   <p>
    simple and practical light. He had never heard of such things before.
   </p>
   <p>
    Could he do without factories? I asked. He had worn the home-made
   </p>
   <p>
    Vermont gray, he said, and that was good. Could he dispense with tea
   </p>
   <p>
    and coffee? Did this country afford any beverage beside water? He had
   </p>
   <p>
    soaked hemlock leaves in water and drank it, and thought that was
   </p>
   <p>
    better than water in warm weather. When I asked him if he could do
   </p>
   <p>
    without money, he showed the convenience of money in such a way as to
   </p>
   <p>
    suggest and coincide with the most philosophical accounts of the origin
   </p>
   <p>
    of this institution, and the very derivation of the word _pecunia_. If
   </p>
   <p>
    an ox were his property, and he wished to get needles and thread at the
   </p>
   <p>
    store, he thought it would be inconvenient and impossible soon to go on
   </p>
   <p>
    mortgaging some portion of the creature each time to that amount. He
   </p>
   <p>
    could defend many institutions better than any philosopher, because, in
   </p>
   <p>
    describing them as they concerned him, he gave the true reason for
   </p>
   <p>
    their prevalence, and speculation had not suggested to him any other.
   </p>
   <p>
    At another time, hearing Plato’s definition of a man,—a biped without
   </p>
   <p>
    feathers,—and that one exhibited a cock plucked and called it Plato’s
   </p>
   <p>
    man, he thought it an important difference that the _knees_ bent the
   </p>
   <p>
    wrong way. He would sometimes exclaim, “How I love to talk! By George,
   </p>
   <p>
    I could talk all day!” I asked him once, when I had not seen him for
   </p>
   <p>
    many months, if he had got a new idea this summer. “Good Lord,” said
   </p>
   <p>
    he, “a man that has to work as I do, if he does not forget the ideas he
   </p>
   <p>
    has had, he will do well. May be the man you hoe with is inclined to
   </p>
   <p>
    race; then, by gorry, your mind must be there; you think of weeds.” He
   </p>
   <p>
    would sometimes ask me first on such occasions, if I had made any
   </p>
   <p>
    improvement. One winter day I asked him if he was always satisfied with
   </p>
   <p>
    himself, wishing to suggest a substitute within him for the priest
   </p>
   <p>
    without, and some higher motive for living. “Satisfied!” said he; “some
   </p>
   <p>
    men are satisfied with one thing, and some with another. One man,
   </p>
   <p>
    perhaps, if he has got enough, will be satisfied to sit all day with
   </p>
   <p>
    his back to the fire and his belly to the table, by George!” Yet I
   </p>
   <p>
    never, by any manœuvring, could get him to take the spiritual view of
   </p>
   <p>
    things; the highest that he appeared to conceive of was a simple
   </p>
   <p>
    expediency, such as you might expect an animal to appreciate; and this,
   </p>
   <p>
    practically, is true of most men. If I suggested any improvement in his
   </p>
   <p>
    mode of life, he merely answered, without expressing any regret, that
   </p>
   <p>
    it was too late. Yet he thoroughly believed in honesty and the like
   </p>
   <p>
    virtues.
   </p>
   <p>
    There was a certain positive originality, however slight, to be
   </p>
   <p>
    detected in him, and I occasionally observed that he was thinking for
   </p>
   <p>
    himself and expressing his own opinion, a phenomenon so rare that I
   </p>
   <p>
    would any day walk ten miles to observe it, and it amounted to the
   </p>
   <p>
    re-origination of many of the institutions of society. Though he
   </p>
   <p>
    hesitated, and perhaps failed to express himself distinctly, he always
   </p>
   <p>
    had a presentable thought behind. Yet his thinking was so primitive and
   </p>
   <p>
    immersed in his animal life, that, though more promising than a merely
   </p>
   <p>
    learned man’s, it rarely ripened to any thing which can be reported. He
   </p>
   <p>
    suggested that there might be men of genius in the lowest grades of
   </p>
   <p>
    life, however permanently humble and illiterate, who take their own
   </p>
   <p>
    view always, or do not pretend to see at all; who are as bottomless
   </p>
   <p>
    even as Walden Pond was thought to be, though they may be dark and
   </p>
   <p>
    muddy.
   </p>
   <p>
    Many a traveller came out of his way to see me and the inside of my
   </p>
   <p>
    house, and, as an excuse for calling, asked for a glass of water. I
   </p>
   <p>
    told them that I drank at the pond, and pointed thither, offering to
   </p>
   <p>
    lend them a dipper. Far off as I lived, I was not exempted from the
   </p>
   <p>
    annual visitation which occurs, methinks, about the first of April,
   </p>
   <p>
    when every body is on the move; and I had my share of good luck, though
   </p>
   <p>
    there were some curious specimens among my visitors. Half-witted men
   </p>
   <p>
    from the almshouse and elsewhere came to see me; but I endeavored to
   </p>
   <p>
    make them exercise all the wit they had, and make their confessions to
   </p>
   <p>
    me; in such cases making wit the theme of our conversation; and so was
   </p>
   <p>
    compensated. Indeed, I found some of them to be wiser than the so
   </p>
   <p>
    called _overseers_ of the poor and selectmen of the town, and thought
   </p>
   <p>
    it was time that the tables were turned. With respect to wit, I learned
   </p>
   <p>
    that there was not much difference between the half and the whole. One
   </p>
   <p>
    day, in particular, an inoffensive, simple-minded pauper, whom with
   </p>
   <p>
    others I had often seen used as fencing stuff, standing or sitting on a
   </p>
   <p>
    bushel in the fields to keep cattle and himself from straying, visited
   </p>
   <p>
    me, and expressed a wish to live as I did. He told me, with the utmost
   </p>
   <p>
    simplicity and truth, quite superior, or rather _inferior_, to any
   </p>
   <p>
    thing that is called humility, that he was “deficient in intellect.”
   </p>
   <p>
    These were his words. The Lord had made him so, yet he supposed the
   </p>
   <p>
    Lord cared as much for him as for another. “I have always been so,”
   </p>
   <p>
    said he, “from my childhood; I never had much mind; I was not like
   </p>
   <p>
    other children; I am weak in the head. It was the Lord’s will, I
   </p>
   <p>
    suppose.” And there he was to prove the truth of his words. He was a
   </p>
   <p>
    metaphysical puzzle to me. I have rarely met a fellow-man on such
   </p>
   <p>
    promising ground,—it was so simple and sincere and so true all that he
   </p>
   <p>
    said. And, true enough, in proportion as he appeared to humble himself
   </p>
   <p>
    was he exalted. I did not know at first but it was the result of a wise
   </p>
   <p>
    policy. It seemed that from such a basis of truth and frankness as the
   </p>
   <p>
    poor weak-headed pauper had laid, our intercourse might go forward to
   </p>
   <p>
    something better than the intercourse of sages.
   </p>
   <p>
    I had some guests from those not reckoned commonly among the town’s
   </p>
   <p>
    poor, but who should be; who are among the world’s poor, at any rate;
   </p>
   <p>
    guests who appeal, not to your hospitality, but to your
   </p>
   <p>
    _hospitalality_; who earnestly wish to be helped, and preface their
   </p>
   <p>
    appeal with the information that they are resolved, for one thing,
   </p>
   <p>
    never to help themselves. I require of a visitor that he be not
   </p>
   <p>
    actually starving, though he may have the very best appetite in the
   </p>
   <p>
    world, however he got it. Objects of charity are not guests. Men who
   </p>
   <p>
    did not know when their visit had terminated, though I went about my
   </p>
   <p>
    business again, answering them from greater and greater remoteness. Men
   </p>
   <p>
    of almost every degree of wit called on me in the migrating season.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some who had more wits than they knew what to do with; runaway slaves
   </p>
   <p>
    with plantation manners, who listened from time to time, like the fox
   </p>
   <p>
    in the fable, as if they heard the hounds a-baying on their track, and
   </p>
   <p>
    looked at me beseechingly, as much as to say,—
   </p>
   <p>
    “O Christian, will you send me back?”
   </p>
   <p>
    One real runaway slave, among the rest, whom I helped to forward toward
   </p>
   <p>
    the northstar. Men of one idea, like a hen with one chicken, and that a
   </p>
   <p>
    duckling; men of a thousand ideas, and unkempt heads, like those hens
   </p>
   <p>
    which are made to take charge of a hundred chickens, all in pursuit of
   </p>
   <p>
    one bug, a score of them lost in every morning’s dew,—and become
   </p>
   <p>
    frizzled and mangy in consequence; men of ideas instead of legs, a sort
   </p>
   <p>
    of intellectual centipede that made you crawl all over. One man
   </p>
   <p>
    proposed a book in which visitors should write their names, as at the
   </p>
   <p>
    White Mountains; but, alas! I have too good a memory to make that
   </p>
   <p>
    necessary.
   </p>
   <p>
    I could not but notice some of the peculiarities of my visitors. Girls
   </p>
   <p>
    and boys and young women generally seemed glad to be in the woods. They
   </p>
   <p>
    looked in the pond and at the flowers, and improved their time. Men of
   </p>
   <p>
    business, even farmers, thought only of solitude and employment, and of
   </p>
   <p>
    the great distance at which I dwelt from something or other; and though
   </p>
   <p>
    they said that they loved a ramble in the woods occasionally, it was
   </p>
   <p>
    obvious that they did not. Restless committed men, whose time was all
   </p>
   <p>
    taken up in getting a living or keeping it; ministers who spoke of God
   </p>
   <p>
    as if they enjoyed a monopoly of the subject, who could not bear all
   </p>
   <p>
    kinds of opinions; doctors, lawyers, uneasy housekeepers who pried into
   </p>
   <p>
    my cupboard and bed when I was out,—how came Mrs. —— to know that my
   </p>
   <p>
    sheets were not as clean as hers?—young men who had ceased to be young,
   </p>
   <p>
    and had concluded that it was safest to follow the beaten track of the
   </p>
   <p>
    professions,—all these generally said that it was not possible to do so
   </p>
   <p>
    much good in my position. Ay! there was the rub. The old and infirm and
   </p>
   <p>
    the timid, of whatever age or sex, thought most of sickness, and sudden
   </p>
   <p>
    accident and death; to them life seemed full of danger,—what danger is
   </p>
   <p>
    there if you don’t think of any?—and they thought that a prudent man
   </p>
   <p>
    would carefully select the safest position, where Dr. B. might be on
   </p>
   <p>
    hand at a moment’s warning. To them the village was literally a
   </p>
   <p>
    _com-munity_, a league for mutual defence, and you would suppose that
   </p>
   <p>
    they would not go a-huckleberrying without a medicine chest. The amount
   </p>
   <p>
    of it is, if a man is alive, there is always _danger_ that he may die,
   </p>
   <p>
    though the danger must be allowed to be less in proportion as he is
   </p>
   <p>
    dead-and-alive to begin with. A man sits as many risks as he runs.
   </p>
   <p>
    Finally, there were the self-styled reformers, the greatest bores of
   </p>
   <p>
    all, who thought that I was forever singing,—
   </p>
   <p>
    This is the house that I built;
   </p>
   <p>
    This is the man that lives in the house that I built;
   </p>
   <p>
    but they did not know that the third line was,—
   </p>
   <p>
    These are the folks that worry the man
   </p>
   <p>
    That lives in the house that I built.
   </p>
   <p>
    I did not fear the hen-harriers, for I kept no chickens; but I feared
   </p>
   <p>
    the men-harriers rather.
   </p>
   <p>
    I had more cheering visitors than the last. Children come a-berrying,
   </p>
   <p>
    railroad men taking a Sunday morning walk in clean shirts, fishermen
   </p>
   <p>
    and hunters, poets and philosophers; in short, all honest pilgrims, who
   </p>
   <p>
    came out to the woods for freedom’s sake, and really left the village
   </p>
   <p>
    behind, I was ready to greet with,—“Welcome, Englishmen! welcome,
   </p>
   <p>
    Englishmen!” for I had had communication with that race.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Bean-Field
   </p>
   <p>
    Meanwhile my beans, the length of whose rows, added together, was seven
   </p>
   <p>
    miles already planted, were impatient to be hoed, for the earliest had
   </p>
   <p>
    grown considerably before the latest were in the ground; indeed they
   </p>
   <p>
    were not easily to be put off. What was the meaning of this so steady
   </p>
   <p>
    and self-respecting, this small Herculean labor, I knew not. I came to
   </p>
   <p>
    love my rows, my beans, though so many more than I wanted. They
   </p>
   <p>
    attached me to the earth, and so I got strength like Antæus. But why
   </p>
   <p>
    should I raise them? Only Heaven knows. This was my curious labor all
   </p>
   <p>
    summer,—to make this portion of the earth’s surface, which had yielded
   </p>
   <p>
    only cinquefoil, blackberries, johnswort, and the like, before, sweet
   </p>
   <p>
    wild fruits and pleasant flowers, produce instead this pulse. What
   </p>
   <p>
    shall I learn of beans or beans of me? I cherish them, I hoe them,
   </p>
   <p>
    early and late I have an eye to them; and this is my day’s work. It is
   </p>
   <p>
    a fine broad leaf to look on. My auxiliaries are the dews and rains
   </p>
   <p>
    which water this dry soil, and what fertility is in the soil itself,
   </p>
   <p>
    which for the most part is lean and effete. My enemies are worms, cool
   </p>
   <p>
    days, and most of all woodchucks. The last have nibbled for me a
   </p>
   <p>
    quarter of an acre clean. But what right had I to oust johnswort and
   </p>
   <p>
    the rest, and break up their ancient herb garden? Soon, however, the
   </p>
   <p>
    remaining beans will be too tough for them, and go forward to meet new
   </p>
   <p>
    foes.
   </p>
   <p>
    When I was four years old, as I well remember, I was brought from
   </p>
   <p>
    Boston to this my native town, through these very woods and this field,
   </p>
   <p>
    to the pond. It is one of the oldest scenes stamped on my memory. And
   </p>
   <p>
    now to-night my flute has waked the echoes over that very water. The
   </p>
   <p>
    pines still stand here older than I; or, if some have fallen, I have
   </p>
   <p>
    cooked my supper with their stumps, and a new growth is rising all
   </p>
   <p>
    around, preparing another aspect for new infant eyes. Almost the same
   </p>
   <p>
    johnswort springs from the same perennial root in this pasture, and
   </p>
   <p>
    even I have at length helped to clothe that fabulous landscape of my
   </p>
   <p>
    infant dreams, and one of the results of my presence and influence is
   </p>
   <p>
    seen in these bean leaves, corn blades, and potato vines.
   </p>
   <p>
    I planted about two acres and a half of upland; and as it was only
   </p>
   <p>
    about fifteen years since the land was cleared, and I myself had got
   </p>
   <p>
    out two or three cords of stumps, I did not give it any manure; but in
   </p>
   <p>
    the course of the summer it appeared by the arrowheads which I turned
   </p>
   <p>
    up in hoeing, that an extinct nation had anciently dwelt here and
   </p>
   <p>
    planted corn and beans ere white men came to clear the land, and so, to
   </p>
   <p>
    some extent, had exhausted the soil for this very crop.
   </p>
   <p>
    Before yet any woodchuck or squirrel had run across the road, or the
   </p>
   <p>
    sun had got above the shrub oaks, while all the dew was on, though the
   </p>
   <p>
    farmers warned me against it,—I would advise you to do all your work if
   </p>
   <p>
    possible while the dew is on,—I began to level the ranks of haughty
   </p>
   <p>
    weeds in my bean-field and throw dust upon their heads. Early in the
   </p>
   <p>
    morning I worked barefooted, dabbling like a plastic artist in the dewy
   </p>
   <p>
    and crumbling sand, but later in the day the sun blistered my feet.
   </p>
   <p>
    There the sun lighted me to hoe beans, pacing slowly backward and
   </p>
   <p>
    forward over that yellow gravelly upland, between the long green rows,
   </p>
   <p>
    fifteen rods, the one end terminating in a shrub oak copse where I
   </p>
   <p>
    could rest in the shade, the other in a blackberry field where the
   </p>
   <p>
    green berries deepened their tints by the time I had made another bout.
   </p>
   <p>
    Removing the weeds, putting fresh soil about the bean stems, and
   </p>
   <p>
    encouraging this weed which I had sown, making the yellow soil express
   </p>
   <p>
    its summer thought in bean leaves and blossoms rather than in wormwood
   </p>
   <p>
    and piper and millet grass, making the earth say beans instead of
   </p>
   <p>
    grass,—this was my daily work. As I had little aid from horses or
   </p>
   <p>
    cattle, or hired men or boys, or improved implements of husbandry, I
   </p>
   <p>
    was much slower, and became much more intimate with my beans than
   </p>
   <p>
    usual. But labor of the hands, even when pursued to the verge of
   </p>
   <p>
    drudgery, is perhaps never the worst form of idleness. It has a
   </p>
   <p>
    constant and imperishable moral, and to the scholar it yields a classic
   </p>
   <p>
    result. A very _agricola laboriosus_ was I to travellers bound westward
   </p>
   <p>
    through Lincoln and Wayland to nobody knows where; they sitting at
   </p>
   <p>
    their ease in gigs, with elbows on knees, and reins loosely hanging in
   </p>
   <p>
    festoons; I the home-staying, laborious native of the soil. But soon my
   </p>
   <p>
    homestead was out of their sight and thought. It was the only open and
   </p>
   <p>
    cultivated field for a great distance on either side of the road; so
   </p>
   <p>
    they made the most of it; and sometimes the man in the field heard more
   </p>
   <p>
    of travellers’ gossip and comment than was meant for his ear: “Beans so
   </p>
   <p>
    late! peas so late!”—for I continued to plant when others had begun to
   </p>
   <p>
    hoe,—the ministerial husbandman had not suspected it. “Corn, my boy,
   </p>
   <p>
    for fodder; corn for fodder.” “Does he _live_ there?” asks the black
   </p>
   <p>
    bonnet of the gray coat; and the hard-featured farmer reins up his
   </p>
   <p>
    grateful dobbin to inquire what you are doing where he sees no manure
   </p>
   <p>
    in the furrow, and recommends a little chip dirt, or any little waste
   </p>
   <p>
    stuff, or it may be ashes or plaster. But here were two acres and a
   </p>
   <p>
    half of furrows, and only a hoe for cart and two hands to draw
   </p>
   <p>
    it,—there being an aversion to other carts and horses,—and chip dirt
   </p>
   <p>
    far away. Fellow-travellers as they rattled by compared it aloud with
   </p>
   <p>
    the fields which they had passed, so that I came to know how I stood in
   </p>
   <p>
    the agricultural world. This was one field not in Mr. Coleman’s report.
   </p>
   <p>
    And, by the way, who estimates the value of the crop which nature
   </p>
   <p>
    yields in the still wilder fields unimproved by man? The crop of
   </p>
   <p>
    _English_ hay is carefully weighed, the moisture calculated, the
   </p>
   <p>
    silicates and the potash; but in all dells and pond holes in the woods
   </p>
   <p>
    and pastures and swamps grows a rich and various crop only unreaped by
   </p>
   <p>
    man. Mine was, as it were, the connecting link between wild and
   </p>
   <p>
    cultivated fields; as some states are civilized, and others
   </p>
   <p>
    half-civilized, and others savage or barbarous, so my field was, though
   </p>
   <p>
    not in a bad sense, a half-cultivated field. They were beans cheerfully
   </p>
   <p>
    returning to their wild and primitive state that I cultivated, and my
   </p>
   <p>
    hoe played the _Ranz des Vaches_ for them.
   </p>
   <p>
    Near at hand, upon the topmost spray of a birch, sings the
   </p>
   <p>
    brown-thrasher—or red mavis, as some love to call him—all the morning,
   </p>
   <p>
    glad of your society, that would find out another farmer’s field if
   </p>
   <p>
    yours were not here. While you are planting the seed, he cries,—“Drop
   </p>
   <p>
    it, drop it,—cover it up, cover it up,—pull it up, pull it up, pull it
   </p>
   <p>
    up.” But this was not corn, and so it was safe from such enemies as he.
   </p>
   <p>
    You may wonder what his rigmarole, his amateur Paganini performances on
   </p>
   <p>
    one string or on twenty, have to do with your planting, and yet prefer
   </p>
   <p>
    it to leached ashes or plaster. It was a cheap sort of top dressing in
   </p>
   <p>
    which I had entire faith.
   </p>
   <p>
    As I drew a still fresher soil about the rows with my hoe, I disturbed
   </p>
   <p>
    the ashes of unchronicled nations who in primeval years lived under
   </p>
   <p>
    these heavens, and their small implements of war and hunting were
   </p>
   <p>
    brought to the light of this modern day. They lay mingled with other
   </p>
   <p>
    natural stones, some of which bore the marks of having been burned by
   </p>
   <p>
    Indian fires, and some by the sun, and also bits of pottery and glass
   </p>
   <p>
    brought hither by the recent cultivators of the soil. When my hoe
   </p>
   <p>
    tinkled against the stones, that music echoed to the woods and the sky,
   </p>
   <p>
    and was an accompaniment to my labor which yielded an instant and
   </p>
   <p>
    immeasurable crop. It was no longer beans that I hoed, nor I that hoed
   </p>
   <p>
    beans; and I remembered with as much pity as pride, if I remembered at
   </p>
   <p>
    all, my acquaintances who had gone to the city to attend the oratorios.
   </p>
   <p>
    The night-hawk circled overhead in the sunny afternoons—for I sometimes
   </p>
   <p>
    made a day of it—like a mote in the eye, or in heaven’s eye, falling
   </p>
   <p>
    from time to time with a swoop and a sound as if the heavens were rent,
   </p>
   <p>
    torn at last to very rags and tatters, and yet a seamless cope
   </p>
   <p>
    remained; small imps that fill the air and lay their eggs on the ground
   </p>
   <p>
    on bare sand or rocks on the tops of hills, where few have found them;
   </p>
   <p>
    graceful and slender like ripples caught up from the pond, as leaves
   </p>
   <p>
    are raised by the wind to float in the heavens; such kindredship is in
   </p>
   <p>
    Nature. The hawk is aerial brother of the wave which he sails over and
   </p>
   <p>
    surveys, those his perfect air-inflated wings answering to the
   </p>
   <p>
    elemental unfledged pinions of the sea. Or sometimes I watched a pair
   </p>
   <p>
    of hen-hawks circling high in the sky, alternately soaring and
   </p>
   <p>
    descending, approaching, and leaving one another, as if they were the
   </p>
   <p>
    embodiment of my own thoughts. Or I was attracted by the passage of
   </p>
   <p>
    wild pigeons from this wood to that, with a slight quivering winnowing
   </p>
   <p>
    sound and carrier haste; or from under a rotten stump my hoe turned up
   </p>
   <p>
    a sluggish portentous and outlandish spotted salamander, a trace of
   </p>
   <p>
    Egypt and the Nile, yet our contemporary. When I paused to lean on my
   </p>
   <p>
    hoe, these sounds and sights I heard and saw anywhere in the row, a
   </p>
   <p>
    part of the inexhaustible entertainment which the country offers.
   </p>
   <p>
    On gala days the town fires its great guns, which echo like popguns to
   </p>
   <p>
    these woods, and some waifs of martial music occasionally penetrate
   </p>
   <p>
    thus far. To me, away there in my bean-field at the other end of the
   </p>
   <p>
    town, the big guns sounded as if a puffball had burst; and when there
   </p>
   <p>
    was a military turnout of which I was ignorant, I have sometimes had a
   </p>
   <p>
    vague sense all the day of some sort of itching and disease in the
   </p>
   <p>
    horizon, as if some eruption would break out there soon, either
   </p>
   <p>
    scarlatina or canker-rash, until at length some more favorable puff of
   </p>
   <p>
    wind, making haste over the fields and up the Wayland road, brought me
   </p>
   <p>
    information of the “trainers.” It seemed by the distant hum as if
   </p>
   <p>
    somebody’s bees had swarmed, and that the neighbors, according to
   </p>
   <p>
    Virgil’s advice, by a faint _tintinnabulum_ upon the most sonorous of
   </p>
   <p>
    their domestic utensils, were endeavoring to call them down into the
   </p>
   <p>
    hive again. And when the sound died quite away, and the hum had ceased,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the most favorable breezes told no tale, I knew that they had got
   </p>
   <p>
    the last drone of them all safely into the Middlesex hive, and that now
   </p>
   <p>
    their minds were bent on the honey with which it was smeared.
   </p>
   <p>
    I felt proud to know that the liberties of Massachusetts and of our
   </p>
   <p>
    fatherland were in such safe keeping; and as I turned to my hoeing
   </p>
   <p>
    again I was filled with an inexpressible confidence, and pursued my
   </p>
   <p>
    labor cheerfully with a calm trust in the future.
   </p>
   <p>
    When there were several bands of musicians, it sounded as if all the
   </p>
   <p>
    village was a vast bellows, and all the buildings expanded and
   </p>
   <p>
    collapsed alternately with a din. But sometimes it was a really noble
   </p>
   <p>
    and inspiring strain that reached these woods, and the trumpet that
   </p>
   <p>
    sings of fame, and I felt as if I could spit a Mexican with a good
   </p>
   <p>
    relish,—for why should we always stand for trifles?—and looked round
   </p>
   <p>
    for a woodchuck or a skunk to exercise my chivalry upon. These martial
   </p>
   <p>
    strains seemed as far away as Palestine, and reminded me of a march of
   </p>
   <p>
    crusaders in the horizon, with a slight tantivy and tremulous motion of
   </p>
   <p>
    the elm-tree tops which overhang the village. This was one of the
   </p>
   <p>
    _great_ days; though the sky had from my clearing only the same
   </p>
   <p>
    everlastingly great look that it wears daily, and I saw no difference
   </p>
   <p>
    in it.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was a singular experience that long acquaintance which I cultivated
   </p>
   <p>
    with beans, what with planting, and hoeing, and harvesting, and
   </p>
   <p>
    threshing, and picking over and selling them,—the last was the hardest
   </p>
   <p>
    of all,—I might add eating, for I did taste. I was determined to know
   </p>
   <p>
    beans. When they were growing, I used to hoe from five o’clock in the
   </p>
   <p>
    morning till noon, and commonly spent the rest of the day about other
   </p>
   <p>
    affairs. Consider the intimate and curious acquaintance one makes with
   </p>
   <p>
    various kinds of weeds,—it will bear some iteration in the account, for
   </p>
   <p>
    there was no little iteration in the labor,—disturbing their delicate
   </p>
   <p>
    organizations so ruthlessly, and making such invidious distinctions
   </p>
   <p>
    with his hoe, levelling whole ranks of one species, and sedulously
   </p>
   <p>
    cultivating another. That’s Roman wormwood,—that’s pigweed,—that’s
   </p>
   <p>
    sorrel,—that’s piper-grass,—have at him, chop him up, turn his roots
   </p>
   <p>
    upward to the sun, don’t let him have a fibre in the shade, if you do
   </p>
   <p>
    he’ll turn himself t’other side up and be as green as a leek in two
   </p>
   <p>
    days. A long war, not with cranes, but with weeds, those Trojans who
   </p>
   <p>
    had sun and rain and dews on their side. Daily the beans saw me come to
   </p>
   <p>
    their rescue armed with a hoe, and thin the ranks of their enemies,
   </p>
   <p>
    filling up the trenches with weedy dead. Many a lusty crest-waving
   </p>
   <p>
    Hector, that towered a whole foot above his crowding comrades, fell
   </p>
   <p>
    before my weapon and rolled in the dust.
   </p>
   <p>
    Those summer days which some of my contemporaries devoted to the fine
   </p>
   <p>
    arts in Boston or Rome, and others to contemplation in India, and
   </p>
   <p>
    others to trade in London or New York, I thus, with the other farmers
   </p>
   <p>
    of New England, devoted to husbandry. Not that I wanted beans to eat,
   </p>
   <p>
    for I am by nature a Pythagorean, so far as beans are concerned,
   </p>
   <p>
    whether they mean porridge or voting, and exchanged them for rice; but,
   </p>
   <p>
    perchance, as some must work in fields if only for the sake of tropes
   </p>
   <p>
    and expression, to serve a parable-maker one day. It was on the whole a
   </p>
   <p>
    rare amusement, which, continued too long, might have become a
   </p>
   <p>
    dissipation. Though I gave them no manure, and did not hoe them all
   </p>
   <p>
    once, I hoed them unusually well as far as I went, and was paid for it
   </p>
   <p>
    in the end, “there being in truth,” as Evelyn says, “no compost or
   </p>
   <p>
    lætation whatsoever comparable to this continual motion, repastination,
   </p>
   <p>
    and turning of the mould with the spade.” “The earth,” he adds
   </p>
   <p>
    elsewhere, “especially if fresh, has a certain magnetism in it, by
   </p>
   <p>
    which it attracts the salt, power, or virtue (call it either) which
   </p>
   <p>
    gives it life, and is the logic of all the labor and stir we keep about
   </p>
   <p>
    it, to sustain us; all dungings and other sordid temperings being but
   </p>
   <p>
    the vicars succedaneous to this improvement.” Moreover, this being one
   </p>
   <p>
    of those “worn-out and exhausted lay fields which enjoy their sabbath,”
   </p>
   <p>
    had perchance, as Sir Kenelm Digby thinks likely, attracted “vital
   </p>
   <p>
    spirits” from the air. I harvested twelve bushels of beans.
   </p>
   <p>
    But to be more particular, for it is complained that Mr. Coleman has
   </p>
   <p>
    reported chiefly the expensive experiments of gentlemen farmers, my
   </p>
   <p>
    outgoes were,—

   <p>
    Leaving a pecuniary profit,
   </p>
   <p>
    as I have elsewhere said, of..............  $8.71½.
   </p>
   <p>
    This is the result of my experience in raising beans. Plant the common
   </p>
   <p>
    small white bush bean about the first of June, in rows three feet by
   </p>
   <p>
    eighteen inches apart, being careful to select fresh round and unmixed
   </p>
   <p>
    seed. First look out for worms, and supply vacancies by planting anew.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then look out for woodchucks, if it is an exposed place, for they will
   </p>
   <p>
    nibble off the earliest tender leaves almost clean as they go; and
   </p>
   <p>
    again, when the young tendrils make their appearance, they have notice
   </p>
   <p>
    of it, and will shear them off with both buds and young pods, sitting
   </p>
   <p>
    erect like a squirrel. But above all harvest as early as possible, if
   </p>
   <p>
    you would escape frosts and have a fair and salable crop; you may save
   </p>
   <p>
    much loss by this means.
   </p>
   <p>
    This further experience also I gained. I said to myself, I will not
   </p>
   <p>
    plant beans and corn with so much industry another summer, but such
   </p>
   <p>
    seeds, if the seed is not lost, as sincerity, truth, simplicity, faith,
   </p>
   <p>
    innocence, and the like, and see if they will not grow in this soil,
   </p>
   <p>
    even with less toil and manurance, and sustain me, for surely it has
   </p>
   <p>
    not been exhausted for these crops. Alas! I said this to myself; but
   </p>
   <p>
    now another summer is gone, and another, and another, and I am obliged
   </p>
   <p>
    to say to you, Reader, that the seeds which I planted, if indeed they
   </p>
   <p>
    _were_ the seeds of those virtues, were wormeaten or had lost their
   </p>
   <p>
    vitality, and so did not come up. Commonly men will only be brave as
   </p>
   <p>
    their fathers were brave, or timid. This generation is very sure to
   </p>
   <p>
    plant corn and beans each new year precisely as the Indians did
   </p>
   <p>
    centuries ago and taught the first settlers to do, as if there were a
   </p>
   <p>
    fate in it. I saw an old man the other day, to my astonishment, making
   </p>
   <p>
    the holes with a hoe for the seventieth time at least, and not for
   </p>
   <p>
    himself to lie down in! But why should not the New Englander try new
   </p>
   <p>
    adventures, and not lay so much stress on his grain, his potato and
   </p>
   <p>
    grass crop, and his orchards,—raise other crops than these? Why concern
   </p>
   <p>
    ourselves so much about our beans for seed, and not be concerned at all
   </p>
   <p>
    about a new generation of men? We should really be fed and cheered if
   </p>
   <p>
    when we met a man we were sure to see that some of the qualities which
   </p>
   <p>
    I have named, which we all prize more than those other productions, but
   </p>
   <p>
    which are for the most part broadcast and floating in the air, had
   </p>
   <p>
    taken root and grown in him. Here comes such a subtile and ineffable
   </p>
   <p>
    quality, for instance, as truth or justice, though the slightest amount
   </p>
   <p>
    or new variety of it, along the road. Our ambassadors should be
   </p>
   <p>
    instructed to send home such seeds as these, and Congress help to
   </p>
   <p>
    distribute them over all the land. We should never stand upon ceremony
   </p>
   <p>
    with sincerity. We should never cheat and insult and banish one another
   </p>
   <p>
    by our meanness, if there were present the kernel of worth and
   </p>
   <p>
    friendliness. We should not meet thus in haste. Most men I do not meet
   </p>
   <p>
    at all, for they seem not to have time; they are busy about their
   </p>
   <p>
    beans. We would not deal with a man thus plodding ever, leaning on a
   </p>
   <p>
    hoe or a spade as a staff between his work, not as a mushroom, but
   </p>
   <p>
    partially risen out of the earth, something more than erect, like
   </p>
   <p>
    swallows alighted and walking on the ground:—
   </p>
   <p>
    “And as he spake, his wings would now and then
   </p>
   <p>
    Spread, as he meant to fly, then close again,”
   </p>
   <p>
    so that we should suspect that we might be conversing with an angel.
   </p>
   <p>
    Bread may not always nourish us; but it always does us good, it even
   </p>
   <p>
    takes stiffness out of our joints, and makes us supple and buoyant,
   </p>
   <p>
    when we knew not what ailed us, to recognize any generosity in man or
   </p>
   <p>
    Nature, to share any unmixed and heroic joy.
   </p>
   <p>
    Ancient poetry and mythology suggest, at least, that husbandry was once
   </p>
   <p>
    a sacred art; but it is pursued with irreverent haste and heedlessness
   </p>
   <p>
    by us, our object being to have large farms and large crops merely. We
   </p>
   <p>
    have no festival, nor procession, nor ceremony, not excepting our
   </p>
   <p>
    Cattle-shows and so called Thanksgivings, by which the farmer expresses
   </p>
   <p>
    a sense of the sacredness of his calling, or is reminded of its sacred
   </p>
   <p>
    origin. It is the premium and the feast which tempt him. He sacrifices
   </p>
   <p>
    not to Ceres and the Terrestrial Jove, but to the infernal Plutus
   </p>
   <p>
    rather. By avarice and selfishness, and a grovelling habit, from which
   </p>
   <p>
    none of us is free, of regarding the soil as property, or the means of
   </p>
   <p>
    acquiring property chiefly, the landscape is deformed, husbandry is
   </p>
   <p>
    degraded with us, and the farmer leads the meanest of lives. He knows
   </p>
   <p>
    Nature but as a robber. Cato says that the profits of agriculture are
   </p>
   <p>
    particularly pious or just, (_maximeque pius quæstus_), and according
   </p>
   <p>
    to Varro the old Romans “called the same earth Mother and Ceres, and
   </p>
   <p>
    thought that they who cultivated it led a pious and useful life, and
   </p>
   <p>
    that they alone were left of the race of King Saturn.”
   </p>
   <p>
    We are wont to forget that the sun looks on our cultivated fields and
   </p>
   <p>
    on the prairies and forests without distinction. They all reflect and
   </p>
   <p>
    absorb his rays alike, and the former make but a small part of the
   </p>
   <p>
    glorious picture which he beholds in his daily course. In his view the
   </p>
   <p>
    earth is all equally cultivated like a garden. Therefore we should
   </p>
   <p>
    receive the benefit of his light and heat with a corresponding trust
   </p>
   <p>
    and magnanimity. What though I value the seed of these beans, and
   </p>
   <p>
    harvest that in the fall of the year? This broad field which I have
   </p>
   <p>
    looked at so long looks not to me as the principal cultivator, but away
   </p>
   <p>
    from me to influences more genial to it, which water and make it green.
   </p>
   <p>
    These beans have results which are not harvested by me. Do they not
   </p>
   <p>
    grow for woodchucks partly? The ear of wheat (in Latin _spica_,
   </p>
   <p>
    obsoletely _speca_, from _spe_, hope) should not be the only hope of
   </p>
   <p>
    the husbandman; its kernel or grain (_granum_ from _gerendo_, bearing)
   </p>
   <p>
    is not all that it bears. How, then, can our harvest fail? Shall I not
   </p>
   <p>
    rejoice also at the abundance of the weeds whose seeds are the granary
   </p>
   <p>
    of the birds? It matters little comparatively whether the fields fill
   </p>
   <p>
    the farmer’s barns. The true husbandman will cease from anxiety, as the
   </p>
   <p>
    squirrels manifest no concern whether the woods will bear chestnuts
   </p>
   <p>
    this year or not, and finish his labor with every day, relinquishing
   </p>
   <p>
    all claim to the produce of his fields, and sacrificing in his mind not
   </p>
   <p>
    only his first but his last fruits also.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Village
   </p>
   <p>
    After hoeing, or perhaps reading and writing, in the forenoon, I
   </p>
   <p>
    usually bathed again in the pond, swimming across one of its coves for
   </p>
   <p>
    a stint, and washed the dust of labor from my person, or smoothed out
   </p>
   <p>
    the last wrinkle which study had made, and for the afternoon was
   </p>
   <p>
    absolutely free. Every day or two I strolled to the village to hear
   </p>
   <p>
    some of the gossip which is incessantly going on there, circulating
   </p>
   <p>
    either from mouth to mouth, or from newspaper to newspaper, and which,
   </p>
   <p>
    taken in homœopathic doses, was really as refreshing in its way as the
   </p>
   <p>
    rustle of leaves and the peeping of frogs. As I walked in the woods to
   </p>
   <p>
    see the birds and squirrels, so I walked in the village to see the men
   </p>
   <p>
    and boys; instead of the wind among the pines I heard the carts rattle.
   </p>
   <p>
    In one direction from my house there was a colony of muskrats in the
   </p>
   <p>
    river meadows; under the grove of elms and buttonwoods in the other
   </p>
   <p>
    horizon was a village of busy men, as curious to me as if they had been
   </p>
   <p>
    prairie dogs, each sitting at the mouth of its burrow, or running over
   </p>
   <p>
    to a neighbor’s to gossip. I went there frequently to observe their
   </p>
   <p>
    habits. The village appeared to me a great news room; and on one side,
   </p>
   <p>
    to support it, as once at Redding &amp; Company’s on State Street, they
   </p>
   <p>
    kept nuts and raisins, or salt and meal and other groceries. Some have
   </p>
   <p>
    such a vast appetite for the former commodity, that is, the news, and
   </p>
   <p>
    such sound digestive organs, that they can sit forever in public
   </p>
   <p>
    avenues without stirring, and let it simmer and whisper through them
   </p>
   <p>
    like the Etesian winds, or as if inhaling ether, it only producing
   </p>
   <p>
    numbness and insensibility to pain,—otherwise it would often be painful
   </p>
   <p>
    to hear,—without affecting the consciousness. I hardly ever failed,
   </p>
   <p>
    when I rambled through the village, to see a row of such worthies,
   </p>
   <p>
    either sitting on a ladder sunning themselves, with their bodies
   </p>
   <p>
    inclined forward and their eyes glancing along the line this way and
   </p>
   <p>
    that, from time to time, with a voluptuous expression, or else leaning
   </p>
   <p>
    against a barn with their hands in their pockets, like caryatides, as
   </p>
   <p>
    if to prop it up. They, being commonly out of doors, heard whatever was
   </p>
   <p>
    in the wind. These are the coarsest mills, in which all gossip is first
   </p>
   <p>
    rudely digested or cracked up before it is emptied into finer and more
   </p>
   <p>
    delicate hoppers within doors. I observed that the vitals of the
   </p>
   <p>
    village were the grocery, the bar-room, the post-office, and the bank;
   </p>
   <p>
    and, as a necessary part of the machinery, they kept a bell, a big gun,
   </p>
   <p>
    and a fire-engine, at convenient places; and the houses were so
   </p>
   <p>
    arranged as to make the most of mankind, in lanes and fronting one
   </p>
   <p>
    another, so that every traveller had to run the gantlet, and every man,
   </p>
   <p>
    woman, and child might get a lick at him. Of course, those who were
   </p>
   <p>
    stationed nearest to the head of the line, where they could most see
   </p>
   <p>
    and be seen, and have the first blow at him, paid the highest prices
   </p>
   <p>
    for their places; and the few straggling inhabitants in the outskirts,
   </p>
   <p>
    where long gaps in the line began to occur, and the traveller could get
   </p>
   <p>
    over walls or turn aside into cow paths, and so escape, paid a very
   </p>
   <p>
    slight ground or window tax. Signs were hung out on all sides to allure
   </p>
   <p>
    him; some to catch him by the appetite, as the tavern and victualling
   </p>
   <p>
    cellar; some by the fancy, as the dry goods store and the jeweller’s;
   </p>
   <p>
    and others by the hair or the feet or the skirts, as the barber, the
   </p>
   <p>
    shoemaker, or the tailor. Besides, there was a still more terrible
   </p>
   <p>
    standing invitation to call at every one of these houses, and company
   </p>
   <p>
    expected about these times. For the most part I escaped wonderfully
   </p>
   <p>
    from these dangers, either by proceeding at once boldly and without
   </p>
   <p>
    deliberation to the goal, as is recommended to those who run the
   </p>
   <p>
    gantlet, or by keeping my thoughts on high things, like Orpheus, who,
   </p>
   <p>
    “loudly singing the praises of the gods to his lyre, drowned the voices
   </p>
   <p>
    of the Sirens, and kept out of danger.” Sometimes I bolted suddenly,
   </p>
   <p>
    and nobody could tell my whereabouts, for I did not stand much about
   </p>
   <p>
    gracefulness, and never hesitated at a gap in a fence. I was even
   </p>
   <p>
    accustomed to make an irruption into some houses, where I was well
   </p>
   <p>
    entertained, and after learning the kernels and very last sieve-ful of
   </p>
   <p>
    news, what had subsided, the prospects of war and peace, and whether
   </p>
   <p>
    the world was likely to hold together much longer, I was let out
   </p>
   <p>
    through the rear avenues, and so escaped to the woods again.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was very pleasant, when I stayed late in town, to launch myself into
   </p>
   <p>
    the night, especially if it was dark and tempestuous, and set sail from
   </p>
   <p>
    some bright village parlor or lecture room, with a bag of rye or Indian
   </p>
   <p>
    meal upon my shoulder, for my snug harbor in the woods, having made all
   </p>
   <p>
    tight without and withdrawn under hatches with a merry crew of
   </p>
   <p>
    thoughts, leaving only my outer man at the helm, or even tying up the
   </p>
   <p>
    helm when it was plain sailing. I had many a genial thought by the
   </p>
   <p>
    cabin fire “as I sailed.” I was never cast away nor distressed in any
   </p>
   <p>
    weather, though I encountered some severe storms. It is darker in the
   </p>
   <p>
    woods, even in common nights, than most suppose. I frequently had to
   </p>
   <p>
    look up at the opening between the trees above the path in order to
   </p>
   <p>
    learn my route, and, where there was no cart-path, to feel with my feet
   </p>
   <p>
    the faint track which I had worn, or steer by the known relation of
   </p>
   <p>
    particular trees which I felt with my hands, passing between two pines
   </p>
   <p>
    for instance, not more than eighteen inches apart, in the midst of the
   </p>
   <p>
    woods, invariably, in the darkest night. Sometimes, after coming home
   </p>
   <p>
    thus late in a dark and muggy night, when my feet felt the path which
   </p>
   <p>
    my eyes could not see, dreaming and absent-minded all the way, until I
   </p>
   <p>
    was aroused by having to raise my hand to lift the latch, I have not
   </p>
   <p>
    been able to recall a single step of my walk, and I have thought that
   </p>
   <p>
    perhaps my body would find its way home if its master should forsake
   </p>
   <p>
    it, as the hand finds its way to the mouth without assistance. Several
   </p>
   <p>
    times, when a visitor chanced to stay into evening, and it proved a
   </p>
   <p>
    dark night, I was obliged to conduct him to the cart-path in the rear
   </p>
   <p>
    of the house, and then point out to him the direction he was to pursue,
   </p>
   <p>
    and in keeping which he was to be guided rather by his feet than his
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes. One very dark night I directed thus on their way two young men
   </p>
   <p>
    who had been fishing in the pond. They lived about a mile off through
   </p>
   <p>
    the woods, and were quite used to the route. A day or two after one of
   </p>
   <p>
    them told me that they wandered about the greater part of the night,
   </p>
   <p>
    close by their own premises, and did not get home till toward morning,
   </p>
   <p>
    by which time, as there had been several heavy showers in the mean
   </p>
   <p>
    while, and the leaves were very wet, they were drenched to their skins.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have heard of many going astray even in the village streets, when the
   </p>
   <p>
    darkness was so thick that you could cut it with a knife, as the saying
   </p>
   <p>
    is. Some who live in the outskirts, having come to town a-shopping in
   </p>
   <p>
    their wagons, have been obliged to put up for the night; and gentlemen
   </p>
   <p>
    and ladies making a call have gone half a mile out of their way,
   </p>
   <p>
    feeling the sidewalk only with their feet, and not knowing when they
   </p>
   <p>
    turned. It is a surprising and memorable, as well as valuable
   </p>
   <p>
    experience, to be lost in the woods any time. Often in a snow storm,
   </p>
   <p>
    even by day, one will come out upon a well-known road and yet find it
   </p>
   <p>
    impossible to tell which way leads to the village. Though he knows that
   </p>
   <p>
    he has travelled it a thousand times, he cannot recognize a feature in
   </p>
   <p>
    it, but it is as strange to him as if it were a road in Siberia. By
   </p>
   <p>
    night, of course, the perplexity is infinitely greater. In our most
   </p>
   <p>
    trivial walks, we are constantly, though unconsciously, steering like
   </p>
   <p>
    pilots by certain well-known beacons and headlands, and if we go beyond
   </p>
   <p>
    our usual course we still carry in our minds the bearing of some
   </p>
   <p>
    neighboring cape; and not till we are completely lost, or turned
   </p>
   <p>
    round,—for a man needs only to be turned round once with his eyes shut
   </p>
   <p>
    in this world to be lost,—do we appreciate the vastness and strangeness
   </p>
   <p>
    of Nature. Every man has to learn the points of compass again as often
   </p>
   <p>
    as he awakes, whether from sleep or any abstraction. Not till we are
   </p>
   <p>
    lost, in other words not till we have lost the world, do we begin to
   </p>
   <p>
    find ourselves, and realize where we are and the infinite extent of our
   </p>
   <p>
    relations.
   </p>
   <p>
    One afternoon, near the end of the first summer, when I went to the
   </p>
   <p>
    village to get a shoe from the cobbler’s, I was seized and put into
   </p>
   <p>
    jail, because, as I have elsewhere related, I did not pay a tax to, or
   </p>
   <p>
    recognize the authority of, the state which buys and sells men, women,
   </p>
   <p>
    and children, like cattle at the door of its senate-house. I had gone
   </p>
   <p>
    down to the woods for other purposes. But, wherever a man goes, men
   </p>
   <p>
    will pursue and paw him with their dirty institutions, and, if they
   </p>
   <p>
    can, constrain him to belong to their desperate odd-fellow society. It
   </p>
   <p>
    is true, I might have resisted forcibly with more or less effect, might
   </p>
   <p>
    have run “amok” against society; but I preferred that society should
   </p>
   <p>
    run “amok” against me, it being the desperate party. However, I was
   </p>
   <p>
    released the next day, obtained my mended shoe, and returned to the
   </p>
   <p>
    woods in season to get my dinner of huckleberries on Fair-Haven Hill. I
   </p>
   <p>
    was never molested by any person but those who represented the state. I
   </p>
   <p>
    had no lock nor bolt but for the desk which held my papers, not even a
   </p>
   <p>
    nail to put over my latch or windows. I never fastened my door night or
   </p>
   <p>
    day, though I was to be absent several days; not even when the next
   </p>
   <p>
    fall I spent a fortnight in the woods of Maine. And yet my house was
   </p>
   <p>
    more respected than if it had been surrounded by a file of soldiers.
   </p>
   <p>
    The tired rambler could rest and warm himself by my fire, the literary
   </p>
   <p>
    amuse himself with the few books on my table, or the curious, by
   </p>
   <p>
    opening my closet door, see what was left of my dinner, and what
   </p>
   <p>
    prospect I had of a supper. Yet, though many people of every class came
   </p>
   <p>
    this way to the pond, I suffered no serious inconvenience from these
   </p>
   <p>
    sources, and I never missed anything but one small book, a volume of
   </p>
   <p>
    Homer, which perhaps was improperly gilded, and this I trust a soldier
   </p>
   <p>
    of our camp has found by this time. I am convinced, that if all men
   </p>
   <p>
    were to live as simply as I then did, thieving and robbery would be
   </p>
   <p>
    unknown. These take place only in communities where some have got more
   </p>
   <p>
    than is sufficient while others have not enough. The Pope’s Homers
   </p>
   <p>
    would soon get properly distributed.—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Nec bella fuerunt,
   </p>
   <p>
    Faginus astabat dum scyphus ante dapes.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Nor wars did men molest,
   </p>
   <p>
    When only beechen bowls were in request.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You who govern public affairs, what need have you to employ
   </p>
   <p>
    punishments? Love virtue, and the people will be virtuous. The virtues
   </p>
   <p>
    of a superior man are like the wind; the virtues of a common man are
   </p>
   <p>
    like the grass; the grass, when the wind passes over it, bends.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The Ponds
   </p>
   <p>
    Sometimes, having had a surfeit of human society and gossip, and worn
   </p>
   <p>
    out all my village friends, I rambled still farther westward than I
   </p>
   <p>
    habitually dwell, into yet more unfrequented parts of the town, “to
   </p>
   <p>
    fresh woods and pastures new,” or, while the sun was setting, made my
   </p>
   <p>
    supper of huckleberries and blueberries on Fair Haven Hill, and laid up
   </p>
   <p>
    a store for several days. The fruits do not yield their true flavor to
   </p>
   <p>
    the purchaser of them, nor to him who raises them for the market. There
   </p>
   <p>
    is but one way to obtain it, yet few take that way. If you would know
   </p>
   <p>
    the flavor of huckleberries, ask the cow-boy or the partridge. It is a
   </p>
   <p>
    vulgar error to suppose that you have tasted huckleberries who never
   </p>
   <p>
    plucked them. A huckleberry never reaches Boston; they have not been
   </p>
   <p>
    known there since they grew on her three hills. The ambrosial and
   </p>
   <p>
    essential part of the fruit is lost with the bloom which is rubbed off
   </p>
   <p>
    in the market cart, and they become mere provender. As long as Eternal
   </p>
   <p>
    Justice reigns, not one innocent huckleberry can be transported thither
   </p>
   <p>
    from the country’s hills.
   </p>
   <p>
    Occasionally, after my hoeing was done for the day, I joined some
   </p>
   <p>
    impatient companion who had been fishing on the pond since morning, as
   </p>
   <p>
    silent and motionless as a duck or a floating leaf, and, after
   </p>
   <p>
    practising various kinds of philosophy, had concluded commonly, by the
   </p>
   <p>
    time I arrived, that he belonged to the ancient sect of Cœnobites.
   </p>
   <p>
    There was one older man, an excellent fisher and skilled in all kinds
   </p>
   <p>
    of woodcraft, who was pleased to look upon my house as a building
   </p>
   <p>
    erected for the convenience of fishermen; and I was equally pleased
   </p>
   <p>
    when he sat in my doorway to arrange his lines. Once in a while we sat
   </p>
   <p>
    together on the pond, he at one end of the boat, and I at the other;
   </p>
   <p>
    but not many words passed between us, for he had grown deaf in his
   </p>
   <p>
    later years, but he occasionally hummed a psalm, which harmonized well
   </p>
   <p>
    enough with my philosophy. Our intercourse was thus altogether one of
   </p>
   <p>
    unbroken harmony, far more pleasing to remember than if it had been
   </p>
   <p>
    carried on by speech. When, as was commonly the case, I had none to
   </p>
   <p>
    commune with, I used to raise the echoes by striking with a paddle on
   </p>
   <p>
    the side of my boat, filling the surrounding woods with circling and
   </p>
   <p>
    dilating sound, stirring them up as the keeper of a menagerie his wild
   </p>
   <p>
    beasts, until I elicited a growl from every wooded vale and hill-side.
   </p>
   <p>
    In warm evenings I frequently sat in the boat playing the flute, and
   </p>
   <p>
    saw the perch, which I seemed to have charmed, hovering around me, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the moon travelling over the ribbed bottom, which was strewed with the
   </p>
   <p>
    wrecks of the forest. Formerly I had come to this pond adventurously,
   </p>
   <p>
    from time to time, in dark summer nights, with a companion, and making
   </p>
   <p>
    a fire close to the water’s edge, which we thought attracted the
   </p>
   <p>
    fishes, we caught pouts with a bunch of worms strung on a thread; and
   </p>
   <p>
    when we had done, far in the night, threw the burning brands high into
   </p>
   <p>
    the air like skyrockets, which, coming down into the pond, were
   </p>
   <p>
    quenched with a loud hissing, and we were suddenly groping in total
   </p>
   <p>
    darkness. Through this, whistling a tune, we took our way to the haunts
   </p>
   <p>
    of men again. But now I had made my home by the shore.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sometimes, after staying in a village parlor till the family had all
   </p>
   <p>
    retired, I have returned to the woods, and, partly with a view to the
   </p>
   <p>
    next day’s dinner, spent the hours of midnight fishing from a boat by
   </p>
   <p>
    moonlight, serenaded by owls and foxes, and hearing, from time to time,
   </p>
   <p>
    the creaking note of some unknown bird close at hand. These experiences
   </p>
   <p>
    were very memorable and valuable to me,—anchored in forty feet of
   </p>
   <p>
    water, and twenty or thirty rods from the shore, surrounded sometimes
   </p>
   <p>
    by thousands of small perch and shiners, dimpling the surface with
   </p>
   <p>
    their tails in the moonlight, and communicating by a long flaxen line
   </p>
   <p>
    with mysterious nocturnal fishes which had their dwelling forty feet
   </p>
   <p>
    below, or sometimes dragging sixty feet of line about the pond as I
   </p>
   <p>
    drifted in the gentle night breeze, now and then feeling a slight
   </p>
   <p>
    vibration along it, indicative of some life prowling about its
   </p>
   <p>
    extremity, of dull uncertain blundering purpose there, and slow to make
   </p>
   <p>
    up its mind. At length you slowly raise, pulling hand over hand, some
   </p>
   <p>
    horned pout squeaking and squirming to the upper air. It was very
   </p>
   <p>
    queer, especially in dark nights, when your thoughts had wandered to
   </p>
   <p>
    vast and cosmogonal themes in other spheres, to feel this faint jerk,
   </p>
   <p>
    which came to interrupt your dreams and link you to Nature again. It
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed as if I might next cast my line upward into the air, as well as
   </p>
   <p>
    downward into this element, which was scarcely more dense. Thus I
   </p>
   <p>
    caught two fishes as it were with one hook.
   </p>
   <p>
    The scenery of Walden is on a humble scale, and, though very beautiful,
   </p>
   <p>
    does not approach to grandeur, nor can it much concern one who has not
   </p>
   <p>
    long frequented it or lived by its shore; yet this pond is so
   </p>
   <p>
    remarkable for its depth and purity as to merit a particular
   </p>
   <p>
    description. It is a clear and deep green well, half a mile long and a
   </p>
   <p>
    mile and three quarters in circumference, and contains about sixty-one
   </p>
   <p>
    and a half acres; a perennial spring in the midst of pine and oak
   </p>
   <p>
    woods, without any visible inlet or outlet except by the clouds and
   </p>
   <p>
    evaporation. The surrounding hills rise abruptly from the water to the
   </p>
   <p>
    height of forty to eighty feet, though on the south-east and east they
   </p>
   <p>
    attain to about one hundred and one hundred and fifty feet
   </p>
   <p>
    respectively, within a quarter and a third of a mile. They are
   </p>
   <p>
    exclusively woodland. All our Concord waters have two colors at least;
   </p>
   <p>
    one when viewed at a distance, and another, more proper, close at hand.
   </p>
   <p>
    The first depends more on the light, and follows the sky. In clear
   </p>
   <p>
    weather, in summer, they appear blue at a little distance, especially
   </p>
   <p>
    if agitated, and at a great distance all appear alike. In stormy
   </p>
   <p>
    weather they are sometimes of a dark slate color. The sea, however, is
   </p>
   <p>
    said to be blue one day and green another without any perceptible
   </p>
   <p>
    change in the atmosphere. I have seen our river, when, the landscape
   </p>
   <p>
    being covered with snow, both water and ice were almost as green as
   </p>
   <p>
    grass. Some consider blue “to be the color of pure water, whether
   </p>
   <p>
    liquid or solid.” But, looking directly down into our waters from a
   </p>
   <p>
    boat, they are seen to be of very different colors. Walden is blue at
   </p>
   <p>
    one time and green at another, even from the same point of view. Lying
   </p>
   <p>
    between the earth and the heavens, it partakes of the color of both.
   </p>
   <p>
    Viewed from a hill-top it reflects the color of the sky; but near at
   </p>
   <p>
    hand it is of a yellowish tint next the shore where you can see the
   </p>
   <p>
    sand, then a light green, which gradually deepens to a uniform dark
   </p>
   <p>
    green in the body of the pond. In some lights, viewed even from a
   </p>
   <p>
    hill-top, it is of a vivid green next the shore. Some have referred
   </p>
   <p>
    this to the reflection of the verdure; but it is equally green there
   </p>
   <p>
    against the railroad sand-bank, and in the spring, before the leaves
   </p>
   <p>
    are expanded, and it may be simply the result of the prevailing blue
   </p>
   <p>
    mixed with the yellow of the sand. Such is the color of its iris. This
   </p>
   <p>
    is that portion, also, where in the spring, the ice being warmed by the
   </p>
   <p>
    heat of the sun reflected from the bottom, and also transmitted through
   </p>
   <p>
    the earth, melts first and forms a narrow canal about the still frozen
   </p>
   <p>
    middle. Like the rest of our waters, when much agitated, in clear
   </p>
   <p>
    weather, so that the surface of the waves may reflect the sky at the
   </p>
   <p>
    right angle, or because there is more light mixed with it, it appears
   </p>
   <p>
    at a little distance of a darker blue than the sky itself; and at such
   </p>
   <p>
    a time, being on its surface, and looking with divided vision, so as to
   </p>
   <p>
    see the reflection, I have discerned a matchless and indescribable
   </p>
   <p>
    light blue, such as watered or changeable silks and sword blades
   </p>
   <p>
    suggest, more cerulean than the sky itself, alternating with the
   </p>
   <p>
    original dark green on the opposite sides of the waves, which last
   </p>
   <p>
    appeared but muddy in comparison. It is a vitreous greenish blue, as I
   </p>
   <p>
    remember it, like those patches of the winter sky seen through cloud
   </p>
   <p>
    vistas in the west before sundown. Yet a single glass of its water held
   </p>
   <p>
    up to the light is as colorless as an equal quantity of air. It is well
   </p>
   <p>
    known that a large plate of glass will have a green tint, owing, as the
   </p>
   <p>
    makers say, to its “body,” but a small piece of the same will be
   </p>
   <p>
    colorless. How large a body of Walden water would be required to
   </p>
   <p>
    reflect a green tint I have never proved. The water of our river is
   </p>
   <p>
    black or a very dark brown to one looking directly down on it, and,
   </p>
   <p>
    like that of most ponds, imparts to the body of one bathing in it a
   </p>
   <p>
    yellowish tinge; but this water is of such crystalline purity that the
   </p>
   <p>
    body of the bather appears of an alabaster whiteness, still more
   </p>
   <p>
    unnatural, which, as the limbs are magnified and distorted withal,
   </p>
   <p>
    produces a monstrous effect, making fit studies for a Michael Angelo.
   </p>
   <p>
    The water is so transparent that the bottom can easily be discerned at
   </p>
   <p>
    the depth of twenty-five or thirty feet. Paddling over it, you may see,
   </p>
   <p>
    many feet beneath the surface the schools of perch and shiners, perhaps
   </p>
   <p>
    only an inch long, yet the former easily distinguished by their
   </p>
   <p>
    transverse bars, and you think that they must be ascetic fish that find
   </p>
   <p>
    a subsistence there. Once, in the winter, many years ago, when I had
   </p>
   <p>
    been cutting holes through the ice in order to catch pickerel, as I
   </p>
   <p>
    stepped ashore I tossed my axe back on to the ice, but, as if some evil
   </p>
   <p>
    genius had directed it, it slid four or five rods directly into one of
   </p>
   <p>
    the holes, where the water was twenty-five feet deep. Out of curiosity,
   </p>
   <p>
    I lay down on the ice and looked through the hole, until I saw the axe
   </p>
   <p>
    a little on one side, standing on its head, with its helve erect and
   </p>
   <p>
    gently swaying to and fro with the pulse of the pond; and there it
   </p>
   <p>
    might have stood erect and swaying till in the course of time the
   </p>
   <p>
    handle rotted off, if I had not disturbed it. Making another hole
   </p>
   <p>
    directly over it with an ice chisel which I had, and cutting down the
   </p>
   <p>
    longest birch which I could find in the neighborhood with my knife, I
   </p>
   <p>
    made a slip-noose, which I attached to its end, and, letting it down
   </p>
   <p>
    carefully, passed it over the knob of the handle, and drew it by a line
   </p>
   <p>
    along the birch, and so pulled the axe out again.
   </p>
   <p>
    The shore is composed of a belt of smooth rounded white stones like
   </p>
   <p>
    paving stones, excepting one or two short sand beaches, and is so steep
   </p>
   <p>
    that in many places a single leap will carry you into water over your
   </p>
   <p>
    head; and were it not for its remarkable transparency, that would be
   </p>
   <p>
    the last to be seen of its bottom till it rose on the opposite side.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some think it is bottomless. It is nowhere muddy, and a casual observer
   </p>
   <p>
    would say that there were no weeds at all in it; and of noticeable
   </p>
   <p>
    plants, except in the little meadows recently overflowed, which do not
   </p>
   <p>
    properly belong to it, a closer scrutiny does not detect a flag nor a
   </p>
   <p>
    bulrush, nor even a lily, yellow or white, but only a few small
   </p>
   <p>
    heart-leaves and potamogetons, and perhaps a water-target or two; all
   </p>
   <p>
    which however a bather might not perceive; and these plants are clean
   </p>
   <p>
    and bright like the element they grow in. The stones extend a rod or
   </p>
   <p>
    two into the water, and then the bottom is pure sand, except in the
   </p>
   <p>
    deepest parts, where there is usually a little sediment, probably from
   </p>
   <p>
    the decay of the leaves which have been wafted on to it so many
   </p>
   <p>
    successive falls, and a bright green weed is brought up on anchors even
   </p>
   <p>
    in midwinter.
   </p>
   <p>
    We have one other pond just like this, White Pond, in Nine Acre Corner,
   </p>
   <p>
    about two and a half miles westerly; but, though I am acquainted with
   </p>
   <p>
    most of the ponds within a dozen miles of this centre I do not know a
   </p>
   <p>
    third of this pure and well-like character. Successive nations
   </p>
   <p>
    perchance have drank at, admired, and fathomed it, and passed away, and
   </p>
   <p>
    still its water is green and pellucid as ever. Not an intermitting
   </p>
   <p>
    spring! Perhaps on that spring morning when Adam and Eve were driven
   </p>
   <p>
    out of Eden Walden Pond was already in existence, and even then
   </p>
   <p>
    breaking up in a gentle spring rain accompanied with mist and a
   </p>
   <p>
    southerly wind, and covered with myriads of ducks and geese, which had
   </p>
   <p>
    not heard of the fall, when still such pure lakes sufficed them. Even
   </p>
   <p>
    then it had commenced to rise and fall, and had clarified its waters
   </p>
   <p>
    and colored them of the hue they now wear, and obtained a patent of
   </p>
   <p>
    heaven to be the only Walden Pond in the world and distiller of
   </p>
   <p>
    celestial dews. Who knows in how many unremembered nations’ literatures
   </p>
   <p>
    this has been the Castalian Fountain? or what nymphs presided over it
   </p>
   <p>
    in the Golden Age? It is a gem of the first water which Concord wears
   </p>
   <p>
    in her coronet.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet perchance the first who came to this well have left some trace of
   </p>
   <p>
    their footsteps. I have been surprised to detect encircling the pond,
   </p>
   <p>
    even where a thick wood has just been cut down on the shore, a narrow
   </p>
   <p>
    shelf-like path in the steep hill-side, alternately rising and falling,
   </p>
   <p>
    approaching and receding from the water’s edge, as old probably as the
   </p>
   <p>
    race of man here, worn by the feet of aboriginal hunters, and still
   </p>
   <p>
    from time to time unwittingly trodden by the present occupants of the
   </p>
   <p>
    land. This is particularly distinct to one standing on the middle of
   </p>
   <p>
    the pond in winter, just after a light snow has fallen, appearing as a
   </p>
   <p>
    clear undulating white line, unobscured by weeds and twigs, and very
   </p>
   <p>
    obvious a quarter of a mile off in many places where in summer it is
   </p>
   <p>
    hardly distinguishable close at hand. The snow reprints it, as it were,
   </p>
   <p>
    in clear white type alto-relievo. The ornamented grounds of villas
   </p>
   <p>
    which will one day be built here may still preserve some trace of this.
   </p>
   <p>
    The pond rises and falls, but whether regularly or not, and within what
   </p>
   <p>
    period, nobody knows, though, as usual, many pretend to know. It is
   </p>
   <p>
    commonly higher in the winter and lower in the summer, though not
   </p>
   <p>
    corresponding to the general wet and dryness. I can remember when it
   </p>
   <p>
    was a foot or two lower, and also when it was at least five feet
   </p>
   <p>
    higher, than when I lived by it. There is a narrow sand-bar running
   </p>
   <p>
    into it, with very deep water on one side, on which I helped boil a
   </p>
   <p>
    kettle of chowder, some six rods from the main shore, about the year
   </p>
   <p>
    1824, which it has not been possible to do for twenty-five years; and
   </p>
   <p>
    on the other hand, my friends used to listen with incredulity when I
   </p>
   <p>
    told them, that a few years later I was accustomed to fish from a boat
   </p>
   <p>
    in a secluded cove in the woods, fifteen rods from the only shore they
   </p>
   <p>
    knew, which place was long since converted into a meadow. But the pond
   </p>
   <p>
    has risen steadily for two years, and now, in the summer of ’52, is
   </p>
   <p>
    just five feet higher than when I lived there, or as high as it was
   </p>
   <p>
    thirty years ago, and fishing goes on again in the meadow. This makes a
   </p>
   <p>
    difference of level, at the outside, of six or seven feet; and yet the
   </p>
   <p>
    water shed by the surrounding hills is insignificant in amount, and
   </p>
   <p>
    this overflow must be referred to causes which affect the deep springs.
   </p>
   <p>
    This same summer the pond has begun to fall again. It is remarkable
   </p>
   <p>
    that this fluctuation, whether periodical or not, appears thus to
   </p>
   <p>
    require many years for its accomplishment. I have observed one rise and
   </p>
   <p>
    a part of two falls, and I expect that a dozen or fifteen years hence
   </p>
   <p>
    the water will again be as low as I have ever known it. Flint’s Pond, a
   </p>
   <p>
    mile eastward, allowing for the disturbance occasioned by its inlets
   </p>
   <p>
    and outlets, and the smaller intermediate ponds also, sympathize with
   </p>
   <p>
    Walden, and recently attained their greatest height at the same time
   </p>
   <p>
    with the latter. The same is true, as far as my observation goes, of
   </p>
   <p>
    White Pond.
   </p>
   <p>
    This rise and fall of Walden at long intervals serves this use at
   </p>
   <p>
    least; the water standing at this great height for a year or more,
   </p>
   <p>
    though it makes it difficult to walk round it, kills the shrubs and
   </p>
   <p>
    trees which have sprung up about its edge since the last rise,
   </p>
   <p>
    pitch-pines, birches, alders, aspens, and others, and, falling again,
   </p>
   <p>
    leaves an unobstructed shore; for, unlike many ponds and all waters
   </p>
   <p>
    which are subject to a daily tide, its shore is cleanest when the water
   </p>
   <p>
    is lowest. On the side of the pond next my house, a row of pitch pines
   </p>
   <p>
    fifteen feet high has been killed and tipped over as if by a lever, and
   </p>
   <p>
    thus a stop put to their encroachments; and their size indicates how
   </p>
   <p>
    many years have elapsed since the last rise to this height. By this
   </p>
   <p>
    fluctuation the pond asserts its title to a shore, and thus the _shore_
   </p>
   <p>
    is _shorn_, and the trees cannot hold it by right of possession. These
   </p>
   <p>
    are the lips of the lake on which no beard grows. It licks its chaps
   </p>
   <p>
    from time to time. When the water is at its height, the alders,
   </p>
   <p>
    willows, and maples send forth a mass of fibrous red roots several feet
   </p>
   <p>
    long from all sides of their stems in the water, and to the height of
   </p>
   <p>
    three or four feet from the ground, in the effort to maintain
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves; and I have known the high-blueberry bushes about the shore,
   </p>
   <p>
    which commonly produce no fruit, bear an abundant crop under these
   </p>
   <p>
    circumstances.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some have been puzzled to tell how the shore became so regularly paved.
   </p>
   <p>
    My townsmen have all heard the tradition, the oldest people tell me
   </p>
   <p>
    that they heard it in their youth, that anciently the Indians were
   </p>
   <p>
    holding a pow-wow upon a hill here, which rose as high into the heavens
   </p>
   <p>
    as the pond now sinks deep into the earth, and they used much
   </p>
   <p>
    profanity, as the story goes, though this vice is one of which the
   </p>
   <p>
    Indians were never guilty, and while they were thus engaged the hill
   </p>
   <p>
    shook and suddenly sank, and only one old squaw, named Walden, escaped,
   </p>
   <p>
    and from her the pond was named. It has been conjectured that when the
   </p>
   <p>
    hill shook these stones rolled down its side and became the present
   </p>
   <p>
    shore. It is very certain, at any rate, that once there was no pond
   </p>
   <p>
    here, and now there is one; and this Indian fable does not in any
   </p>
   <p>
    respect conflict with the account of that ancient settler whom I have
   </p>
   <p>
    mentioned, who remembers so well when he first came here with his
   </p>
   <p>
    divining rod, saw a thin vapor rising from the sward, and the hazel
   </p>
   <p>
    pointed steadily downward, and he concluded to dig a well here. As for
   </p>
   <p>
    the stones, many still think that they are hardly to be accounted for
   </p>
   <p>
    by the action of the waves on these hills; but I observe that the
   </p>
   <p>
    surrounding hills are remarkably full of the same kind of stones, so
   </p>
   <p>
    that they have been obliged to pile them up in walls on both sides of
   </p>
   <p>
    the railroad cut nearest the pond; and, moreover, there are most stones
   </p>
   <p>
    where the shore is most abrupt; so that, unfortunately, it is no longer
   </p>
   <p>
    a mystery to me. I detect the paver. If the name was not derived from
   </p>
   <p>
    that of some English locality,—Saffron Walden, for instance,—one might
   </p>
   <p>
    suppose that it was called originally _Walled-in_ Pond.
   </p>
   <p>
    The pond was my well ready dug. For four months in the year its water
   </p>
   <p>
    is as cold as it is pure at all times; and I think that it is then as
   </p>
   <p>
    good as any, if not the best, in the town. In the winter, all water
   </p>
   <p>
    which is exposed to the air is colder than springs and wells which are
   </p>
   <p>
    protected from it. The temperature of the pond water which had stood in
   </p>
   <p>
    the room where I sat from five o’clock in the afternoon till noon the
   </p>
   <p>
    next day, the sixth of March, 1846, the thermometer having been up to
   </p>
   <p>
    65° or 70° some of the time, owing partly to the sun on the roof, was
   </p>
   <p>
    42°, or one degree colder than the water of one of the coldest wells in
   </p>
   <p>
    the village just drawn. The temperature of the Boiling Spring the same
   </p>
   <p>
    day was 45°, or the warmest of any water tried, though it is the
   </p>
   <p>
    coldest that I know of in summer, when, beside, shallow and stagnant
   </p>
   <p>
    surface water is not mingled with it. Moreover, in summer, Walden never
   </p>
   <p>
    becomes so warm as most water which is exposed to the sun, on account
   </p>
   <p>
    of its depth. In the warmest weather I usually placed a pailful in my
   </p>
   <p>
    cellar, where it became cool in the night, and remained so during the
   </p>
   <p>
    day; though I also resorted to a spring in the neighborhood. It was as
   </p>
   <p>
    good when a week old as the day it was dipped, and had no taste of the
   </p>
   <p>
    pump. Whoever camps for a week in summer by the shore of a pond, needs
   </p>
   <p>
    only bury a pail of water a few feet deep in the shade of his camp to
   </p>
   <p>
    be independent of the luxury of ice.
   </p>
   <p>
    There have been caught in Walden pickerel, one weighing seven pounds,
   </p>
   <p>
    to say nothing of another which carried off a reel with great velocity,
   </p>
   <p>
    which the fisherman safely set down at eight pounds because he did not
   </p>
   <p>
    see him, perch and pouts, some of each weighing over two pounds,
   </p>
   <p>
    shiners, chivins or roach (_Leuciscus pulchellus_), a very few breams,
   </p>
   <p>
    and a couple of eels, one weighing four pounds,—I am thus particular
   </p>
   <p>
    because the weight of a fish is commonly its only title to fame, and
   </p>
   <p>
    these are the only eels I have heard of here;—also, I have a faint
   </p>
   <p>
    recollection of a little fish some five inches long, with silvery sides
   </p>
   <p>
    and a greenish back, somewhat dace-like in its character, which I
   </p>
   <p>
    mention here chiefly to link my facts to fable. Nevertheless, this pond
   </p>
   <p>
    is not very fertile in fish. Its pickerel, though not abundant, are its
   </p>
   <p>
    chief boast. I have seen at one time lying on the ice pickerel of at
   </p>
   <p>
    least three different kinds; a long and shallow one, steel-colored,
   </p>
   <p>
    most like those caught in the river; a bright golden kind, with
   </p>
   <p>
    greenish reflections and remarkably deep, which is the most common
   </p>
   <p>
    here; and another, golden-colored, and shaped like the last, but
   </p>
   <p>
    peppered on the sides with small dark brown or black spots, intermixed
   </p>
   <p>
    with a few faint blood-red ones, very much like a trout. The specific
   </p>
   <p>
    name _reticulatus_ would not apply to this; it should be _guttatus_
   </p>
   <p>
    rather. These are all very firm fish, and weigh more than their size
   </p>
   <p>
    promises. The shiners, pouts, and perch also, and indeed all the fishes
   </p>
   <p>
    which inhabit this pond, are much cleaner, handsomer, and firmer
   </p>
   <p>
    fleshed than those in the river and most other ponds, as the water is
   </p>
   <p>
    purer, and they can easily be distinguished from them. Probably many
   </p>
   <p>
    ichthyologists would make new varieties of some of them. There are also
   </p>
   <p>
    a clean race of frogs and tortoises, and a few muscels in it; muskrats
   </p>
   <p>
    and minks leave their traces about it, and occasionally a travelling
   </p>
   <p>
    mud-turtle visits it. Sometimes, when I pushed off my boat in the
   </p>
   <p>
    morning, I disturbed a great mud-turtle which had secreted himself
   </p>
   <p>
    under the boat in the night. Ducks and geese frequent it in the spring
   </p>
   <p>
    and fall, the white-bellied swallows (_Hirundo bicolor_) skim over it,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the peetweets (_Totanus macularius_) “teter” along its stony shores
   </p>
   <p>
    all summer. I have sometimes disturbed a fishhawk sitting on a
   </p>
   <p>
    white-pine over the water; but I doubt if it is ever profaned by the
   </p>
   <p>
    wing of a gull, like Fair Haven. At most, it tolerates one annual loon.
   </p>
   <p>
    These are all the animals of consequence which frequent it now.
   </p>
   <p>
    You may see from a boat, in calm weather, near the sandy eastern shore,
   </p>
   <p>
    where the water is eight or ten feet deep, and also in some other parts
   </p>
   <p>
    of the pond, some circular heaps half a dozen feet in diameter by a
   </p>
   <p>
    foot in height, consisting of small stones less than a hen’s egg in
   </p>
   <p>
    size, where all around is bare sand. At first you wonder if the Indians
   </p>
   <p>
    could have formed them on the ice for any purpose, and so, when the ice
   </p>
   <p>
    melted, they sank to the bottom; but they are too regular and some of
   </p>
   <p>
    them plainly too fresh for that. They are similar to those found in
   </p>
   <p>
    rivers; but as there are no suckers nor lampreys here, I know not by
   </p>
   <p>
    what fish they could be made. Perhaps they are the nests of the chivin.
   </p>
   <p>
    These lend a pleasing mystery to the bottom.
   </p>
   <p>
    The shore is irregular enough not to be monotonous. I have in my mind’s
   </p>
   <p>
    eye the western indented with deep bays, the bolder northern, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    beautifully scalloped southern shore, where successive capes overlap
   </p>
   <p>
    each other and suggest unexplored coves between. The forest has never
   </p>
   <p>
    so good a setting, nor is so distinctly beautiful, as when seen from
   </p>
   <p>
    the middle of a small lake amid hills which rise from the water’s edge;
   </p>
   <p>
    for the water in which it is reflected not only makes the best
   </p>
   <p>
    foreground in such a case, but, with its winding shore, the most
   </p>
   <p>
    natural and agreeable boundary to it. There is no rawness nor
   </p>
   <p>
    imperfection in its edge there, as where the axe has cleared a part, or
   </p>
   <p>
    a cultivated field abuts on it. The trees have ample room to expand on
   </p>
   <p>
    the water side, and each sends forth its most vigorous branch in that
   </p>
   <p>
    direction. There Nature has woven a natural selvage, and the eye rises
   </p>
   <p>
    by just gradations from the low shrubs of the shore to the highest
   </p>
   <p>
    trees. There are few traces of man’s hand to be seen. The water laves
   </p>
   <p>
    the shore as it did a thousand years ago.
   </p>
   <p>
    A lake is the landscape’s most beautiful and expressive feature. It is
   </p>
   <p>
    earth’s eye; looking into which the beholder measures the depth of his
   </p>
   <p>
    own nature. The fluviatile trees next the shore are the slender
   </p>
   <p>
    eyelashes which fringe it, and the wooded hills and cliffs around are
   </p>
   <p>
    its overhanging brows.
   </p>
   <p>
    Standing on the smooth sandy beach at the east end of the pond, in a
   </p>
   <p>
    calm September afternoon, when a slight haze makes the opposite shore
   </p>
   <p>
    line indistinct, I have seen whence came the expression, “the glassy
   </p>
   <p>
    surface of a lake.” When you invert your head, it looks like a thread
   </p>
   <p>
    of finest gossamer stretched across the valley, and gleaming against
   </p>
   <p>
    the distant pine woods, separating one stratum of the atmosphere from
   </p>
   <p>
    another. You would think that you could walk dry under it to the
   </p>
   <p>
    opposite hills, and that the swallows which skim over might perch on
   </p>
   <p>
    it. Indeed, they sometimes dive below this line, as it were by mistake,
   </p>
   <p>
    and are undeceived. As you look over the pond westward you are obliged
   </p>
   <p>
    to employ both your hands to defend your eyes against the reflected as
   </p>
   <p>
    well as the true sun, for they are equally bright; and if, between the
   </p>
   <p>
    two, you survey its surface critically, it is literally as smooth as
   </p>
   <p>
    glass, except where the skater insects, at equal intervals scattered
   </p>
   <p>
    over its whole extent, by their motions in the sun produce the finest
   </p>
   <p>
    imaginable sparkle on it, or, perchance, a duck plumes itself, or, as I
   </p>
   <p>
    have said, a swallow skims so low as to touch it. It may be that in the
   </p>
   <p>
    distance a fish describes an arc of three or four feet in the air, and
   </p>
   <p>
    there is one bright flash where it emerges, and another where it
   </p>
   <p>
    strikes the water; sometimes the whole silvery arc is revealed; or here
   </p>
   <p>
    and there, perhaps, is a thistle-down floating on its surface, which
   </p>
   <p>
    the fishes dart at and so dimple it again. It is like molten glass
   </p>
   <p>
    cooled but not congealed, and the few motes in it are pure and
   </p>
   <p>
    beautiful like the imperfections in glass. You may often detect a yet
   </p>
   <p>
    smoother and darker water, separated from the rest as if by an
   </p>
   <p>
    invisible cobweb, boom of the water nymphs, resting on it. From a
   </p>
   <p>
    hill-top you can see a fish leap in almost any part; for not a pickerel
   </p>
   <p>
    or shiner picks an insect from this smooth surface but it manifestly
   </p>
   <p>
    disturbs the equilibrium of the whole lake. It is wonderful with what
   </p>
   <p>
    elaborateness this simple fact is advertised,—this piscine murder will
   </p>
   <p>
    out,—and from my distant perch I distinguish the circling undulations
   </p>
   <p>
    when they are half a dozen rods in diameter. You can even detect a
   </p>
   <p>
    water-bug (_Gyrinus_) ceaselessly progressing over the smooth surface a
   </p>
   <p>
    quarter of a mile off; for they furrow the water slightly, making a
   </p>
   <p>
    conspicuous ripple bounded by two diverging lines, but the skaters
   </p>
   <p>
    glide over it without rippling it perceptibly. When the surface is
   </p>
   <p>
    considerably agitated there are no skaters nor water-bugs on it, but
   </p>
   <p>
    apparently, in calm days, they leave their havens and adventurously
   </p>
   <p>
    glide forth from the shore by short impulses till they completely cover
   </p>
   <p>
    it. It is a soothing employment, on one of those fine days in the fall
   </p>
   <p>
    when all the warmth of the sun is fully appreciated, to sit on a stump
   </p>
   <p>
    on such a height as this, overlooking the pond, and study the dimpling
   </p>
   <p>
    circles which are incessantly inscribed on its otherwise invisible
   </p>
   <p>
    surface amid the reflected skies and trees. Over this great expanse
   </p>
   <p>
    there is no disturbance but it is thus at once gently smoothed away and
   </p>
   <p>
    assuaged, as, when a vase of water is jarred, the trembling circles
   </p>
   <p>
    seek the shore and all is smooth again. Not a fish can leap or an
   </p>
   <p>
    insect fall on the pond but it is thus reported in circling dimples, in
   </p>
   <p>
    lines of beauty, as it were the constant welling up of its fountain,
   </p>
   <p>
    the gentle pulsing of its life, the heaving of its breast. The thrills
   </p>
   <p>
    of joy and thrills of pain are undistinguishable. How peaceful the
   </p>
   <p>
    phenomena of the lake! Again the works of man shine as in the spring.
   </p>
   <p>
    Ay, every leaf and twig and stone and cobweb sparkles now at
   </p>
   <p>
    mid-afternoon as when covered with dew in a spring morning. Every
   </p>
   <p>
    motion of an oar or an insect produces a flash of light; and if an oar
   </p>
   <p>
    falls, how sweet the echo!
   </p>
   <p>
    In such a day, in September or October, Walden is a perfect forest
   </p>
   <p>
    mirror, set round with stones as precious to my eye as if fewer or
   </p>
   <p>
    rarer. Nothing so fair, so pure, and at the same time so large, as a
   </p>
   <p>
    lake, perchance, lies on the surface of the earth. Sky water. It needs
   </p>
   <p>
    no fence. Nations come and go without defiling it. It is a mirror which
   </p>
   <p>
    no stone can crack, whose quicksilver will never wear off, whose
   </p>
   <p>
    gilding Nature continually repairs; no storms, no dust, can dim its
   </p>
   <p>
    surface ever fresh;—a mirror in which all impurity presented to it
   </p>
   <p>
    sinks, swept and dusted by the sun’s hazy brush,—this the light
   </p>
   <p>
    dust-cloth,—which retains no breath that is breathed on it, but sends
   </p>
   <p>
    its own to float as clouds high above its surface, and be reflected in
   </p>
   <p>
    its bosom still.
   </p>
   <p>
    A field of water betrays the spirit that is in the air. It is
   </p>
   <p>
    continually receiving new life and motion from above. It is
   </p>
   <p>
    intermediate in its nature between land and sky. On land only the grass
   </p>
   <p>
    and trees wave, but the water itself is rippled by the wind. I see
   </p>
   <p>
    where the breeze dashes across it by the streaks or flakes of light. It
   </p>
   <p>
    is remarkable that we can look down on its surface. We shall, perhaps,
   </p>
   <p>
    look down thus on the surface of air at length, and mark where a still
   </p>
   <p>
    subtler spirit sweeps over it.
   </p>
   <p>
    The skaters and water-bugs finally disappear in the latter part of
   </p>
   <p>
    October, when the severe frosts have come; and then and in November,
   </p>
   <p>
    usually, in a calm day, there is absolutely nothing to ripple the
   </p>
   <p>
    surface. One November afternoon, in the calm at the end of a rain storm
   </p>
   <p>
    of several days’ duration, when the sky was still completely overcast
   </p>
   <p>
    and the air was full of mist, I observed that the pond was remarkably
   </p>
   <p>
    smooth, so that it was difficult to distinguish its surface; though it
   </p>
   <p>
    no longer reflected the bright tints of October, but the sombre
   </p>
   <p>
    November colors of the surrounding hills. Though I passed over it as
   </p>
   <p>
    gently as possible, the slight undulations produced by my boat extended
   </p>
   <p>
    almost as far as I could see, and gave a ribbed appearance to the
   </p>
   <p>
    reflections. But, as I was looking over the surface, I saw here and
   </p>
   <p>
    there at a distance a faint glimmer, as if some skater insects which
   </p>
   <p>
    had escaped the frosts might be collected there, or, perchance, the
   </p>
   <p>
    surface, being so smooth, betrayed where a spring welled up from the
   </p>
   <p>
    bottom. Paddling gently to one of these places, I was surprised to find
   </p>
   <p>
    myself surrounded by myriads of small perch, about five inches long, of
   </p>
   <p>
    a rich bronze color in the green water, sporting there, and constantly
   </p>
   <p>
    rising to the surface and dimpling it, sometimes leaving bubbles on it.
   </p>
   <p>
    In such transparent and seemingly bottomless water, reflecting the
   </p>
   <p>
    clouds, I seemed to be floating through the air as in a balloon, and
   </p>
   <p>
    their swimming impressed me as a kind of flight or hovering, as if they
   </p>
   <p>
    were a compact flock of birds passing just beneath my level on the
   </p>
   <p>
    right or left, their fins, like sails, set all around them. There were
   </p>
   <p>
    many such schools in the pond, apparently improving the short season
   </p>
   <p>
    before winter would draw an icy shutter over their broad skylight,
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes giving to the surface an appearance as if a slight breeze
   </p>
   <p>
    struck it, or a few rain-drops fell there. When I approached carelessly
   </p>
   <p>
    and alarmed them, they made a sudden splash and rippling with their
   </p>
   <p>
    tails, as if one had struck the water with a brushy bough, and
   </p>
   <p>
    instantly took refuge in the depths. At length the wind rose, the mist
   </p>
   <p>
    increased, and the waves began to run, and the perch leaped much higher
   </p>
   <p>
    than before, half out of water, a hundred black points, three inches
   </p>
   <p>
    long, at once above the surface. Even as late as the fifth of December,
   </p>
   <p>
    one year, I saw some dimples on the surface, and thinking it was going
   </p>
   <p>
    to rain hard immediately, the air being full of mist, I made haste to
   </p>
   <p>
    take my place at the oars and row homeward; already the rain seemed
   </p>
   <p>
    rapidly increasing, though I felt none on my cheek, and I anticipated a
   </p>
   <p>
    thorough soaking. But suddenly the dimples ceased, for they were
   </p>
   <p>
    produced by the perch, which the noise of my oars had seared into the
   </p>
   <p>
    depths, and I saw their schools dimly disappearing; so I spent a dry
   </p>
   <p>
    afternoon after all.
   </p>
   <p>
    An old man who used to frequent this pond nearly sixty years ago, when
   </p>
   <p>
    it was dark with surrounding forests, tells me that in those days he
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes saw it all alive with ducks and other water fowl, and that
   </p>
   <p>
    there were many eagles about it. He came here a-fishing, and used an
   </p>
   <p>
    old log canoe which he found on the shore. It was made of two
   </p>
   <p>
    white-pine logs dug out and pinned together, and was cut off square at
   </p>
   <p>
    the ends. It was very clumsy, but lasted a great many years before it
   </p>
   <p>
    became water-logged and perhaps sank to the bottom. He did not know
   </p>
   <p>
    whose it was; it belonged to the pond. He used to make a cable for his
   </p>
   <p>
    anchor of strips of hickory bark tied together. An old man, a potter,
   </p>
   <p>
    who lived by the pond before the Revolution, told him once that there
   </p>
   <p>
    was an iron chest at the bottom, and that he had seen it. Sometimes it
   </p>
   <p>
    would come floating up to the shore; but when you went toward it, it
   </p>
   <p>
    would go back into deep water and disappear. I was pleased to hear of
   </p>
   <p>
    the old log canoe, which took the place of an Indian one of the same
   </p>
   <p>
    material but more graceful construction, which perchance had first been
   </p>
   <p>
    a tree on the bank, and then, as it were, fell into the water, to float
   </p>
   <p>
    there for a generation, the most proper vessel for the lake. I remember
   </p>
   <p>
    that when I first looked into these depths there were many large trunks
   </p>
   <p>
    to be seen indistinctly lying on the bottom, which had either been
   </p>
   <p>
    blown over formerly, or left on the ice at the last cutting, when wood
   </p>
   <p>
    was cheaper; but now they have mostly disappeared.
   </p>
   <p>
    When I first paddled a boat on Walden, it was completely surrounded by
   </p>
   <p>
    thick and lofty pine and oak woods, and in some of its coves grape
   </p>
   <p>
    vines had run over the trees next the water and formed bowers under
   </p>
   <p>
    which a boat could pass. The hills which form its shores are so steep,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the woods on them were then so high, that, as you looked down from
   </p>
   <p>
    the west end, it had the appearance of an amphitheatre for some kind of
   </p>
   <p>
    sylvan spectacle. I have spent many an hour, when I was younger,
   </p>
   <p>
    floating over its surface as the zephyr willed, having paddled my boat
   </p>
   <p>
    to the middle, and lying on my back across the seats, in a summer
   </p>
   <p>
    forenoon, dreaming awake, until I was aroused by the boat touching the
   </p>
   <p>
    sand, and I arose to see what shore my fates had impelled me to; days
   </p>
   <p>
    when idleness was the most attractive and productive industry. Many a
   </p>
   <p>
    forenoon have I stolen away, preferring to spend thus the most valued
   </p>
   <p>
    part of the day; for I was rich, if not in money, in sunny hours and
   </p>
   <p>
    summer days, and spent them lavishly; nor do I regret that I did not
   </p>
   <p>
    waste more of them in the workshop or the teacher’s desk. But since I
   </p>
   <p>
    left those shores the woodchoppers have still further laid them waste,
   </p>
   <p>
    and now for many a year there will be no more rambling through the
   </p>
   <p>
    aisles of the wood, with occasional vistas through which you see the
   </p>
   <p>
    water. My Muse may be excused if she is silent henceforth. How can you
   </p>
   <p>
    expect the birds to sing when their groves are cut down?
   </p>
   <p>
    Now the trunks of trees on the bottom, and the old log canoe, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    dark surrounding woods, are gone, and the villagers, who scarcely know
   </p>
   <p>
    where it lies, instead of going to the pond to bathe or drink, are
   </p>
   <p>
    thinking to bring its water, which should be as sacred as the Ganges at
   </p>
   <p>
    least, to the village in a pipe, to wash their dishes with!—to earn
   </p>
   <p>
    their Walden by the turning of a cock or drawing of a plug! That
   </p>
   <p>
    devilish Iron Horse, whose ear-rending neigh is heard throughout the
   </p>
   <p>
    town, has muddied the Boiling Spring with his foot, and he it is that
   </p>
   <p>
    has browsed off all the woods on Walden shore, that Trojan horse, with
   </p>
   <p>
    a thousand men in his belly, introduced by mercenary Greeks! Where is
   </p>
   <p>
    the country’s champion, the Moore of Moore Hill, to meet him at the
   </p>
   <p>
    Deep Cut and thrust an avenging lance between the ribs of the bloated
   </p>
   <p>
    pest?
   </p>
   <p>
    Nevertheless, of all the characters I have known, perhaps Walden wears
   </p>
   <p>
    best, and best preserves its purity. Many men have been likened to it,
   </p>
   <p>
    but few deserve that honor. Though the woodchoppers have laid bare
   </p>
   <p>
    first this shore and then that, and the Irish have built their sties by
   </p>
   <p>
    it, and the railroad has infringed on its border, and the ice-men have
   </p>
   <p>
    skimmed it once, it is itself unchanged, the same water which my
   </p>
   <p>
    youthful eyes fell on; all the change is in me. It has not acquired one
   </p>
   <p>
    permanent wrinkle after all its ripples. It is perennially young, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    may stand and see a swallow dip apparently to pick an insect from its
   </p>
   <p>
    surface as of yore. It struck me again tonight, as if I had not seen it
   </p>
   <p>
    almost daily for more than twenty years,—Why, here is Walden, the same
   </p>
   <p>
    woodland lake that I discovered so many years ago; where a forest was
   </p>
   <p>
    cut down last winter another is springing up by its shore as lustily as
   </p>
   <p>
    ever; the same thought is welling up to its surface that was then; it
   </p>
   <p>
    is the same liquid joy and happiness to itself and its Maker, ay, and
   </p>
   <p>
    it _may_ be to me. It is the work of a brave man surely, in whom there
   </p>
   <p>
    was no guile! He rounded this water with his hand, deepened and
   </p>
   <p>
    clarified it in his thought, and in his will bequeathed it to Concord.
   </p>
   <p>
    I see by its face that it is visited by the same reflection; and I can
   </p>
   <p>
    almost say, Walden, is it you?
   </p>
   <p>
    It is no dream of mine,
   </p>
   <p>
    To ornament a line;
   </p>
   <p>
    I cannot come nearer to God and Heaven
   </p>
   <p>
    Than I live to Walden even.
   </p>
   <p>
    I am its stony shore,
   </p>
   <p>
    And the breeze that passes o’er;
   </p>
   <p>
    In the hollow of my hand
   </p>
   <p>
    Are its water and its sand,
   </p>
   <p>
    And its deepest resort
   </p>
   <p>
    Lies high in my thought.
   </p>
   <p>
    The cars never pause to look at it; yet I fancy that the engineers and
   </p>
   <p>
    firemen and brakemen, and those passengers who have a season ticket and
   </p>
   <p>
    see it often, are better men for the sight. The engineer does not
   </p>
   <p>
    forget at night, or his nature does not, that he has beheld this vision
   </p>
   <p>
    of serenity and purity once at least during the day. Though seen but
   </p>
   <p>
    once, it helps to wash out State-street and the engine’s soot. One
   </p>
   <p>
    proposes that it be called “God’s Drop.”
   </p>
   <p>
    I have said that Walden has no visible inlet nor outlet, but it is on
   </p>
   <p>
    the one hand distantly and indirectly related to Flint’s Pond, which is
   </p>
   <p>
    more elevated, by a chain of small ponds coming from that quarter, and
   </p>
   <p>
    on the other directly and manifestly to Concord River, which is lower,
   </p>
   <p>
    by a similar chain of ponds through which in some other geological
   </p>
   <p>
    period it may have flowed, and by a little digging, which God forbid,
   </p>
   <p>
    it can be made to flow thither again. If by living thus reserved and
   </p>
   <p>
    austere, like a hermit in the woods, so long, it has acquired such
   </p>
   <p>
    wonderful purity, who would not regret that the comparatively impure
   </p>
   <p>
    waters of Flint’s Pond should be mingled with it, or itself should ever
   </p>
   <p>
    go to waste its sweetness in the ocean wave?
   </p>
   <p>
    Flint’s, or Sandy Pond, in Lincoln, our greatest lake and inland sea,
   </p>
   <p>
    lies about a mile east of Walden. It is much larger, being said to
   </p>
   <p>
    contain one hundred and ninety-seven acres, and is more fertile in
   </p>
   <p>
    fish; but it is comparatively shallow, and not remarkably pure. A walk
   </p>
   <p>
    through the woods thither was often my recreation. It was worth the
   </p>
   <p>
    while, if only to feel the wind blow on your cheek freely, and see the
   </p>
   <p>
    waves run, and remember the life of mariners. I went a-chestnutting
   </p>
   <p>
    there in the fall, on windy days, when the nuts were dropping into the
   </p>
   <p>
    water and were washed to my feet; and one day, as I crept along its
   </p>
   <p>
    sedgy shore, the fresh spray blowing in my face, I came upon the
   </p>
   <p>
    mouldering wreck of a boat, the sides gone, and hardly more than the
   </p>
   <p>
    impression of its flat bottom left amid the rushes; yet its model was
   </p>
   <p>
    sharply defined, as if it were a large decayed pad, with its veins. It
   </p>
   <p>
    was as impressive a wreck as one could imagine on the sea-shore, and
   </p>
   <p>
    had as good a moral. It is by this time mere vegetable mould and
   </p>
   <p>
    undistinguishable pond shore, through which rushes and flags have
   </p>
   <p>
    pushed up. I used to admire the ripple marks on the sandy bottom, at
   </p>
   <p>
    the north end of this pond, made firm and hard to the feet of the wader
   </p>
   <p>
    by the pressure of the water, and the rushes which grew in Indian file,
   </p>
   <p>
    in waving lines, corresponding to these marks, rank behind rank, as if
   </p>
   <p>
    the waves had planted them. There also I have found, in considerable
   </p>
   <p>
    quantities, curious balls, composed apparently of fine grass or roots,
   </p>
   <p>
    of pipewort perhaps, from half an inch to four inches in diameter, and
   </p>
   <p>
    perfectly spherical. These wash back and forth in shallow water on a
   </p>
   <p>
    sandy bottom, and are sometimes cast on the shore. They are either
   </p>
   <p>
    solid grass, or have a little sand in the middle. At first you would
   </p>
   <p>
    say that they were formed by the action of the waves, like a pebble;
   </p>
   <p>
    yet the smallest are made of equally coarse materials, half an inch
   </p>
   <p>
    long, and they are produced only at one season of the year. Moreover,
   </p>
   <p>
    the waves, I suspect, do not so much construct as wear down a material
   </p>
   <p>
    which has already acquired consistency. They preserve their form when
   </p>
   <p>
    dry for an indefinite period.
   </p>
   <p>
    _Flint’s Pond!_ Such is the poverty of our nomenclature. What right had
   </p>
   <p>
    the unclean and stupid farmer, whose farm abutted on this sky water,
   </p>
   <p>
    whose shores he has ruthlessly laid bare, to give his name to it? Some
   </p>
   <p>
    skin-flint, who loved better the reflecting surface of a dollar, or a
   </p>
   <p>
    bright cent, in which he could see his own brazen face; who regarded
   </p>
   <p>
    even the wild ducks which settled in it as trespassers; his fingers
   </p>
   <p>
    grown into crooked and horny talons from the long habit of grasping
   </p>
   <p>
    harpy-like;—so it is not named for me. I go not there to see him nor to
   </p>
   <p>
    hear of him; who never _saw_ it, who never bathed in it, who never
   </p>
   <p>
    loved it, who never protected it, who never spoke a good word for it,
   </p>
   <p>
    nor thanked God that he had made it. Rather let it be named from the
   </p>
   <p>
    fishes that swim in it, the wild fowl or quadrupeds which frequent it,
   </p>
   <p>
    the wild flowers which grow by its shores, or some wild man or child
   </p>
   <p>
    the thread of whose history is interwoven with its own; not from him
   </p>
   <p>
    who could show no title to it but the deed which a like-minded neighbor
   </p>
   <p>
    or legislature gave him,—him who thought only of its money value; whose
   </p>
   <p>
    presence perchance cursed all the shore; who exhausted the land around
   </p>
   <p>
    it, and would fain have exhausted the waters within it; who regretted
   </p>
   <p>
    only that it was not English hay or cranberry meadow,—there was nothing
   </p>
   <p>
    to redeem it, forsooth, in his eyes,—and would have drained and sold it
   </p>
   <p>
    for the mud at its bottom. It did not turn his mill, and it was no
   </p>
   <p>
    _privilege_ to him to behold it. I respect not his labors, his farm
   </p>
   <p>
    where every thing has its price; who would carry the landscape, who
   </p>
   <p>
    would carry his God, to market, if he could get any thing for him; who
   </p>
   <p>
    goes to market _for_ his god as it is; on whose farm nothing grows
   </p>
   <p>
    free, whose fields bear no crops, whose meadows no flowers, whose trees
   </p>
   <p>
    no fruits, but dollars; who loves not the beauty of his fruits, whose
   </p>
   <p>
    fruits are not ripe for him till they are turned to dollars. Give me
   </p>
   <p>
    the poverty that enjoys true wealth. Farmers are respectable and
   </p>
   <p>
    interesting to me in proportion as they are poor,—poor farmers. A model
   </p>
   <p>
    farm! where the house stands like a fungus in a muck-heap, chambers for
   </p>
   <p>
    men, horses, oxen, and swine, cleansed and uncleansed, all contiguous
   </p>
   <p>
    to one another! Stocked with men! A great grease-spot, redolent of
   </p>
   <p>
    manures and buttermilk! Under a high state of cultivation, being
   </p>
   <p>
    manured with the hearts and brains of men! As if you were to raise your
   </p>
   <p>
    potatoes in the church-yard! Such is a model farm.
   </p>
   <p>
    No, no; if the fairest features of the landscape are to be named after
   </p>
   <p>
    men, let them be the noblest and worthiest men alone. Let our lakes
   </p>
   <p>
    receive as true names at least as the Icarian Sea, where “still the
   </p>
   <p>
    shore” a “brave attempt resounds.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Goose Pond, of small extent, is on my way to Flint’s; Fair-Haven, an
   </p>
   <p>
    expansion of Concord River, said to contain some seventy acres, is a
   </p>
   <p>
    mile south-west; and White Pond, of about forty acres, is a mile and a
   </p>
   <p>
    half beyond Fair-Haven. This is my lake country. These, with Concord
   </p>
   <p>
    River, are my water privileges; and night and day, year in year out,
   </p>
   <p>
    they grind such grist as I carry to them.
   </p>
   <p>
    Since the woodcutters, and the railroad, and I myself have profaned
   </p>
   <p>
    Walden, perhaps the most attractive, if not the most beautiful, of all
   </p>
   <p>
    our lakes, the gem of the woods, is White Pond;—a poor name from its
   </p>
   <p>
    commonness, whether derived from the remarkable purity of its waters or
   </p>
   <p>
    the color of its sands. In these as in other respects, however, it is a
   </p>
   <p>
    lesser twin of Walden. They are so much alike that you would say they
   </p>
   <p>
    must be connected under ground. It has the same stony shore, and its
   </p>
   <p>
    waters are of the same hue. As at Walden, in sultry dog-day weather,
   </p>
   <p>
    looking down through the woods on some of its bays which are not so
   </p>
   <p>
    deep but that the reflection from the bottom tinges them, its waters
   </p>
   <p>
    are of a misty bluish-green or glaucous color. Many years since I used
   </p>
   <p>
    to go there to collect the sand by cart-loads, to make sand-paper with,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I have continued to visit it ever since. One who frequents it
   </p>
   <p>
    proposes to call it Virid Lake. Perhaps it might be called Yellow-Pine
   </p>
   <p>
    Lake, from the following circumstance. About fifteen years ago you
   </p>
   <p>
    could see the top of a pitch-pine, of the kind called yellow-pine
   </p>
   <p>
    hereabouts, though it is not a distinct species, projecting above the
   </p>
   <p>
    surface in deep water, many rods from the shore. It was even supposed
   </p>
   <p>
    by some that the pond had sunk, and this was one of the primitive
   </p>
   <p>
    forest that formerly stood there. I find that even so long ago as 1792,
   </p>
   <p>
    in a “Topographical Description of the Town of Concord,” by one of its
   </p>
   <p>
    citizens, in the Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society,
   </p>
   <p>
    the author, after speaking of Walden and White Ponds, adds: “In the
   </p>
   <p>
    middle of the latter may be seen, when the water is very low, a tree
   </p>
   <p>
    which appears as if it grew in the place where it now stands, although
   </p>
   <p>
    the roots are fifty feet below the surface of the water; the top of
   </p>
   <p>
    this tree is broken off, and at that place measures fourteen inches in
   </p>
   <p>
    diameter.” In the spring of ’49 I talked with the man who lives nearest
   </p>
   <p>
    the pond in Sudbury, who told me that it was he who got out this tree
   </p>
   <p>
    ten or fifteen years before. As near as he could remember, it stood
   </p>
   <p>
    twelve or fifteen rods from the shore, where the water was thirty or
   </p>
   <p>
    forty feet deep. It was in the winter, and he had been getting out ice
   </p>
   <p>
    in the forenoon, and had resolved that in the afternoon, with the aid
   </p>
   <p>
    of his neighbors, he would take out the old yellow-pine. He sawed a
   </p>
   <p>
    channel in the ice toward the shore, and hauled it over and along and
   </p>
   <p>
    out on to the ice with oxen; but, before he had gone far in his work,
   </p>
   <p>
    he was surprised to find that it was wrong end upward, with the stumps
   </p>
   <p>
    of the branches pointing down, and the small end firmly fastened in the
   </p>
   <p>
    sandy bottom. It was about a foot in diameter at the big end, and he
   </p>
   <p>
    had expected to get a good saw-log, but it was so rotten as to be fit
   </p>
   <p>
    only for fuel, if for that. He had some of it in his shed then. There
   </p>
   <p>
    were marks of an axe and of woodpeckers on the butt. He thought that it
   </p>
   <p>
    might have been a dead tree on the shore, but was finally blown over
   </p>
   <p>
    into the pond, and after the top had become waterlogged, while the
   </p>
   <p>
    butt-end was still dry and light, had drifted out and sunk wrong end
   </p>
   <p>
    up. His father, eighty years old, could not remember when it was not
   </p>
   <p>
    there. Several pretty large logs may still be seen lying on the bottom,
   </p>
   <p>
    where, owing to the undulation of the surface, they look like huge
   </p>
   <p>
    water snakes in motion.
   </p>
   <p>
    This pond has rarely been profaned by a boat, for there is little in it
   </p>
   <p>
    to tempt a fisherman. Instead of the white lily, which requires mud, or
   </p>
   <p>
    the common sweet flag, the blue flag (_Iris versicolor_) grows thinly
   </p>
   <p>
    in the pure water, rising from the stony bottom all around the shore,
   </p>
   <p>
    where it is visited by humming birds in June; and the color both of its
   </p>
   <p>
    bluish blades and its flowers, and especially their reflections, are in
   </p>
   <p>
    singular harmony with the glaucous water.
   </p>
   <p>
    White Pond and Walden are great crystals on the surface of the earth,
   </p>
   <p>
    Lakes of Light. If they were permanently congealed, and small enough to
   </p>
   <p>
    be clutched, they would, perchance, be carried off by slaves, like
   </p>
   <p>
    precious stones, to adorn the heads of emperors; but being liquid, and
   </p>
   <p>
    ample, and secured to us and our successors forever, we disregard them,
   </p>
   <p>
    and run after the diamond of Kohinoor. They are too pure to have a
   </p>
   <p>
    market value; they contain no muck. How much more beautiful than our
   </p>
   <p>
    lives, how much more transparent than our characters, are they! We
   </p>
   <p>
    never learned meanness of them. How much fairer than the pool before
   </p>
   <p>
    the farmer’s door, in which his ducks swim! Hither the clean wild ducks
   </p>
   <p>
    come. Nature has no human inhabitant who appreciates her. The birds
   </p>
   <p>
    with their plumage and their notes are in harmony with the flowers, but
   </p>
   <p>
    what youth or maiden conspires with the wild luxuriant beauty of
   </p>
   <p>
    Nature? She flourishes most alone, far from the towns where they
   </p>
   <p>
    reside. Talk of heaven! ye disgrace earth.
   </p>
   <p>
    Baker Farm
   </p>
   <p>
    Sometimes I rambled to pine groves, standing like temples, or like
   </p>
   <p>
    fleets at sea, full-rigged, with wavy boughs, and rippling with light,
   </p>
   <p>
    so soft and green and shady that the Druids would have forsaken their
   </p>
   <p>
    oaks to worship in them; or to the cedar wood beyond Flint’s Pond,
   </p>
   <p>
    where the trees, covered with hoary blue berries, spiring higher and
   </p>
   <p>
    higher, are fit to stand before Valhalla, and the creeping juniper
   </p>
   <p>
    covers the ground with wreaths full of fruit; or to swamps where the
   </p>
   <p>
    usnea lichen hangs in festoons from the white-spruce trees, and
   </p>
   <p>
    toad-stools, round tables of the swamp gods, cover the ground, and more
   </p>
   <p>
    beautiful fungi adorn the stumps, like butterflies or shells, vegetable
   </p>
   <p>
    winkles; where the swamp-pink and dogwood grow, the red alder-berry
   </p>
   <p>
    glows like eyes of imps, the waxwork grooves and crushes the hardest
   </p>
   <p>
    woods in its folds, and the wild-holly berries make the beholder forget
   </p>
   <p>
    his home with their beauty, and he is dazzled and tempted by nameless
   </p>
   <p>
    other wild forbidden fruits, too fair for mortal taste. Instead of
   </p>
   <p>
    calling on some scholar, I paid many a visit to particular trees, of
   </p>
   <p>
    kinds which are rare in this neighborhood, standing far away in the
   </p>
   <p>
    middle of some pasture, or in the depths of a wood or swamp, or on a
   </p>
   <p>
    hill-top; such as the black-birch, of which we have some handsome
   </p>
   <p>
    specimens two feet in diameter; its cousin, the yellow birch, with its
   </p>
   <p>
    loose golden vest, perfumed like the first; the beech, which has so
   </p>
   <p>
    neat a bole and beautifully lichen-painted, perfect in all its details,
   </p>
   <p>
    of which, excepting scattered specimens, I know but one small grove of
   </p>
   <p>
    sizable trees left in the township, supposed by some to have been
   </p>
   <p>
    planted by the pigeons that were once baited with beech nuts near by;
   </p>
   <p>
    it is worth the while to see the silver grain sparkle when you split
   </p>
   <p>
    this wood; the bass; the hornbeam; the _Celtis occidentalis_, or false
   </p>
   <p>
    elm, of which we have but one well-grown; some taller mast of a pine, a
   </p>
   <p>
    shingle tree, or a more perfect hemlock than usual, standing like a
   </p>
   <p>
    pagoda in the midst of the woods; and many others I could mention.
   </p>
   <p>
    These were the shrines I visited both summer and winter.
   </p>
   <p>
    Once it chanced that I stood in the very abutment of a rainbow’s arch,
   </p>
   <p>
    which filled the lower stratum of the atmosphere, tinging the grass and
   </p>
   <p>
    leaves around, and dazzling me as if I looked through colored crystal.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was a lake of rainbow light, in which, for a short while, I lived
   </p>
   <p>
    like a dolphin. If it had lasted longer it might have tinged my
   </p>
   <p>
    employments and life. As I walked on the railroad causeway, I used to
   </p>
   <p>
    wonder at the halo of light around my shadow, and would fain fancy
   </p>
   <p>
    myself one of the elect. One who visited me declared that the shadows
   </p>
   <p>
    of some Irishmen before him had no halo about them, that it was only
   </p>
   <p>
    natives that were so distinguished. Benvenuto Cellini tells us in his
   </p>
   <p>
    memoirs, that, after a certain terrible dream or vision which he had
   </p>
   <p>
    during his confinement in the castle of St. Angelo, a resplendent light
   </p>
   <p>
    appeared over the shadow of his head at morning and evening, whether he
   </p>
   <p>
    was in Italy or France, and it was particularly conspicuous when the
   </p>
   <p>
    grass was moist with dew. This was probably the same phenomenon to
   </p>
   <p>
    which I have referred, which is especially observed in the morning, but
   </p>
   <p>
    also at other times, and even by moonlight. Though a constant one, it
   </p>
   <p>
    is not commonly noticed, and, in the case of an excitable imagination
   </p>
   <p>
    like Cellini’s, it would be basis enough for superstition. Beside, he
   </p>
   <p>
    tells us that he showed it to very few. But are they not indeed
   </p>
   <p>
    distinguished who are conscious that they are regarded at all?
   </p>
   <p>
    I set out one afternoon to go a-fishing to Fair-Haven, through the
   </p>
   <p>
    woods, to eke out my scanty fare of vegetables. My way led through
   </p>
   <p>
    Pleasant Meadow, an adjunct of the Baker Farm, that retreat of which a
   </p>
   <p>
    poet has since sung, beginning,—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Thy entry is a pleasant field,
   </p>
   <p>
    Which some mossy fruit trees yield
   </p>
   <p>
    Partly to a ruddy brook,
   </p>
   <p>
    By gliding musquash undertook,
   </p>
   <p>
    And mercurial trout,
   </p>
   <p>
    Darting about.”
   </p>
   <p>
    I thought of living there before I went to Walden. I “hooked” the
   </p>
   <p>
    apples, leaped the brook, and scared the musquash and the trout. It was
   </p>
   <p>
    one of those afternoons which seem indefinitely long before one, in
   </p>
   <p>
    which many events may happen, a large portion of our natural life,
   </p>
   <p>
    though it was already half spent when I started. By the way there came
   </p>
   <p>
    up a shower, which compelled me to stand half an hour under a pine,
   </p>
   <p>
    piling boughs over my head, and wearing my handkerchief for a shed; and
   </p>
   <p>
    when at length I had made one cast over the pickerel-weed, standing up
   </p>
   <p>
    to my middle in water, I found myself suddenly in the shadow of a
   </p>
   <p>
    cloud, and the thunder began to rumble with such emphasis that I could
   </p>
   <p>
    do no more than listen to it. The gods must be proud, thought I, with
   </p>
   <p>
    such forked flashes to rout a poor unarmed fisherman. So I made haste
   </p>
   <p>
    for shelter to the nearest hut, which stood half a mile from any road,
   </p>
   <p>
    but so much the nearer to the pond, and had long been uninhabited:—
   </p>
   <p>
    “And here a poet builded,
   </p>
   <p>
    In the completed years,
   </p>
   <p>
    For behold a trivial cabin
   </p>
   <p>
    That to destruction steers.”
   </p>
   <p>
    So the Muse fables. But therein, as I found, dwelt now John Field, an
   </p>
   <p>
    Irishman, and his wife, and several children, from the broad-faced boy
   </p>
   <p>
    who assisted his father at his work, and now came running by his side
   </p>
   <p>
    from the bog to escape the rain, to the wrinkled, sibyl-like,
   </p>
   <p>
    cone-headed infant that sat upon its father’s knee as in the palaces of
   </p>
   <p>
    nobles, and looked out from its home in the midst of wet and hunger
   </p>
   <p>
    inquisitively upon the stranger, with the privilege of infancy, not
   </p>
   <p>
    knowing but it was the last of a noble line, and the hope and cynosure
   </p>
   <p>
    of the world, instead of John Field’s poor starveling brat. There we
   </p>
   <p>
    sat together under that part of the roof which leaked the least, while
   </p>
   <p>
    it showered and thundered without. I had sat there many times of old
   </p>
   <p>
    before the ship was built that floated his family to America. An
   </p>
   <p>
    honest, hard-working, but shiftless man plainly was John Field; and his
   </p>
   <p>
    wife, she too was brave to cook so many successive dinners in the
   </p>
   <p>
    recesses of that lofty stove; with round greasy face and bare breast,
   </p>
   <p>
    still thinking to improve her condition one day; with the never absent
   </p>
   <p>
    mop in one hand, and yet no effects of it visible anywhere. The
   </p>
   <p>
    chickens, which had also taken shelter here from the rain, stalked
   </p>
   <p>
    about the room like members of the family, too humanized methought to
   </p>
   <p>
    roast well. They stood and looked in my eye or pecked at my shoe
   </p>
   <p>
    significantly. Meanwhile my host told me his story, how hard he worked
   </p>
   <p>
    “bogging” for a neighboring farmer, turning up a meadow with a spade or
   </p>
   <p>
    bog hoe at the rate of ten dollars an acre and the use of the land with
   </p>
   <p>
    manure for one year, and his little broad-faced son worked cheerfully
   </p>
   <p>
    at his father’s side the while, not knowing how poor a bargain the
   </p>
   <p>
    latter had made. I tried to help him with my experience, telling him
   </p>
   <p>
    that he was one of my nearest neighbors, and that I too, who came
   </p>
   <p>
    a-fishing here, and looked like a loafer, was getting my living like
   </p>
   <p>
    himself; that I lived in a tight, light, and clean house, which hardly
   </p>
   <p>
    cost more than the annual rent of such a ruin as his commonly amounts
   </p>
   <p>
    to; and how, if he chose, he might in a month or two build himself a
   </p>
   <p>
    palace of his own; that I did not use tea, nor coffee, nor butter, nor
   </p>
   <p>
    milk, nor fresh meat, and so did not have to work to get them; again,
   </p>
   <p>
    as I did not work hard, I did not have to eat hard, and it cost me but
   </p>
   <p>
    a trifle for my food; but as he began with tea, and coffee, and butter,
   </p>
   <p>
    and milk, and beef, he had to work hard to pay for them, and when he
   </p>
   <p>
    had worked hard he had to eat hard again to repair the waste of his
   </p>
   <p>
    system,—and so it was as broad as it was long, indeed it was broader
   </p>
   <p>
    than it was long, for he was discontented and wasted his life into the
   </p>
   <p>
    bargain; and yet he had rated it as a gain in coming to America, that
   </p>
   <p>
    here you could get tea, and coffee, and meat every day. But the only
   </p>
   <p>
    true America is that country where you are at liberty to pursue such a
   </p>
   <p>
    mode of life as may enable you to do without these, and where the state
   </p>
   <p>
    does not endeavor to compel you to sustain the slavery and war and
   </p>
   <p>
    other superfluous expenses which directly or indirectly result from the
   </p>
   <p>
    use of such things. For I purposely talked to him as if he were a
   </p>
   <p>
    philosopher, or desired to be one. I should be glad if all the meadows
   </p>
   <p>
    on the earth were left in a wild state, if that were the consequence of
   </p>
   <p>
    men’s beginning to redeem themselves. A man will not need to study
   </p>
   <p>
    history to find out what is best for his own culture. But alas! the
   </p>
   <p>
    culture of an Irishman is an enterprise to be undertaken with a sort of
   </p>
   <p>
    moral bog hoe. I told him, that as he worked so hard at bogging, he
   </p>
   <p>
    required thick boots and stout clothing, which yet were soon soiled and
   </p>
   <p>
    worn out, but I wore light shoes and thin clothing, which cost not half
   </p>
   <p>
    so much, though he might think that I was dressed like a gentleman,
   </p>
   <p>
    (which, however, was not the case,) and in an hour or two, without
   </p>
   <p>
    labor, but as a recreation, I could, if I wished, catch as many fish as
   </p>
   <p>
    I should want for two days, or earn enough money to support me a week.
   </p>
   <p>
    If he and his family would live simply, they might all go
   </p>
   <p>
    a-huckleberrying in the summer for their amusement. John heaved a sigh
   </p>
   <p>
    at this, and his wife stared with arms a-kimbo, and both appeared to be
   </p>
   <p>
    wondering if they had capital enough to begin such a course with, or
   </p>
   <p>
    arithmetic enough to carry it through. It was sailing by dead reckoning
   </p>
   <p>
    to them, and they saw not clearly how to make their port so; therefore
   </p>
   <p>
    I suppose they still take life bravely, after their fashion, face to
   </p>
   <p>
    face, giving it tooth and nail, not having skill to split its massive
   </p>
   <p>
    columns with any fine entering wedge, and rout it in detail;—thinking
   </p>
   <p>
    to deal with it roughly, as one should handle a thistle. But they fight
   </p>
   <p>
    at an overwhelming disadvantage,—living, John Field, alas! without
   </p>
   <p>
    arithmetic, and failing so.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Do you ever fish?” I asked. “Oh yes, I catch a mess now and then when
   </p>
   <p>
    I am lying by; good perch I catch.” “What’s your bait?” “I catch
   </p>
   <p>
    shiners with fish-worms, and bait the perch with them.” “You’d better
   </p>
   <p>
    go now, John,” said his wife, with glistening and hopeful face; but
   </p>
   <p>
    John demurred.
   </p>
   <p>
    The shower was now over, and a rainbow above the eastern woods promised
   </p>
   <p>
    a fair evening; so I took my departure. When I had got without I asked
   </p>
   <p>
    for a drink, hoping to get a sight of the well bottom, to complete my
   </p>
   <p>
    survey of the premises; but there, alas! are shallows and quicksands,
   </p>
   <p>
    and rope broken withal, and bucket irrecoverable. Meanwhile the right
   </p>
   <p>
    culinary vessel was selected, water was seemingly distilled, and after
   </p>
   <p>
    consultation and long delay passed out to the thirsty one,—not yet
   </p>
   <p>
    suffered to cool, not yet to settle. Such gruel sustains life here, I
   </p>
   <p>
    thought; so, shutting my eyes, and excluding the motes by a skilfully
   </p>
   <p>
    directed under-current, I drank to genuine hospitality the heartiest
   </p>
   <p>
    draught I could. I am not squeamish in such cases when manners are
   </p>
   <p>
    concerned.
   </p>
   <p>
    As I was leaving the Irishman’s roof after the rain, bending my steps
   </p>
   <p>
    again to the pond, my haste to catch pickerel, wading in retired
   </p>
   <p>
    meadows, in sloughs and bog-holes, in forlorn and savage places,
   </p>
   <p>
    appeared for an instant trivial to me who had been sent to school and
   </p>
   <p>
    college; but as I ran down the hill toward the reddening west, with the
   </p>
   <p>
    rainbow over my shoulder, and some faint tinkling sounds borne to my
   </p>
   <p>
    ear through the cleansed air, from I know not what quarter, my Good
   </p>
   <p>
    Genius seemed to say,—Go fish and hunt far and wide day by day,—farther
   </p>
   <p>
    and wider,—and rest thee by many brooks and hearth-sides without
   </p>
   <p>
    misgiving. Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth. Rise free
   </p>
   <p>
    from care before the dawn, and seek adventures. Let the noon find thee
   </p>
   <p>
    by other lakes, and the night overtake thee everywhere at home. There
   </p>
   <p>
    are no larger fields than these, no worthier games than may here be
   </p>
   <p>
    played. Grow wild according to thy nature, like these sedges and
   </p>
   <p>
    brakes, which will never become English hay. Let the thunder rumble;
   </p>
   <p>
    what if it threaten ruin to farmers’ crops? that is not its errand to
   </p>
   <p>
    thee. Take shelter under the cloud, while they flee to carts and sheds.
   </p>
   <p>
    Let not to get a living be thy trade, but thy sport. Enjoy the land,
   </p>
   <p>
    but own it not. Through want of enterprise and faith men are where they
   </p>
   <p>
    are, buying and selling, and spending their lives like serfs.
   </p>
   <p>
    O Baker Farm!
   </p>
   <p>
    “Landscape where the richest element
   </p>
   <p>
    Is a little sunshine innocent.” * *
   </p>
   <p>
    “No one runs to revel
   </p>
   <p>
    On thy rail-fenced lea.” * *
   </p>
   <p>
    “Debate with no man hast thou,
   </p>
   <p>
    With questions art never perplexed,
   </p>
   <p>
    As tame at the first sight as now,
   </p>
   <p>
    In thy plain russet gabardine dressed.” * *
   </p>
   <p>
    “Come ye who love,
   </p>
   <p>
    And ye who hate,
   </p>
   <p>
    Children of the Holy Dove,

   <p>
    And Guy Faux of the state,
   </p>
   <p>
    And hang conspiracies
   </p>
   <p>
    From the tough rafters of the trees!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Men come tamely home at night only from the next field or street, where
   </p>
   <p>
    their household echoes haunt, and their life pines because it breathes
   </p>
   <p>
    its own breath over again; their shadows morning and evening reach
   </p>
   <p>
    farther than their daily steps. We should come home from far, from
   </p>
   <p>
    adventures, and perils, and discoveries every day, with new experience
   </p>
   <p>
    and character.
   </p>
   <p>
    Before I had reached the pond some fresh impulse had brought out John
   </p>
   <p>
    Field, with altered mind, letting go “bogging” ere this sunset. But he,
   </p>
   <p>
    poor man, disturbed only a couple of fins while I was catching a fair
   </p>
   <p>
    string, and he said it was his luck; but when we changed seats in the
   </p>
   <p>
    boat luck changed seats too. Poor John Field!—I trust he does not read
   </p>
   <p>
    this, unless he will improve by it,—thinking to live by some derivative
   </p>
   <p>
    old country mode in this primitive new country,—to catch perch with
   </p>
   <p>
    shiners. It is good bait sometimes, I allow. With his horizon all his
   </p>
   <p>
    own, yet he a poor man, born to be poor, with his inherited Irish
   </p>
   <p>
    poverty or poor life, his Adam’s grandmother and boggy ways, not to
   </p>
   <p>
    rise in this world, he nor his posterity, till their wading webbed
   </p>
   <p>
    bog-trotting feet get _talaria_ to their heels.
   </p>
   <p>
    Higher Laws
   </p>
   <p>
    As I came home through the woods with my string of fish, trailing my
   </p>
   <p>
    pole, it being now quite dark, I caught a glimpse of a woodchuck
   </p>
   <p>
    stealing across my path, and felt a strange thrill of savage delight,
   </p>
   <p>
    and was strongly tempted to seize and devour him raw; not that I was
   </p>
   <p>
    hungry then, except for that wildness which he represented. Once or
   </p>
   <p>
    twice, however, while I lived at the pond, I found myself ranging the
   </p>
   <p>
    woods, like a half-starved hound, with a strange abandonment, seeking
   </p>
   <p>
    some kind of venison which I might devour, and no morsel could have
   </p>
   <p>
    been too savage for me. The wildest scenes had become unaccountably
   </p>
   <p>
    familiar. I found in myself, and still find, an instinct toward a
   </p>
   <p>
    higher, or, as it is named, spiritual life, as do most men, and another
   </p>
   <p>
    toward a primitive rank and savage one, and I reverence them both. I
   </p>
   <p>
    love the wild not less than the good. The wildness and adventure that
   </p>
   <p>
    are in fishing still recommended it to me. I like sometimes to take
   </p>
   <p>
    rank hold on life and spend my day more as the animals do. Perhaps I
   </p>
   <p>
    have owed to this employment and to hunting, when quite young, my
   </p>
   <p>
    closest acquaintance with Nature. They early introduce us to and detain
   </p>
   <p>
    us in scenery with which otherwise, at that age, we should have little
   </p>
   <p>
    acquaintance. Fishermen, hunters, woodchoppers, and others, spending
   </p>
   <p>
    their lives in the fields and woods, in a peculiar sense a part of
   </p>
   <p>
    Nature themselves, are often in a more favorable mood for observing
   </p>
   <p>
    her, in the intervals of their pursuits, than philosophers or poets
   </p>
   <p>
    even, who approach her with expectation. She is not afraid to exhibit
   </p>
   <p>
    herself to them. The traveller on the prairie is naturally a hunter, on
   </p>
   <p>
    the head waters of the Missouri and Columbia a trapper, and at the
   </p>
   <p>
    Falls of St. Mary a fisherman. He who is only a traveller learns things
   </p>
   <p>
    at second-hand and by the halves, and is poor authority. We are most
   </p>
   <p>
    interested when science reports what those men already know practically
   </p>
   <p>
    or instinctively, for that alone is a true _humanity_, or account of
   </p>
   <p>
    human experience.
   </p>
   <p>
    They mistake who assert that the Yankee has few amusements, because he
   </p>
   <p>
    has not so many public holidays, and men and boys do not play so many
   </p>
   <p>
    games as they do in England, for here the more primitive but solitary
   </p>
   <p>
    amusements of hunting fishing and the like have not yet given place to
   </p>
   <p>
    the former. Almost every New England boy among my contemporaries
   </p>
   <p>
    shouldered a fowling piece between the ages of ten and fourteen; and
   </p>
   <p>
    his hunting and fishing grounds were not limited, like the preserves of
   </p>
   <p>
    an English nobleman, but were more boundless even than those of a
   </p>
   <p>
    savage. No wonder, then, that he did not oftener stay to play on the
   </p>
   <p>
    common. But already a change is taking place, owing, not to an
   </p>
   <p>
    increased humanity, but to an increased scarcity of game, for perhaps
   </p>
   <p>
    the hunter is the greatest friend of the animals hunted, not excepting
   </p>
   <p>
    the Humane Society.
   </p>
   <p>
    Moreover, when at the pond, I wished sometimes to add fish to my fare
   </p>
   <p>
    for variety. I have actually fished from the same kind of necessity
   </p>
   <p>
    that the first fishers did. Whatever humanity I might conjure up
   </p>
   <p>
    against it was all factitious, and concerned my philosophy more than my
   </p>
   <p>
    feelings. I speak of fishing only now, for I had long felt differently
   </p>
   <p>
    about fowling, and sold my gun before I went to the woods. Not that I
   </p>
   <p>
    am less humane than others, but I did not perceive that my feelings
   </p>
   <p>
    were much affected. I did not pity the fishes nor the worms. This was
   </p>
   <p>
    habit. As for fowling, during the last years that I carried a gun my
   </p>
   <p>
    excuse was that I was studying ornithology, and sought only new or rare
   </p>
   <p>
    birds. But I confess that I am now inclined to think that there is a
   </p>
   <p>
    finer way of studying ornithology than this. It requires so much closer
   </p>
   <p>
    attention to the habits of the birds, that, if for that reason only, I
   </p>
   <p>
    have been willing to omit the gun. Yet notwithstanding the objection on
   </p>
   <p>
    the score of humanity, I am compelled to doubt if equally valuable
   </p>
   <p>
    sports are ever substituted for these; and when some of my friends have
   </p>
   <p>
    asked me anxiously about their boys, whether they should let them hunt,
   </p>
   <p>
    I have answered, yes,—remembering that it was one of the best parts of
   </p>
   <p>
    my education,—_make_ them hunters, though sportsmen only at first, if
   </p>
   <p>
    possible, mighty hunters at last, so that they shall not find game
   </p>
   <p>
    large enough for them in this or any vegetable wilderness,—hunters as
   </p>
   <p>
    well as fishers of men. Thus far I am of the opinion of Chaucer’s nun,
   </p>
   <p>
    who
   </p>
   <p>
    “yave not of the text a pulled hen
   </p>
   <p>
    That saith that hunters ben not holy men.”
   </p>
   <p>
    There is a period in the history of the individual, as of the race,
   </p>
   <p>
    when the hunters are the “best men,” as the Algonquins called them. We
   </p>
   <p>
    cannot but pity the boy who has never fired a gun; he is no more
   </p>
   <p>
    humane, while his education has been sadly neglected. This was my
   </p>
   <p>
    answer with respect to those youths who were bent on this pursuit,
   </p>
   <p>
    trusting that they would soon outgrow it. No humane being, past the
   </p>
   <p>
    thoughtless age of boyhood, will wantonly murder any creature which
   </p>
   <p>
    holds its life by the same tenure that he does. The hare in its
   </p>
   <p>
    extremity cries like a child. I warn you, mothers, that my sympathies
   </p>
   <p>
    do not always make the usual phil-_anthropic_ distinctions.
   </p>
   <p>
    Such is oftenest the young man’s introduction to the forest, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    most original part of himself. He goes thither at first as a hunter and
   </p>
   <p>
    fisher, until at last, if he has the seeds of a better life in him, he
   </p>
   <p>
    distinguishes his proper objects, as a poet or naturalist it may be,
   </p>
   <p>
    and leaves the gun and fish-pole behind. The mass of men are still and
   </p>
   <p>
    always young in this respect. In some countries a hunting parson is no
   </p>
   <p>
    uncommon sight. Such a one might make a good shepherd’s dog, but is far
   </p>
   <p>
    from being the Good Shepherd. I have been surprised to consider that
   </p>
   <p>
    the only obvious employment, except wood-chopping, ice-cutting, or the
   </p>
   <p>
    like business, which ever to my knowledge detained at Walden Pond for a
   </p>
   <p>
    whole half day any of my fellow-citizens, whether fathers or children
   </p>
   <p>
    of the town, with just one exception, was fishing. Commonly they did
   </p>
   <p>
    not think that they were lucky, or well paid for their time, unless
   </p>
   <p>
    they got a long string of fish, though they had the opportunity of
   </p>
   <p>
    seeing the pond all the while. They might go there a thousand times
   </p>
   <p>
    before the sediment of fishing would sink to the bottom and leave their
   </p>
   <p>
    purpose pure; but no doubt such a clarifying process would be going on
   </p>
   <p>
    all the while. The governor and his council faintly remember the pond,
   </p>
   <p>
    for they went a-fishing there when they were boys; but now they are too
   </p>
   <p>
    old and dignified to go a-fishing, and so they know it no more forever.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet even they expect to go to heaven at last. If the legislature
   </p>
   <p>
    regards it, it is chiefly to regulate the number of hooks to be used
   </p>
   <p>
    there; but they know nothing about the hook of hooks with which to
   </p>
   <p>
    angle for the pond itself, impaling the legislature for a bait. Thus,
   </p>
   <p>
    even in civilized communities, the embryo man passes through the hunter
   </p>
   <p>
    stage of development.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have found repeatedly, of late years, that I cannot fish without
   </p>
   <p>
    falling a little in self-respect. I have tried it again and again. I
   </p>
   <p>
    have skill at it, and, like many of my fellows, a certain instinct for
   </p>
   <p>
    it, which revives from time to time, but always when I have done I feel
   </p>
   <p>
    that it would have been better if I had not fished. I think that I do
   </p>
   <p>
    not mistake. It is a faint intimation, yet so are the first streaks of
   </p>
   <p>
    morning. There is unquestionably this instinct in me which belongs to
   </p>
   <p>
    the lower orders of creation; yet with every year I am less a
   </p>
   <p>
    fisherman, though without more humanity or even wisdom; at present I am
   </p>
   <p>
    no fisherman at all. But I see that if I were to live in a wilderness I
   </p>
   <p>
    should again be tempted to become a fisher and hunter in earnest.
   </p>
   <p>
    Beside, there is something essentially unclean about this diet and all
   </p>
   <p>
    flesh, and I began to see where housework commences, and whence the
   </p>
   <p>
    endeavor, which costs so much, to wear a tidy and respectable
   </p>
   <p>
    appearance each day, to keep the house sweet and free from all ill
   </p>
   <p>
    odors and sights. Having been my own butcher and scullion and cook, as
   </p>
   <p>
    well as the gentleman for whom the dishes were served up, I can speak
   </p>
   <p>
    from an unusually complete experience. The practical objection to
   </p>
   <p>
    animal food in my case was its uncleanness; and, besides, when I had
   </p>
   <p>
    caught and cleaned and cooked and eaten my fish, they seemed not to
   </p>
   <p>
    have fed me essentially. It was insignificant and unnecessary, and cost
   </p>
   <p>
    more than it came to. A little bread or a few potatoes would have done
   </p>
   <p>
    as well, with less trouble and filth. Like many of my contemporaries, I
   </p>
   <p>
    had rarely for many years used animal food, or tea, or coffee, &amp;c.; not
   </p>
   <p>
    so much because of any ill effects which I had traced to them, as
   </p>
   <p>
    because they were not agreeable to my imagination. The repugnance to
   </p>
   <p>
    animal food is not the effect of experience, but is an instinct. It
   </p>
   <p>
    appeared more beautiful to live low and fare hard in many respects; and
   </p>
   <p>
    though I never did so, I went far enough to please my imagination. I
   </p>
   <p>
    believe that every man who has ever been earnest to preserve his higher
   </p>
   <p>
    or poetic faculties in the best condition has been particularly
   </p>
   <p>
    inclined to abstain from animal food, and from much food of any kind.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is a significant fact, stated by entomologists, I find it in Kirby
   </p>
   <p>
    and Spence, that “some insects in their perfect state, though furnished
   </p>
   <p>
    with organs of feeding, make no use of them;” and they lay it down as
   </p>
   <p>
    “a general rule, that almost all insects in this state eat much less
   </p>
   <p>
    than in that of larvæ. The voracious caterpillar when transformed into
   </p>
   <p>
    a butterfly,” . . “and the gluttonous maggot when become a fly,”
   </p>
   <p>
    content themselves with a drop or two of honey or some other sweet
   </p>
   <p>
    liquid. The abdomen under the wings of the butterfly still represents
   </p>
   <p>
    the larva. This is the tid-bit which tempts his insectivorous fate. The
   </p>
   <p>
    gross feeder is a man in the larva state; and there are whole nations
   </p>
   <p>
    in that condition, nations without fancy or imagination, whose vast
   </p>
   <p>
    abdomens betray them.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is hard to provide and cook so simple and clean a diet as will not
   </p>
   <p>
    offend the imagination; but this, I think, is to be fed when we feed
   </p>
   <p>
    the body; they should both sit down at the same table. Yet perhaps this
   </p>
   <p>
    may be done. The fruits eaten temperately need not make us ashamed of
   </p>
   <p>
    our appetites, nor interrupt the worthiest pursuits. But put an extra
   </p>
   <p>
    condiment into your dish, and it will poison you. It is not worth the
   </p>
   <p>
    while to live by rich cookery. Most men would feel shame if caught
   </p>
   <p>
    preparing with their own hands precisely such a dinner, whether of
   </p>
   <p>
    animal or vegetable food, as is every day prepared for them by others.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet till this is otherwise we are not civilized, and, if gentlemen and
   </p>
   <p>
    ladies, are not true men and women. This certainly suggests what change
   </p>
   <p>
    is to be made. It may be vain to ask why the imagination will not be
   </p>
   <p>
    reconciled to flesh and fat. I am satisfied that it is not. Is it not a
   </p>
   <p>
    reproach that man is a carnivorous animal? True, he can and does live,
   </p>
   <p>
    in a great measure, by preying on other animals; but this is a
   </p>
   <p>
    miserable way,—as any one who will go to snaring rabbits, or
   </p>
   <p>
    slaughtering lambs, may learn,—and he will be regarded as a benefactor
   </p>
   <p>
    of his race who shall teach man to confine himself to a more innocent
   </p>
   <p>
    and wholesome diet. Whatever my own practice may be, I have no doubt
   </p>
   <p>
    that it is a part of the destiny of the human race, in its gradual
   </p>
   <p>
    improvement, to leave off eating animals, as surely as the savage
   </p>
   <p>
    tribes have left off eating each other when they came in contact with
   </p>
   <p>
    the more civilized.
   </p>
   <p>
    If one listens to the faintest but constant suggestions of his genius,
   </p>
   <p>
    which are certainly true, he sees not to what extremes, or even
   </p>
   <p>
    insanity, it may lead him; and yet that way, as he grows more resolute
   </p>
   <p>
    and faithful, his road lies. The faintest assured objection which one
   </p>
   <p>
    healthy man feels will at length prevail over the arguments and customs
   </p>
   <p>
    of mankind. No man ever followed his genius till it misled him. Though
   </p>
   <p>
    the result were bodily weakness, yet perhaps no one can say that the
   </p>
   <p>
    consequences were to be regretted, for these were a life in conformity
   </p>
   <p>
    to higher principles. If the day and the night are such that you greet
   </p>
   <p>
    them with joy, and life emits a fragrance like flowers and
   </p>
   <p>
    sweet-scented herbs, is more elastic, more starry, more immortal,—that
   </p>
   <p>
    is your success. All nature is your congratulation, and you have cause
   </p>
   <p>
    momentarily to bless yourself. The greatest gains and values are
   </p>
   <p>
    farthest from being appreciated. We easily come to doubt if they exist.
   </p>
   <p>
    We soon forget them. They are the highest reality. Perhaps the facts
   </p>
   <p>
    most astounding and most real are never communicated by man to man. The
   </p>
   <p>
    true harvest of my daily life is somewhat as intangible and
   </p>
   <p>
    indescribable as the tints of morning or evening. It is a little
   </p>
   <p>
    star-dust caught, a segment of the rainbow which I have clutched.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet, for my part, I was never unusually squeamish; I could sometimes
   </p>
   <p>
    eat a fried rat with a good relish, if it were necessary. I am glad to
   </p>
   <p>
    have drunk water so long, for the same reason that I prefer the natural
   </p>
   <p>
    sky to an opium-eater’s heaven. I would fain keep sober always; and
   </p>
   <p>
    there are infinite degrees of drunkenness. I believe that water is the
   </p>
   <p>
    only drink for a wise man; wine is not so noble a liquor; and think of
   </p>
   <p>
    dashing the hopes of a morning with a cup of warm coffee, or of an
   </p>
   <p>
    evening with a dish of tea! Ah, how low I fall when I am tempted by
   </p>
   <p>
    them! Even music may be intoxicating. Such apparently slight causes
   </p>
   <p>
    destroyed Greece and Rome, and will destroy England and America. Of all
   </p>
   <p>
    ebriosity, who does not prefer to be intoxicated by the air he
   </p>
   <p>
    breathes? I have found it to be the most serious objection to coarse
   </p>
   <p>
    labors long continued, that they compelled me to eat and drink coarsely
   </p>
   <p>
    also. But to tell the truth, I find myself at present somewhat less
   </p>
   <p>
    particular in these respects. I carry less religion to the table, ask
   </p>
   <p>
    no blessing; not because I am wiser than I was, but, I am obliged to
   </p>
   <p>
    confess, because, however much it is to be regretted, with years I have
   </p>
   <p>
    grown more coarse and indifferent. Perhaps these questions are
   </p>
   <p>
    entertained only in youth, as most believe of poetry. My practice is
   </p>
   <p>
    “nowhere,” my opinion is here. Nevertheless I am far from regarding
   </p>
   <p>
    myself as one of those privileged ones to whom the Ved refers when it
   </p>
   <p>
    says, that “he who has true faith in the Omnipresent Supreme Being may
   </p>
   <p>
    eat all that exists,” that is, is not bound to inquire what is his
   </p>
   <p>
    food, or who prepares it; and even in their case it is to be observed,
   </p>
   <p>
    as a Hindoo commentator has remarked, that the Vedant limits this
   </p>
   <p>
    privilege to “the time of distress.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Who has not sometimes derived an inexpressible satisfaction from his
   </p>
   <p>
    food in which appetite had no share? I have been thrilled to think that
   </p>
   <p>
    I owed a mental perception to the commonly gross sense of taste, that I
   </p>
   <p>
    have been inspired through the palate, that some berries which I had
   </p>
   <p>
    eaten on a hill-side had fed my genius. “The soul not being mistress of
   </p>
   <p>
    herself,” says Thseng-tseu, “one looks, and one does not see; one
   </p>
   <p>
    listens, and one does not hear; one eats, and one does not know the
   </p>
   <p>
    savor of food.” He who distinguishes the true savor of his food can
   </p>
   <p>
    never be a glutton; he who does not cannot be otherwise. A puritan may
   </p>
   <p>
    go to his brown-bread crust with as gross an appetite as ever an
   </p>
   <p>
    alderman to his turtle. Not that food which entereth into the mouth
   </p>
   <p>
    defileth a man, but the appetite with which it is eaten. It is neither
   </p>
   <p>
    the quality nor the quantity, but the devotion to sensual savors; when
   </p>
   <p>
    that which is eaten is not a viand to sustain our animal, or inspire
   </p>
   <p>
    our spiritual life, but food for the worms that possess us. If the
   </p>
   <p>
    hunter has a taste for mud-turtles, muskrats, and other such savage
   </p>
   <p>
    tid-bits, the fine lady indulges a taste for jelly made of a calf’s
   </p>
   <p>
    foot, or for sardines from over the sea, and they are even. He goes to
   </p>
   <p>
    the mill-pond, she to her preserve-pot. The wonder is how they, how you
   </p>
   <p>
    and I, can live this slimy, beastly life, eating and drinking.
   </p>
   <p>
    Our whole life is startlingly moral. There is never an instant’s truce
   </p>
   <p>
    between virtue and vice. Goodness is the only investment that never
   </p>
   <p>
    fails. In the music of the harp which trembles round the world it is
   </p>
   <p>
    the insisting on this which thrills us. The harp is the travelling
   </p>
   <p>
    patterer for the Universe’s Insurance Company, recommending its laws,
   </p>
   <p>
    and our little goodness is all the assessment that we pay. Though the
   </p>
   <p>
    youth at last grows indifferent, the laws of the universe are not
   </p>
   <p>
    indifferent, but are forever on the side of the most sensitive. Listen
   </p>
   <p>
    to every zephyr for some reproof, for it is surely there, and he is
   </p>
   <p>
    unfortunate who does not hear it. We cannot touch a string or move a
   </p>
   <p>
    stop but the charming moral transfixes us. Many an irksome noise, go a
   </p>
   <p>
    long way off, is heard as music, a proud sweet satire on the meanness
   </p>
   <p>
    of our lives.
   </p>
   <p>
    We are conscious of an animal in us, which awakens in proportion as our
   </p>
   <p>
    higher nature slumbers. It is reptile and sensual, and perhaps cannot
   </p>
   <p>
    be wholly expelled; like the worms which, even in life and health,
   </p>
   <p>
    occupy our bodies. Possibly we may withdraw from it, but never change
   </p>
   <p>
    its nature. I fear that it may enjoy a certain health of its own; that
   </p>
   <p>
    we may be well, yet not pure. The other day I picked up the lower jaw
   </p>
   <p>
    of a hog, with white and sound teeth and tusks, which suggested that
   </p>
   <p>
    there was an animal health and vigor distinct from the spiritual. This
   </p>
   <p>
    creature succeeded by other means than temperance and purity. “That in
   </p>
   <p>
    which men differ from brute beasts,” says Mencius, “is a thing very
   </p>
   <p>
    inconsiderable; the common herd lose it very soon; superior men
   </p>
   <p>
    preserve it carefully.” Who knows what sort of life would result if we
   </p>
   <p>
    had attained to purity? If I knew so wise a man as could teach me
   </p>
   <p>
    purity I would go to seek him forthwith. “A command over our passions,
   </p>
   <p>
    and over the external senses of the body, and good acts, are declared
   </p>
   <p>
    by the Ved to be indispensable in the mind’s approximation to God.” Yet
   </p>
   <p>
    the spirit can for the time pervade and control every member and
   </p>
   <p>
    function of the body, and transmute what in form is the grossest
   </p>
   <p>
    sensuality into purity and devotion. The generative energy, which, when
   </p>
   <p>
    we are loose, dissipates and makes us unclean, when we are continent
   </p>
   <p>
    invigorates and inspires us. Chastity is the flowering of man; and what
   </p>
   <p>
    are called Genius, Heroism, Holiness, and the like, are but various
   </p>
   <p>
    fruits which succeed it. Man flows at once to God when the channel of
   </p>
   <p>
    purity is open. By turns our purity inspires and our impurity casts us
   </p>
   <p>
    down. He is blessed who is assured that the animal is dying out in him
   </p>
   <p>
    day by day, and the divine being established. Perhaps there is none but
   </p>
   <p>
    has cause for shame on account of the inferior and brutish nature to
   </p>
   <p>
    which he is allied. I fear that we are such gods or demigods only as
   </p>
   <p>
    fauns and satyrs, the divine allied to beasts, the creatures of
   </p>
   <p>
    appetite, and that, to some extent, our very life is our disgrace.—
   </p>
   <p>
    “How happy’s he who hath due place assigned
   </p>
   <p>
    To his beasts and disafforested his mind!
   </p>
   <p>
    *    *    *    *    *
   </p>
   <p>
    Can use this horse, goat, wolf, and ev’ry beast,
   </p>
   <p>
    And is not ass himself to all the rest!
   </p>
   <p>
    Else man not only is the herd of swine,
   </p>
   <p>
    But he’s those devils too which did incline
   </p>
   <p>
    Them to a headlong rage, and made them worse.”
   </p>
   <p>
    All sensuality is one, though it takes many forms; all purity is one.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is the same whether a man eat, or drink, or cohabit, or sleep
   </p>
   <p>
    sensually. They are but one appetite, and we only need to see a person
   </p>
   <p>
    do any one of these things to know how great a sensualist he is. The
   </p>
   <p>
    impure can neither stand nor sit with purity. When the reptile is
   </p>
   <p>
    attacked at one mouth of his burrow, he shows himself at another. If
   </p>
   <p>
    you would be chaste, you must be temperate. What is chastity? How shall
   </p>
   <p>
    a man know if he is chaste? He shall not know it. We have heard of this
   </p>
   <p>
    virtue, but we know not what it is. We speak conformably to the rumor
   </p>
   <p>
    which we have heard. From exertion come wisdom and purity; from sloth
   </p>
   <p>
    ignorance and sensuality. In the student sensuality is a sluggish habit
   </p>
   <p>
    of mind. An unclean person is universally a slothful one, one who sits
   </p>
   <p>
    by a stove, whom the sun shines on prostrate, who reposes without being
   </p>
   <p>
    fatigued. If you would avoid uncleanness, and all the sins, work
   </p>
   <p>
    earnestly, though it be at cleaning a stable. Nature is hard to be
   </p>
   <p>
    overcome, but she must be overcome. What avails it that you are
   </p>
   <p>
    Christian, if you are not purer than the heathen, if you deny yourself
   </p>
   <p>
    no more, if you are not more religious? I know of many systems of
   </p>
   <p>
    religion esteemed heathenish whose precepts fill the reader with shame,
   </p>
   <p>
    and provoke him to new endeavors, though it be to the performance of
   </p>
   <p>
    rites merely.
   </p>
   <p>
    I hesitate to say these things, but it is not because of the subject,—I
   </p>
   <p>
    care not how obscene my _words_ are,—but because I cannot speak of them
   </p>
   <p>
    without betraying my impurity. We discourse freely without shame of one
   </p>
   <p>
    form of sensuality, and are silent about another. We are so degraded
   </p>
   <p>
    that we cannot speak simply of the necessary functions of human nature.
   </p>
   <p>
    In earlier ages, in some countries, every function was reverently
   </p>
   <p>
    spoken of and regulated by law. Nothing was too trivial for the Hindoo
   </p>
   <p>
    lawgiver, however offensive it may be to modern taste. He teaches how
   </p>
   <p>
    to eat, drink, cohabit, void excrement and urine, and the like,
   </p>
   <p>
    elevating what is mean, and does not falsely excuse himself by calling
   </p>
   <p>
    these things trifles.
   </p>
   <p>
    Every man is the builder of a temple, called his body, to the god he
   </p>
   <p>
    worships, after a style purely his own, nor can he get off by hammering
   </p>
   <p>
    marble instead. We are all sculptors and painters, and our material is
   </p>
   <p>
    our own flesh and blood and bones. Any nobleness begins at once to
   </p>
   <p>
    refine a man’s features, any meanness or sensuality to imbrute them.
   </p>
   <p>
    John Farmer sat at his door one September evening, after a hard day’s
   </p>
   <p>
    work, his mind still running on his labor more or less. Having bathed,
   </p>
   <p>
    he sat down to re-create his intellectual man. It was a rather cool
   </p>
   <p>
    evening, and some of his neighbors were apprehending a frost. He had
   </p>
   <p>
    not attended to the train of his thoughts long when he heard some one
   </p>
   <p>
    playing on a flute, and that sound harmonized with his mood. Still he
   </p>
   <p>
    thought of his work; but the burden of his thought was, that though
   </p>
   <p>
    this kept running in his head, and he found himself planning and
   </p>
   <p>
    contriving it against his will, yet it concerned him very little. It
   </p>
   <p>
    was no more than the scurf of his skin, which was constantly shuffled
   </p>
   <p>
    off. But the notes of the flute came home to his ears out of a
   </p>
   <p>
    different sphere from that he worked in, and suggested work for certain
   </p>
   <p>
    faculties which slumbered in him. They gently did away with the street,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the village, and the state in which he lived. A voice said to
   </p>
   <p>
    him,—Why do you stay here and live this mean moiling life, when a
   </p>
   <p>
    glorious existence is possible for you? Those same stars twinkle over
   </p>
   <p>
    other fields than these.—But how to come out of this condition and
   </p>
   <p>
    actually migrate thither? All that he could think of was to practise
   </p>
   <p>
    some new austerity, to let his mind descend into his body and redeem
   </p>
   <p>
    it, and treat himself with ever increasing respect.
   </p>
   <p>
    Brute Neighbors
   </p>
   <p>
    Sometimes I had a companion in my fishing, who came through the village
   </p>
   <p>
    to my house from the other side of the town, and the catching of the
   </p>
   <p>
    dinner was as much a social exercise as the eating of it.
   </p>
   <p>
    _Hermit._ I wonder what the world is doing now. I have not heard so
   </p>
   <p>
    much as a locust over the sweet-fern these three hours. The pigeons are
   </p>
   <p>
    all asleep upon their roosts,—no flutter from them. Was that a farmer’s
   </p>
   <p>
    noon horn which sounded from beyond the woods just now? The hands are
   </p>
   <p>
    coming in to boiled salt beef and cider and Indian bread. Why will men
   </p>
   <p>
    worry themselves so? He that does not eat need not work. I wonder how
   </p>
   <p>
    much they have reaped. Who would live there where a body can never
   </p>
   <p>
    think for the barking of Bose? And O, the housekeeping! to keep bright
   </p>
   <p>
    the devil’s door-knobs, and scour his tubs this bright day! Better not
   </p>
   <p>
    keep a house. Say, some hollow tree; and then for morning calls and
   </p>
   <p>
    dinner-parties! Only a woodpecker tapping. O, they swarm; the sun is
   </p>
   <p>
    too warm there; they are born too far into life for me. I have water
   </p>
   <p>
    from the spring, and a loaf of brown bread on the shelf.—Hark! I hear a
   </p>
   <p>
    rustling of the leaves. Is it some ill-fed village hound yielding to
   </p>
   <p>
    the instinct of the chase? or the lost pig which is said to be in these
   </p>
   <p>
    woods, whose tracks I saw after the rain? It comes on apace; my sumachs
   </p>
   <p>
    and sweet-briers tremble.—Eh, Mr. Poet, is it you? How do you like the
   </p>
   <p>
    world to-day?
   </p>
   <p>
    _Poet._ See those clouds; how they hang! That’s the greatest thing I
   </p>
   <p>
    have seen to-day. There’s nothing like it in old paintings, nothing
   </p>
   <p>
    like it in foreign lands,—unless when we were off the coast of Spain.
   </p>
   <p>
    That’s a true Mediterranean sky. I thought, as I have my living to get,
   </p>
   <p>
    and have not eaten to-day, that I might go a-fishing. That’s the true
   </p>
   <p>
    industry for poets. It is the only trade I have learned. Come, let’s
   </p>
   <p>
    along.
   </p>
   <p>
    _Hermit._ I cannot resist. My brown bread will soon be gone. I will go
   </p>
   <p>
    with you gladly soon, but I am just concluding a serious meditation. I
   </p>
   <p>
    think that I am near the end of it. Leave me alone, then, for a while.
   </p>
   <p>
    But that we may not be delayed, you shall be digging the bait
   </p>
   <p>
    meanwhile. Angle-worms are rarely to be met with in these parts, where
   </p>
   <p>
    the soil was never fattened with manure; the race is nearly extinct.
   </p>
   <p>
    The sport of digging the bait is nearly equal to that of catching the
   </p>
   <p>
    fish, when one’s appetite is not too keen; and this you may have all to
   </p>
   <p>
    yourself to-day. I would advise you to set in the spade down yonder
   </p>
   <p>
    among the ground-nuts, where you see the johnswort waving. I think that
   </p>
   <p>
    I may warrant you one worm to every three sods you turn up, if you look
   </p>
   <p>
    well in among the roots of the grass, as if you were weeding. Or, if
   </p>
   <p>
    you choose to go farther, it will not be unwise, for I have found the
   </p>
   <p>
    increase of fair bait to be very nearly as the squares of the
   </p>
   <p>
    distances.
   </p>
   <p>
    _Hermit alone._ Let me see; where was I? Methinks I was nearly in this
   </p>
   <p>
    frame of mind; the world lay about at this angle. Shall I go to heaven
   </p>
   <p>
    or a-fishing? If I should soon bring this meditation to an end, would
   </p>
   <p>
    another so sweet occasion be likely to offer? I was as near being
   </p>
   <p>
    resolved into the essence of things as ever I was in my life. I fear my
   </p>
   <p>
    thoughts will not come back to me. If it would do any good, I would
   </p>
   <p>
    whistle for them. When they make us an offer, is it wise to say, We
   </p>
   <p>
    will think of it? My thoughts have left no track, and I cannot find the
   </p>
   <p>
    path again. What was it that I was thinking of? It was a very hazy day.
   </p>
   <p>
    I will just try these three sentences of Con-fut-see; they may fetch
   </p>
   <p>
    that state about again. I know not whether it was the dumps or a
   </p>
   <p>
    budding ecstasy. Mem. There never is but one opportunity of a kind.
   </p>
   <p>
    _Poet._ How now, Hermit, is it too soon? I have got just thirteen whole
   </p>
   <p>
    ones, beside several which are imperfect or undersized; but they will
   </p>
   <p>
    do for the smaller fry; they do not cover up the hook so much. Those
   </p>
   <p>
    village worms are quite too large; a shiner may make a meal off one
   </p>
   <p>
    without finding the skewer.
   </p>
   <p>
    _Hermit._ Well, then, let’s be off. Shall we to the Concord? There’s
   </p>
   <p>
    good sport there if the water be not too high.
   </p>
   <p>
    Why do precisely these objects which we behold make a world? Why has
   </p>
   <p>
    man just these species of animals for his neighbors; as if nothing but
   </p>
   <p>
    a mouse could have filled this crevice? I suspect that Pilpay &amp; Co.
   </p>
   <p>
    have put animals to their best use, for they are all beasts of burden,
   </p>
   <p>
    in a sense, made to carry some portion of our thoughts.
   </p>
   <p>
    The mice which haunted my house were not the common ones, which are
   </p>
   <p>
    said to have been introduced into the country, but a wild native kind
   </p>
   <p>
    not found in the village. I sent one to a distinguished naturalist, and
   </p>
   <p>
    it interested him much. When I was building, one of these had its nest
   </p>
   <p>
    underneath the house, and before I had laid the second floor, and swept
   </p>
   <p>
    out the shavings, would come out regularly at lunch time and pick up
   </p>
   <p>
    the crumbs at my feet. It probably had never seen a man before; and it
   </p>
   <p>
    soon became quite familiar, and would run over my shoes and up my
   </p>
   <p>
    clothes. It could readily ascend the sides of the room by short
   </p>
   <p>
    impulses, like a squirrel, which it resembled in its motions. At
   </p>
   <p>
    length, as I leaned with my elbow on the bench one day, it ran up my
   </p>
   <p>
    clothes, and along my sleeve, and round and round the paper which held
   </p>
   <p>
    my dinner, while I kept the latter close, and dodged and played at
   </p>
   <p>
    bopeep with it; and when at last I held still a piece of cheese between
   </p>
   <p>
    my thumb and finger, it came and nibbled it, sitting in my hand, and
   </p>
   <p>
    afterward cleaned its face and paws, like a fly, and walked away.
   </p>
   <p>
    A phœbe soon built in my shed, and a robin for protection in a pine
   </p>
   <p>
    which grew against the house. In June the partridge (_Tetrao
   </p>
   <p>
    umbellus_,) which is so shy a bird, led her brood past my windows, from
   </p>
   <p>
    the woods in the rear to the front of my house, clucking and calling to
   </p>
   <p>
    them like a hen, and in all her behavior proving herself the hen of the
   </p>
   <p>
    woods. The young suddenly disperse on your approach, at a signal from
   </p>
   <p>
    the mother, as if a whirlwind had swept them away, and they so exactly
   </p>
   <p>
    resemble the dried leaves and twigs that many a traveler has placed his
   </p>
   <p>
    foot in the midst of a brood, and heard the whir of the old bird as she
   </p>
   <p>
    flew off, and her anxious calls and mewing, or seen her trail her wings
   </p>
   <p>
    to attract his attention, without suspecting their neighborhood. The
   </p>
   <p>
    parent will sometimes roll and spin round before you in such a
   </p>
   <p>
    dishabille, that you cannot, for a few moments, detect what kind of
   </p>
   <p>
    creature it is. The young squat still and flat, often running their
   </p>
   <p>
    heads under a leaf, and mind only their mother’s directions given from
   </p>
   <p>
    a distance, nor will your approach make them run again and betray
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves. You may even tread on them, or have your eyes on them for a
   </p>
   <p>
    minute, without discovering them. I have held them in my open hand at
   </p>
   <p>
    such a time, and still their only care, obedient to their mother and
   </p>
   <p>
    their instinct, was to squat there without fear or trembling. So
   </p>
   <p>
    perfect is this instinct, that once, when I had laid them on the leaves
   </p>
   <p>
    again, and one accidentally fell on its side, it was found with the
   </p>
   <p>
    rest in exactly the same position ten minutes afterward. They are not
   </p>
   <p>
    callow like the young of most birds, but more perfectly developed and
   </p>
   <p>
    precocious even than chickens. The remarkably adult yet innocent
   </p>
   <p>
    expression of their open and serene eyes is very memorable. All
   </p>
   <p>
    intelligence seems reflected in them. They suggest not merely the
   </p>
   <p>
    purity of infancy, but a wisdom clarified by experience. Such an eye
   </p>
   <p>
    was not born when the bird was, but is coeval with the sky it reflects.
   </p>
   <p>
    The woods do not yield another such a gem. The traveller does not often
   </p>
   <p>
    look into such a limpid well. The ignorant or reckless sportsman often
   </p>
   <p>
    shoots the parent at such a time, and leaves these innocents to fall a
   </p>
   <p>
    prey to some prowling beast or bird, or gradually mingle with the
   </p>
   <p>
    decaying leaves which they so much resemble. It is said that when
   </p>
   <p>
    hatched by a hen they will directly disperse on some alarm, and so are
   </p>
   <p>
    lost, for they never hear the mother’s call which gathers them again.
   </p>
   <p>
    These were my hens and chickens.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is remarkable how many creatures live wild and free though secret in
   </p>
   <p>
    the woods, and still sustain themselves in the neighborhood of towns,
   </p>
   <p>
    suspected by hunters only. How retired the otter manages to live here!
   </p>
   <p>
    He grows to be four feet long, as big as a small boy, perhaps without
   </p>
   <p>
    any human being getting a glimpse of him. I formerly saw the raccoon in
   </p>
   <p>
    the woods behind where my house is built, and probably still heard
   </p>
   <p>
    their whinnering at night. Commonly I rested an hour or two in the
   </p>
   <p>
    shade at noon, after planting, and ate my lunch, and read a little by a
   </p>
   <p>
    spring which was the source of a swamp and of a brook, oozing from
   </p>
   <p>
    under Brister’s Hill, half a mile from my field. The approach to this
   </p>
   <p>
    was through a succession of descending grassy hollows, full of young
   </p>
   <p>
    pitch-pines, into a larger wood about the swamp. There, in a very
   </p>
   <p>
    secluded and shaded spot, under a spreading white-pine, there was yet a
   </p>
   <p>
    clean, firm sward to sit on. I had dug out the spring and made a well
   </p>
   <p>
    of clear gray water, where I could dip up a pailful without roiling it,
   </p>
   <p>
    and thither I went for this purpose almost every day in midsummer, when
   </p>
   <p>
    the pond was warmest. Thither, too, the wood-cock led her brood, to
   </p>
   <p>
    probe the mud for worms, flying but a foot above them down the bank,
   </p>
   <p>
    while they ran in a troop beneath; but at last, spying me, she would
   </p>
   <p>
    leave her young and circle round and round me, nearer and nearer till
   </p>
   <p>
    within four or five feet, pretending broken wings and legs, to attract
   </p>
   <p>
    my attention, and get off her young, who would already have taken up
   </p>
   <p>
    their march, with faint wiry peep, single file through the swamp, as
   </p>
   <p>
    she directed. Or I heard the peep of the young when I could not see the
   </p>
   <p>
    parent bird. There too the turtle-doves sat over the spring, or
   </p>
   <p>
    fluttered from bough to bough of the soft white-pines over my head; or
   </p>
   <p>
    the red squirrel, coursing down the nearest bough, was particularly
   </p>
   <p>
    familiar and inquisitive. You only need sit still long enough in some
   </p>
   <p>
    attractive spot in the woods that all its inhabitants may exhibit
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves to you by turns.
   </p>
   <p>
    I was witness to events of a less peaceful character. One day when I
   </p>
   <p>
    went out to my wood-pile, or rather my pile of stumps, I observed two
   </p>
   <p>
    large ants, the one red, the other much larger, nearly half an inch
   </p>
   <p>
    long, and black, fiercely contending with one another. Having once got
   </p>
   <p>
    hold they never let go, but struggled and wrestled and rolled on the
   </p>
   <p>
    chips incessantly. Looking farther, I was surprised to find that the
   </p>
   <p>
    chips were covered with such combatants, that it was not a _duellum_,
   </p>
   <p>
    but a _bellum_, a war between two races of ants, the red always pitted
   </p>
   <p>
    against the black, and frequently two red ones to one black. The
   </p>
   <p>
    legions of these Myrmidons covered all the hills and vales in my
   </p>
   <p>
    wood-yard, and the ground was already strewn with the dead and dying,
   </p>
   <p>
    both red and black. It was the only battle which I have ever witnessed,
   </p>
   <p>
    the only battle-field I ever trod while the battle was raging;
   </p>
   <p>
    internecine war; the red republicans on the one hand, and the black
   </p>
   <p>
    imperialists on the other. On every side they were engaged in deadly
   </p>
   <p>
    combat, yet without any noise that I could hear, and human soldiers
   </p>
   <p>
    never fought so resolutely. I watched a couple that were fast locked in
   </p>
   <p>
    each other’s embraces, in a little sunny valley amid the chips, now at
   </p>
   <p>
    noon-day prepared to fight till the sun went down, or life went out.
   </p>
   <p>
    The smaller red champion had fastened himself like a vice to his
   </p>
   <p>
    adversary’s front, and through all the tumblings on that field never
   </p>
   <p>
    for an instant ceased to gnaw at one of his feelers near the root,
   </p>
   <p>
    having already caused the other to go by the board; while the stronger
   </p>
   <p>
    black one dashed him from side to side, and, as I saw on looking
   </p>
   <p>
    nearer, had already divested him of several of his members. They fought
   </p>
   <p>
    with more pertinacity than bull-dogs. Neither manifested the least
   </p>
   <p>
    disposition to retreat. It was evident that their battle-cry was
   </p>
   <p>
    Conquer or die. In the mean while there came along a single red ant on
   </p>
   <p>
    the hill-side of this valley, evidently full of excitement, who either
   </p>
   <p>
    had despatched his foe, or had not yet taken part in the battle;
   </p>
   <p>
    probably the latter, for he had lost none of his limbs; whose mother
   </p>
   <p>
    had charged him to return with his shield or upon it. Or perchance he
   </p>
   <p>
    was some Achilles, who had nourished his wrath apart, and had now come
   </p>
   <p>
    to avenge or rescue his Patroclus. He saw this unequal combat from
   </p>
   <p>
    afar,—for the blacks were nearly twice the size of the red,—he drew
   </p>
   <p>
    near with rapid pace till he stood on his guard within half an inch of
   </p>
   <p>
    the combatants; then, watching his opportunity, he sprang upon the
   </p>
   <p>
    black warrior, and commenced his operations near the root of his right
   </p>
   <p>
    fore-leg, leaving the foe to select among his own members; and so there
   </p>
   <p>
    were three united for life, as if a new kind of attraction had been
   </p>
   <p>
    invented which put all other locks and cements to shame. I should not
   </p>
   <p>
    have wondered by this time to find that they had their respective
   </p>
   <p>
    musical bands stationed on some eminent chip, and playing their
   </p>
   <p>
    national airs the while, to excite the slow and cheer the dying
   </p>
   <p>
    combatants. I was myself excited somewhat even as if they had been men.
   </p>
   <p>
    The more you think of it, the less the difference. And certainly there
   </p>
   <p>
    is not the fight recorded in Concord history, at least, if in the
   </p>
   <p>
    history of America, that will bear a moment’s comparison with this,
   </p>
   <p>
    whether for the numbers engaged in it, or for the patriotism and
   </p>
   <p>
    heroism displayed. For numbers and for carnage it was an Austerlitz or
   </p>
   <p>
    Dresden. Concord Fight! Two killed on the patriots’ side, and Luther
   </p>
   <p>
    Blanchard wounded! Why here every ant was a Buttrick,—“Fire! for God’s
   </p>
   <p>
    sake fire!”—and thousands shared the fate of Davis and Hosmer. There
   </p>
   <p>
    was not one hireling there. I have no doubt that it was a principle
   </p>
   <p>
    they fought for, as much as our ancestors, and not to avoid a
   </p>
   <p>
    three-penny tax on their tea; and the results of this battle will be as
   </p>
   <p>
    important and memorable to those whom it concerns as those of the
   </p>
   <p>
    battle of Bunker Hill, at least.
   </p>
   <p>
    I took up the chip on which the three I have particularly described
   </p>
   <p>
    were struggling, carried it into my house, and placed it under a
   </p>
   <p>
    tumbler on my window-sill, in order to see the issue. Holding a
   </p>
   <p>
    microscope to the first-mentioned red ant, I saw that, though he was
   </p>
   <p>
    assiduously gnawing at the near fore-leg of his enemy, having severed
   </p>
   <p>
    his remaining feeler, his own breast was all torn away, exposing what
   </p>
   <p>
    vitals he had there to the jaws of the black warrior, whose breastplate
   </p>
   <p>
    was apparently too thick for him to pierce; and the dark carbuncles of
   </p>
   <p>
    the sufferer’s eyes shone with ferocity such as war only could excite.
   </p>
   <p>
    They struggled half an hour longer under the tumbler, and when I looked
   </p>
   <p>
    again the black soldier had severed the heads of his foes from their
   </p>
   <p>
    bodies, and the still living heads were hanging on either side of him
   </p>
   <p>
    like ghastly trophies at his saddle-bow, still apparently as firmly
   </p>
   <p>
    fastened as ever, and he was endeavoring with feeble struggles, being
   </p>
   <p>
    without feelers and with only the remnant of a leg, and I know not how
   </p>
   <p>
    many other wounds, to divest himself of them; which at length, after
   </p>
   <p>
    half an hour more, he accomplished. I raised the glass, and he went off
   </p>
   <p>
    over the window-sill in that crippled state. Whether he finally
   </p>
   <p>
    survived that combat, and spent the remainder of his days in some Hotel
   </p>
   <p>
    des Invalides, I do not know; but I thought that his industry would not
   </p>
   <p>
    be worth much thereafter. I never learned which party was victorious,
   </p>
   <p>
    nor the cause of the war; but I felt for the rest of that day as if I
   </p>
   <p>
    had had my feelings excited and harrowed by witnessing the struggle,
   </p>
   <p>
    the ferocity and carnage, of a human battle before my door.
   </p>
   <p>
    Kirby and Spence tell us that the battles of ants have long been
   </p>
   <p>
    celebrated and the date of them recorded, though they say that Huber is
   </p>
   <p>
    the only modern author who appears to have witnessed them. “Æneas
   </p>
   <p>
    Sylvius,” say they, “after giving a very circumstantial account of one
   </p>
   <p>
    contested with great obstinacy by a great and small species on the
   </p>
   <p>
    trunk of a pear tree,” adds that “‘This action was fought in the
   </p>
   <p>
    pontificate of Eugenius the Fourth, in the presence of Nicholas
   </p>
   <p>
    Pistoriensis, an eminent lawyer, who related the whole history of the
   </p>
   <p>
    battle with the greatest fidelity.’ A similar engagement between great
   </p>
   <p>
    and small ants is recorded by Olaus Magnus, in which the small ones,
   </p>
   <p>
    being victorious, are said to have buried the bodies of their own
   </p>
   <p>
    soldiers, but left those of their giant enemies a prey to the birds.
   </p>
   <p>
    This event happened previous to the expulsion of the tyrant Christiern
   </p>
   <p>
    the Second from Sweden.” The battle which I witnessed took place in the
   </p>
   <p>
    Presidency of Polk, five years before the passage of Webster’s
   </p>
   <p>
    Fugitive-Slave Bill.
   </p>
   <p>
    Many a village Bose, fit only to course a mud-turtle in a victualling
   </p>
   <p>
    cellar, sported his heavy quarters in the woods, without the knowledge
   </p>
   <p>
    of his master, and ineffectually smelled at old fox burrows and
   </p>
   <p>
    woodchucks’ holes; led perchance by some slight cur which nimbly
   </p>
   <p>
    threaded the wood, and might still inspire a natural terror in its
   </p>
   <p>
    denizens;—now far behind his guide, barking like a canine bull toward
   </p>
   <p>
    some small squirrel which had treed itself for scrutiny, then,
   </p>
   <p>
    cantering off, bending the bushes with his weight, imagining that he is
   </p>
   <p>
    on the track of some stray member of the jerbilla family. Once I was
   </p>
   <p>
    surprised to see a cat walking along the stony shore of the pond, for
   </p>
   <p>
    they rarely wander so far from home. The surprise was mutual.
   </p>
   <p>
    Nevertheless the most domestic cat, which has lain on a rug all her
   </p>
   <p>
    days, appears quite at home in the woods, and, by her sly and stealthy
   </p>
   <p>
    behavior, proves herself more native there than the regular
   </p>
   <p>
    inhabitants. Once, when berrying, I met with a cat with young kittens
   </p>
   <p>
    in the woods, quite wild, and they all, like their mother, had their
   </p>
   <p>
    backs up and were fiercely spitting at me. A few years before I lived
   </p>
   <p>
    in the woods there was what was called a “winged cat” in one of the
   </p>
   <p>
    farm-houses in Lincoln nearest the pond, Mr. Gilian Baker’s. When I
   </p>
   <p>
    called to see her in June, 1842, she was gone a-hunting in the woods,
   </p>
   <p>
    as was her wont, (I am not sure whether it was a male or female, and so
   </p>
   <p>
    use the more common pronoun,) but her mistress told me that she came
   </p>
   <p>
    into the neighborhood a little more than a year before, in April, and
   </p>
   <p>
    was finally taken into their house; that she was of a dark
   </p>
   <p>
    brownish-gray color, with a white spot on her throat, and white feet,
   </p>
   <p>
    and had a large bushy tail like a fox; that in the winter the fur grew
   </p>
   <p>
    thick and flatted out along her sides, forming stripes ten or twelve
   </p>
   <p>
    inches long by two and a half wide, and under her chin like a muff, the
   </p>
   <p>
    upper side loose, the under matted like felt, and in the spring these
   </p>
   <p>
    appendages dropped off. They gave me a pair of her “wings,” which I
   </p>
   <p>
    keep still. There is no appearance of a membrane about them. Some
   </p>
   <p>
    thought it was part flying-squirrel or some other wild animal, which is
   </p>
   <p>
    not impossible, for, according to naturalists, prolific hybrids have
   </p>
   <p>
    been produced by the union of the marten and domestic cat. This would
   </p>
   <p>
    have been the right kind of cat for me to keep, if I had kept any; for
   </p>
   <p>
    why should not a poet’s cat be winged as well as his horse?
   </p>
   <p>
    In the fall the loon (_Colymbus glacialis_) came, as usual, to moult
   </p>
   <p>
    and bathe in the pond, making the woods ring with his wild laughter
   </p>
   <p>
    before I had risen. At rumor of his arrival all the Mill-dam sportsmen
   </p>
   <p>
    are on the alert, in gigs and on foot, two by two and three by three,
   </p>
   <p>
    with patent rifles and conical balls and spy-glasses. They come
   </p>
   <p>
    rustling through the woods like autumn leaves, at least ten men to one
   </p>
   <p>
    loon. Some station themselves on this side of the pond, some on that,
   </p>
   <p>
    for the poor bird cannot be omnipresent; if he dive here he must come
   </p>
   <p>
    up there. But now the kind October wind rises, rustling the leaves and
   </p>
   <p>
    rippling the surface of the water, so that no loon can be heard or
   </p>
   <p>
    seen, though his foes sweep the pond with spy-glasses, and make the
   </p>
   <p>
    woods resound with their discharges. The waves generously rise and dash
   </p>
   <p>
    angrily, taking sides with all water-fowl, and our sportsmen must beat
   </p>
   <p>
    a retreat to town and shop and unfinished jobs. But they were too often
   </p>
   <p>
    successful. When I went to get a pail of water early in the morning I
   </p>
   <p>
    frequently saw this stately bird sailing out of my cove within a few
   </p>
   <p>
    rods. If I endeavored to overtake him in a boat, in order to see how he
   </p>
   <p>
    would manœuvre, he would dive and be completely lost, so that I did not
   </p>
   <p>
    discover him again, sometimes, till the latter part of the day. But I
   </p>
   <p>
    was more than a match for him on the surface. He commonly went off in a
   </p>
   <p>
    rain.
   </p>
   <p>
    As I was paddling along the north shore one very calm October
   </p>
   <p>
    afternoon, for such days especially they settle on to the lakes, like
   </p>
   <p>
    the milkweed down, having looked in vain over the pond for a loon,
   </p>
   <p>
    suddenly one, sailing out from the shore toward the middle a few rods
   </p>
   <p>
    in front of me, set up his wild laugh and betrayed himself. I pursued
   </p>
   <p>
    with a paddle and he dived, but when he came up I was nearer than
   </p>
   <p>
    before. He dived again, but I miscalculated the direction he would
   </p>
   <p>
    take, and we were fifty rods apart when he came to the surface this
   </p>
   <p>
    time, for I had helped to widen the interval; and again he laughed long
   </p>
   <p>
    and loud, and with more reason than before. He manœuvred so cunningly
   </p>
   <p>
    that I could not get within half a dozen rods of him. Each time, when
   </p>
   <p>
    he came to the surface, turning his head this way and that, he cooly
   </p>
   <p>
    surveyed the water and the land, and apparently chose his course so
   </p>
   <p>
    that he might come up where there was the widest expanse of water and
   </p>
   <p>
    at the greatest distance from the boat. It was surprising how quickly
   </p>
   <p>
    he made up his mind and put his resolve into execution. He led me at
   </p>
   <p>
    once to the widest part of the pond, and could not be driven from it.
   </p>
   <p>
    While he was thinking one thing in his brain, I was endeavoring to
   </p>
   <p>
    divine his thought in mine. It was a pretty game, played on the smooth
   </p>
   <p>
    surface of the pond, a man against a loon. Suddenly your adversary’s
   </p>
   <p>
    checker disappears beneath the board, and the problem is to place yours
   </p>
   <p>
    nearest to where his will appear again. Sometimes he would come up
   </p>
   <p>
    unexpectedly on the opposite side of me, having apparently passed
   </p>
   <p>
    directly under the boat. So long-winded was he and so unweariable, that
   </p>
   <p>
    when he had swum farthest he would immediately plunge again,
   </p>
   <p>
    nevertheless; and then no wit could divine where in the deep pond,
   </p>
   <p>
    beneath the smooth surface, he might be speeding his way like a fish,
   </p>
   <p>
    for he had time and ability to visit the bottom of the pond in its
   </p>
   <p>
    deepest part. It is said that loons have been caught in the New York
   </p>
   <p>
    lakes eighty feet beneath the surface, with hooks set for trout,—though
   </p>
   <p>
    Walden is deeper than that. How surprised must the fishes be to see
   </p>
   <p>
    this ungainly visitor from another sphere speeding his way amid their
   </p>
   <p>
    schools! Yet he appeared to know his course as surely under water as on
   </p>
   <p>
    the surface, and swam much faster there. Once or twice I saw a ripple
   </p>
   <p>
    where he approached the surface, just put his head out to reconnoitre,
   </p>
   <p>
    and instantly dived again. I found that it was as well for me to rest
   </p>
   <p>
    on my oars and wait his reappearing as to endeavor to calculate where
   </p>
   <p>
    he would rise; for again and again, when I was straining my eyes over
   </p>
   <p>
    the surface one way, I would suddenly be startled by his unearthly
   </p>
   <p>
    laugh behind me. But why, after displaying so much cunning, did he
   </p>
   <p>
    invariably betray himself the moment he came up by that loud laugh? Did
   </p>
   <p>
    not his white breast enough betray him? He was indeed a silly loon, I
   </p>
   <p>
    thought. I could commonly hear the splash of the water when he came up,
   </p>
   <p>
    and so also detected him. But after an hour he seemed as fresh as ever,
   </p>
   <p>
    dived as willingly and swam yet farther than at first. It was
   </p>
   <p>
    surprising to see how serenely he sailed off with unruffled breast when
   </p>
   <p>
    he came to the surface, doing all the work with his webbed feet
   </p>
   <p>
    beneath. His usual note was this demoniac laughter, yet somewhat like
   </p>
   <p>
    that of a water-fowl; but occasionally, when he had balked me most
   </p>
   <p>
    successfully and come up a long way off, he uttered a long-drawn
   </p>
   <p>
    unearthly howl, probably more like that of a wolf than any bird; as
   </p>
   <p>
    when a beast puts his muzzle to the ground and deliberately howls. This
   </p>
   <p>
    was his looning,—perhaps the wildest sound that is ever heard here,
   </p>
   <p>
    making the woods ring far and wide. I concluded that he laughed in
   </p>
   <p>
    derision of my efforts, confident of his own resources. Though the sky
   </p>
   <p>
    was by this time overcast, the pond was so smooth that I could see
   </p>
   <p>
    where he broke the surface when I did not hear him. His white breast,
   </p>
   <p>
    the stillness of the air, and the smoothness of the water were all
   </p>
   <p>
    against him. At length, having come up fifty rods off, he uttered one
   </p>
   <p>
    of those prolonged howls, as if calling on the god of loons to aid him,
   </p>
   <p>
    and immediately there came a wind from the east and rippled the
   </p>
   <p>
    surface, and filled the whole air with misty rain, and I was impressed
   </p>
   <p>
    as if it were the prayer of the loon answered, and his god was angry
   </p>
   <p>
    with me; and so I left him disappearing far away on the tumultuous
   </p>
   <p>
    surface.
   </p>
   <p>
    For hours, in fall days, I watched the ducks cunningly tack and veer
   </p>
   <p>
    and hold the middle of the pond, far from the sportsman; tricks which
   </p>
   <p>
    they will have less need to practise in Louisiana bayous. When
   </p>
   <p>
    compelled to rise they would sometimes circle round and round and over
   </p>
   <p>
    the pond at a considerable height, from which they could easily see to
   </p>
   <p>
    other ponds and the river, like black motes in the sky; and, when I
   </p>
   <p>
    thought they had gone off thither long since, they would settle down by
   </p>
   <p>
    a slanting flight of a quarter of a mile on to a distant part which was
   </p>
   <p>
    left free; but what beside safety they got by sailing in the middle of
   </p>
   <p>
    Walden I do not know, unless they love its water for the same reason
   </p>
   <p>
    that I do.
   </p>
   <p>
    House-Warming
   </p>
   <p>
    In October I went a-graping to the river meadows, and loaded myself
   </p>
   <p>
    with clusters more precious for their beauty and fragrance than for
   </p>
   <p>
    food. There too I admired, though I did not gather, the cranberries,
   </p>
   <p>
    small waxen gems, pendants of the meadow grass, pearly and red, which
   </p>
   <p>
    the farmer plucks with an ugly rake, leaving the smooth meadow in a
   </p>
   <p>
    snarl, heedlessly measuring them by the bushel and the dollar only, and
   </p>
   <p>
    sells the spoils of the meads to Boston and New York; destined to be
   </p>
   <p>
    _jammed_, to satisfy the tastes of lovers of Nature there. So butchers
   </p>
   <p>
    rake the tongues of bison out of the prairie grass, regardless of the
   </p>
   <p>
    torn and drooping plant. The barberry’s brilliant fruit was likewise
   </p>
   <p>
    food for my eyes merely; but I collected a small store of wild apples
   </p>
   <p>
    for coddling, which the proprietor and travellers had overlooked. When
   </p>
   <p>
    chestnuts were ripe I laid up half a bushel for winter. It was very
   </p>
   <p>
    exciting at that season to roam the then boundless chestnut woods of
   </p>
   <p>
    Lincoln,—they now sleep their long sleep under the railroad,—with a bag
   </p>
   <p>
    on my shoulder, and a stick to open burrs with in my hand, for I did
   </p>
   <p>
    not always wait for the frost, amid the rustling of leaves and the loud
   </p>
   <p>
    reproofs of the red-squirrels and the jays, whose half-consumed nuts I
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes stole, for the burrs which they had selected were sure to
   </p>
   <p>
    contain sound ones. Occasionally I climbed and shook the trees. They
   </p>
   <p>
    grew also behind my house, and one large tree, which almost
   </p>
   <p>
    overshadowed it, was, when in flower, a bouquet which scented the whole
   </p>
   <p>
    neighborhood, but the squirrels and the jays got most of its fruit; the
   </p>
   <p>
    last coming in flocks early in the morning and picking the nuts out of
   </p>
   <p>
    the burrs before they fell. I relinquished these trees to them and
   </p>
   <p>
    visited the more distant woods composed wholly of chestnut. These nuts,
   </p>
   <p>
    as far as they went, were a good substitute for bread. Many other
   </p>
   <p>
    substitutes might, perhaps, be found. Digging one day for fish-worms, I
   </p>
   <p>
    discovered the ground-nut (_Apios tuberosa_) on its string, the potato
   </p>
   <p>
    of the aborigines, a sort of fabulous fruit, which I had begun to doubt
   </p>
   <p>
    if I had ever dug and eaten in childhood, as I had told, and had not
   </p>
   <p>
    dreamed it. I had often since seen its crimpled red velvety blossom
   </p>
   <p>
    supported by the stems of other plants without knowing it to be the
   </p>
   <p>
    same. Cultivation has well nigh exterminated it. It has a sweetish
   </p>
   <p>
    taste, much like that of a frostbitten potato, and I found it better
   </p>
   <p>
    boiled than roasted. This tuber seemed like a faint promise of Nature
   </p>
   <p>
    to rear her own children and feed them simply here at some future
   </p>
   <p>
    period. In these days of fatted cattle and waving grain-fields this
   </p>
   <p>
    humble root, which was once the _totem_ of an Indian tribe, is quite
   </p>
   <p>
    forgotten, or known only by its flowering vine; but let wild Nature
   </p>
   <p>
    reign here once more, and the tender and luxurious English grains will
   </p>
   <p>
    probably disappear before a myriad of foes, and without the care of man
   </p>
   <p>
    the crow may carry back even the last seed of corn to the great
   </p>
   <p>
    cornfield of the Indian’s God in the south-west, whence he is said to
   </p>
   <p>
    have brought it; but the now almost exterminated ground-nut will
   </p>
   <p>
    perhaps revive and flourish in spite of frosts and wildness, prove
   </p>
   <p>
    itself indigenous, and resume its ancient importance and dignity as the
   </p>
   <p>
    diet of the hunter tribe. Some Indian Ceres or Minerva must have been
   </p>
   <p>
    the inventor and bestower of it; and when the reign of poetry commences
   </p>
   <p>
    here, its leaves and string of nuts may be represented on our works of
   </p>
   <p>
    art.
   </p>
   <p>
    Already, by the first of September, I had seen two or three small
   </p>
   <p>
    maples turned scarlet across the pond, beneath where the white stems of
   </p>
   <p>
    three aspens diverged, at the point of a promontory, next the water.
   </p>
   <p>
    Ah, many a tale their color told! And gradually from week to week the
   </p>
   <p>
    character of each tree came out, and it admired itself reflected in the
   </p>
   <p>
    smooth mirror of the lake. Each morning the manager of this gallery
   </p>
   <p>
    substituted some new picture, distinguished by more brilliant or
   </p>
   <p>
    harmonious coloring, for the old upon the walls.
   </p>
   <p>
    The wasps came by thousands to my lodge in October, as to winter
   </p>
   <p>
    quarters, and settled on my windows within and on the walls over-head,
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes deterring visitors from entering. Each morning, when they
   </p>
   <p>
    were numbed with cold, I swept some of them out, but I did not trouble
   </p>
   <p>
    myself much to get rid of them; I even felt complimented by their
   </p>
   <p>
    regarding my house as a desirable shelter. They never molested me
   </p>
   <p>
    seriously, though they bedded with me; and they gradually disappeared,
   </p>
   <p>
    into what crevices I do not know, avoiding winter and unspeakable cold.
   </p>
   <p>
    Like the wasps, before I finally went into winter quarters in November,
   </p>
   <p>
    I used to resort to the north-east side of Walden, which the sun,
   </p>
   <p>
    reflected from the pitch-pine woods and the stony shore, made the
   </p>
   <p>
    fire-side of the pond; it is so much pleasanter and wholesomer to be
   </p>
   <p>
    warmed by the sun while you can be, than by an artificial fire. I thus
   </p>
   <p>
    warmed myself by the still glowing embers which the summer, like a
   </p>
   <p>
    departed hunter, had left.
   </p>
   <p>
    When I came to build my chimney I studied masonry. My bricks being
   </p>
   <p>
    second-hand ones required to be cleaned with a trowel, so that I
   </p>
   <p>
    learned more than usual of the qualities of bricks and trowels. The
   </p>
   <p>
    mortar on them was fifty years old, and was said to be still growing
   </p>
   <p>
    harder; but this is one of those sayings which men love to repeat
   </p>
   <p>
    whether they are true or not. Such sayings themselves grow harder and
   </p>
   <p>
    adhere more firmly with age, and it would take many blows with a trowel
   </p>
   <p>
    to clean an old wiseacre of them. Many of the villages of Mesopotamia
   </p>
   <p>
    are built of second-hand bricks of a very good quality, obtained from
   </p>
   <p>
    the ruins of Babylon, and the cement on them is older and probably
   </p>
   <p>
    harder still. However that may be, I was struck by the peculiar
   </p>
   <p>
    toughness of the steel which bore so many violent blows without being
   </p>
   <p>
    worn out. As my bricks had been in a chimney before, though I did not
   </p>
   <p>
    read the name of Nebuchadnezzar on them, I picked out as many
   </p>
   <p>
    fire-place bricks as I could find, to save work and waste, and I filled
   </p>
   <p>
    the spaces between the bricks about the fire-place with stones from the
   </p>
   <p>
    pond shore, and also made my mortar with the white sand from the same
   </p>
   <p>
    place. I lingered most about the fireplace, as the most vital part of
   </p>
   <p>
    the house. Indeed, I worked so deliberately, that though I commenced at
   </p>
   <p>
    the ground in the morning, a course of bricks raised a few inches above
   </p>
   <p>
    the floor served for my pillow at night; yet I did not get a stiff neck
   </p>
   <p>
    for it that I remember; my stiff neck is of older date. I took a poet
   </p>
   <p>
    to board for a fortnight about those times, which caused me to be put
   </p>
   <p>
    to it for room. He brought his own knife, though I had two, and we used
   </p>
   <p>
    to scour them by thrusting them into the earth. He shared with me the
   </p>
   <p>
    labors of cooking. I was pleased to see my work rising so square and
   </p>
   <p>
    solid by degrees, and reflected, that, if it proceeded slowly, it was
   </p>
   <p>
    calculated to endure a long time. The chimney is to some extent an
   </p>
   <p>
    independent structure, standing on the ground and rising through the
   </p>
   <p>
    house to the heavens; even after the house is burned it still stands
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes, and its importance and independence are apparent. This was
   </p>
   <p>
    toward the end of summer. It was now November.
   </p>
   <p>
    The north wind had already begun to cool the pond, though it took many
   </p>
   <p>
    weeks of steady blowing to accomplish it, it is so deep. When I began
   </p>
   <p>
    to have a fire at evening, before I plastered my house, the chimney
   </p>
   <p>
    carried smoke particularly well, because of the numerous chinks between
   </p>
   <p>
    the boards. Yet I passed some cheerful evenings in that cool and airy
   </p>
   <p>
    apartment, surrounded by the rough brown boards full of knots, and
   </p>
   <p>
    rafters with the bark on high overhead. My house never pleased my eye
   </p>
   <p>
    so much after it was plastered, though I was obliged to confess that it
   </p>
   <p>
    was more comfortable. Should not every apartment in which man dwells be
   </p>
   <p>
    lofty enough to create some obscurity over-head, where flickering
   </p>
   <p>
    shadows may play at evening about the rafters? These forms are more
   </p>
   <p>
    agreeable to the fancy and imagination than fresco paintings or other
   </p>
   <p>
    the most expensive furniture. I now first began to inhabit my house, I
   </p>
   <p>
    may say, when I began to use it for warmth as well as shelter. I had
   </p>
   <p>
    got a couple of old fire-dogs to keep the wood from the hearth, and it
   </p>
   <p>
    did me good to see the soot form on the back of the chimney which I had
   </p>
   <p>
    built, and I poked the fire with more right and more satisfaction than
   </p>
   <p>
    usual. My dwelling was small, and I could hardly entertain an echo in
   </p>
   <p>
    it; but it seemed larger for being a single apartment and remote from
   </p>
   <p>
    neighbors. All the attractions of a house were concentrated in one
   </p>
   <p>
    room; it was kitchen, chamber, parlor, and keeping-room; and whatever
   </p>
   <p>
    satisfaction parent or child, master or servant, derive from living in
   </p>
   <p>
    a house, I enjoyed it all. Cato says, the master of a family
   </p>
   <p>
    (_patremfamilias_) must have in his rustic villa “cellam oleariam,
   </p>
   <p>
    vinariam, dolia multa, uti lubeat caritatem expectare, et rei, et
   </p>
   <p>
    virtuti, et gloriæ erit,” that is, “an oil and wine cellar, many casks,
   </p>
   <p>
    so that it may be pleasant to expect hard times; it will be for his
   </p>
   <p>
    advantage, and virtue, and glory.” I had in my cellar a firkin of
   </p>
   <p>
    potatoes, about two quarts of peas with the weevil in them, and on my
   </p>
   <p>
    shelf a little rice, a jug of molasses, and of rye and Indian meal a
   </p>
   <p>
    peck each.
   </p>
   <p>
    I sometimes dream of a larger and more populous house, standing in a
   </p>
   <p>
    golden age, of enduring materials, and without ginger-bread work, which
   </p>
   <p>
    shall still consist of only one room, a vast, rude, substantial,
   </p>
   <p>
    primitive hall, without ceiling or plastering, with bare rafters and
   </p>
   <p>
    purlins supporting a sort of lower heaven over one’s head,—useful to
   </p>
   <p>
    keep off rain and snow; where the king and queen posts stand out to
   </p>
   <p>
    receive your homage, when you have done reverence to the prostrate
   </p>
   <p>
    Saturn of an older dynasty on stepping over the sill; a cavernous
   </p>
   <p>
    house, wherein you must reach up a torch upon a pole to see the roof;
   </p>
   <p>
    where some may live in the fire-place, some in the recess of a window,
   </p>
   <p>
    and some on settles, some at one end of the hall, some at another, and
   </p>
   <p>
    some aloft on rafters with the spiders, if they choose; a house which
   </p>
   <p>
    you have got into when you have opened the outside door, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    ceremony is over; where the weary traveller may wash, and eat, and
   </p>
   <p>
    converse, and sleep, without further journey; such a shelter as you
   </p>
   <p>
    would be glad to reach in a tempestuous night, containing all the
   </p>
   <p>
    essentials of a house, and nothing for house-keeping; where you can see
   </p>
   <p>
    all the treasures of the house at one view, and every thing hangs upon
   </p>
   <p>
    its peg, that a man should use; at once kitchen, pantry, parlor,
   </p>
   <p>
    chamber, store-house, and garret; where you can see so necessary a
   </p>
   <p>
    thing as a barrel or a ladder, so convenient a thing as a cupboard, and
   </p>
   <p>
    hear the pot boil, and pay your respects to the fire that cooks your
   </p>
   <p>
    dinner and the oven that bakes your bread, and the necessary furniture
   </p>
   <p>
    and utensils are the chief ornaments; where the washing is not put out,
   </p>
   <p>
    nor the fire, nor the mistress, and perhaps you are sometimes requested
   </p>
   <p>
    to move from off the trap-door, when the cook would descend into the
   </p>
   <p>
    cellar, and so learn whether the ground is solid or hollow beneath you
   </p>
   <p>
    without stamping. A house whose inside is as open and manifest as a
   </p>
   <p>
    bird’s nest, and you cannot go in at the front door and out at the back
   </p>
   <p>
    without seeing some of its inhabitants; where to be a guest is to be
   </p>
   <p>
    presented with the freedom of the house, and not to be carefully
   </p>
   <p>
    excluded from seven eighths of it, shut up in a particular cell, and
   </p>
   <p>
    told to make yourself at home there,—in solitary confinement. Nowadays
   </p>
   <p>
    the host does not admit you to _his_ hearth, but has got the mason to
   </p>
   <p>
    build one for yourself somewhere in his alley, and hospitality is the
   </p>
   <p>
    art of _keeping_ you at the greatest distance. There is as much secrecy
   </p>
   <p>
    about the cooking as if he had a design to poison you. I am aware that
   </p>
   <p>
    I have been on many a man’s premises, and might have been legally
   </p>
   <p>
    ordered off, but I am not aware that I have been in many men’s houses.
   </p>
   <p>
    I might visit in my old clothes a king and queen who lived simply in
   </p>
   <p>
    such a house as I have described, if I were going their way; but
   </p>
   <p>
    backing out of a modern palace will be all that I shall desire to
   </p>
   <p>
    learn, if ever I am caught in one.
   </p>
   <p>
    It would seem as if the very language of our parlors would lose all its
   </p>
   <p>
    nerve and degenerate into _palaver_ wholly, our lives pass at such
   </p>
   <p>
    remoteness from its symbols, and its metaphors and tropes are
   </p>
   <p>
    necessarily so far fetched, through slides and dumb-waiters, as it
   </p>
   <p>
    were; in other words, the parlor is so far from the kitchen and
   </p>
   <p>
    workshop. The dinner even is only the parable of a dinner, commonly. As
   </p>
   <p>
    if only the savage dwelt near enough to Nature and Truth to borrow a
   </p>
   <p>
    trope from them. How can the scholar, who dwells away in the North West
   </p>
   <p>
    Territory or the Isle of Man, tell what is parliamentary in the
   </p>
   <p>
    kitchen?
   </p>
   <p>
    However, only one or two of my guests were ever bold enough to stay and
   </p>
   <p>
    eat a hasty-pudding with me; but when they saw that crisis approaching
   </p>
   <p>
    they beat a hasty retreat rather, as if it would shake the house to its
   </p>
   <p>
    foundations. Nevertheless, it stood through a great many
   </p>
   <p>
    hasty-puddings.
   </p>
   <p>
    I did not plaster till it was freezing weather. I brought over some
   </p>
   <p>
    whiter and cleaner sand for this purpose from the opposite shore of the
   </p>
   <p>
    pond in a boat, a sort of conveyance which would have tempted me to go
   </p>
   <p>
    much farther if necessary. My house had in the mean while been shingled
   </p>
   <p>
    down to the ground on every side. In lathing I was pleased to be able
   </p>
   <p>
    to send home each nail with a single blow of the hammer, and it was my
   </p>
   <p>
    ambition to transfer the plaster from the board to the wall neatly and
   </p>
   <p>
    rapidly. I remembered the story of a conceited fellow, who, in fine
   </p>
   <p>
    clothes, was wont to lounge about the village once, giving advice to
   </p>
   <p>
    workmen. Venturing one day to substitute deeds for words, he turned up
   </p>
   <p>
    his cuffs, seized a plasterer’s board, and having loaded his trowel
   </p>
   <p>
    without mishap, with a complacent look toward the lathing overhead,
   </p>
   <p>
    made a bold gesture thitherward; and straightway, to his complete
   </p>
   <p>
    discomfiture, received the whole contents in his ruffled bosom. I
   </p>
   <p>
    admired anew the economy and convenience of plastering, which so
   </p>
   <p>
    effectually shuts out the cold and takes a handsome finish, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    learned the various casualties to which the plasterer is liable. I was
   </p>
   <p>
    surprised to see how thirsty the bricks were which drank up all the
   </p>
   <p>
    moisture in my plaster before I had smoothed it, and how many pailfuls
   </p>
   <p>
    of water it takes to christen a new hearth. I had the previous winter
   </p>
   <p>
    made a small quantity of lime by burning the shells of the _Unio
   </p>
   <p>
    fluviatilis_, which our river affords, for the sake of the experiment;
   </p>
   <p>
    so that I knew where my materials came from. I might have got good
   </p>
   <p>
    limestone within a mile or two and burned it myself, if I had cared to
   </p>
   <p>
    do so.
   </p>
   <p>
    The pond had in the mean while skimmed over in the shadiest and
   </p>
   <p>
    shallowest coves, some days or even weeks before the general freezing.
   </p>
   <p>
    The first ice is especially interesting and perfect, being hard, dark,
   </p>
   <p>
    and transparent, and affords the best opportunity that ever offers for
   </p>
   <p>
    examining the bottom where it is shallow; for you can lie at your
   </p>
   <p>
    length on ice only an inch thick, like a skater insect on the surface
   </p>
   <p>
    of the water, and study the bottom at your leisure, only two or three
   </p>
   <p>
    inches distant, like a picture behind a glass, and the water is
   </p>
   <p>
    necessarily always smooth then. There are many furrows in the sand
   </p>
   <p>
    where some creature has travelled about and doubled on its tracks; and,
   </p>
   <p>
    for wrecks, it is strewn with the cases of cadis worms made of minute
   </p>
   <p>
    grains of white quartz. Perhaps these have creased it, for you find
   </p>
   <p>
    some of their cases in the furrows, though they are deep and broad for
   </p>
   <p>
    them to make. But the ice itself is the object of most interest, though
   </p>
   <p>
    you must improve the earliest opportunity to study it. If you examine
   </p>
   <p>
    it closely the morning after it freezes, you find that the greater part
   </p>
   <p>
    of the bubbles, which at first appeared to be within it, are against
   </p>
   <p>
    its under surface, and that more are continually rising from the
   </p>
   <p>
    bottom; while the ice is as yet comparatively solid and dark, that is,
   </p>
   <p>
    you see the water through it. These bubbles are from an eightieth to an
   </p>
   <p>
    eighth of an inch in diameter, very clear and beautiful, and you see
   </p>
   <p>
    your face reflected in them through the ice. There may be thirty or
   </p>
   <p>
    forty of them to a square inch. There are also already within the ice
   </p>
   <p>
    narrow oblong perpendicular bubbles about half an inch long, sharp
   </p>
   <p>
    cones with the apex upward; or oftener, if the ice is quite fresh,
   </p>
   <p>
    minute spherical bubbles one directly above another, like a string of
   </p>
   <p>
    beads. But these within the ice are not so numerous nor obvious as
   </p>
   <p>
    those beneath. I sometimes used to cast on stones to try the strength
   </p>
   <p>
    of the ice, and those which broke through carried in air with them,
   </p>
   <p>
    which formed very large and conspicuous white bubbles beneath. One day
   </p>
   <p>
    when I came to the same place forty-eight hours afterward, I found that
   </p>
   <p>
    those large bubbles were still perfect, though an inch more of ice had
   </p>
   <p>
    formed, as I could see distinctly by the seam in the edge of a cake.
   </p>
   <p>
    But as the last two days had been very warm, like an Indian summer, the
   </p>
   <p>
    ice was not now transparent, showing the dark green color of the water,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the bottom, but opaque and whitish or gray, and though twice as
   </p>
   <p>
    thick was hardly stronger than before, for the air bubbles had greatly
   </p>
   <p>
    expanded under this heat and run together, and lost their regularity;
   </p>
   <p>
    they were no longer one directly over another, but often like silvery
   </p>
   <p>
    coins poured from a bag, one overlapping another, or in thin flakes, as
   </p>
   <p>
    if occupying slight cleavages. The beauty of the ice was gone, and it
   </p>
   <p>
    was too late to study the bottom. Being curious to know what position
   </p>
   <p>
    my great bubbles occupied with regard to the new ice, I broke out a
   </p>
   <p>
    cake containing a middling sized one, and turned it bottom upward. The
   </p>
   <p>
    new ice had formed around and under the bubble, so that it was included
   </p>
   <p>
    between the two ices. It was wholly in the lower ice, but close against
   </p>
   <p>
    the upper, and was flattish, or perhaps slightly lenticular, with a
   </p>
   <p>
    rounded edge, a quarter of an inch deep by four inches in diameter; and
   </p>
   <p>
    I was surprised to find that directly under the bubble the ice was
   </p>
   <p>
    melted with great regularity in the form of a saucer reversed, to the
   </p>
   <p>
    height of five eighths of an inch in the middle, leaving a thin
   </p>
   <p>
    partition there between the water and the bubble, hardly an eighth of
   </p>
   <p>
    an inch thick; and in many places the small bubbles in this partition
   </p>
   <p>
    had burst out downward, and probably there was no ice at all under the
   </p>
   <p>
    largest bubbles, which were a foot in diameter. I inferred that the
   </p>
   <p>
    infinite number of minute bubbles which I had first seen against the
   </p>
   <p>
    under surface of the ice were now frozen in likewise, and that each, in
   </p>
   <p>
    its degree, had operated like a burning glass on the ice beneath to
   </p>
   <p>
    melt and rot it. These are the little air-guns which contribute to make
   </p>
   <p>
    the ice crack and whoop.
   </p>
   <p>
    At length the winter set in in good earnest, just as I had finished
   </p>
   <p>
    plastering, and the wind began to howl around the house as if it had
   </p>
   <p>
    not had permission to do so till then. Night after night the geese came
   </p>
   <p>
    lumbering in in the dark with a clangor and a whistling of wings, even
   </p>
   <p>
    after the ground was covered with snow, some to alight in Walden, and
   </p>
   <p>
    some flying low over the woods toward Fair Haven, bound for Mexico.
   </p>
   <p>
    Several times, when returning from the village at ten or eleven o’clock
   </p>
   <p>
    at night, I heard the tread of a flock of geese, or else ducks, on the
   </p>
   <p>
    dry leaves in the woods by a pond-hole behind my dwelling, where they
   </p>
   <p>
    had come up to feed, and the faint honk or quack of their leader as
   </p>
   <p>
    they hurried off. In 1845 Walden froze entirely over for the first time
   </p>
   <p>
    on the night of the 22d of December, Flint’s and other shallower ponds
   </p>
   <p>
    and the river having been frozen ten days or more; in ’46, the 16th; in
   </p>
   <p>
    ’49, about the 31st; and in ’50, about the 27th of December; in ’52,
   </p>
   <p>
    the 5th of January; in ’53, the 31st of December. The snow had already
   </p>
   <p>
    covered the ground since the 25th of November, and surrounded me
   </p>
   <p>
    suddenly with the scenery of winter. I withdrew yet farther into my
   </p>
   <p>
    shell, and endeavored to keep a bright fire both within my house and
   </p>
   <p>
    within my breast. My employment out of doors now was to collect the
   </p>
   <p>
    dead wood in the forest, bringing it in my hands or on my shoulders, or
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes trailing a dead pine tree under each arm to my shed. An old
   </p>
   <p>
    forest fence which had seen its best days was a great haul for me. I
   </p>
   <p>
    sacrificed it to Vulcan, for it was past serving the god Terminus. How
   </p>
   <p>
    much more interesting an event is that man’s supper who has just been
   </p>
   <p>
    forth in the snow to hunt, nay, you might say, steal, the fuel to cook
   </p>
   <p>
    it with! His bread and meat are sweet. There are enough fagots and
   </p>
   <p>
    waste wood of all kinds in the forests of most of our towns to support
   </p>
   <p>
    many fires, but which at present warm none, and, some think, hinder the
   </p>
   <p>
    growth of the young wood. There was also the drift-wood of the pond. In
   </p>
   <p>
    the course of the summer I had discovered a raft of pitch-pine logs
   </p>
   <p>
    with the bark on, pinned together by the Irish when the railroad was
   </p>
   <p>
    built. This I hauled up partly on the shore. After soaking two years
   </p>
   <p>
    and then lying high six months it was perfectly sound, though
   </p>
   <p>
    waterlogged past drying. I amused myself one winter day with sliding
   </p>
   <p>
    this piecemeal across the pond, nearly half a mile, skating behind with
   </p>
   <p>
    one end of a log fifteen feet long on my shoulder, and the other on the
   </p>
   <p>
    ice; or I tied several logs together with a birch withe, and then, with
   </p>
   <p>
    a longer birch or alder which had a hook at the end, dragged them
   </p>
   <p>
    across. Though completely waterlogged and almost as heavy as lead, they
   </p>
   <p>
    not only burned long, but made a very hot fire; nay, I thought that
   </p>
   <p>
    they burned better for the soaking, as if the pitch, being confined by
   </p>
   <p>
    the water, burned longer, as in a lamp.
   </p>
   <p>
    Gilpin, in his account of the forest borderers of England, says that
   </p>
   <p>
    “the encroachments of trespassers, and the houses and fences thus
   </p>
   <p>
    raised on the borders of the forest,” were “considered as great
   </p>
   <p>
    nuisances by the old forest law, and were severely punished under the
   </p>
   <p>
    name of _purprestures_, as tending _ad terrorem ferarum—ad nocumentum
   </p>
   <p>
    forestæ_, &amp;c.,” to the frightening of the game and the detriment of the
   </p>
   <p>
    forest. But I was interested in the preservation of the venison and the
   </p>
   <p>
    vert more than the hunters or woodchoppers, and as much as though I had
   </p>
   <p>
    been the Lord Warden himself; and if any part was burned, though I
   </p>
   <p>
    burned it myself by accident, I grieved with a grief that lasted longer
   </p>
   <p>
    and was more inconsolable than that of the proprietors; nay, I grieved
   </p>
   <p>
    when it was cut down by the proprietors themselves. I would that our
   </p>
   <p>
    farmers when they cut down a forest felt some of that awe which the old
   </p>
   <p>
    Romans did when they came to thin, or let in the light to, a
   </p>
   <p>
    consecrated grove (_lucum conlucare_), that is, would believe that it
   </p>
   <p>
    is sacred to some god. The Roman made an expiatory offering, and
   </p>
   <p>
    prayed, Whatever god or goddess thou art to whom this grove is sacred,
   </p>
   <p>
    be propitious to me, my family, and children, &amp;c.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is remarkable what a value is still put upon wood even in this age
   </p>
   <p>
    and in this new country, a value more permanent and universal than that
   </p>
   <p>
    of gold. After all our discoveries and inventions no man will go by a
   </p>
   <p>
    pile of wood. It is as precious to us as it was to our Saxon and Norman
   </p>
   <p>
    ancestors. If they made their bows of it, we make our gun-stocks of it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Michaux, more than thirty years ago, says that the price of wood for
   </p>
   <p>
    fuel in New York and Philadelphia “nearly equals, and sometimes
   </p>
   <p>
    exceeds, that of the best wood in Paris, though this immense capital
   </p>
   <p>
    annually requires more than three hundred thousand cords, and is
   </p>
   <p>
    surrounded to the distance of three hundred miles by cultivated
   </p>
   <p>
    plains.” In this town the price of wood rises almost steadily, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    only question is, how much higher it is to be this year than it was the
   </p>
   <p>
    last. Mechanics and tradesmen who come in person to the forest on no
   </p>
   <p>
    other errand, are sure to attend the wood auction, and even pay a high
   </p>
   <p>
    price for the privilege of gleaning after the woodchopper. It is now
   </p>
   <p>
    many years that men have resorted to the forest for fuel and the
   </p>
   <p>
    materials of the arts; the New Englander and the New Hollander, the
   </p>
   <p>
    Parisian and the Celt, the farmer and Robinhood, Goody Blake and Harry
   </p>
   <p>
    Gill, in most parts of the world the prince and the peasant, the
   </p>
   <p>
    scholar and the savage, equally require still a few sticks from the
   </p>
   <p>
    forest to warm them and cook their food. Neither could I do without
   </p>
   <p>
    them.
   </p>
   <p>
    Every man looks at his wood-pile with a kind of affection. I love to
   </p>
   <p>
    have mine before my window, and the more chips the better to remind me
   </p>
   <p>
    of my pleasing work. I had an old axe which nobody claimed, with which
   </p>
   <p>
    by spells in winter days, on the sunny side of the house, I played
   </p>
   <p>
    about the stumps which I had got out of my bean-field. As my driver
   </p>
   <p>
    prophesied when I was ploughing, they warmed me twice, once while I was
   </p>
   <p>
    splitting them, and again when they were on the fire, so that no fuel
   </p>
   <p>
    could give out more heat. As for the axe, I was advised to get the
   </p>
   <p>
    village blacksmith to “jump” it; but I jumped him, and, putting a
   </p>
   <p>
    hickory helve from the woods into it, made it do. If it was dull, it
   </p>
   <p>
    was at least hung true.
   </p>
   <p>
    A few pieces of fat pine were a great treasure. It is interesting to
   </p>
   <p>
    remember how much of this food for fire is still concealed in the
   </p>
   <p>
    bowels of the earth. In previous years I had often gone “prospecting”
   </p>
   <p>
    over some bare hill-side, where a pitch-pine wood had formerly stood,
   </p>
   <p>
    and got out the fat pine roots. They are almost indestructible. Stumps
   </p>
   <p>
    thirty or forty years old, at least, will still be sound at the core,
   </p>
   <p>
    though the sapwood has all become vegetable mould, as appears by the
   </p>
   <p>
    scales of the thick bark forming a ring level with the earth four or
   </p>
   <p>
    five inches distant from the heart. With axe and shovel you explore
   </p>
   <p>
    this mine, and follow the marrowy store, yellow as beef tallow, or as
   </p>
   <p>
    if you had struck on a vein of gold, deep into the earth. But commonly
   </p>
   <p>
    I kindled my fire with the dry leaves of the forest, which I had stored
   </p>
   <p>
    up in my shed before the snow came. Green hickory finely split makes
   </p>
   <p>
    the woodchopper’s kindlings, when he has a camp in the woods. Once in a
   </p>
   <p>
    while I got a little of this. When the villagers were lighting their
   </p>
   <p>
    fires beyond the horizon, I too gave notice to the various wild
   </p>
   <p>
    inhabitants of Walden vale, by a smoky streamer from my chimney, that I
   </p>
   <p>
    was awake.—
   </p>
   <p>
    Light-winged Smoke, Icarian bird,
   </p>
   <p>
    Melting thy pinions in thy upward flight,
   </p>
   <p>
    Lark without song, and messenger of dawn,
   </p>
   <p>
    Circling above the hamlets as thy nest;
   </p>
   <p>
    Or else, departing dream, and shadowy form
   </p>
   <p>
    Of midnight vision, gathering up thy skirts;
   </p>
   <p>
    By night star-veiling, and by day
   </p>
   <p>
    Darkening the light and blotting out the sun;
   </p>
   <p>
    Go thou my incense upward from this hearth,
   </p>
   <p>
    And ask the gods to pardon this clear flame.
   </p>
   <p>
    Hard green wood just cut, though I used but little of that, answered my
   </p>
   <p>
    purpose better than any other. I sometimes left a good fire when I went
   </p>
   <p>
    to take a walk in a winter afternoon; and when I returned, three or
   </p>
   <p>
    four hours afterward, it would be still alive and glowing. My house was
   </p>
   <p>
    not empty though I was gone. It was as if I had left a cheerful
   </p>
   <p>
    housekeeper behind. It was I and Fire that lived there; and commonly my
   </p>
   <p>
    housekeeper proved trustworthy. One day, however, as I was splitting
   </p>
   <p>
    wood, I thought that I would just look in at the window and see if the
   </p>
   <p>
    house was not on fire; it was the only time I remember to have been
   </p>
   <p>
    particularly anxious on this score; so I looked and saw that a spark
   </p>
   <p>
    had caught my bed, and I went in and extinguished it when it had burned
   </p>
   <p>
    a place as big as my hand. But my house occupied so sunny and sheltered
   </p>
   <p>
    a position, and its roof was so low, that I could afford to let the
   </p>
   <p>
    fire go out in the middle of almost any winter day.
   </p>
   <p>
    The moles nested in my cellar, nibbling every third potato, and making
   </p>
   <p>
    a snug bed even there of some hair left after plastering and of brown
   </p>
   <p>
    paper; for even the wildest animals love comfort and warmth as well as
   </p>
   <p>
    man, and they survive the winter only because they are so careful to
   </p>
   <p>
    secure them. Some of my friends spoke as if I was coming to the woods
   </p>
   <p>
    on purpose to freeze myself. The animal merely makes a bed, which he
   </p>
   <p>
    warms with his body, in a sheltered place; but man, having discovered
   </p>
   <p>
    fire, boxes up some air in a spacious apartment, and warms that,
   </p>
   <p>
    instead of robbing himself, makes that his bed, in which he can move
   </p>
   <p>
    about divested of more cumbrous clothing, maintain a kind of summer in
   </p>
   <p>
    the midst of winter, and by means of windows even admit the light, and
   </p>
   <p>
    with a lamp lengthen out the day. Thus he goes a step or two beyond
   </p>
   <p>
    instinct, and saves a little time for the fine arts. Though, when I had
   </p>
   <p>
    been exposed to the rudest blasts a long time, my whole body began to
   </p>
   <p>
    grow torpid, when I reached the genial atmosphere of my house I soon
   </p>
   <p>
    recovered my faculties and prolonged my life. But the most luxuriously
   </p>
   <p>
    housed has little to boast of in this respect, nor need we trouble
   </p>
   <p>
    ourselves to speculate how the human race may be at last destroyed. It
   </p>
   <p>
    would be easy to cut their threads any time with a little sharper blast
   </p>
   <p>
    from the north. We go on dating from Cold Fridays and Great Snows; but
   </p>
   <p>
    a little colder Friday, or greater snow, would put a period to man’s
   </p>
   <p>
    existence on the globe.
   </p>
   <p>
    The next winter I used a small cooking-stove for economy, since I did
   </p>
   <p>
    not own the forest; but it did not keep fire so well as the open
   </p>
   <p>
    fire-place. Cooking was then, for the most part, no longer a poetic,
   </p>
   <p>
    but merely a chemic process. It will soon be forgotten, in these days
   </p>
   <p>
    of stoves, that we used to roast potatoes in the ashes, after the
   </p>
   <p>
    Indian fashion. The stove not only took up room and scented the house,
   </p>
   <p>
    but it concealed the fire, and I felt as if I had lost a companion. You
   </p>
   <p>
    can always see a face in the fire. The laborer, looking into it at
   </p>
   <p>
    evening, purifies his thoughts of the dross and earthiness which they
   </p>
   <p>
    have accumulated during the day. But I could no longer sit and look
   </p>
   <p>
    into the fire, and the pertinent words of a poet recurred to me with
   </p>
   <p>
    new force.—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Never, bright flame, may be denied to me
   </p>
   <p>
    Thy dear, life imaging, close sympathy.
   </p>
   <p>
    What but my hopes shot upward e’er so bright?
   </p>
   <p>
    What but my fortunes sunk so low in night?
   </p>
   <p>
    Why art thou banished from our hearth and hall,
   </p>
   <p>
    Thou who art welcomed and beloved by all?
   </p>
   <p>
    Was thy existence then too fanciful
   </p>
   <p>
    For our life’s common light, who are so dull?
   </p>
   <p>
    Did thy bright gleam mysterious converse hold
   </p>
   <p>
    With our congenial souls? secrets too bold?
   </p>
   <p>
    Well, we are safe and strong, for now we sit
   </p>
   <p>
    Beside a hearth where no dim shadows flit,
   </p>
   <p>
    Where nothing cheers nor saddens, but a fire
   </p>
   <p>
    Warms feet and hands—nor does to more aspire;
   </p>
   <p>
    By whose compact utilitarian heap
   </p>
   <p>
    The present may sit down and go to sleep,
   </p>
   <p>
    Nor fear the ghosts who from the dim past walked,
   </p>
   <p>
    And with us by the unequal light of the old wood fire talked.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Former Inhabitants and Winter Visitors
   </p>
   <p>
    I weathered some merry snow storms, and spent some cheerful winter
   </p>
   <p>
    evenings by my fire-side, while the snow whirled wildly without, and
   </p>
   <p>
    even the hooting of the owl was hushed. For many weeks I met no one in
   </p>
   <p>
    my walks but those who came occasionally to cut wood and sled it to the
   </p>
   <p>
    village. The elements, however, abetted me in making a path through the
   </p>
   <p>
    deepest snow in the woods, for when I had once gone through the wind
   </p>
   <p>
    blew the oak leaves into my tracks, where they lodged, and by absorbing
   </p>
   <p>
    the rays of the sun melted the snow, and so not only made a dry bed for
   </p>
   <p>
    my feet, but in the night their dark line was my guide. For human
   </p>
   <p>
    society I was obliged to conjure up the former occupants of these
   </p>
   <p>
    woods. Within the memory of many of my townsmen the road near which my
   </p>
   <p>
    house stands resounded with the laugh and gossip of inhabitants, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the woods which border it were notched and dotted here and there with
   </p>
   <p>
    their little gardens and dwellings, though it was then much more shut
   </p>
   <p>
    in by the forest than now. In some places, within my own remembrance,
   </p>
   <p>
    the pines would scrape both sides of a chaise at once, and women and
   </p>
   <p>
    children who were compelled to go this way to Lincoln alone and on foot
   </p>
   <p>
    did it with fear, and often ran a good part of the distance. Though
   </p>
   <p>
    mainly but a humble route to neighboring villages, or for the woodman’s
   </p>
   <p>
    team, it once amused the traveller more than now by its variety, and
   </p>
   <p>
    lingered longer in his memory. Where now firm open fields stretch from
   </p>
   <p>
    the village to the woods, it then ran through a maple swamp on a
   </p>
   <p>
    foundation of logs, the remnants of which, doubtless, still underlie
   </p>
   <p>
    the present dusty highway, from the Stratton, now the Alms House, Farm,
   </p>
   <p>
    to Brister’s Hill.
   </p>
   <p>
    East of my bean-field, across the road, lived Cato Ingraham, slave of
   </p>
   <p>
    Duncan Ingraham, Esquire, gentleman, of Concord village, who built his
   </p>
   <p>
    slave a house, and gave him permission to live in Walden Woods;—Cato,
   </p>
   <p>
    not Uticensis, but Concordiensis. Some say that he was a Guinea Negro.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are a few who remember his little patch among the walnuts, which
   </p>
   <p>
    he let grow up till he should be old and need them; but a younger and
   </p>
   <p>
    whiter speculator got them at last. He too, however, occupies an
   </p>
   <p>
    equally narrow house at present. Cato’s half-obliterated cellar hole
   </p>
   <p>
    still remains, though known to few, being concealed from the traveller
   </p>
   <p>
    by a fringe of pines. It is now filled with the smooth sumach (_Rhus
   </p>
   <p>
    glabra_,) and one of the earliest species of golden-rod (_Solidago
   </p>
   <p>
    stricta_) grows there luxuriantly.
   </p>
   <p>
    Here, by the very corner of my field, still nearer to town, Zilpha, a
   </p>
   <p>
    colored woman, had her little house, where she spun linen for the
   </p>
   <p>
    townsfolk, making the Walden Woods ring with her shrill singing, for
   </p>
   <p>
    she had a loud and notable voice. At length, in the war of 1812, her
   </p>
   <p>
    dwelling was set on fire by English soldiers, prisoners on parole, when
   </p>
   <p>
    she was away, and her cat and dog and hens were all burned up together.
   </p>
   <p>
    She led a hard life, and somewhat inhumane. One old frequenter of these
   </p>
   <p>
    woods remembers, that as he passed her house one noon he heard her
   </p>
   <p>
    muttering to herself over her gurgling pot,—“Ye are all bones, bones!”
   </p>
   <p>
    I have seen bricks amid the oak copse there.
   </p>
   <p>
    Down the road, on the right hand, on Brister’s Hill, lived Brister
   </p>
   <p>
    Freeman, “a handy Negro,” slave of Squire Cummings once,—there where
   </p>
   <p>
    grow still the apple-trees which Brister planted and tended; large old
   </p>
   <p>
    trees now, but their fruit still wild and ciderish to my taste. Not
   </p>
   <p>
    long since I read his epitaph in the old Lincoln burying-ground, a
   </p>
   <p>
    little on one side, near the unmarked graves of some British grenadiers
   </p>
   <p>
    who fell in the retreat from Concord,—where he is styled “Sippio
   </p>
   <p>
    Brister,”—Scipio Africanus he had some title to be called,—“a man of
   </p>
   <p>
    color,” as if he were discolored. It also told me, with staring
   </p>
   <p>
    emphasis, when he died; which was but an indirect way of informing me
   </p>
   <p>
    that he ever lived. With him dwelt Fenda, his hospitable wife, who told
   </p>
   <p>
    fortunes, yet pleasantly,—large, round, and black, blacker than any of
   </p>
   <p>
    the children of night, such a dusky orb as never rose on Concord before
   </p>
   <p>
    or since.
   </p>
   <p>
    Farther down the hill, on the left, on the old road in the woods, are
   </p>
   <p>
    marks of some homestead of the Stratton family; whose orchard once
   </p>
   <p>
    covered all the slope of Brister’s Hill, but was long since killed out
   </p>
   <p>
    by pitch pines, excepting a few stumps, whose old roots furnish still
   </p>
   <p>
    the wild stocks of many a thrifty village tree.
   </p>
   <p>
    Nearer yet to town, you come to Breed’s location, on the other side of
   </p>
   <p>
    the way, just on the edge of the wood; ground famous for the pranks of
   </p>
   <p>
    a demon not distinctly named in old mythology, who has acted a
   </p>
   <p>
    prominent and astounding part in our New England life, and deserves, as
   </p>
   <p>
    much as any mythological character, to have his biography written one
   </p>
   <p>
    day; who first comes in the guise of a friend or hired man, and then
   </p>
   <p>
    robs and murders the whole family,—New-England Rum. But history must
   </p>
   <p>
    not yet tell the tragedies enacted here; let time intervene in some
   </p>
   <p>
    measure to assuage and lend an azure tint to them. Here the most
   </p>
   <p>
    indistinct and dubious tradition says that once a tavern stood; the
   </p>
   <p>
    well the same, which tempered the traveller’s beverage and refreshed
   </p>
   <p>
    his steed. Here then men saluted one another, and heard and told the
   </p>
   <p>
    news, and went their ways again.
   </p>
   <p>
    Breed’s hut was standing only a dozen years ago, though it had long
   </p>
   <p>
    been unoccupied. It was about the size of mine. It was set on fire by
   </p>
   <p>
    mischievous boys, one Election night, if I do not mistake. I lived on
   </p>
   <p>
    the edge of the village then, and had just lost myself over Davenant’s
   </p>
   <p>
    Gondibert, that winter that I labored with a lethargy,—which, by the
   </p>
   <p>
    way, I never knew whether to regard as a family complaint, having an
   </p>
   <p>
    uncle who goes to sleep shaving himself, and is obliged to sprout
   </p>
   <p>
    potatoes in a cellar Sundays, in order to keep awake and keep the
   </p>
   <p>
    Sabbath, or as the consequence of my attempt to read Chalmers’
   </p>
   <p>
    collection of English poetry without skipping. It fairly overcame my
   </p>
   <p>
    Nervii. I had just sunk my head on this when the bells rung fire, and
   </p>
   <p>
    in hot haste the engines rolled that way, led by a straggling troop of
   </p>
   <p>
    men and boys, and I among the foremost, for I had leaped the brook. We
   </p>
   <p>
    thought it was far south over the woods,—we who had run to fires
   </p>
   <p>
    before,—barn, shop, or dwelling-house, or all together. “It’s Baker’s
   </p>
   <p>
    barn,” cried one. “It is the Codman place,” affirmed another. And then
   </p>
   <p>
    fresh sparks went up above the wood, as if the roof fell in, and we all
   </p>
   <p>
    shouted “Concord to the rescue!” Wagons shot past with furious speed
   </p>
   <p>
    and crushing loads, bearing, perchance, among the rest, the agent of
   </p>
   <p>
    the Insurance Company, who was bound to go however far; and ever and
   </p>
   <p>
    anon the engine bell tinkled behind, more slow and sure; and rearmost
   </p>
   <p>
    of all, as it was afterward whispered, came they who set the fire and
   </p>
   <p>
    gave the alarm. Thus we kept on like true idealists, rejecting the
   </p>
   <p>
    evidence of our senses, until at a turn in the road we heard the
   </p>
   <p>
    crackling and actually felt the heat of the fire from over the wall,
   </p>
   <p>
    and realized, alas! that we were there. The very nearness of the fire
   </p>
   <p>
    but cooled our ardor. At first we thought to throw a frog-pond on to
   </p>
   <p>
    it; but concluded to let it burn, it was so far gone and so worthless.
   </p>
   <p>
    So we stood round our engine, jostled one another, expressed our
   </p>
   <p>
    sentiments through speaking-trumpets, or in lower tone referred to the
   </p>
   <p>
    great conflagrations which the world has witnessed, including Bascom’s
   </p>
   <p>
    shop, and, between ourselves, we thought that, were we there in season
   </p>
   <p>
    with our “tub,” and a full frog-pond by, we could turn that threatened
   </p>
   <p>
    last and universal one into another flood. We finally retreated without
   </p>
   <p>
    doing any mischief,—returned to sleep and Gondibert. But as for
   </p>
   <p>
    Gondibert, I would except that passage in the preface about wit being
   </p>
   <p>
    the soul’s powder,—“but most of mankind are strangers to wit, as
   </p>
   <p>
    Indians are to powder.”
   </p>
   <p>
    It chanced that I walked that way across the fields the following
   </p>
   <p>
    night, about the same hour, and hearing a low moaning at this spot, I
   </p>
   <p>
    drew near in the dark, and discovered the only survivor of the family
   </p>
   <p>
    that I know, the heir of both its virtues and its vices, who alone was
   </p>
   <p>
    interested in this burning, lying on his stomach and looking over the
   </p>
   <p>
    cellar wall at the still smouldering cinders beneath, muttering to
   </p>
   <p>
    himself, as is his wont. He had been working far off in the river
   </p>
   <p>
    meadows all day, and had improved the first moments that he could call
   </p>
   <p>
    his own to visit the home of his fathers and his youth. He gazed into
   </p>
   <p>
    the cellar from all sides and points of view by turns, always lying
   </p>
   <p>
    down to it, as if there was some treasure, which he remembered,
   </p>
   <p>
    concealed between the stones, where there was absolutely nothing but a
   </p>
   <p>
    heap of bricks and ashes. The house being gone, he looked at what there
   </p>
   <p>
    was left. He was soothed by the sympathy which my mere presence
   </p>
   <p>
    implied, and showed me, as well as the darkness permitted, where the
   </p>
   <p>
    well was covered up; which, thank Heaven, could never be burned; and he
   </p>
   <p>
    groped long about the wall to find the well-sweep which his father had
   </p>
   <p>
    cut and mounted, feeling for the iron hook or staple by which a burden
   </p>
   <p>
    had been fastened to the heavy end,—all that he could now cling to,—to
   </p>
   <p>
    convince me that it was no common “rider.” I felt it, and still remark
   </p>
   <p>
    it almost daily in my walks, for by it hangs the history of a family.
   </p>
   <p>
    Once more, on the left, where are seen the well and lilac bushes by the
   </p>
   <p>
    wall, in the now open field, lived Nutting and Le Grosse. But to return
   </p>
   <p>
    toward Lincoln.
   </p>
   <p>
    Farther in the woods than any of these, where the road approaches
   </p>
   <p>
    nearest to the pond, Wyman the potter squatted, and furnished his
   </p>
   <p>
    townsmen with earthen ware, and left descendants to succeed him.
   </p>
   <p>
    Neither were they rich in worldly goods, holding the land by sufferance
   </p>
   <p>
    while they lived; and there often the sheriff came in vain to collect
   </p>
   <p>
    the taxes, and “attached a chip,” for form’s sake, as I have read in
   </p>
   <p>
    his accounts, there being nothing else that he could lay his hands on.
   </p>
   <p>
    One day in midsummer, when I was hoeing, a man who was carrying a load
   </p>
   <p>
    of pottery to market stopped his horse against my field and inquired
   </p>
   <p>
    concerning Wyman the younger. He had long ago bought a potter’s wheel
   </p>
   <p>
    of him, and wished to know what had become of him. I had read of the
   </p>
   <p>
    potter’s clay and wheel in Scripture, but it had never occurred to me
   </p>
   <p>
    that the pots we use were not such as had come down unbroken from those
   </p>
   <p>
    days, or grown on trees like gourds somewhere, and I was pleased to
   </p>
   <p>
    hear that so fictile an art was ever practiced in my neighborhood.
   </p>
   <p>
    The last inhabitant of these woods before me was an Irishman, Hugh
   </p>
   <p>
    Quoil (if I have spelt his name with coil enough,) who occupied Wyman’s
   </p>
   <p>
    tenement,—Col. Quoil, he was called. Rumor said that he had been a
   </p>
   <p>
    soldier at Waterloo. If he had lived I should have made him fight his
   </p>
   <p>
    battles over again. His trade here was that of a ditcher. Napoleon went
   </p>
   <p>
    to St. Helena; Quoil came to Walden Woods. All I know of him is tragic.
   </p>
   <p>
    He was a man of manners, like one who had seen the world, and was
   </p>
   <p>
    capable of more civil speech than you could well attend to. He wore a
   </p>
   <p>
    great coat in mid-summer, being affected with the trembling delirium,
   </p>
   <p>
    and his face was the color of carmine. He died in the road at the foot
   </p>
   <p>
    of Brister’s Hill shortly after I came to the woods, so that I have not
   </p>
   <p>
    remembered him as a neighbor. Before his house was pulled down, when
   </p>
   <p>
    his comrades avoided it as “an unlucky castle,” I visited it. There lay
   </p>
   <p>
    his old clothes curled up by use, as if they were himself, upon his
   </p>
   <p>
    raised plank bed. His pipe lay broken on the hearth, instead of a bowl
   </p>
   <p>
    broken at the fountain. The last could never have been the symbol of
   </p>
   <p>
    his death, for he confessed to me that, though he had heard of
   </p>
   <p>
    Brister’s Spring, he had never seen it; and soiled cards, kings of
   </p>
   <p>
    diamonds spades and hearts, were scattered over the floor. One black
   </p>
   <p>
    chicken which the administrator could not catch, black as night and as
   </p>
   <p>
    silent, not even croaking, awaiting Reynard, still went to roost in the
   </p>
   <p>
    next apartment. In the rear there was the dim outline of a garden,
   </p>
   <p>
    which had been planted but had never received its first hoeing, owing
   </p>
   <p>
    to those terrible shaking fits, though it was now harvest time. It was
   </p>
   <p>
    over-run with Roman wormwood and beggar-ticks, which last stuck to my
   </p>
   <p>
    clothes for all fruit. The skin of a woodchuck was freshly stretched
   </p>
   <p>
    upon the back of the house, a trophy of his last Waterloo; but no warm
   </p>
   <p>
    cap or mittens would he want more.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now only a dent in the earth marks the site of these dwellings, with
   </p>
   <p>
    buried cellar stones, and strawberries, raspberries, thimble-berries,
   </p>
   <p>
    hazel-bushes, and sumachs growing in the sunny sward there; some
   </p>
   <p>
    pitch-pine or gnarled oak occupies what was the chimney nook, and a
   </p>
   <p>
    sweet-scented black-birch, perhaps, waves where the door-stone was.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sometimes the well dent is visible, where once a spring oozed; now dry
   </p>
   <p>
    and tearless grass; or it was covered deep,—not to be discovered till
   </p>
   <p>
    some late day,—with a flat stone under the sod, when the last of the
   </p>
   <p>
    race departed. What a sorrowful act must that be,—the covering up of
   </p>
   <p>
    wells! coincident with the opening of wells of tears. These cellar
   </p>
   <p>
    dents, like deserted fox burrows, old holes, are all that is left where
   </p>
   <p>
    once were the stir and bustle of human life, and “fate, free-will,
   </p>
   <p>
    foreknowledge absolute,” in some form and dialect or other were by
   </p>
   <p>
    turns discussed. But all I can learn of their conclusions amounts to
   </p>
   <p>
    just this, that “Cato and Brister pulled wool;” which is about as
   </p>
   <p>
    edifying as the history of more famous schools of philosophy.
   </p>
   <p>
    Still grows the vivacious lilac a generation after the door and lintel
   </p>
   <p>
    and the sill are gone, unfolding its sweet-scented flowers each spring,
   </p>
   <p>
    to be plucked by the musing traveller; planted and tended once by
   </p>
   <p>
    children’s hands, in front-yard plots,—now standing by wall-sides in
   </p>
   <p>
    retired pastures, and giving place to new-rising forests;—the last of
   </p>
   <p>
    that stirp, sole survivor of that family. Little did the dusky children
   </p>
   <p>
    think that the puny slip with its two eyes only, which they stuck in
   </p>
   <p>
    the ground in the shadow of the house and daily watered, would root
   </p>
   <p>
    itself so, and outlive them, and house itself in the rear that shaded
   </p>
   <p>
    it, and grown man’s garden and orchard, and tell their story faintly to
   </p>
   <p>
    the lone wanderer a half century after they had grown up and
   </p>
   <p>
    died,—blossoming as fair, and smelling as sweet, as in that first
   </p>
   <p>
    spring. I mark its still tender, civil, cheerful, lilac colors.
   </p>
   <p>
    But this small village, germ of something more, why did it fail while
   </p>
   <p>
    Concord keeps its ground? Were there no natural advantages,—no water
   </p>
   <p>
    privileges, forsooth? Ay, the deep Walden Pond and cool Brister’s
   </p>
   <p>
    Spring,—privilege to drink long and healthy draughts at these, all
   </p>
   <p>
    unimproved by these men but to dilute their glass. They were
   </p>
   <p>
    universally a thirsty race. Might not the basket, stable-broom,
   </p>
   <p>
    mat-making, corn-parching, linen-spinning, and pottery business have
   </p>
   <p>
    thrived here, making the wilderness to blossom like the rose, and a
   </p>
   <p>
    numerous posterity have inherited the land of their fathers? The
   </p>
   <p>
    sterile soil would at least have been proof against a low-land
   </p>
   <p>
    degeneracy. Alas! how little does the memory of these human inhabitants
   </p>
   <p>
    enhance the beauty of the landscape! Again, perhaps, Nature will try,
   </p>
   <p>
    with me for a first settler, and my house raised last spring to be the
   </p>
   <p>
    oldest in the hamlet.
   </p>
   <p>
    I am not aware that any man has ever built on the spot which I occupy.
   </p>
   <p>
    Deliver me from a city built on the site of a more ancient city, whose
   </p>
   <p>
    materials are ruins, whose gardens cemeteries. The soil is blanched and
   </p>
   <p>
    accursed there, and before that becomes necessary the earth itself will
   </p>
   <p>
    be destroyed. With such reminiscences I repeopled the woods and lulled
   </p>
   <p>
    myself asleep.
   </p>
   <p>
    At this season I seldom had a visitor. When the snow lay deepest no
   </p>
   <p>
    wanderer ventured near my house for a week or fortnight at a time, but
   </p>
   <p>
    there I lived as snug as a meadow mouse, or as cattle and poultry which
   </p>
   <p>
    are said to have survived for a long time buried in drifts, even
   </p>
   <p>
    without food; or like that early settler’s family in the town of
   </p>
   <p>
    Sutton, in this state, whose cottage was completely covered by the
   </p>
   <p>
    great snow of 1717 when he was absent, and an Indian found it only by
   </p>
   <p>
    the hole which the chimney’s breath made in the drift, and so relieved
   </p>
   <p>
    the family. But no friendly Indian concerned himself about me; nor
   </p>
   <p>
    needed he, for the master of the house was at home. The Great Snow! How
   </p>
   <p>
    cheerful it is to hear of! When the farmers could not get to the woods
   </p>
   <p>
    and swamps with their teams, and were obliged to cut down the shade
   </p>
   <p>
    trees before their houses, and when the crust was harder, cut off the
   </p>
   <p>
    trees in the swamps, ten feet from the ground, as it appeared the next
   </p>
   <p>
    spring.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the deepest snows, the path which I used from the highway to my
   </p>
   <p>
    house, about half a mile long, might have been represented by a
   </p>
   <p>
    meandering dotted line, with wide intervals between the dots. For a
   </p>
   <p>
    week of even weather I took exactly the same number of steps, and of
   </p>
   <p>
    the same length, coming and going, stepping deliberately and with the
   </p>
   <p>
    precision of a pair of dividers in my own deep tracks,—to such routine
   </p>
   <p>
    the winter reduces us,—yet often they were filled with heaven’s own
   </p>
   <p>
    blue. But no weather interfered fatally with my walks, or rather my
   </p>
   <p>
    going abroad, for I frequently tramped eight or ten miles through the
   </p>
   <p>
    deepest snow to keep an appointment with a beech-tree, or a
   </p>
   <p>
    yellow-birch, or an old acquaintance among the pines; when the ice and
   </p>
   <p>
    snow causing their limbs to droop, and so sharpening their tops, had
   </p>
   <p>
    changed the pines into fir-trees; wading to the tops of the highest
   </p>
   <p>
    hills when the snow was nearly two feet deep on a level, and shaking
   </p>
   <p>
    down another snow-storm on my head at every step; or sometimes creeping
   </p>
   <p>
    and floundering thither on my hands and knees, when the hunters had
   </p>
   <p>
    gone into winter quarters. One afternoon I amused myself by watching a
   </p>
   <p>
    barred owl (_Strix nebulosa_) sitting on one of the lower dead limbs of
   </p>
   <p>
    a white-pine, close to the trunk, in broad daylight, I standing within
   </p>
   <p>
    a rod of him. He could hear me when I moved and cronched the snow with
   </p>
   <p>
    my feet, but could not plainly see me. When I made most noise he would
   </p>
   <p>
    stretch out his neck, and erect his neck feathers, and open his eyes
   </p>
   <p>
    wide; but their lids soon fell again, and he began to nod. I too felt a
   </p>
   <p>
    slumberous influence after watching him half an hour, as he sat thus
   </p>
   <p>
    with his eyes half open, like a cat, winged brother of the cat. There
   </p>
   <p>
    was only a narrow slit left between their lids, by which he preserved a
   </p>
   <p>
    peninsular relation to me; thus, with half-shut eyes, looking out from
   </p>
   <p>
    the land of dreams, and endeavoring to realize me, vague object or mote
   </p>
   <p>
    that interrupted his visions. At length, on some louder noise or my
   </p>
   <p>
    nearer approach, he would grow uneasy and sluggishly turn about on his
   </p>
   <p>
    perch, as if impatient at having his dreams disturbed; and when he
   </p>
   <p>
    launched himself off and flapped through the pines, spreading his wings
   </p>
   <p>
    to unexpected breadth, I could not hear the slightest sound from them.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus, guided amid the pine boughs rather by a delicate sense of their
   </p>
   <p>
    neighborhood than by sight, feeling his twilight way as it were with
   </p>
   <p>
    his sensitive pinions, he found a new perch, where he might in peace
   </p>
   <p>
    await the dawning of his day.
   </p>
   <p>
    As I walked over the long causeway made for the railroad through the
   </p>
   <p>
    meadows, I encountered many a blustering and nipping wind, for nowhere
   </p>
   <p>
    has it freer play; and when the frost had smitten me on one cheek,
   </p>
   <p>
    heathen as I was, I turned to it the other also. Nor was it much better
   </p>
   <p>
    by the carriage road from Brister’s Hill. For I came to town still,
   </p>
   <p>
    like a friendly Indian, when the contents of the broad open fields were
   </p>
   <p>
    all piled up between the walls of the Walden road, and half an hour
   </p>
   <p>
    sufficed to obliterate the tracks of the last traveller. And when I
   </p>
   <p>
    returned new drifts would have formed, through which I floundered,
   </p>
   <p>
    where the busy north-west wind had been depositing the powdery snow
   </p>
   <p>
    round a sharp angle in the road, and not a rabbit’s track, nor even the
   </p>
   <p>
    fine print, the small type, of a meadow mouse was to be seen. Yet I
   </p>
   <p>
    rarely failed to find, even in mid-winter, some warm and springly swamp
   </p>
   <p>
    where the grass and the skunk-cabbage still put forth with perennial
   </p>
   <p>
    verdure, and some hardier bird occasionally awaited the return of
   </p>
   <p>
    spring.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sometimes, notwithstanding the snow, when I returned from my walk at
   </p>
   <p>
    evening I crossed the deep tracks of a woodchopper leading from my
   </p>
   <p>
    door, and found his pile of whittlings on the hearth, and my house
   </p>
   <p>
    filled with the odor of his pipe. Or on a Sunday afternoon, if I
   </p>
   <p>
    chanced to be at home, I heard the cronching of the snow made by the
   </p>
   <p>
    step of a long-headed farmer, who from far through the woods sought my
   </p>
   <p>
    house, to have a social “crack;” one of the few of his vocation who are
   </p>
   <p>
    “men on their farms;” who donned a frock instead of a professor’s gown,
   </p>
   <p>
    and is as ready to extract the moral out of church or state as to haul
   </p>
   <p>
    a load of manure from his barn-yard. We talked of rude and simple
   </p>
   <p>
    times, when men sat about large fires in cold bracing weather, with
   </p>
   <p>
    clear heads; and when other dessert failed, we tried our teeth on many
   </p>
   <p>
    a nut which wise squirrels have long since abandoned, for those which
   </p>
   <p>
    have the thickest shells are commonly empty.
   </p>
   <p>
    The one who came from farthest to my lodge, through deepest snows and
   </p>
   <p>
    most dismal tempests, was a poet. A farmer, a hunter, a soldier, a
   </p>
   <p>
    reporter, even a philosopher, may be daunted; but nothing can deter a
   </p>
   <p>
    poet, for he is actuated by pure love. Who can predict his comings and
   </p>
   <p>
    goings? His business calls him out at all hours, even when doctors
   </p>
   <p>
    sleep. We made that small house ring with boisterous mirth and resound
   </p>
   <p>
    with the murmur of much sober talk, making amends then to Walden vale
   </p>
   <p>
    for the long silences. Broadway was still and deserted in comparison.
   </p>
   <p>
    At suitable intervals there were regular salutes of laughter, which
   </p>
   <p>
    might have been referred indifferently to the last uttered or the
   </p>
   <p>
    forth-coming jest. We made many a “bran new” theory of life over a thin
   </p>
   <p>
    dish of gruel, which combined the advantages of conviviality with the
   </p>
   <p>
    clear-headedness which philosophy requires.
   </p>
   <p>
    I should not forget that during my last winter at the pond there was
   </p>
   <p>
    another welcome visitor, who at one time came through the village,
   </p>
   <p>
    through snow and rain and darkness, till he saw my lamp through the
   </p>
   <p>
    trees, and shared with me some long winter evenings. One of the last of
   </p>
   <p>
    the philosophers,—Connecticut gave him to the world,—he peddled first
   </p>
   <p>
    her wares, afterwards, as he declares, his brains. These he peddles
   </p>
   <p>
    still, prompting God and disgracing man, bearing for fruit his brain
   </p>
   <p>
    only, like the nut its kernel. I think that he must be the man of the
   </p>
   <p>
    most faith of any alive. His words and attitude always suppose a better
   </p>
   <p>
    state of things than other men are acquainted with, and he will be the
   </p>
   <p>
    last man to be disappointed as the ages revolve. He has no venture in
   </p>
   <p>
    the present. But though comparatively disregarded now, when his day
   </p>
   <p>
    comes, laws unsuspected by most will take effect, and masters of
   </p>
   <p>
    families and rulers will come to him for advice.—
   </p>
   <p>
    “How blind that cannot see serenity!”
   </p>
   <p>
    A true friend of man; almost the only friend of human progress. An Old
   </p>
   <p>
    Mortality, say rather an Immortality, with unwearied patience and faith
   </p>
   <p>
    making plain the image engraven in men’s bodies, the God of whom they
   </p>
   <p>
    are but defaced and leaning monuments. With his hospitable intellect he
   </p>
   <p>
    embraces children, beggars, insane, and scholars, and entertains the
   </p>
   <p>
    thought of all, adding to it commonly some breadth and elegance. I
   </p>
   <p>
    think that he should keep a caravansary on the world’s highway, where
   </p>
   <p>
    philosophers of all nations might put up, and on his sign should be
   </p>
   <p>
    printed, “Entertainment for man, but not for his beast. Enter ye that
   </p>
   <p>
    have leisure and a quiet mind, who earnestly seek the right road.” He
   </p>
   <p>
    is perhaps the sanest man and has the fewest crotchets of any I chance
   </p>
   <p>
    to know; the same yesterday and tomorrow. Of yore we had sauntered and
   </p>
   <p>
    talked, and effectually put the world behind us; for he was pledged to
   </p>
   <p>
    no institution in it, freeborn, _ingenuus_. Whichever way we turned, it
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed that the heavens and the earth had met together, since he
   </p>
   <p>
    enhanced the beauty of the landscape. A blue-robed man, whose fittest
   </p>
   <p>
    roof is the overarching sky which reflects his serenity. I do not see
   </p>
   <p>
    how he can ever die; Nature cannot spare him.
   </p>
   <p>
    Having each some shingles of thought well dried, we sat and whittled
   </p>
   <p>
    them, trying our knives, and admiring the clear yellowish grain of the
   </p>
   <p>
    pumpkin pine. We waded so gently and reverently, or we pulled together
   </p>
   <p>
    so smoothly, that the fishes of thought were not scared from the
   </p>
   <p>
    stream, nor feared any angler on the bank, but came and went grandly,
   </p>
   <p>
    like the clouds which float through the western sky, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    mother-o’-pearl flocks which sometimes form and dissolve there. There
   </p>
   <p>
    we worked, revising mythology, rounding a fable here and there, and
   </p>
   <p>
    building castles in the air for which earth offered no worthy
   </p>
   <p>
    foundation. Great Looker! Great Expecter! to converse with whom was a
   </p>
   <p>
    New England Night’s Entertainment. Ah! such discourse we had, hermit
   </p>
   <p>
    and philosopher, and the old settler I have spoken of,—we three,—it
   </p>
   <p>
    expanded and racked my little house; I should not dare to say how many
   </p>
   <p>
    pounds’ weight there was above the atmospheric pressure on every
   </p>
   <p>
    circular inch; it opened its seams so that they had to be calked with
   </p>
   <p>
    much dulness thereafter to stop the consequent leak;—but I had enough
   </p>
   <p>
    of that kind of oakum already picked.
   </p>
   <p>
    There was one other with whom I had “solid seasons,” long to be
   </p>
   <p>
    remembered, at his house in the village, and who looked in upon me from
   </p>
   <p>
    time to time; but I had no more for society there.
   </p>
   <p>
    There too, as every where, I sometimes expected the Visitor who never
   </p>
   <p>
    comes. The Vishnu Purana says, “The house-holder is to remain at
   </p>
   <p>
    eventide in his court-yard as long as it takes to milk a cow, or longer
   </p>
   <p>
    if he pleases, to await the arrival of a guest.” I often performed this
   </p>
   <p>
    duty of hospitality, waited long enough to milk a whole herd of cows,
   </p>
   <p>
    but did not see the man approaching from the town.
   </p>
   <p>
    Winter Animals
   </p>
   <p>
    When the ponds were firmly frozen, they afforded not only new and
   </p>
   <p>
    shorter routes to many points, but new views from their surfaces of the
   </p>
   <p>
    familiar landscape around them. When I crossed Flint’s Pond, after it
   </p>
   <p>
    was covered with snow, though I had often paddled about and skated over
   </p>
   <p>
    it, it was so unexpectedly wide and so strange that I could think of
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing but Baffin’s Bay. The Lincoln hills rose up around me at the
   </p>
   <p>
    extremity of a snowy plain, in which I did not remember to have stood
   </p>
   <p>
    before; and the fishermen, at an indeterminable distance over the ice,
   </p>
   <p>
    moving slowly about with their wolfish dogs, passed for sealers or
   </p>
   <p>
    Esquimaux, or in misty weather loomed like fabulous creatures, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    did not know whether they were giants or pygmies. I took this course
   </p>
   <p>
    when I went to lecture in Lincoln in the evening, travelling in no road
   </p>
   <p>
    and passing no house between my own hut and the lecture room. In Goose
   </p>
   <p>
    Pond, which lay in my way, a colony of muskrats dwelt, and raised their
   </p>
   <p>
    cabins high above the ice, though none could be seen abroad when I
   </p>
   <p>
    crossed it. Walden, being like the rest usually bare of snow, or with
   </p>
   <p>
    only shallow and interrupted drifts on it, was my yard, where I could
   </p>
   <p>
    walk freely when the snow was nearly two feet deep on a level elsewhere
   </p>
   <p>
    and the villagers were confined to their streets. There, far from the
   </p>
   <p>
    village street, and except at very long intervals, from the jingle of
   </p>
   <p>
    sleigh-bells, I slid and skated, as in a vast moose-yard well trodden,
   </p>
   <p>
    overhung by oak woods and solemn pines bent down with snow or bristling
   </p>
   <p>
    with icicles.
   </p>
   <p>
    For sounds in winter nights, and often in winter days, I heard the
   </p>
   <p>
    forlorn but melodious note of a hooting owl indefinitely far; such a
   </p>
   <p>
    sound as the frozen earth would yield if struck with a suitable
   </p>
   <p>
    plectrum, the very _lingua vernacula_ of Walden Wood, and quite
   </p>
   <p>
    familiar to me at last, though I never saw the bird while it was making
   </p>
   <p>
    it. I seldom opened my door in a winter evening without hearing it;
   </p>
   <p>
    _Hoo hoo hoo, hoorer, hoo,_ sounded sonorously, and the first three
   </p>
   <p>
    syllables accented somewhat like _how der do_; or sometimes _hoo hoo_
   </p>
   <p>
    only. One night in the beginning of winter, before the pond froze over,
   </p>
   <p>
    about nine o’clock, I was startled by the loud honking of a goose, and,
   </p>
   <p>
    stepping to the door, heard the sound of their wings like a tempest in
   </p>
   <p>
    the woods as they flew low over my house. They passed over the pond
   </p>
   <p>
    toward Fair Haven, seemingly deterred from settling by my light, their
   </p>
   <p>
    commodore honking all the while with a regular beat. Suddenly an
   </p>
   <p>
    unmistakable cat-owl from very near me, with the most harsh and
   </p>
   <p>
    tremendous voice I ever heard from any inhabitant of the woods,
   </p>
   <p>
    responded at regular intervals to the goose, as if determined to expose
   </p>
   <p>
    and disgrace this intruder from Hudson’s Bay by exhibiting a greater
   </p>
   <p>
    compass and volume of voice in a native, and _boo-hoo_ him out of
   </p>
   <p>
    Concord horizon. What do you mean by alarming the citadel at this time
   </p>
   <p>
    of night consecrated to me? Do you think I am ever caught napping at
   </p>
   <p>
    such an hour, and that I have not got lungs and a larynx as well as
   </p>
   <p>
    yourself? _Boo-hoo, boo-hoo, boo-hoo!_ It was one of the most thrilling
   </p>
   <p>
    discords I ever heard. And yet, if you had a discriminating ear, there
   </p>
   <p>
    were in it the elements of a concord such as these plains never saw nor
   </p>
   <p>
    heard.
   </p>
   <p>
    I also heard the whooping of the ice in the pond, my great bed-fellow
   </p>
   <p>
    in that part of Concord, as if it were restless in its bed and would
   </p>
   <p>
    fain turn over, were troubled with flatulency and had dreams; or I was
   </p>
   <p>
    waked by the cracking of the ground by the frost, as if some one had
   </p>
   <p>
    driven a team against my door, and in the morning would find a crack in
   </p>
   <p>
    the earth a quarter of a mile long and a third of an inch wide.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sometimes I heard the foxes as they ranged over the snow crust, in
   </p>
   <p>
    moonlight nights, in search of a partridge or other game, barking
   </p>
   <p>
    raggedly and demoniacally like forest dogs, as if laboring with some
   </p>
   <p>
    anxiety, or seeking expression, struggling for light and to be dogs
   </p>
   <p>
    outright and run freely in the streets; for if we take the ages into
   </p>
   <p>
    our account, may there not be a civilization going on among brutes as
   </p>
   <p>
    well as men? They seemed to me to be rudimental, burrowing men, still
   </p>
   <p>
    standing on their defence, awaiting their transformation. Sometimes one
   </p>
   <p>
    came near to my window, attracted by my light, barked a vulpine curse
   </p>
   <p>
    at me, and then retreated.
   </p>
   <p>
    Usually the red squirrel (_Sciurus Hudsonius_) waked me in the dawn,
   </p>
   <p>
    coursing over the roof and up and down the sides of the house, as if
   </p>
   <p>
    sent out of the woods for this purpose. In the course of the winter I
   </p>
   <p>
    threw out half a bushel of ears of sweet-corn, which had not got ripe,
   </p>
   <p>
    on to the snow crust by my door, and was amused by watching the motions
   </p>
   <p>
    of the various animals which were baited by it. In the twilight and the
   </p>
   <p>
    night the rabbits came regularly and made a hearty meal. All day long
   </p>
   <p>
    the red squirrels came and went, and afforded me much entertainment by
   </p>
   <p>
    their manœuvres. One would approach at first warily through the
   </p>
   <p>
    shrub-oaks, running over the snow crust by fits and starts like a leaf
   </p>
   <p>
    blown by the wind, now a few paces this way, with wonderful speed and
   </p>
   <p>
    waste of energy, making inconceivable haste with his “trotters,” as if
   </p>
   <p>
    it were for a wager, and now as many paces that way, but never getting
   </p>
   <p>
    on more than half a rod at a time; and then suddenly pausing with a
   </p>
   <p>
    ludicrous expression and a gratuitous somerset, as if all the eyes in
   </p>
   <p>
    the universe were fixed on him,—for all the motions of a squirrel, even
   </p>
   <p>
    in the most solitary recesses of the forest, imply spectators as much
   </p>
   <p>
    as those of a dancing girl,—wasting more time in delay and
   </p>
   <p>
    circumspection than would have sufficed to walk the whole distance,—I
   </p>
   <p>
    never saw one walk,—and then suddenly, before you could say Jack
   </p>
   <p>
    Robinson, he would be in the top of a young pitch-pine, winding up his
   </p>
   <p>
    clock and chiding all imaginary spectators, soliloquizing and talking
   </p>
   <p>
    to all the universe at the same time,—for no reason that I could ever
   </p>
   <p>
    detect, or he himself was aware of, I suspect. At length he would reach
   </p>
   <p>
    the corn, and selecting a suitable ear, frisk about in the same
   </p>
   <p>
    uncertain trigonometrical way to the top-most stick of my wood-pile,
   </p>
   <p>
    before my window, where he looked me in the face, and there sit for
   </p>
   <p>
    hours, supplying himself with a new ear from time to time, nibbling at
   </p>
   <p>
    first voraciously and throwing the half-naked cobs about; till at
   </p>
   <p>
    length he grew more dainty still and played with his food, tasting only
   </p>
   <p>
    the inside of the kernel, and the ear, which was held balanced over the
   </p>
   <p>
    stick by one paw, slipped from his careless grasp and fell to the
   </p>
   <p>
    ground, when he would look over at it with a ludicrous expression of
   </p>
   <p>
    uncertainty, as if suspecting that it had life, with a mind not made up
   </p>
   <p>
    whether to get it again, or a new one, or be off; now thinking of corn,
   </p>
   <p>
    then listening to hear what was in the wind. So the little impudent
   </p>
   <p>
    fellow would waste many an ear in a forenoon; till at last, seizing
   </p>
   <p>
    some longer and plumper one, considerably bigger than himself, and
   </p>
   <p>
    skilfully balancing it, he would set out with it to the woods, like a
   </p>
   <p>
    tiger with a buffalo, by the same zig-zag course and frequent pauses,
   </p>
   <p>
    scratching along with it as if it were too heavy for him and falling
   </p>
   <p>
    all the while, making its fall a diagonal between a perpendicular and
   </p>
   <p>
    horizontal, being determined to put it through at any rate;—a
   </p>
   <p>
    singularly frivolous and whimsical fellow;—and so he would get off with
   </p>
   <p>
    it to where he lived, perhaps carry it to the top of a pine tree forty
   </p>
   <p>
    or fifty rods distant, and I would afterwards find the cobs strewn
   </p>
   <p>
    about the woods in various directions.
   </p>
   <p>
    At length the jays arrive, whose discordant screams were heard long
   </p>
   <p>
    before, as they were warily making their approach an eighth of a mile
   </p>
   <p>
    off, and in a stealthy and sneaking manner they flit from tree to tree,
   </p>
   <p>
    nearer and nearer, and pick up the kernels which the squirrels have
   </p>
   <p>
    dropped. Then, sitting on a pitch-pine bough, they attempt to swallow
   </p>
   <p>
    in their haste a kernel which is too big for their throats and chokes
   </p>
   <p>
    them; and after great labor they disgorge it, and spend an hour in the
   </p>
   <p>
    endeavor to crack it by repeated blows with their bills. They were
   </p>
   <p>
    manifestly thieves, and I had not much respect for them; but the
   </p>
   <p>
    squirrels, though at first shy, went to work as if they were taking
   </p>
   <p>
    what was their own.
   </p>
   <p>
    Meanwhile also came the chickadees in flocks, which, picking up the
   </p>
   <p>
    crumbs the squirrels had dropped, flew to the nearest twig, and,
   </p>
   <p>
    placing them under their claws, hammered away at them with their little
   </p>
   <p>
    bills, as if it were an insect in the bark, till they were sufficiently
   </p>
   <p>
    reduced for their slender throats. A little flock of these tit-mice
   </p>
   <p>
    came daily to pick a dinner out of my wood-pile, or the crumbs at my
   </p>
   <p>
    door, with faint flitting lisping notes, like the tinkling of icicles
   </p>
   <p>
    in the grass, or else with sprightly _day day day_, or more rarely, in
   </p>
   <p>
    spring-like days, a wiry summery _phe-be_ from the wood-side. They were
   </p>
   <p>
    so familiar that at length one alighted on an armful of wood which I
   </p>
   <p>
    was carrying in, and pecked at the sticks without fear. I once had a
   </p>
   <p>
    sparrow alight upon my shoulder for a moment while I was hoeing in a
   </p>
   <p>
    village garden, and I felt that I was more distinguished by that
   </p>
   <p>
    circumstance than I should have been by any epaulet I could have worn.
   </p>
   <p>
    The squirrels also grew at last to be quite familiar, and occasionally
   </p>
   <p>
    stepped upon my shoe, when that was the nearest way.
   </p>
   <p>
    When the ground was not yet quite covered, and again near the end of
   </p>
   <p>
    winter, when the snow was melted on my south hill-side and about my
   </p>
   <p>
    wood-pile, the partridges came out of the woods morning and evening to
   </p>
   <p>
    feed there. Whichever side you walk in the woods the partridge bursts
   </p>
   <p>
    away on whirring wings, jarring the snow from the dry leaves and twigs
   </p>
   <p>
    on high, which comes sifting down in the sun-beams like golden dust;
   </p>
   <p>
    for this brave bird is not to be scared by winter. It is frequently
   </p>
   <p>
    covered up by drifts, and, it is said, “sometimes plunges from on wing
   </p>
   <p>
    into the soft snow, where it remains concealed for a day or two.” I
   </p>
   <p>
    used to start them in the open land also, where they had come out of
   </p>
   <p>
    the woods at sunset to “bud” the wild apple-trees. They will come
   </p>
   <p>
    regularly every evening to particular trees, where the cunning
   </p>
   <p>
    sportsman lies in wait for them, and the distant orchards next the
   </p>
   <p>
    woods suffer thus not a little. I am glad that the partridge gets fed,
   </p>
   <p>
    at any rate. It is Nature’s own bird which lives on buds and
   </p>
   <p>
    diet-drink.
   </p>
   <p>
    In dark winter mornings, or in short winter afternoons, I sometimes
   </p>
   <p>
    heard a pack of hounds threading all the woods with hounding cry and
   </p>
   <p>
    yelp, unable to resist the instinct of the chase, and the note of the
   </p>
   <p>
    hunting horn at intervals, proving that man was in the rear. The woods
   </p>
   <p>
    ring again, and yet no fox bursts forth on to the open level of the
   </p>
   <p>
    pond, nor following pack pursuing their Actæon. And perhaps at evening
   </p>
   <p>
    I see the hunters returning with a single brush trailing from their
   </p>
   <p>
    sleigh for a trophy, seeking their inn. They tell me that if the fox
   </p>
   <p>
    would remain in the bosom of the frozen earth he would be safe, or if
   </p>
   <p>
    he would run in a straight line away no fox-hound could overtake him;
   </p>
   <p>
    but, having left his pursuers far behind, he stops to rest and listen
   </p>
   <p>
    till they come up, and when he runs he circles round to his old haunts,
   </p>
   <p>
    where the hunters await him. Sometimes, however, he will run upon a
   </p>
   <p>
    wall many rods, and then leap off far to one side, and he appears to
   </p>
   <p>
    know that water will not retain his scent. A hunter told me that he
   </p>
   <p>
    once saw a fox pursued by hounds burst out on to Walden when the ice
   </p>
   <p>
    was covered with shallow puddles, run part way across, and then return
   </p>
   <p>
    to the same shore. Ere long the hounds arrived, but here they lost the
   </p>
   <p>
    scent. Sometimes a pack hunting by themselves would pass my door, and
   </p>
   <p>
    circle round my house, and yelp and hound without regarding me, as if
   </p>
   <p>
    afflicted by a species of madness, so that nothing could divert them
   </p>
   <p>
    from the pursuit. Thus they circle until they fall upon the recent
   </p>
   <p>
    trail of a fox, for a wise hound will forsake every thing else for
   </p>
   <p>
    this. One day a man came to my hut from Lexington to inquire after his
   </p>
   <p>
    hound that made a large track, and had been hunting for a week by
   </p>
   <p>
    himself. But I fear that he was not the wiser for all I told him, for
   </p>
   <p>
    every time I attempted to answer his questions he interrupted me by
   </p>
   <p>
    asking, “What do you do here?” He had lost a dog, but found a man.
   </p>
   <p>
    One old hunter who has a dry tongue, who used to come to bathe in
   </p>
   <p>
    Walden once every year when the water was warmest, and at such times
   </p>
   <p>
    looked in upon me, told me that many years ago he took his gun one
   </p>
   <p>
    afternoon and went out for a cruise in Walden Wood; and as he walked
   </p>
   <p>
    the Wayland road he heard the cry of hounds approaching, and ere long a
   </p>
   <p>
    fox leaped the wall into the road, and as quick as thought leaped the
   </p>
   <p>
    other wall out of the road, and his swift bullet had not touched him.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some way behind came an old hound and her three pups in full pursuit,
   </p>
   <p>
    hunting on their own account, and disappeared again in the woods. Late
   </p>
   <p>
    in the afternoon, as he was resting in the thick woods south of Walden,
   </p>
   <p>
    he heard the voice of the hounds far over toward Fair Haven still
   </p>
   <p>
    pursuing the fox; and on they came, their hounding cry which made all
   </p>
   <p>
    the woods ring sounding nearer and nearer, now from Well-Meadow, now
   </p>
   <p>
    from the Baker Farm. For a long time he stood still and listened to
   </p>
   <p>
    their music, so sweet to a hunter’s ear, when suddenly the fox
   </p>
   <p>
    appeared, threading the solemn aisles with an easy coursing pace, whose
   </p>
   <p>
    sound was concealed by a sympathetic rustle of the leaves, swift and
   </p>
   <p>
    still, keeping the ground, leaving his pursuers far behind; and,
   </p>
   <p>
    leaping upon a rock amid the woods, he sat erect and listening, with
   </p>
   <p>
    his back to the hunter. For a moment compassion restrained the latter’s
   </p>
   <p>
    arm; but that was a short-lived mood, and as quick as thought can
   </p>
   <p>
    follow thought his piece was levelled, and _whang!_—the fox rolling
   </p>
   <p>
    over the rock lay dead on the ground. The hunter still kept his place
   </p>
   <p>
    and listened to the hounds. Still on they came, and now the near woods
   </p>
   <p>
    resounded through all their aisles with their demoniac cry. At length
   </p>
   <p>
    the old hound burst into view with muzzle to the ground, and snapping
   </p>
   <p>
    the air as if possessed, and ran directly to the rock; but spying the
   </p>
   <p>
    dead fox she suddenly ceased her hounding as if struck dumb with
   </p>
   <p>
    amazement, and walked round and round him in silence; and one by one
   </p>
   <p>
    her pups arrived, and, like their mother, were sobered into silence by
   </p>
   <p>
    the mystery. Then the hunter came forward and stood in their midst, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the mystery was solved. They waited in silence while he skinned the
   </p>
   <p>
    fox, then followed the brush a while, and at length turned off into the
   </p>
   <p>
    woods again. That evening a Weston Squire came to the Concord hunter’s
   </p>
   <p>
    cottage to inquire for his hounds, and told how for a week they had
   </p>
   <p>
    been hunting on their own account from Weston woods. The Concord hunter
   </p>
   <p>
    told him what he knew and offered him the skin; but the other declined
   </p>
   <p>
    it and departed. He did not find his hounds that night, but the next
   </p>
   <p>
    day learned that they had crossed the river and put up at a farm-house
   </p>
   <p>
    for the night, whence, having been well fed, they took their departure
   </p>
   <p>
    early in the morning.
   </p>
   <p>
    The hunter who told me this could remember one Sam Nutting, who used to
   </p>
   <p>
    hunt bears on Fair Haven Ledges, and exchange their skins for rum in
   </p>
   <p>
    Concord village; who told him, even, that he had seen a moose there.
   </p>
   <p>
    Nutting had a famous fox-hound named Burgoyne,—he pronounced it
   </p>
   <p>
    Bugine,—which my informant used to borrow. In the “Wast Book” of an old
   </p>
   <p>
    trader of this town, who was also a captain, town-clerk, and
   </p>
   <p>
    representative, I find the following entry. Jan. 18th, 1742–3, “John
   </p>
   <p>
    Melven Cr. by 1 Grey Fox 0—2—3;” they are not now found here; and in
   </p>
   <p>
    his ledger, Feb. 7th, 1743, Hezekiah Stratton has credit “by ½ a Catt
   </p>
   <p>
    skin 0—1—4½;” of course, a wild-cat, for Stratton was a sergeant in the
   </p>
   <p>
    old French war, and would not have got credit for hunting less noble
   </p>
   <p>
    game. Credit is given for deer skins also, and they were daily sold.
   </p>
   <p>
    One man still preserves the horns of the last deer that was killed in
   </p>
   <p>
    this vicinity, and another has told me the particulars of the hunt in
   </p>
   <p>
    which his uncle was engaged. The hunters were formerly a numerous and
   </p>
   <p>
    merry crew here. I remember well one gaunt Nimrod who would catch up a
   </p>
   <p>
    leaf by the road-side and play a strain on it wilder and more
   </p>
   <p>
    melodious, if my memory serves me, than any hunting-horn.
   </p>
   <p>
    At midnight, when there was a moon, I sometimes met with hounds in my
   </p>
   <p>
    path prowling about the woods, which would skulk out of my way, as if
   </p>
   <p>
    afraid, and stand silent amid the bushes till I had passed.
   </p>
   <p>
    Squirrels and wild mice disputed for my store of nuts. There were
   </p>
   <p>
    scores of pitch-pines around my house, from one to four inches in
   </p>
   <p>
    diameter, which had been gnawed by mice the previous winter,—a
   </p>
   <p>
    Norwegian winter for them, for the snow lay long and deep, and they
   </p>
   <p>
    were obliged to mix a large proportion of pine bark with their other
   </p>
   <p>
    diet. These trees were alive and apparently flourishing at mid-summer,
   </p>
   <p>
    and many of them had grown a foot, though completely girdled; but after
   </p>
   <p>
    another winter such were without exception dead. It is remarkable that
   </p>
   <p>
    a single mouse should thus be allowed a whole pine tree for its dinner,
   </p>
   <p>
    gnawing round instead of up and down it; but perhaps it is necessary in
   </p>
   <p>
    order to thin these trees, which are wont to grow up densely.
   </p>
   <p>
    The hares (_Lepus Americanus_) were very familiar. One had her form
   </p>
   <p>
    under my house all winter, separated from me only by the flooring, and
   </p>
   <p>
    she startled me each morning by her hasty departure when I began to
   </p>
   <p>
    stir,—thump, thump, thump, striking her head against the floor timbers
   </p>
   <p>
    in her hurry. They used to come round my door at dusk to nibble the
   </p>
   <p>
    potato parings which I had thrown out, and were so nearly the color of
   </p>
   <p>
    the ground that they could hardly be distinguished when still.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sometimes in the twilight I alternately lost and recovered sight of one
   </p>
   <p>
    sitting motionless under my window. When I opened my door in the
   </p>
   <p>
    evening, off they would go with a squeak and a bounce. Near at hand
   </p>
   <p>
    they only excited my pity. One evening one sat by my door two paces
   </p>
   <p>
    from me, at first trembling with fear, yet unwilling to move; a poor
   </p>
   <p>
    wee thing, lean and bony, with ragged ears and sharp nose, scant tail
   </p>
   <p>
    and slender paws. It looked as if Nature no longer contained the breed
   </p>
   <p>
    of nobler bloods, but stood on her last toes. Its large eyes appeared
   </p>
   <p>
    young and unhealthy, almost dropsical. I took a step, and lo, away it
   </p>
   <p>
    scud with an elastic spring over the snow crust, straightening its body
   </p>
   <p>
    and its limbs into graceful length, and soon put the forest between me
   </p>
   <p>
    and itself,—the wild free venison, asserting its vigor and the dignity
   </p>
   <p>
    of Nature. Not without reason was its slenderness. Such then was its
   </p>
   <p>
    nature. (_Lepus_, _levipes_, light-foot, some think.)
   </p>
   <p>
    What is a country without rabbits and partridges? They are among the
   </p>
   <p>
    most simple and indigenous animal products; ancient and venerable
   </p>
   <p>
    families known to antiquity as to modern times; of the very hue and
   </p>
   <p>
    substance of Nature, nearest allied to leaves and to the ground,—and to
   </p>
   <p>
    one another; it is either winged or it is legged. It is hardly as if
   </p>
   <p>
    you had seen a wild creature when a rabbit or a partridge bursts away,
   </p>
   <p>
    only a natural one, as much to be expected as rustling leaves. The
   </p>
   <p>
    partridge and the rabbit are still sure to thrive, like true natives of
   </p>
   <p>
    the soil, whatever revolutions occur. If the forest is cut off, the
   </p>
   <p>
    sprouts and bushes which spring up afford them concealment, and they
   </p>
   <p>
    become more numerous than ever. That must be a poor country indeed that
   </p>
   <p>
    does not support a hare. Our woods teem with them both, and around
   </p>
   <p>
    every swamp may be seen the partridge or rabbit walk, beset with twiggy
   </p>
   <p>
    fences and horse-hair snares, which some cow-boy tends.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Pond in Winter
   </p>
   <p>
    After a still winter night I awoke with the impression that some
   </p>
   <p>
    question had been put to me, which I had been endeavoring in vain to
   </p>
   <p>
    answer in my sleep, as what—how—when—where? But there was dawning
   </p>
   <p>
    Nature, in whom all creatures live, looking in at my broad windows with
   </p>
   <p>
    serene and satisfied face, and no question on _her_ lips. I awoke to an
   </p>
   <p>
    answered question, to Nature and daylight. The snow lying deep on the
   </p>
   <p>
    earth dotted with young pines, and the very slope of the hill on which
   </p>
   <p>
    my house is placed, seemed to say, Forward! Nature puts no question and
   </p>
   <p>
    answers none which we mortals ask. She has long ago taken her
   </p>
   <p>
    resolution. “O Prince, our eyes contemplate with admiration and
   </p>
   <p>
    transmit to the soul the wonderful and varied spectacle of this
   </p>
   <p>
    universe. The night veils without doubt a part of this glorious
   </p>
   <p>
    creation; but day comes to reveal to us this great work, which extends
   </p>
   <p>
    from earth even into the plains of the ether.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Then to my morning work. First I take an axe and pail and go in search
   </p>
   <p>
    of water, if that be not a dream. After a cold and snowy night it
   </p>
   <p>
    needed a divining rod to find it. Every winter the liquid and trembling
   </p>
   <p>
    surface of the pond, which was so sensitive to every breath, and
   </p>
   <p>
    reflected every light and shadow, becomes solid to the depth of a foot
   </p>
   <p>
    or a foot and a half, so that it will support the heaviest teams, and
   </p>
   <p>
    perchance the snow covers it to an equal depth, and it is not to be
   </p>
   <p>
    distinguished from any level field. Like the marmots in the surrounding
   </p>
   <p>
    hills, it closes its eye-lids and becomes dormant for three months or
   </p>
   <p>
    more. Standing on the snow-covered plain, as if in a pasture amid the
   </p>
   <p>
    hills, I cut my way first through a foot of snow, and then a foot of
   </p>
   <p>
    ice, and open a window under my feet, where, kneeling to drink, I look
   </p>
   <p>
    down into the quiet parlor of the fishes, pervaded by a softened light
   </p>
   <p>
    as through a window of ground glass, with its bright sanded floor the
   </p>
   <p>
    same as in summer; there a perennial waveless serenity reigns as in the
   </p>
   <p>
    amber twilight sky, corresponding to the cool and even temperament of
   </p>
   <p>
    the inhabitants. Heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads.
   </p>
   <p>
    Early in the morning, while all things are crisp with frost, men come
   </p>
   <p>
    with fishing reels and slender lunch, and let down their fine lines
   </p>
   <p>
    through the snowy field to take pickerel and perch; wild men, who
   </p>
   <p>
    instinctively follow other fashions and trust other authorities than
   </p>
   <p>
    their townsmen, and by their goings and comings stitch towns together
   </p>
   <p>
    in parts where else they would be ripped. They sit and eat their
   </p>
   <p>
    luncheon in stout fear-naughts on the dry oak leaves on the shore, as
   </p>
   <p>
    wise in natural lore as the citizen is in artificial. They never
   </p>
   <p>
    consulted with books, and know and can tell much less than they have
   </p>
   <p>
    done. The things which they practise are said not yet to be known. Here
   </p>
   <p>
    is one fishing for pickerel with grown perch for bait. You look into
   </p>
   <p>
    his pail with wonder as into a summer pond, as if he kept summer locked
   </p>
   <p>
    up at home, or knew where she had retreated. How, pray, did he get
   </p>
   <p>
    these in mid-winter? O, he got worms out of rotten logs since the
   </p>
   <p>
    ground froze, and so he caught them. His life itself passes deeper in
   </p>
   <p>
    Nature than the studies of the naturalist penetrate; himself a subject
   </p>
   <p>
    for the naturalist. The latter raises the moss and bark gently with his
   </p>
   <p>
    knife in search of insects; the former lays open logs to their core
   </p>
   <p>
    with his axe, and moss and bark fly far and wide. He gets his living by
   </p>
   <p>
    barking trees. Such a man has some right to fish, and I love to see
   </p>
   <p>
    Nature carried out in him. The perch swallows the grub-worm, the
   </p>
   <p>
    pickerel swallows the perch, and the fisher-man swallows the pickerel;
   </p>
   <p>
    and so all the chinks in the scale of being are filled.
   </p>
   <p>
    When I strolled around the pond in misty weather I was sometimes amused
   </p>
   <p>
    by the primitive mode which some ruder fisherman had adopted. He would
   </p>
   <p>
    perhaps have placed alder branches over the narrow holes in the ice,
   </p>
   <p>
    which were four or five rods apart and an equal distance from the
   </p>
   <p>
    shore, and having fastened the end of the line to a stick to prevent
   </p>
   <p>
    its being pulled through, have passed the slack line over a twig of the
   </p>
   <p>
    alder, a foot or more above the ice, and tied a dry oak leaf to it,
   </p>
   <p>
    which, being pulled down, would show when he had a bite. These alders
   </p>
   <p>
    loomed through the mist at regular intervals as you walked half way
   </p>
   <p>
    round the pond.
   </p>
   <p>
    Ah, the pickerel of Walden! when I see them lying on the ice, or in the
   </p>
   <p>
    well which the fisherman cuts in the ice, making a little hole to admit
   </p>
   <p>
    the water, I am always surprised by their rare beauty, as if they were
   </p>
   <p>
    fabulous fishes, they are so foreign to the streets, even to the woods,
   </p>
   <p>
    foreign as Arabia to our Concord life. They possess a quite dazzling
   </p>
   <p>
    and transcendent beauty which separates them by a wide interval from
   </p>
   <p>
    the cadaverous cod and haddock whose fame is trumpeted in our streets.
   </p>
   <p>
    They are not green like the pines, nor gray like the stones, nor blue
   </p>
   <p>
    like the sky; but they have, to my eyes, if possible, yet rarer colors,
   </p>
   <p>
    like flowers and precious stones, as if they were the pearls, the
   </p>
   <p>
    animalized _nuclei_ or crystals of the Walden water. They, of course,
   </p>
   <p>
    are Walden all over and all through; are themselves small Waldens in
   </p>
   <p>
    the animal kingdom, Waldenses. It is surprising that they are caught
   </p>
   <p>
    here,—that in this deep and capacious spring, far beneath the rattling
   </p>
   <p>
    teams and chaises and tinkling sleighs that travel the Walden road,
   </p>
   <p>
    this great gold and emerald fish swims. I never chanced to see its kind
   </p>
   <p>
    in any market; it would be the cynosure of all eyes there. Easily, with
   </p>
   <p>
    a few convulsive quirks, they give up their watery ghosts, like a
   </p>
   <p>
    mortal translated before his time to the thin air of heaven.
   </p>
   <p>

   </p>
   <p>
    As I was desirous to recover the long lost bottom of Walden Pond, I
   </p>
   <p>
    surveyed it carefully, before the ice broke up, early in ’46, with
   </p>
   <p>
    compass and chain and sounding line. There have been many stories told
   </p>
   <p>
    about the bottom, or rather no bottom, of this pond, which certainly
   </p>
   <p>
    had no foundation for themselves. It is remarkable how long men will
   </p>
   <p>
    believe in the bottomlessness of a pond without taking the trouble to
   </p>
   <p>
    sound it. I have visited two such Bottomless Ponds in one walk in this
   </p>
   <p>
    neighborhood. Many have believed that Walden reached quite through to
   </p>
   <p>
    the other side of the globe. Some who have lain flat on the ice for a
   </p>
   <p>
    long time, looking down through the illusive medium, perchance with
   </p>
   <p>
    watery eyes into the bargain, and driven to hasty conclusions by the
   </p>
   <p>
    fear of catching cold in their breasts, have seen vast holes “into
   </p>
   <p>
    which a load of hay might be driven,” if there were any body to drive
   </p>
   <p>
    it, the undoubted source of the Styx and entrance to the Infernal
   </p>
   <p>
    Regions from these parts. Others have gone down from the village with a
   </p>
   <p>
    “fifty-six” and a wagon load of inch rope, but yet have failed to find
   </p>
   <p>
    any bottom; for while the “fifty-six” was resting by the way, they were
   </p>
   <p>
    paying out the rope in the vain attempt to fathom their truly
   </p>
   <p>
    immeasurable capacity for marvellousness. But I can assure my readers
   </p>
   <p>
    that Walden has a reasonably tight bottom at a not unreasonable, though
   </p>
   <p>
    at an unusual, depth. I fathomed it easily with a cod-line and a stone
   </p>
   <p>
    weighing about a pound and a half, and could tell accurately when the
   </p>
   <p>
    stone left the bottom, by having to pull so much harder before the
   </p>
   <p>
    water got underneath to help me. The greatest depth was exactly one
   </p>
   <p>
    hundred and two feet; to which may be added the five feet which it has
   </p>
   <p>
    risen since, making one hundred and seven. This is a remarkable depth
   </p>
   <p>
    for so small an area; yet not an inch of it can be spared by the
   </p>
   <p>
    imagination. What if all ponds were shallow? Would it not react on the
   </p>
   <p>
    minds of men? I am thankful that this pond was made deep and pure for a
   </p>
   <p>
    symbol. While men believe in the infinite some ponds will be thought to
   </p>
   <p>
    be bottomless.
   </p>
   <p>
    A factory owner, hearing what depth I had found, thought that it could
   </p>
   <p>
    not be true, for, judging from his acquaintance with dams, sand would
   </p>
   <p>
    not lie at so steep an angle. But the deepest ponds are not so deep in
   </p>
   <p>
    proportion to their area as most suppose, and, if drained, would not
   </p>
   <p>
    leave very remarkable valleys. They are not like cups between the
   </p>
   <p>
    hills; for this one, which is so unusually deep for its area, appears
   </p>
   <p>
    in a vertical section through its centre not deeper than a shallow
   </p>
   <p>
    plate. Most ponds, emptied, would leave a meadow no more hollow than we
   </p>
   <p>
    frequently see. William Gilpin, who is so admirable in all that relates
   </p>
   <p>
    to landscapes, and usually so correct, standing at the head of Loch
   </p>
   <p>
    Fyne, in Scotland, which he describes as “a bay of salt water, sixty or
   </p>
   <p>
    seventy fathoms deep, four miles in breadth,” and about fifty miles
   </p>
   <p>
    long, surrounded by mountains, observes, “If we could have seen it
   </p>
   <p>
    immediately after the diluvian crash, or whatever convulsion of Nature
   </p>
   <p>
    occasioned it, before the waters gushed in, what a horrid chasm must it
   </p>
   <p>
    have appeared!
   </p>
   <p>
    So high as heaved the tumid hills, so low
   </p>
   <p>
    Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,
   </p>
   <p>
    Capacious bed of waters—.”
   </p>
   <p>
    But if, using the shortest diameter of Loch Fyne, we apply these
   </p>
   <p>
    proportions to Walden, which, as we have seen, appears already in a
   </p>
   <p>
    vertical section only like a shallow plate, it will appear four times
   </p>
   <p>
    as shallow. So much for the _increased_ horrors of the chasm of Loch
   </p>
   <p>
    Fyne when emptied. No doubt many a smiling valley with its stretching
   </p>
   <p>
    cornfields occupies exactly such a “horrid chasm,” from which the
   </p>
   <p>
    waters have receded, though it requires the insight and the far sight
   </p>
   <p>
    of the geologist to convince the unsuspecting inhabitants of this fact.
   </p>
   <p>
    Often an inquisitive eye may detect the shores of a primitive lake in
   </p>
   <p>
    the low horizon hills, and no subsequent elevation of the plain has
   </p>
   <p>
    been necessary to conceal their history. But it is easiest, as they who
   </p>
   <p>
    work on the highways know, to find the hollows by the puddles after a
   </p>
   <p>
    shower. The amount of it is, the imagination give it the least license,
   </p>
   <p>
    dives deeper and soars higher than Nature goes. So, probably, the depth
   </p>
   <p>
    of the ocean will be found to be very inconsiderable compared with its
   </p>
   <p>
    breadth.
   </p>
   <p>
    As I sounded through the ice I could determine the shape of the bottom
   </p>
   <p>
    with greater accuracy than is possible in surveying harbors which do
   </p>
   <p>
    not freeze over, and I was surprised at its general regularity. In the
   </p>
   <p>
    deepest part there are several acres more level than almost any field
   </p>
   <p>
    which is exposed to the sun wind and plough. In one instance, on a line
   </p>
   <p>
    arbitrarily chosen, the depth did not vary more than one foot in thirty
   </p>
   <p>
    rods; and generally, near the middle, I could calculate the variation
   </p>
   <p>
    for each one hundred feet in any direction beforehand within three or
   </p>
   <p>
    four inches. Some are accustomed to speak of deep and dangerous holes
   </p>
   <p>
    even in quiet sandy ponds like this, but the effect of water under
   </p>
   <p>
    these circumstances is to level all inequalities. The regularity of the
   </p>
   <p>
    bottom and its conformity to the shores and the range of the
   </p>
   <p>
    neighboring hills were so perfect that a distant promontory betrayed
   </p>
   <p>
    itself in the soundings quite across the pond, and its direction could
   </p>
   <p>
    be determined by observing the opposite shore. Cape becomes bar, and
   </p>
   <p>
    plain shoal, and valley and gorge deep water and channel.
   </p>
   <p>
    When I had mapped the pond by the scale of ten rods to an inch, and put
   </p>
   <p>
    down the soundings, more than a hundred in all, I observed this
   </p>
   <p>
    remarkable coincidence. Having noticed that the number indicating the
   </p>
   <p>
    greatest depth was apparently in the centre of the map, I laid a rule
   </p>
   <p>
    on the map lengthwise, and then breadthwise, and found, to my surprise,
   </p>
   <p>
    that the line of greatest length intersected the line of greatest
   </p>
   <p>
    breadth _exactly_ at the point of greatest depth, notwithstanding that
   </p>
   <p>
    the middle is so nearly level, the outline of the pond far from
   </p>
   <p>
    regular, and the extreme length and breadth were got by measuring into
   </p>
   <p>
    the coves; and I said to myself, Who knows but this hint would conduct
   </p>
   <p>
    to the deepest part of the ocean as well as of a pond or puddle? Is not
   </p>
   <p>
    this the rule also for the height of mountains, regarded as the
   </p>
   <p>
    opposite of valleys? We know that a hill is not highest at its
   </p>
   <p>
    narrowest part.
   </p>
   <p>
    Of five coves, three, or all which had been sounded, were observed to
   </p>
   <p>
    have a bar quite across their mouths and deeper water within, so that
   </p>
   <p>
    the bay tended to be an expansion of water within the land not only
   </p>
   <p>
    horizontally but vertically, and to form a basin or independent pond,
   </p>
   <p>
    the direction of the two capes showing the course of the bar. Every
   </p>
   <p>
    harbor on the sea-coast, also, has its bar at its entrance. In
   </p>
   <p>
    proportion as the mouth of the cove was wider compared with its length,
   </p>
   <p>
    the water over the bar was deeper compared with that in the basin.
   </p>
   <p>
    Given, then, the length and breadth of the cove, and the character of
   </p>
   <p>
    the surrounding shore, and you have almost elements enough to make out
   </p>
   <p>
    a formula for all cases.
   </p>
   <p>
    In order to see how nearly I could guess, with this experience, at the
   </p>
   <p>
    deepest point in a pond, by observing the outlines of its surface and
   </p>
   <p>
    the character of its shores alone, I made a plan of White Pond, which
   </p>
   <p>
    contains about forty-one acres, and, like this, has no island in it,
   </p>
   <p>
    nor any visible inlet or outlet; and as the line of greatest breadth
   </p>
   <p>
    fell very near the line of least breadth, where two opposite capes
   </p>
   <p>
    approached each other and two opposite bays receded, I ventured to mark
   </p>
   <p>
    a point a short distance from the latter line, but still on the line of
   </p>
   <p>
    greatest length, as the deepest. The deepest part was found to be
   </p>
   <p>
    within one hundred feet of this, still farther in the direction to
   </p>
   <p>
    which I had inclined, and was only one foot deeper, namely, sixty feet.
   </p>
   <p>
    Of course, a stream running through, or an island in the pond, would
   </p>
   <p>
    make the problem much more complicated.
   </p>
   <p>
    If we knew all the laws of Nature, we should need only one fact, or the
   </p>
   <p>
    description of one actual phenomenon, to infer all the particular
   </p>
   <p>
    results at that point. Now we know only a few laws, and our result is
   </p>
   <p>
    vitiated, not, of course, by any confusion or irregularity in Nature,
   </p>
   <p>
    but by our ignorance of essential elements in the calculation. Our
   </p>
   <p>
    notions of law and harmony are commonly confined to those instances
   </p>
   <p>
    which we detect; but the harmony which results from a far greater
   </p>
   <p>
    number of seemingly conflicting, but really concurring, laws, which we
   </p>
   <p>
    have not detected, is still more wonderful. The particular laws are as
   </p>
   <p>
    our points of view, as, to the traveller, a mountain outline varies
   </p>
   <p>
    with every step, and it has an infinite number of profiles, though
   </p>
   <p>
    absolutely but one form. Even when cleft or bored through it is not
   </p>
   <p>
    comprehended in its entireness.
   </p>
   <p>
    What I have observed of the pond is no less true in ethics. It is the
   </p>
   <p>
    law of average. Such a rule of the two diameters not only guides us
   </p>
   <p>
    toward the sun in the system and the heart in man, but draw lines
   </p>
   <p>
    through the length and breadth of the aggregate of a man’s particular
   </p>
   <p>
    daily behaviors and waves of life into his coves and inlets, and where
   </p>
   <p>
    they intersect will be the height or depth of his character. Perhaps we
   </p>
   <p>
    need only to know how his shores trend and his adjacent country or
   </p>
   <p>
    circumstances, to infer his depth and concealed bottom. If he is
   </p>
   <p>
    surrounded by mountainous circumstances, an Achillean shore, whose
   </p>
   <p>
    peaks overshadow and are reflected in his bosom, they suggest a
   </p>
   <p>
    corresponding depth in him. But a low and smooth shore proves him
   </p>
   <p>
    shallow on that side. In our bodies, a bold projecting brow falls off
   </p>
   <p>
    to and indicates a corresponding depth of thought. Also there is a bar
   </p>
   <p>
    across the entrance of our every cove, or particular inclination; each
   </p>
   <p>
    is our harbor for a season, in which we are detained and partially
   </p>
   <p>
    land-locked. These inclinations are not whimsical usually, but their
   </p>
   <p>
    form, size, and direction are determined by the promontories of the
   </p>
   <p>
    shore, the ancient axes of elevation. When this bar is gradually
   </p>
   <p>
    increased by storms, tides, or currents, or there is a subsidence of
   </p>
   <p>
    the waters, so that it reaches to the surface, that which was at first
   </p>
   <p>
    but an inclination in the shore in which a thought was harbored becomes
   </p>
   <p>
    an individual lake, cut off from the ocean, wherein the thought secures
   </p>
   <p>
    its own conditions, changes, perhaps, from salt to fresh, becomes a
   </p>
   <p>
    sweet sea, dead sea, or a marsh. At the advent of each individual into
   </p>
   <p>
    this life, may we not suppose that such a bar has risen to the surface
   </p>
   <p>
    somewhere? It is true, we are such poor navigators that our thoughts,
   </p>
   <p>
    for the most part, stand off and on upon a harborless coast, are
   </p>
   <p>
    conversant only with the bights of the bays of poesy, or steer for the
   </p>
   <p>
    public ports of entry, and go into the dry docks of science, where they
   </p>
   <p>
    merely refit for this world, and no natural currents concur to
   </p>
   <p>
    individualize them.
   </p>
   <p>
    As for the inlet or outlet of Walden, I have not discovered any but
   </p>
   <p>
    rain and snow and evaporation, though perhaps, with a thermometer and a
   </p>
   <p>
    line, such places may be found, for where the water flows into the pond
   </p>
   <p>
    it will probably be coldest in summer and warmest in winter. When the
   </p>
   <p>
    ice-men were at work here in ’46–7, the cakes sent to the shore were
   </p>
   <p>
    one day rejected by those who were stacking them up there, not being
   </p>
   <p>
    thick enough to lie side by side with the rest; and the cutters thus
   </p>
   <p>
    discovered that the ice over a small space was two or three inches
   </p>
   <p>
    thinner than elsewhere, which made them think that there was an inlet
   </p>
   <p>
    there. They also showed me in another place what they thought was a
   </p>
   <p>
    “leach hole,” through which the pond leaked out under a hill into a
   </p>
   <p>
    neighboring meadow, pushing me out on a cake of ice to see it. It was a
   </p>
   <p>
    small cavity under ten feet of water; but I think that I can warrant
   </p>
   <p>
    the pond not to need soldering till they find a worse leak than that.
   </p>
   <p>
    One has suggested, that if such a “leach hole” should be found, its
   </p>
   <p>
    connection with the meadow, if any existed, might be proved by
   </p>
   <p>
    conveying some colored powder or sawdust to the mouth of the hole, and
   </p>
   <p>
    then putting a strainer over the spring in the meadow, which would
   </p>
   <p>
    catch some of the particles carried through by the current.
   </p>
   <p>
    While I was surveying, the ice, which was sixteen inches thick,
   </p>
   <p>
    undulated under a slight wind like water. It is well known that a level
   </p>
   <p>
    cannot be used on ice. At one rod from the shore its greatest
   </p>
   <p>
    fluctuation, when observed by means of a level on land directed toward
   </p>
   <p>
    a graduated staff on the ice, was three quarters of an inch, though the
   </p>
   <p>
    ice appeared firmly attached to the shore. It was probably greater in
   </p>
   <p>
    the middle. Who knows but if our instruments were delicate enough we
   </p>
   <p>
    might detect an undulation in the crust of the earth? When two legs of
   </p>
   <p>
    my level were on the shore and the third on the ice, and the sights
   </p>
   <p>
    were directed over the latter, a rise or fall of the ice of an almost
   </p>
   <p>
    infinitesimal amount made a difference of several feet on a tree across
   </p>
   <p>
    the pond. When I began to cut holes for sounding, there were three or
   </p>
   <p>
    four inches of water on the ice under a deep snow which had sunk it
   </p>
   <p>
    thus far; but the water began immediately to run into these holes, and
   </p>
   <p>
    continued to run for two days in deep streams, which wore away the ice
   </p>
   <p>
    on every side, and contributed essentially, if not mainly, to dry the
   </p>
   <p>
    surface of the pond; for, as the water ran in, it raised and floated
   </p>
   <p>
    the ice. This was somewhat like cutting a hole in the bottom of a ship
   </p>
   <p>
    to let the water out. When such holes freeze, and a rain succeeds, and
   </p>
   <p>
    finally a new freezing forms a fresh smooth ice over all, it is
   </p>
   <p>
    beautifully mottled internally by dark figures, shaped somewhat like a
   </p>
   <p>
    spider’s web, what you may call ice rosettes, produced by the channels
   </p>
   <p>
    worn by the water flowing from all sides to a centre. Sometimes, also,
   </p>
   <p>
    when the ice was covered with shallow puddles, I saw a double shadow of
   </p>
   <p>
    myself, one standing on the head of the other, one on the ice, the
   </p>
   <p>
    other on the trees or hill-side.
   </p>
   <p>
    While yet it is cold January, and snow and ice are thick and solid, the
   </p>
   <p>
    prudent landlord comes from the village to get ice to cool his summer
   </p>
   <p>
    drink; impressively, even pathetically wise, to foresee the heat and
   </p>
   <p>
    thirst of July now in January,—wearing a thick coat and mittens! when
   </p>
   <p>
    so many things are not provided for. It may be that he lays up no
   </p>
   <p>
    treasures in this world which will cool his summer drink in the next.
   </p>
   <p>
    He cuts and saws the solid pond, unroofs the house of fishes, and carts
   </p>
   <p>
    off their very element and air, held fast by chains and stakes like
   </p>
   <p>
    corded wood, through the favoring winter air, to wintry cellars, to
   </p>
   <p>
    underlie the summer there. It looks like solidified azure, as, far off,
   </p>
   <p>
    it is drawn through the streets. These ice-cutters are a merry race,
   </p>
   <p>
    full of jest and sport, and when I went among them they were wont to
   </p>
   <p>
    invite me to saw pit-fashion with them, I standing underneath.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the winter of ’46–7 there came a hundred men of Hyperborean
   </p>
   <p>
    extraction swoop down on to our pond one morning, with many car-loads
   </p>
   <p>
    of ungainly-looking farming tools, sleds, ploughs, drill-barrows,
   </p>
   <p>
    turf-knives, spades, saws, rakes, and each man was armed with a
   </p>
   <p>
    double-pointed pike-staff, such as is not described in the New-England
   </p>
   <p>
    Farmer or the Cultivator. I did not know whether they had come to sow a
   </p>
   <p>
    crop of winter rye, or some other kind of grain recently introduced
   </p>
   <p>
    from Iceland. As I saw no manure, I judged that they meant to skim the
   </p>
   <p>
    land, as I had done, thinking the soil was deep and had lain fallow
   </p>
   <p>
    long enough. They said that a gentleman farmer, who was behind the
   </p>
   <p>
    scenes, wanted to double his money, which, as I understood, amounted to
   </p>
   <p>
    half a million already; but in order to cover each one of his dollars
   </p>
   <p>
    with another, he took off the only coat, ay, the skin itself, of Walden
   </p>
   <p>
    Pond in the midst of a hard winter. They went to work at once,
   </p>
   <p>
    ploughing, harrowing, rolling, furrowing, in admirable order, as if
   </p>
   <p>
    they were bent on making this a model farm; but when I was looking
   </p>
   <p>
    sharp to see what kind of seed they dropped into the furrow, a gang of
   </p>
   <p>
    fellows by my side suddenly began to hook up the virgin mould itself,
   </p>
   <p>
    with a peculiar jerk, clean down to the sand, or rather the water,—for
   </p>
   <p>
    it was a very springy soil,—indeed all the _terra firma_ there was,—and
   </p>
   <p>
    haul it away on sleds, and then I guessed that they must be cutting
   </p>
   <p>
    peat in a bog. So they came and went every day, with a peculiar shriek
   </p>
   <p>
    from the locomotive, from and to some point of the polar regions, as it
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed to me, like a flock of arctic snow-birds. But sometimes Squaw
   </p>
   <p>
    Walden had her revenge, and a hired man, walking behind his team,
   </p>
   <p>
    slipped through a crack in the ground down toward Tartarus, and he who
   </p>
   <p>
    was so brave before suddenly became but the ninth part of a man, almost
   </p>
   <p>
    gave up his animal heat, and was glad to take refuge in my house, and
   </p>
   <p>
    acknowledged that there was some virtue in a stove; or sometimes the
   </p>
   <p>
    frozen soil took a piece of steel out of a ploughshare, or a plough got
   </p>
   <p>
    set in the furrow and had to be cut out.
   </p>
   <p>
    To speak literally, a hundred Irishmen, with Yankee overseers, came
   </p>
   <p>
    from Cambridge every day to get out the ice. They divided it into cakes
   </p>
   <p>
    by methods too well known to require description, and these, being
   </p>
   <p>
    sledded to the shore, were rapidly hauled off on to an ice platform,
   </p>
   <p>
    and raised by grappling irons and block and tackle, worked by horses,
   </p>
   <p>
    on to a stack, as surely as so many barrels of flour, and there placed
   </p>
   <p>
    evenly side by side, and row upon row, as if they formed the solid base
   </p>
   <p>
    of an obelisk designed to pierce the clouds. They told me that in a
   </p>
   <p>
    good day they could get out a thousand tons, which was the yield of
   </p>
   <p>
    about one acre. Deep ruts and “cradle holes” were worn in the ice, as
   </p>
   <p>
    on _terra firma_, by the passage of the sleds over the same track, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the horses invariably ate their oats out of cakes of ice hollowed out
   </p>
   <p>
    like buckets. They stacked up the cakes thus in the open air in a pile
   </p>
   <p>
    thirty-five feet high on one side and six or seven rods square, putting
   </p>
   <p>
    hay between the outside layers to exclude the air; for when the wind,
   </p>
   <p>
    though never so cold, finds a passage through, it will wear large
   </p>
   <p>
    cavities, leaving slight supports or studs only here and there, and
   </p>
   <p>
    finally topple it down. At first it looked like a vast blue fort or
   </p>
   <p>
    Valhalla; but when they began to tuck the coarse meadow hay into the
   </p>
   <p>
    crevices, and this became covered with rime and icicles, it looked like
   </p>
   <p>
    a venerable moss-grown and hoary ruin, built of azure-tinted marble,
   </p>
   <p>
    the abode of Winter, that old man we see in the almanac,—his shanty, as
   </p>
   <p>
    if he had a design to estivate with us. They calculated that not
   </p>
   <p>
    twenty-five per cent of this would reach its destination, and that two
   </p>
   <p>
    or three per cent would be wasted in the cars. However, a still greater
   </p>
   <p>
    part of this heap had a different destiny from what was intended; for,
   </p>
   <p>
    either because the ice was found not to keep so well as was expected,
   </p>
   <p>
    containing more air than usual, or for some other reason, it never got
   </p>
   <p>
    to market. This heap, made in the winter of ’46–7 and estimated to
   </p>
   <p>
    contain ten thousand tons, was finally covered with hay and boards; and
   </p>
   <p>
    though it was unroofed the following July, and a part of it carried
   </p>
   <p>
    off, the rest remaining exposed to the sun, it stood over that summer
   </p>
   <p>
    and the next winter, and was not quite melted till September 1848. Thus
   </p>
   <p>
    the pond recovered the greater part.
   </p>
   <p>
    Like the water, the Walden ice, seen near at hand, has a green tint,
   </p>
   <p>
    but at a distance is beautifully blue, and you can easily tell it from
   </p>
   <p>
    the white ice of the river, or the merely greenish ice of some ponds, a
   </p>
   <p>
    quarter of a mile off. Sometimes one of those great cakes slips from
   </p>
   <p>
    the ice-man’s sled into the village street, and lies there for a week
   </p>
   <p>
    like a great emerald, an object of interest to all passers. I have
   </p>
   <p>
    noticed that a portion of Walden which in the state of water was green
   </p>
   <p>
    will often, when frozen, appear from the same point of view blue. So
   </p>
   <p>
    the hollows about this pond will, sometimes, in the winter, be filled
   </p>
   <p>
    with a greenish water somewhat like its own, but the next day will have
   </p>
   <p>
    frozen blue. Perhaps the blue color of water and ice is due to the
   </p>
   <p>
    light and air they contain, and the most transparent is the bluest. Ice
   </p>
   <p>
    is an interesting subject for contemplation. They told me that they had
   </p>
   <p>
    some in the ice-houses at Fresh Pond five years old which was as good
   </p>
   <p>
    as ever. Why is it that a bucket of water soon becomes putrid, but
   </p>
   <p>
    frozen remains sweet forever? It is commonly said that this is the
   </p>
   <p>
    difference between the affections and the intellect.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus for sixteen days I saw from my window a hundred men at work like
   </p>
   <p>
    busy husbandmen, with teams and horses and apparently all the
   </p>
   <p>
    implements of farming, such a picture as we see on the first page of
   </p>
   <p>
    the almanac; and as often as I looked out I was reminded of the fable
   </p>
   <p>
    of the lark and the reapers, or the parable of the sower, and the like;
   </p>
   <p>
    and now they are all gone, and in thirty days more, probably, I shall
   </p>
   <p>
    look from the same window on the pure sea-green Walden water there,
   </p>
   <p>
    reflecting the clouds and the trees, and sending up its evaporations in
   </p>
   <p>
    solitude, and no traces will appear that a man has ever stood there.
   </p>
   <p>
    Perhaps I shall hear a solitary loon laugh as he dives and plumes
   </p>
   <p>
    himself, or shall see a lonely fisher in his boat, like a floating
   </p>
   <p>
    leaf, beholding his form reflected in the waves, where lately a hundred
   </p>
   <p>
    men securely labored.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus it appears that the sweltering inhabitants of Charleston and New
   </p>
   <p>
    Orleans, of Madras and Bombay and Calcutta, drink at my well. In the
   </p>
   <p>
    morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal
   </p>
   <p>
    philosophy of the Bhagvat Geeta, since whose composition years of the
   </p>
   <p>
    gods have elapsed, and in comparison with which our modern world and
   </p>
   <p>
    its literature seem puny and trivial; and I doubt if that philosophy is
   </p>
   <p>
    not to be referred to a previous state of existence, so remote is its
   </p>
   <p>
    sublimity from our conceptions. I lay down the book and go to my well
   </p>
   <p>
    for water, and lo! there I meet the servant of the Bramin, priest of
   </p>
   <p>
    Brahma and Vishnu and Indra, who still sits in his temple on the Ganges
   </p>
   <p>
    reading the Vedas, or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and
   </p>
   <p>
    water jug. I meet his servant come to draw water for his master, and
   </p>
   <p>
    our buckets as it were grate together in the same well. The pure Walden
   </p>
   <p>
    water is mingled with the sacred water of the Ganges. With favoring
   </p>
   <p>
    winds it is wafted past the site of the fabulous islands of Atlantis
   </p>
   <p>
    and the Hesperides, makes the periplus of Hanno, and, floating by
   </p>
   <p>
    Ternate and Tidore and the mouth of the Persian Gulf, melts in the
   </p>
   <p>
    tropic gales of the Indian seas, and is landed in ports of which
   </p>
   <p>
    Alexander only heard the names.
   </p>
   <p>
    Spring
   </p>
   <p>
    The opening of large tracts by the ice-cutters commonly causes a pond
   </p>
   <p>
    to break up earlier; for the water, agitated by the wind, even in cold
   </p>
   <p>
    weather, wears away the surrounding ice. But such was not the effect on
   </p>
   <p>
    Walden that year, for she had soon got a thick new garment to take the
   </p>
   <p>
    place of the old. This pond never breaks up so soon as the others in
   </p>
   <p>
    this neighborhood, on account both of its greater depth and its having
   </p>
   <p>
    no stream passing through it to melt or wear away the ice. I never knew
   </p>
   <p>
    it to open in the course of a winter, not excepting that of ’52–3,
   </p>
   <p>
    which gave the ponds so severe a trial. It commonly opens about the
   </p>
   <p>
    first of April, a week or ten days later than Flint’s Pond and
   </p>
   <p>
    Fair-Haven, beginning to melt on the north side and in the shallower
   </p>
   <p>
    parts where it began to freeze. It indicates better than any water
   </p>
   <p>
    hereabouts the absolute progress of the season, being least affected by
   </p>
   <p>
    transient changes of temperature. A severe cold of a few days’ duration
   </p>
   <p>
    in March may very much retard the opening of the former ponds, while
   </p>
   <p>
    the temperature of Walden increases almost uninterruptedly. A
   </p>
   <p>
    thermometer thrust into the middle of Walden on the 6th of March, 1847,
   </p>
   <p>
    stood at 32°, or freezing point; near the shore at 33°; in the middle
   </p>
   <p>
    of Flint’s Pond, the same day, at 32½°; at a dozen rods from the shore,
   </p>
   <p>
    in shallow water, under ice a foot thick, at 36°. This difference of
   </p>
   <p>
    three and a half degrees between the temperature of the deep water and
   </p>
   <p>
    the shallow in the latter pond, and the fact that a great proportion of
   </p>
   <p>
    it is comparatively shallow, show why it should break up so much sooner
   </p>
   <p>
    than Walden. The ice in the shallowest part was at this time several
   </p>
   <p>
    inches thinner than in the middle. In mid-winter the middle had been
   </p>
   <p>
    the warmest and the ice thinnest there. So, also, every one who has
   </p>
   <p>
    waded about the shores of the pond in summer must have perceived how
   </p>
   <p>
    much warmer the water is close to the shore, where only three or four
   </p>
   <p>
    inches deep, than a little distance out, and on the surface where it is
   </p>
   <p>
    deep, than near the bottom. In spring the sun not only exerts an
   </p>
   <p>
    influence through the increased temperature of the air and earth, but
   </p>
   <p>
    its heat passes through ice a foot or more thick, and is reflected from
   </p>
   <p>
    the bottom in shallow water, and so also warms the water and melts the
   </p>
   <p>
    under side of the ice, at the same time that it is melting it more
   </p>
   <p>
    directly above, making it uneven, and causing the air bubbles which it
   </p>
   <p>
    contains to extend themselves upward and downward until it is
   </p>
   <p>
    completely honeycombed, and at last disappears suddenly in a single
   </p>
   <p>
    spring rain. Ice has its grain as well as wood, and when a cake begins
   </p>
   <p>
    to rot or “comb,” that is, assume the appearance of honey-comb,
   </p>
   <p>
    whatever may be its position, the air cells are at right angles with
   </p>
   <p>
    what was the water surface. Where there is a rock or a log rising near
   </p>
   <p>
    to the surface the ice over it is much thinner, and is frequently quite
   </p>
   <p>
    dissolved by this reflected heat; and I have been told that in the
   </p>
   <p>
    experiment at Cambridge to freeze water in a shallow wooden pond,
   </p>
   <p>
    though the cold air circulated underneath, and so had access to both
   </p>
   <p>
    sides, the reflection of the sun from the bottom more than
   </p>
   <p>
    counterbalanced this advantage. When a warm rain in the middle of the
   </p>
   <p>
    winter melts off the snow-ice from Walden, and leaves a hard dark or
   </p>
   <p>
    transparent ice on the middle, there will be a strip of rotten though
   </p>
   <p>
    thicker white ice, a rod or more wide, about the shores, created by
   </p>
   <p>
    this reflected heat. Also, as I have said, the bubbles themselves
   </p>
   <p>
    within the ice operate as burning-glasses to melt the ice beneath.
   </p>
   <p>
    The phenomena of the year take place every day in a pond on a small
   </p>
   <p>
    scale. Every morning, generally speaking, the shallow water is being
   </p>
   <p>
    warmed more rapidly than the deep, though it may not be made so warm
   </p>
   <p>
    after all, and every evening it is being cooled more rapidly until the
   </p>
   <p>
    morning. The day is an epitome of the year. The night is the winter,
   </p>
   <p>
    the morning and evening are the spring and fall, and the noon is the
   </p>
   <p>
    summer. The cracking and booming of the ice indicate a change of
   </p>
   <p>
    temperature. One pleasant morning after a cold night, February 24th,
   </p>
   <p>
    1850, having gone to Flint’s Pond to spend the day, I noticed with
   </p>
   <p>
    surprise, that when I struck the ice with the head of my axe, it
   </p>
   <p>
    resounded like a gong for many rods around, or as if I had struck on a
   </p>
   <p>
    tight drum-head. The pond began to boom about an hour after sunrise,
   </p>
   <p>
    when it felt the influence of the sun’s rays slanted upon it from over
   </p>
   <p>
    the hills; it stretched itself and yawned like a waking man with a
   </p>
   <p>
    gradually increasing tumult, which was kept up three or four hours. It
   </p>
   <p>
    took a short siesta at noon, and boomed once more toward night, as the
   </p>
   <p>
    sun was withdrawing his influence. In the right stage of the weather a
   </p>
   <p>
    pond fires its evening gun with great regularity. But in the middle of
   </p>
   <p>
    the day, being full of cracks, and the air also being less elastic, it
   </p>
   <p>
    had completely lost its resonance, and probably fishes and muskrats
   </p>
   <p>
    could not then have been stunned by a blow on it. The fishermen say
   </p>
   <p>
    that the “thundering of the pond” scares the fishes and prevents their
   </p>
   <p>
    biting. The pond does not thunder every evening, and I cannot tell
   </p>
   <p>
    surely when to expect its thundering; but though I may perceive no
   </p>
   <p>
    difference in the weather, it does. Who would have suspected so large
   </p>
   <p>
    and cold and thick-skinned a thing to be so sensitive? Yet it has its
   </p>
   <p>
    law to which it thunders obedience when it should as surely as the buds
   </p>
   <p>
    expand in the spring. The earth is all alive and covered with papillæ.
   </p>
   <p>
    The largest pond is as sensitive to atmospheric changes as the globule
   </p>
   <p>
    of mercury in its tube.
   </p>
   <p>
    One attraction in coming to the woods to live was that I should have
   </p>
   <p>
    leisure and opportunity to see the spring come in. The ice in the pond
   </p>
   <p>
    at length begins to be honey-combed, and I can set my heel in it as I
   </p>
   <p>
    walk. Fogs and rains and warmer suns are gradually melting the snow;
   </p>
   <p>
    the days have grown sensibly longer; and I see how I shall get through
   </p>
   <p>
    the winter without adding to my wood-pile, for large fires are no
   </p>
   <p>
    longer necessary. I am on the alert for the first signs of spring, to
   </p>
   <p>
    hear the chance note of some arriving bird, or the striped squirrel’s
   </p>
   <p>
    chirp, for his stores must be now nearly exhausted, or see the
   </p>
   <p>
    woodchuck venture out of his winter quarters. On the 13th of March,
   </p>
   <p>
    after I had heard the bluebird, song-sparrow, and red-wing, the ice was
   </p>
   <p>
    still nearly a foot thick. As the weather grew warmer it was not
   </p>
   <p>
    sensibly worn away by the water, nor broken up and floated off as in
   </p>
   <p>
    rivers, but, though it was completely melted for half a rod in width
   </p>
   <p>
    about the shore, the middle was merely honey-combed and saturated with
   </p>
   <p>
    water, so that you could put your foot through it when six inches
   </p>
   <p>
    thick; but by the next day evening, perhaps, after a warm rain followed
   </p>
   <p>
    by fog, it would have wholly disappeared, all gone off with the fog,
   </p>
   <p>
    spirited away. One year I went across the middle only five days before
   </p>
   <p>
    it disappeared entirely. In 1845 Walden was first completely open on
   </p>
   <p>
    the 1st of April; in ’46, the 25th of March; in ’47, the 8th of April;
   </p>
   <p>
    in ’51, the 28th of March; in ’52, the 18th of April; in ’53, the 23d
   </p>
   <p>
    of March; in ’54, about the 7th of April.
   </p>
   <p>
    Every incident connected with the breaking up of the rivers and ponds
   </p>
   <p>
    and the settling of the weather is particularly interesting to us who
   </p>
   <p>
    live in a climate of so great extremes. When the warmer days come, they
   </p>
   <p>
    who dwell near the river hear the ice crack at night with a startling
   </p>
   <p>
    whoop as loud as artillery, as if its icy fetters were rent from end to
   </p>
   <p>
    end, and within a few days see it rapidly going out. So the alligator
   </p>
   <p>
    comes out of the mud with quakings of the earth. One old man, who has
   </p>
   <p>
    been a close observer of Nature, and seems as thoroughly wise in regard
   </p>
   <p>
    to all her operations as if she had been put upon the stocks when he
   </p>
   <p>
    was a boy, and he had helped to lay her keel,—who has come to his
   </p>
   <p>
    growth, and can hardly acquire more of natural lore if he should live
   </p>
   <p>
    to the age of Methuselah,—told me, and I was surprised to hear him
   </p>
   <p>
    express wonder at any of Nature’s operations, for I thought that there
   </p>
   <p>
    were no secrets between them, that one spring day he took his gun and
   </p>
   <p>
    boat, and thought that he would have a little sport with the ducks.
   </p>
   <p>
    There was ice still on the meadows, but it was all gone out of the
   </p>
   <p>
    river, and he dropped down without obstruction from Sudbury, where he
   </p>
   <p>
    lived, to Fair-Haven Pond, which he found, unexpectedly, covered for
   </p>
   <p>
    the most part with a firm field of ice. It was a warm day, and he was
   </p>
   <p>
    surprised to see so great a body of ice remaining. Not seeing any
   </p>
   <p>
    ducks, he hid his boat on the north or back side of an island in the
   </p>
   <p>
    pond, and then concealed himself in the bushes on the south side, to
   </p>
   <p>
    await them. The ice was melted for three or four rods from the shore,
   </p>
   <p>
    and there was a smooth and warm sheet of water, with a muddy bottom,
   </p>
   <p>
    such as the ducks love, within, and he thought it likely that some
   </p>
   <p>
    would be along pretty soon. After he had lain still there about an hour
   </p>
   <p>
    he heard a low and seemingly very distant sound, but singularly grand
   </p>
   <p>
    and impressive, unlike any thing he had ever heard, gradually swelling
   </p>
   <p>
    and increasing as if it would have a universal and memorable ending, a
   </p>
   <p>
    sullen rush and roar, which seemed to him all at once like the sound of
   </p>
   <p>
    a vast body of fowl coming in to settle there, and, seizing his gun, he
   </p>
   <p>
    started up in haste and excited; but he found, to his surprise, that
   </p>
   <p>
    the whole body of the ice had started while he lay there, and drifted
   </p>
   <p>
    in to the shore, and the sound he had heard was made by its edge
   </p>
   <p>
    grating on the shore,—at first gently nibbled and crumbled off, but at
   </p>
   <p>
    length heaving up and scattering its wrecks along the island to a
   </p>
   <p>
    considerable height before it came to a stand still.
   </p>
   <p>
    At length the sun’s rays have attained the right angle, and warm winds
   </p>
   <p>
    blow up mist and rain and melt the snow banks, and the sun dispersing
   </p>
   <p>
    the mist smiles on a checkered landscape of russet and white smoking
   </p>
   <p>
    with incense, through which the traveller picks his way from islet to
   </p>
   <p>
    islet, cheered by the music of a thousand tinkling rills and rivulets
   </p>
   <p>
    whose veins are filled with the blood of winter which they are bearing
   </p>
   <p>
    off.
   </p>
   <p>
    Few phenomena gave me more delight than to observe the forms which
   </p>
   <p>
    thawing sand and clay assume in flowing down the sides of a deep cut on
   </p>
   <p>
    the railroad through which I passed on my way to the village, a
   </p>
   <p>
    phenomenon not very common on so large a scale, though the number of
   </p>
   <p>
    freshly exposed banks of the right material must have been greatly
   </p>
   <p>
    multiplied since railroads were invented. The material was sand of
   </p>
   <p>
    every degree of fineness and of various rich colors, commonly mixed
   </p>
   <p>
    with a little clay. When the frost comes out in the spring, and even in
   </p>
   <p>
    a thawing day in the winter, the sand begins to flow down the slopes
   </p>
   <p>
    like lava, sometimes bursting out through the snow and overflowing it
   </p>
   <p>
    where no sand was to be seen before. Innumerable little streams overlap
   </p>
   <p>
    and interlace one with another, exhibiting a sort of hybrid product,
   </p>
   <p>
    which obeys half way the law of currents, and half way that of
   </p>
   <p>
    vegetation. As it flows it takes the forms of sappy leaves or vines,
   </p>
   <p>
    making heaps of pulpy sprays a foot or more in depth, and resembling,
   </p>
   <p>
    as you look down on them, the laciniated, lobed, and imbricated
   </p>
   <p>
    thalluses of some lichens; or you are reminded of coral, of leopard’s
   </p>
   <p>
    paws or birds’ feet, of brains or lungs or bowels, and excrements of
   </p>
   <p>
    all kinds. It is a truly _grotesque_ vegetation, whose forms and color
   </p>
   <p>
    we see imitated in bronze, a sort of architectural foliage more ancient
   </p>
   <p>
    and typical than acanthus, chiccory, ivy, vine, or any vegetable
   </p>
   <p>
    leaves; destined perhaps, under some circumstances, to become a puzzle
   </p>
   <p>
    to future geologists. The whole cut impressed me as if it were a cave
   </p>
   <p>
    with its stalactites laid open to the light. The various shades of the
   </p>
   <p>
    sand are singularly rich and agreeable, embracing the different iron
   </p>
   <p>
    colors, brown, gray, yellowish, and reddish. When the flowing mass
   </p>
   <p>
    reaches the drain at the foot of the bank it spreads out flatter into
   </p>
   <p>
    _strands_, the separate streams losing their semi-cylindrical form and
   </p>
   <p>
    gradually becoming more flat and broad, running together as they are
   </p>
   <p>
    more moist, till they form an almost flat _sand_, still variously and
   </p>
   <p>
    beautifully shaded, but in which you can trace the original forms of
   </p>
   <p>
    vegetation; till at length, in the water itself, they are converted
   </p>
   <p>
    into _banks_, like those formed off the mouths of rivers, and the forms
   </p>
   <p>
    of vegetation are lost in the ripple marks on the bottom.
   </p>
   <p>
    The whole bank, which is from twenty to forty feet high, is sometimes
   </p>
   <p>
    overlaid with a mass of this kind of foliage, or sandy rupture, for a
   </p>
   <p>
    quarter of a mile on one or both sides, the produce of one spring day.
   </p>
   <p>
    What makes this sand foliage remarkable is its springing into existence
   </p>
   <p>
    thus suddenly. When I see on the one side the inert bank,—for the sun
   </p>
   <p>
    acts on one side first,—and on the other this luxuriant foliage, the
   </p>
   <p>
    creation of an hour, I am affected as if in a peculiar sense I stood in
   </p>
   <p>
    the laboratory of the Artist who made the world and me,—had come to
   </p>
   <p>
    where he was still at work, sporting on this bank, and with excess of
   </p>
   <p>
    energy strewing his fresh designs about. I feel as if I were nearer to
   </p>
   <p>
    the vitals of the globe, for this sandy overflow is something such a
   </p>
   <p>
    foliaceous mass as the vitals of the animal body. You find thus in the
   </p>
   <p>
    very sands an anticipation of the vegetable leaf. No wonder that the
   </p>
   <p>
    earth expresses itself outwardly in leaves, it so labors with the idea
   </p>
   <p>
    inwardly. The atoms have already learned this law, and are pregnant by
   </p>
   <p>
    it. The overhanging leaf sees here its prototype. _Internally_, whether
   </p>
   <p>
    in the globe or animal body, it is a moist thick _lobe_, a word
   </p>
   <p>
    especially applicable to the liver and lungs and the _leaves_ of fat,
   </p>
   <p>
    (?e?ß?, _labor_, _lapsus_, to flow or slip downward, a lapsing; ??ß??,
   </p>
   <p>
    _globus_, lobe, globe; also lap, flap, and many other words,)
   </p>
   <p>
    _externally_ a dry thin _leaf_, even as the _f_ and _v_ are a pressed
   </p>
   <p>
    and dried _b_. The radicals of _lobe_ are _lb_, the soft mass of the
   </p>
   <p>
    _b_ (single lobed, or B, double lobed,) with the liquid _l_ behind it
   </p>
   <p>
    pressing it forward. In globe, _glb_, the guttural _g_ adds to the
   </p>
   <p>
    meaning the capacity of the throat. The feathers and wings of birds are
   </p>
   <p>
    still drier and thinner leaves. Thus, also, you pass from the lumpish
   </p>
   <p>
    grub in the earth to the airy and fluttering butterfly. The very globe
   </p>
   <p>
    continually transcends and translates itself, and becomes winged in its
   </p>
   <p>
    orbit. Even ice begins with delicate crystal leaves, as if it had
   </p>
   <p>
    flowed into moulds which the fronds of water plants have impressed on
   </p>
   <p>
    the watery mirror. The whole tree itself is but one leaf, and rivers
   </p>
   <p>
    are still vaster leaves whose pulp is intervening earth, and towns and
   </p>
   <p>
    cities are the ova of insects in their axils.
   </p>
   <p>
    When the sun withdraws the sand ceases to flow, but in the morning the
   </p>
   <p>
    streams will start once more and branch and branch again into a myriad
   </p>
   <p>
    of others. You here see perchance how blood vessels are formed. If you
   </p>
   <p>
    look closely you observe that first there pushes forward from the
   </p>
   <p>
    thawing mass a stream of softened sand with a drop-like point, like the
   </p>
   <p>
    ball of the finger, feeling its way slowly and blindly downward, until
   </p>
   <p>
    at last with more heat and moisture, as the sun gets higher, the most
   </p>
   <p>
    fluid portion, in its effort to obey the law to which the most inert
   </p>
   <p>
    also yields, separates from the latter and forms for itself a
   </p>
   <p>
    meandering channel or artery within that, in which is seen a little
   </p>
   <p>
    silvery stream glancing like lightning from one stage of pulpy leaves
   </p>
   <p>
    or branches to another, and ever and anon swallowed up in the sand. It
   </p>
   <p>
    is wonderful how rapidly yet perfectly the sand organizes itself as it
   </p>
   <p>
    flows, using the best material its mass affords to form the sharp edges
   </p>
   <p>
    of its channel. Such are the sources of rivers. In the silicious matter
   </p>
   <p>
    which the water deposits is perhaps the bony system, and in the still
   </p>
   <p>
    finer soil and organic matter the fleshy fibre or cellular tissue. What
   </p>
   <p>
    is man but a mass of thawing clay? The ball of the human finger is but
   </p>
   <p>
    a drop congealed. The fingers and toes flow to their extent from the
   </p>
   <p>
    thawing mass of the body. Who knows what the human body would expand
   </p>
   <p>
    and flow out to under a more genial heaven? Is not the hand a spreading
   </p>
   <p>
    _palm_ leaf with its lobes and veins? The ear may be regarded,
   </p>
   <p>
    fancifully, as a lichen, _umbilicaria_, on the side of the head, with
   </p>
   <p>
    its lobe or drop. The lip—_labium_, from _labor_ (?)—laps or lapses
   </p>
   <p>
    from the sides of the cavernous mouth. The nose is a manifest congealed
   </p>
   <p>
    drop or stalactite. The chin is a still larger drop, the confluent
   </p>
   <p>
    dripping of the face. The cheeks are a slide from the brows into the
   </p>
   <p>
    valley of the face, opposed and diffused by the cheek bones. Each
   </p>
   <p>
    rounded lobe of the vegetable leaf, too, is a thick and now loitering
   </p>
   <p>
    drop, larger or smaller; the lobes are the fingers of the leaf; and as
   </p>
   <p>
    many lobes as it has, in so many directions it tends to flow, and more
   </p>
   <p>
    heat or other genial influences would have caused it to flow yet
   </p>
   <p>
    farther.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus it seemed that this one hillside illustrated the principle of all
   </p>
   <p>
    the operations of Nature. The Maker of this earth but patented a leaf.
   </p>
   <p>
    What Champollion will decipher this hieroglyphic for us, that we may
   </p>
   <p>
    turn over a new leaf at last? This phenomenon is more exhilarating to
   </p>
   <p>
    me than the luxuriance and fertility of vineyards. True, it is somewhat
   </p>
   <p>
    excrementitious in its character, and there is no end to the heaps of
   </p>
   <p>
    liver lights and bowels, as if the globe were turned wrong side
   </p>
   <p>
    outward; but this suggests at least that Nature has some bowels, and
   </p>
   <p>
    there again is mother of humanity. This is the frost coming out of the
   </p>
   <p>
    ground; this is Spring. It precedes the green and flowery spring, as
   </p>
   <p>
    mythology precedes regular poetry. I know of nothing more purgative of
   </p>
   <p>
    winter fumes and indigestions. It convinces me that Earth is still in
   </p>
   <p>
    her swaddling clothes, and stretches forth baby fingers on every side.
   </p>
   <p>
    Fresh curls spring from the baldest brow. There is nothing inorganic.
   </p>
   <p>
    These foliaceous heaps lie along the bank like the slag of a furnace,
   </p>
   <p>
    showing that Nature is “in full blast” within. The earth is not a mere
   </p>
   <p>
    fragment of dead history, stratum upon stratum like the leaves of a
   </p>
   <p>
    book, to be studied by geologists and antiquaries chiefly, but living
   </p>
   <p>
    poetry like the leaves of a tree, which precede flowers and fruit,—not
   </p>
   <p>
    a fossil earth, but a living earth; compared with whose great central
   </p>
   <p>
    life all animal and vegetable life is merely parasitic. Its throes will
   </p>
   <p>
    heave our exuviæ from their graves. You may melt your metals and cast
   </p>
   <p>
    them into the most beautiful moulds you can; they will never excite me
   </p>
   <p>
    like the forms which this molten earth flows out into. And not only it,
   </p>
   <p>
    but the institutions upon it, are plastic like clay in the hands of the
   </p>
   <p>
    potter.
   </p>
   <p>
    Ere long, not only on these banks, but on every hill and plain and in
   </p>
   <p>
    every hollow, the frost comes out of the ground like a dormant
   </p>
   <p>
    quadruped from its burrow, and seeks the sea with music, or migrates to
   </p>
   <p>
    other climes in clouds. Thaw with his gentle persuasion is more
   </p>
   <p>
    powerful than Thor with his hammer. The one melts, the other but breaks
   </p>
   <p>
    in pieces.
   </p>
   <p>
    When the ground was partially bare of snow, and a few warm days had
   </p>
   <p>
    dried its surface somewhat, it was pleasant to compare the first tender
   </p>
   <p>
    signs of the infant year just peeping forth with the stately beauty of
   </p>
   <p>
    the withered vegetation which had withstood the
   </p>
   <p>
    winter,—life-everlasting, golden-rods, pinweeds, and graceful wild
   </p>
   <p>
    grasses, more obvious and interesting frequently than in summer even,
   </p>
   <p>
    as if their beauty was not ripe till then; even cotton-grass,
   </p>
   <p>
    cat-tails, mulleins, johnswort, hard-hack, meadow-sweet, and other
   </p>
   <p>
    strong stemmed plants, those unexhausted granaries which entertain the
   </p>
   <p>
    earliest birds,—decent weeds, at least, which widowed Nature wears. I
   </p>
   <p>
    am particularly attracted by the arching and sheaf-like top of the
   </p>
   <p>
    wool-grass; it brings back the summer to our winter memories, and is
   </p>
   <p>
    among the forms which art loves to copy, and which, in the vegetable
   </p>
   <p>
    kingdom, have the same relation to types already in the mind of man
   </p>
   <p>
    that astronomy has. It is an antique style older than Greek or
   </p>
   <p>
    Egyptian. Many of the phenomena of Winter are suggestive of an
   </p>
   <p>
    inexpressible tenderness and fragile delicacy. We are accustomed to
   </p>
   <p>
    hear this king described as a rude and boisterous tyrant; but with the
   </p>
   <p>
    gentleness of a lover he adorns the tresses of Summer.
   </p>
   <p>
    At the approach of spring the red-squirrels got under my house, two at
   </p>
   <p>
    a time, directly under my feet as I sat reading or writing, and kept up
   </p>
   <p>
    the queerest chuckling and chirruping and vocal pirouetting and
   </p>
   <p>
    gurgling sounds that ever were heard; and when I stamped they only
   </p>
   <p>
    chirruped the louder, as if past all fear and respect in their mad
   </p>
   <p>
    pranks, defying humanity to stop them. No you
   </p>
   <p>
    don’t—chickaree—chickaree. They were wholly deaf to my arguments, or
   </p>
   <p>
    failed to perceive their force, and fell into a strain of invective
   </p>
   <p>
    that was irresistible.
   </p>
   <p>
    The first sparrow of spring! The year beginning with younger hope than
   </p>
   <p>
    ever! The faint silvery warblings heard over the partially bare and
   </p>
   <p>
    moist fields from the blue-bird, the song-sparrow, and the red-wing, as
   </p>
   <p>
    if the last flakes of winter tinkled as they fell! What at such a time
   </p>
   <p>
    are histories, chronologies, traditions, and all written revelations?
   </p>
   <p>
    The brooks sing carols and glees to the spring. The marsh-hawk sailing
   </p>
   <p>
    low over the meadow is already seeking the first slimy life that
   </p>
   <p>
    awakes. The sinking sound of melting snow is heard in all dells, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the ice dissolves apace in the ponds. The grass flames up on the
   </p>
   <p>
    hillsides like a spring fire,—“et primitus oritur herba imbribus
   </p>
   <p>
    primoribus evocata,”—as if the earth sent forth an inward heat to greet
   </p>
   <p>
    the returning sun; not yellow but green is the color of its flame;—the
   </p>
   <p>
    symbol of perpetual youth, the grass-blade, like a long green ribbon,
   </p>
   <p>
    streams from the sod into the summer, checked indeed by the frost, but
   </p>
   <p>
    anon pushing on again, lifting its spear of last year’s hay with the
   </p>
   <p>
    fresh life below. It grows as steadily as the rill oozes out of the
   </p>
   <p>
    ground. It is almost identical with that, for in the growing days of
   </p>
   <p>
    June, when the rills are dry, the grass blades are their channels, and
   </p>
   <p>
    from year to year the herds drink at this perennial green stream, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the mower draws from it betimes their winter supply. So our human life
   </p>
   <p>
    but dies down to its root, and still puts forth its green blade to
   </p>
   <p>
    eternity.
   </p>
   <p>
    Walden is melting apace. There is a canal two rods wide along the
   </p>
   <p>
    northerly and westerly sides, and wider still at the east end. A great
   </p>
   <p>
    field of ice has cracked off from the main body. I hear a song-sparrow
   </p>
   <p>
    singing from the bushes on the shore,—_olit_, _olit_, _olit,_—_chip_,
   </p>
   <p>
    _chip_, _chip_, _che char_,—_che wiss_, _wiss_, _wiss_. He too is
   </p>
   <p>
    helping to crack it. How handsome the great sweeping curves in the edge
   </p>
   <p>
    of the ice, answering somewhat to those of the shore, but more regular!
   </p>
   <p>
    It is unusually hard, owing to the recent severe but transient cold,
   </p>
   <p>
    and all watered or waved like a palace floor. But the wind slides
   </p>
   <p>
    eastward over its opaque surface in vain, till it reaches the living
   </p>
   <p>
    surface beyond. It is glorious to behold this ribbon of water sparkling
   </p>
   <p>
    in the sun, the bare face of the pond full of glee and youth, as if it
   </p>
   <p>
    spoke the joy of the fishes within it, and of the sands on its shore,—a
   </p>
   <p>
    silvery sheen as from the scales of a _leuciscus_, as it were all one
   </p>
   <p>
    active fish. Such is the contrast between winter and spring. Walden was
   </p>
   <p>
    dead and is alive again. But this spring it broke up more steadily, as
   </p>
   <p>
    I have said.
   </p>
   <p>
    The change from storm and winter to serene and mild weather, from dark
   </p>
   <p>
    and sluggish hours to bright and elastic ones, is a memorable crisis
   </p>
   <p>
    which all things proclaim. It is seemingly instantaneous at last.
   </p>
   <p>
    Suddenly an influx of light filled my house, though the evening was at
   </p>
   <p>
    hand, and the clouds of winter still overhung it, and the eaves were
   </p>
   <p>
    dripping with sleety rain. I looked out the window, and lo! where
   </p>
   <p>
    yesterday was cold gray ice there lay the transparent pond already calm
   </p>
   <p>
    and full of hope as in a summer evening, reflecting a summer evening
   </p>
   <p>
    sky in its bosom, though none was visible overhead, as if it had
   </p>
   <p>
    intelligence with some remote horizon. I heard a robin in the distance,
   </p>
   <p>
    the first I had heard for many a thousand years, methought, whose note
   </p>
   <p>
    I shall not forget for many a thousand more,—the same sweet and
   </p>
   <p>
    powerful song as of yore. O the evening robin, at the end of a New
   </p>
   <p>
    England summer day! If I could ever find the twig he sits upon! I mean
   </p>
   <p>
    _he_; I mean _the twig_. This at least is not the _Turdus migratorius_.
   </p>
   <p>
    The pitch-pines and shrub-oaks about my house, which had so long
   </p>
   <p>
    drooped, suddenly resumed their several characters, looked brighter,
   </p>
   <p>
    greener, and more erect and alive, as if effectually cleansed and
   </p>
   <p>
    restored by the rain. I knew that it would not rain any more. You may
   </p>
   <p>
    tell by looking at any twig of the forest, ay, at your very wood-pile,
   </p>
   <p>
    whether its winter is past or not. As it grew darker, I was startled by
   </p>
   <p>
    the _honking_ of geese flying low over the woods, like weary travellers
   </p>
   <p>
    getting in late from southern lakes, and indulging at last in
   </p>
   <p>
    unrestrained complaint and mutual consolation. Standing at my door, I
   </p>
   <p>
    could hear the rush of their wings; when, driving toward my house, they
   </p>
   <p>
    suddenly spied my light, and with hushed clamor wheeled and settled in
   </p>
   <p>
    the pond. So I came in, and shut the door, and passed my first spring
   </p>
   <p>
    night in the woods.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the morning I watched the geese from the door through the mist,
   </p>
   <p>
    sailing in the middle of the pond, fifty rods off, so large and
   </p>
   <p>
    tumultuous that Walden appeared like an artificial pond for their
   </p>
   <p>
    amusement. But when I stood on the shore they at once rose up with a
   </p>
   <p>
    great flapping of wings at the signal of their commander, and when they
   </p>
   <p>
    had got into rank circled about over my head, twenty-nine of them, and
   </p>
   <p>
    then steered straight to Canada, with a regular _honk_ from the leader
   </p>
   <p>
    at intervals, trusting to break their fast in muddier pools. A “plump”
   </p>
   <p>
    of ducks rose at the same time and took the route to the north in the
   </p>
   <p>
    wake of their noisier cousins.
   </p>
   <p>
    For a week I heard the circling, groping clangor of some solitary goose
   </p>
   <p>
    in the foggy mornings, seeking its companion, and still peopling the
   </p>
   <p>
    woods with the sound of a larger life than they could sustain. In April
   </p>
   <p>
    the pigeons were seen again flying express in small flocks, and in due
   </p>
   <p>
    time I heard the martins twittering over my clearing, though it had not
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed that the township contained so many that it could afford me any,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I fancied that they were peculiarly of the ancient race that dwelt
   </p>
   <p>
    in hollow trees ere white men came. In almost all climes the tortoise
   </p>
   <p>
    and the frog are among the precursors and heralds of this season, and
   </p>
   <p>
    birds fly with song and glancing plumage, and plants spring and bloom,
   </p>
   <p>
    and winds blow, to correct this slight oscillation of the poles and
   </p>
   <p>
    preserve the equilibrium of Nature.
   </p>
   <p>
    As every season seems best to us in its turn, so the coming in of
   </p>
   <p>
    spring is like the creation of Cosmos out of Chaos and the realization
   </p>
   <p>
    of the Golden Age.—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Eurus ad Auroram Nabathæaque regna recessit,
   </p>
   <p>
    Persidaque, et radiis juga subdita matutinis.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “The East-Wind withdrew to Aurora and the Nabathæan kingdom,
   </p>
   <p>
    And the Persian, and the ridges placed under the morning rays
   </p>
   <p>
    *    *    *    *
   </p>
   <p>
    Man was born.  Whether that Artificer of things,
   </p>
   <p>
    The origin of a better world, made him from the divine seed;
   </p>
   <p>
    Or the earth, being recent and lately sundered from the high
   </p>
   <p>
    Ether, retained some seeds of cognate heaven.”
   </p>
   <p>
    A single gentle rain makes the grass many shades greener. So our
   </p>
   <p>
    prospects brighten on the influx of better thoughts. We should be
   </p>
   <p>
    blessed if we lived in the present always, and took advantage of every
   </p>
   <p>
    accident that befell us, like the grass which confesses the influence
   </p>
   <p>
    of the slightest dew that falls on it; and did not spend our time in
   </p>
   <p>
    atoning for the neglect of past opportunities, which we call doing our
   </p>
   <p>
    duty. We loiter in winter while it is already spring. In a pleasant
   </p>
   <p>
    spring morning all men’s sins are forgiven. Such a day is a truce to
   </p>
   <p>
    vice. While such a sun holds out to burn, the vilest sinner may return.
   </p>
   <p>
    Through our own recovered innocence we discern the innocence of our
   </p>
   <p>
    neighbors. You may have known your neighbor yesterday for a thief, a
   </p>
   <p>
    drunkard, or a sensualist, and merely pitied or despised him, and
   </p>
   <p>
    despaired of the world; but the sun shines bright and warm this first
   </p>
   <p>
    spring morning, re-creating the world, and you meet him at some serene
   </p>
   <p>
    work, and see how his exhausted and debauched veins expand with still
   </p>
   <p>
    joy and bless the new day, feel the spring influence with the innocence
   </p>
   <p>
    of infancy, and all his faults are forgotten. There is not only an
   </p>
   <p>
    atmosphere of good will about him, but even a savor of holiness groping
   </p>
   <p>
    for expression, blindly and ineffectually perhaps, like a new-born
   </p>
   <p>
    instinct, and for a short hour the south hill-side echoes to no vulgar
   </p>
   <p>
    jest. You see some innocent fair shoots preparing to burst from his
   </p>
   <p>
    gnarled rind and try another year’s life, tender and fresh as the
   </p>
   <p>
    youngest plant. Even he has entered into the joy of his Lord. Why the
   </p>
   <p>
    jailer does not leave open his prison doors,—why the judge does not
   </p>
   <p>
    dismis his case,—why the preacher does not dismiss his congregation! It
   </p>
   <p>
    is because they do not obey the hint which God gives them, nor accept
   </p>
   <p>
    the pardon which he freely offers to all.
   </p>
   <p>
    “A return to goodness produced each day in the tranquil and beneficent
   </p>
   <p>
    breath of the morning, causes that in respect to the love of virtue and
   </p>
   <p>
    the hatred of vice, one approaches a little the primitive nature of
   </p>
   <p>
    man, as the sprouts of the forest which has been felled. In like manner
   </p>
   <p>
    the evil which one does in the interval of a day prevents the germs of
   </p>
   <p>
    virtues which began to spring up again from developing themselves and
   </p>
   <p>
    destroys them.
   </p>
   <p>
    “After the germs of virtue have thus been prevented many times from
   </p>
   <p>
    developing themselves, then the beneficent breath of evening does not
   </p>
   <p>
    suffice to preserve them. As soon as the breath of evening does not
   </p>
   <p>
    suffice longer to preserve them, then the nature of man does not differ
   </p>
   <p>
    much from that of the brute. Men seeing the nature of this man like
   </p>
   <p>
    that of the brute, think that he has never possessed the innate faculty
   </p>
   <p>
    of reason. Are those the true and natural sentiments of man?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “The Golden Age was first created, which without any avenger
   </p>
   <p>
    Spontaneously without law cherished fidelity and rectitude.
   </p>
   <p>
    Punishment and fear were not; nor were threatening words read
   </p>
   <p>
    On suspended brass; nor did the suppliant crowd fear
   </p>
   <p>
    The words of their judge; but were safe without an avenger.
   </p>
   <p>
    Not yet the pine felled on its mountains had descended
   </p>
   <p>
    To the liquid waves that it might see a foreign world,
   </p>
   <p>
    And mortals knew no shores but their own.
   </p>
   <p>
    *    *    *    *
   </p>
   <p>
    There was eternal spring, and placid zephyrs with warm
   </p>
   <p>
    Blasts soothed the flowers born without seed.”
   </p>
   <p>
    On the 29th of April, as I was fishing from the bank of the river near
   </p>
   <p>
    the Nine-Acre-Corner bridge, standing on the quaking grass and willow
   </p>
   <p>
    roots, where the muskrats lurk, I heard a singular rattling sound,
   </p>
   <p>
    somewhat like that of the sticks which boys play with their fingers,
   </p>
   <p>
    when, looking up, I observed a very slight and graceful hawk, like a
   </p>
   <p>
    night-hawk, alternately soaring like a ripple and tumbling a rod or two
   </p>
   <p>
    over and over, showing the underside of its wings, which gleamed like a
   </p>
   <p>
    satin ribbon in the sun, or like the pearly inside of a shell. This
   </p>
   <p>
    sight reminded me of falconry and what nobleness and poetry are
   </p>
   <p>
    associated with that sport. The Merlin it seemed to me it might be
   </p>
   <p>
    called: but I care not for its name. It was the most ethereal flight I
   </p>
   <p>
    had ever witnessed. It did not simply flutter like a butterfly, nor
   </p>
   <p>
    soar like the larger hawks, but it sported with proud reliance in the
   </p>
   <p>
    fields of air; mounting again and again with its strange chuckle, it
   </p>
   <p>
    repeated its free and beautiful fall, turning over and over like a
   </p>
   <p>
    kite, and then recovering from its lofty tumbling, as if it had never
   </p>
   <p>
    set its foot on _terra firma_. It appeared to have no companion in the
   </p>
   <p>
    universe,—sporting there alone,—and to need none but the morning and
   </p>
   <p>
    the ether with which it played. It was not lonely, but made all the
   </p>
   <p>
    earth lonely beneath it. Where was the parent which hatched it, its
   </p>
   <p>
    kindred, and its father in the heavens? The tenant of the air, it
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed related to the earth but by an egg hatched some time in the
   </p>
   <p>
    crevice of a crag;—or was its native nest made in the angle of a cloud,
   </p>
   <p>
    woven of the rainbow’s trimmings and the sunset sky, and lined with
   </p>
   <p>
    some soft midsummer haze caught up from earth? Its eyry now some cliffy
   </p>
   <p>
    cloud.
   </p>
   <p>
    Beside this I got a rare mess of golden and silver and bright cupreous
   </p>
   <p>
    fishes, which looked like a string of jewels. Ah! I have penetrated to
   </p>
   <p>
    those meadows on the morning of many a first spring day, jumping from
   </p>
   <p>
    hummock to hummock, from willow root to willow root, when the wild
   </p>
   <p>
    river valley and the woods were bathed in so pure and bright a light as
   </p>
   <p>
    would have waked the dead, if they had been slumbering in their graves,
   </p>
   <p>
    as some suppose. There needs no stronger proof of immortality. All
   </p>
   <p>
    things must live in such a light. O Death, where was thy sting? O
   </p>
   <p>
    Grave, where was thy victory, then?
   </p>
   <p>
    Our village life would stagnate if it were not for the unexplored
   </p>
   <p>
    forests and meadows which surround it. We need the tonic of
   </p>
   <p>
    wildness,—to wade sometimes in marshes where the bittern and the
   </p>
   <p>
    meadow-hen lurk, and hear the booming of the snipe; to smell the
   </p>
   <p>
    whispering sedge where only some wilder and more solitary fowl builds
   </p>
   <p>
    her nest, and the mink crawls with its belly close to the ground. At
   </p>
   <p>
    the same time that we are earnest to explore and learn all things, we
   </p>
   <p>
    require that all things be mysterious and unexplorable, that land and
   </p>
   <p>
    sea be infinitely wild, unsurveyed and unfathomed by us because
   </p>
   <p>
    unfathomable. We can never have enough of Nature. We must be refreshed
   </p>
   <p>
    by the sight of inexhaustible vigor, vast and Titanic features, the
   </p>
   <p>
    sea-coast with its wrecks, the wilderness with its living and its
   </p>
   <p>
    decaying trees, the thunder cloud, and the rain which lasts three weeks
   </p>
   <p>
    and produces freshets. We need to witness our own limits transgressed,
   </p>
   <p>
    and some life pasturing freely where we never wander. We are cheered
   </p>
   <p>
    when we observe the vulture feeding on the carrion which disgusts and
   </p>
   <p>
    disheartens us and deriving health and strength from the repast. There
   </p>
   <p>
    was a dead horse in the hollow by the path to my house, which compelled
   </p>
   <p>
    me sometimes to go out of my way, especially in the night when the air
   </p>
   <p>
    was heavy, but the assurance it gave me of the strong appetite and
   </p>
   <p>
    inviolable health of Nature was my compensation for this. I love to see
   </p>
   <p>
    that Nature is so rife with life that myriads can be afforded to be
   </p>
   <p>
    sacrificed and suffered to prey on one another; that tender
   </p>
   <p>
    organizations can be so serenely squashed out of existence like
   </p>
   <p>
    pulp,—tadpoles which herons gobble up, and tortoises and toads run over
   </p>
   <p>
    in the road; and that sometimes it has rained flesh and blood! With the
   </p>
   <p>
    liability to accident, we must see how little account is to be made of
   </p>
   <p>
    it. The impression made on a wise man is that of universal innocence.
   </p>
   <p>
    Poison is not poisonous after all, nor are any wounds fatal. Compassion
   </p>
   <p>
    is a very untenable ground. It must be expeditious. Its pleadings will
   </p>
   <p>
    not bear to be stereotyped.
   </p>
   <p>
    Early in May, the oaks, hickories, maples, and other trees, just
   </p>
   <p>
    putting out amidst the pine woods around the pond, imparted a
   </p>
   <p>
    brightness like sunshine to the landscape, especially in cloudy days,
   </p>
   <p>
    as if the sun were breaking through mists and shining faintly on the
   </p>
   <p>
    hill-sides here and there. On the third or fourth of May I saw a loon
   </p>
   <p>
    in the pond, and during the first week of the month I heard the
   </p>
   <p>
    whippoorwill, the brown-thrasher, the veery, the wood-pewee, the
   </p>
   <p>
    chewink, and other birds. I had heard the wood-thrush long before. The
   </p>
   <p>
    phœbe had already come once more and looked in at my door and window,
   </p>
   <p>
    to see if my house was cavern-like enough for her, sustaining herself
   </p>
   <p>
    on humming wings with clinched talons, as if she held by the air, while
   </p>
   <p>
    she surveyed the premises. The sulphur-like pollen of the pitch-pine
   </p>
   <p>
    soon covered the pond and the stones and rotten wood along the shore,
   </p>
   <p>
    so that you could have collected a barrel-ful. This is the “sulphur
   </p>
   <p>
    showers” we hear of. Even in Calidas’ drama of Sacontala, we read of
   </p>
   <p>
    “rills dyed yellow with the golden dust of the lotus.” And so the
   </p>
   <p>
    seasons went rolling on into summer, as one rambles into higher and
   </p>
   <p>
    higher grass.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus was my first year’s life in the woods completed; and the second
   </p>
   <p>
    year was similar to it. I finally left Walden September 6th, 1847.
   </p>
   <p>
    Conclusion
   </p>
   <p>
    To the sick the doctors wisely recommend a change of air and scenery.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thank Heaven, here is not all the world. The buck-eye does not grow in
   </p>
   <p>
    New England, and the mocking-bird is rarely heard here. The wild-goose
   </p>
   <p>
    is more of a cosmopolite than we; he breaks his fast in Canada, takes a
   </p>
   <p>
    luncheon in the Ohio, and plumes himself for the night in a southern
   </p>
   <p>
    bayou. Even the bison, to some extent, keeps pace with the seasons,
   </p>
   <p>
    cropping the pastures of the Colorado only till a greener and sweeter
   </p>
   <p>
    grass awaits him by the Yellowstone. Yet we think that if rail-fences
   </p>
   <p>
    are pulled down, and stone-walls piled up on our farms, bounds are
   </p>
   <p>
    henceforth set to our lives and our fates decided. If you are chosen
   </p>
   <p>
    town-clerk, forsooth, you cannot go to Tierra del Fuego this summer:
   </p>
   <p>
    but you may go to the land of infernal fire nevertheless. The universe
   </p>
   <p>
    is wider than our views of it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet we should oftener look over the tafferel of our craft, like curious
   </p>
   <p>
    passengers, and not make the voyage like stupid sailors picking oakum.
   </p>
   <p>
    The other side of the globe is but the home of our correspondent. Our
   </p>
   <p>
    voyaging is only great-circle sailing, and the doctors prescribe for
   </p>
   <p>
    diseases of the skin merely. One hastens to Southern Africa to chase
   </p>
   <p>
    the giraffe; but surely that is not the game he would be after. How
   </p>
   <p>
    long, pray, would a man hunt giraffes if he could? Snipes and woodcocks
   </p>
   <p>
    also may afford rare sport; but I trust it would be nobler game to
   </p>
   <p>
    shoot one’s self.—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Direct your eye right inward, and you’ll find
   </p>
   <p>
    A thousand regions in your mind
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet undiscovered. Travel them, and be
   </p>
   <p>
    Expert in home-cosmography.”
   </p>
   <p>
    What does Africa,—what does the West stand for? Is not our own interior
   </p>
   <p>
    white on the chart? black though it may prove, like the coast, when
   </p>
   <p>
    discovered. Is it the source of the Nile, or the Niger, or the
   </p>
   <p>
    Mississippi, or a North-West Passage around this continent, that we
   </p>
   <p>
    would find? Are these the problems which most concern mankind? Is
   </p>
   <p>
    Franklin the only man who is lost, that his wife should be so earnest
   </p>
   <p>
    to find him? Does Mr. Grinnell know where he himself is? Be rather the
   </p>
   <p>
    Mungo Park, the Lewis and Clarke and Frobisher, of your own streams and
   </p>
   <p>
    oceans; explore your own higher latitudes,—with shiploads of preserved
   </p>
   <p>
    meats to support you, if they be necessary; and pile the empty cans
   </p>
   <p>
    sky-high for a sign. Were preserved meats invented to preserve meat
   </p>
   <p>
    merely? Nay, be a Columbus to whole new continents and worlds within
   </p>
   <p>
    you, opening new channels, not of trade, but of thought. Every man is
   </p>
   <p>
    the lord of a realm beside which the earthly empire of the Czar is but
   </p>
   <p>
    a petty state, a hummock left by the ice. Yet some can be patriotic who
   </p>
   <p>
    have no _self_-respect, and sacrifice the greater to the less. They
   </p>
   <p>
    love the soil which makes their graves, but have no sympathy with the
   </p>
   <p>
    spirit which may still animate their clay. Patriotism is a maggot in
   </p>
   <p>
    their heads. What was the meaning of that South-Sea Exploring
   </p>
   <p>
    Expedition, with all its parade and expense, but an indirect
   </p>
   <p>
    recognition of the fact, that there are continents and seas in the
   </p>
   <p>
    moral world to which every man is an isthmus or an inlet, yet
   </p>
   <p>
    unexplored by him, but that it is easier to sail many thousand miles
   </p>
   <p>
    through cold and storm and cannibals, in a government ship, with five
   </p>
   <p>
    hundred men and boys to assist one, than it is to explore the private
   </p>
   <p>
    sea, the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean of one’s being alone.—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Erret, et extremos alter scrutetur Iberos.
   </p>
   <p>
    Plus habet hic vitæ, plus habet ille viæ.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Let them wander and scrutinize the outlandish Australians.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have more of God, they more of the road.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is not worth the while to go round the world to count the cats in
   </p>
   <p>
    Zanzibar. Yet do this even till you can do better, and you may perhaps
   </p>
   <p>
    find some “Symmes’ Hole” by which to get at the inside at last. England
   </p>
   <p>
    and France, Spain and Portugal, Gold Coast and Slave Coast, all front
   </p>
   <p>
    on this private sea; but no bark from them has ventured out of sight of
   </p>
   <p>
    land, though it is without doubt the direct way to India. If you would
   </p>
   <p>
    learn to speak all tongues and conform to the customs of all nations,
   </p>
   <p>
    if you would travel farther than all travellers, be naturalized in all
   </p>
   <p>
    climes, and cause the Sphinx to dash her head against a stone, even
   </p>
   <p>
    obey the precept of the old philosopher, and Explore thyself. Herein
   </p>
   <p>
    are demanded the eye and the nerve. Only the defeated and deserters go
   </p>
   <p>
    to the wars, cowards that run away and enlist. Start now on that
   </p>
   <p>
    farthest western way, which does not pause at the Mississippi or the
   </p>
   <p>
    Pacific, nor conduct toward a worn-out China or Japan, but leads on
   </p>
   <p>
    direct a tangent to this sphere, summer and winter, day and night, sun
   </p>
   <p>
    down, moon down, and at last earth down too.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is said that Mirabeau took to highway robbery “to ascertain what
   </p>
   <p>
    degree of resolution was necessary in order to place one’s self in
   </p>
   <p>
    formal opposition to the most sacred laws of society.” He declared that
   </p>
   <p>
    “a soldier who fights in the ranks does not require half so much
   </p>
   <p>
    courage as a foot-pad,”—“that honor and religion have never stood in
   </p>
   <p>
    the way of a well-considered and a firm resolve.” This was manly, as
   </p>
   <p>
    the world goes; and yet it was idle, if not desperate. A saner man
   </p>
   <p>
    would have found himself often enough “in formal opposition” to what
   </p>
   <p>
    are deemed “the most sacred laws of society,” through obedience to yet
   </p>
   <p>
    more sacred laws, and so have tested his resolution without going out
   </p>
   <p>
    of his way. It is not for a man to put himself in such an attitude to
   </p>
   <p>
    society, but to maintain himself in whatever attitude he find himself
   </p>
   <p>
    through obedience to the laws of his being, which will never be one of
   </p>
   <p>
    opposition to a just government, if he should chance to meet with such.
   </p>
   <p>
    I left the woods for as good a reason as I went there. Perhaps it
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed to me that I had several more lives to live, and could not spare
   </p>
   <p>
    any more time for that one. It is remarkable how easily and insensibly
   </p>
   <p>
    we fall into a particular route, and make a beaten track for ourselves.
   </p>
   <p>
    I had not lived there a week before my feet wore a path from my door to
   </p>
   <p>
    the pond-side; and though it is five or six years since I trod it, it
   </p>
   <p>
    is still quite distinct. It is true, I fear that others may have fallen
   </p>
   <p>
    into it, and so helped to keep it open. The surface of the earth is
   </p>
   <p>
    soft and impressible by the feet of men; and so with the paths which
   </p>
   <p>
    the mind travels. How worn and dusty, then, must be the highways of the
   </p>
   <p>
    world, how deep the ruts of tradition and conformity! I did not wish to
   </p>
   <p>
    take a cabin passage, but rather to go before the mast and on the deck
   </p>
   <p>
    of the world, for there I could best see the moonlight amid the
   </p>
   <p>
    mountains. I do not wish to go below now.
   </p>
   <p>
    I learned this, at least, by my experiment; that if one advances
   </p>
   <p>
    confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the
   </p>
   <p>
    life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in
   </p>
   <p>
    common hours. He will put some things behind, will pass an invisible
   </p>
   <p>
    boundary; new, universal, and more liberal laws will begin to establish
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves around and within him; or the old laws be expanded, and
   </p>
   <p>
    interpreted in his favor in a more liberal sense, and he will live with
   </p>
   <p>
    the license of a higher order of beings. In proportion as he simplifies
   </p>
   <p>
    his life, the laws of the universe will appear less complex, and
   </p>
   <p>
    solitude will not be solitude, nor poverty poverty, nor weakness
   </p>
   <p>
    weakness. If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be
   </p>
   <p>
    lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is a ridiculous demand which England and America make, that you
   </p>
   <p>
    shall speak so that they can understand you. Neither men nor
   </p>
   <p>
    toad-stools grow so. As if that were important, and there were not
   </p>
   <p>
    enough to understand you without them. As if Nature could support but
   </p>
   <p>
    one order of understandings, could not sustain birds as well as
   </p>
   <p>
    quadrupeds, flying as well as creeping things, and _hush_ and _who_,
   </p>
   <p>
    which Bright can understand, were the best English. As if there were
   </p>
   <p>
    safety in stupidity alone. I fear chiefly lest my expression may not be
   </p>
   <p>
    _extra-vagant_ enough, may not wander far enough beyond the narrow
   </p>
   <p>
    limits of my daily experience, so as to be adequate to the truth of
   </p>
   <p>
    which I have been convinced. _Extra vagance!_ it depends on how you are
   </p>
   <p>
    yarded. The migrating buffalo, which seeks new pastures in another
   </p>
   <p>
    latitude, is not extravagant like the cow which kicks over the pail,
   </p>
   <p>
    leaps the cow-yard fence, and runs after her calf, in milking time. I
   </p>
   <p>
    desire to speak somewhere _without_ bounds; like a man in a waking
   </p>
   <p>
    moment, to men in their waking moments; for I am convinced that I
   </p>
   <p>
    cannot exaggerate enough even to lay the foundation of a true
   </p>
   <p>
    expression. Who that has heard a strain of music feared then lest he
   </p>
   <p>
    should speak extravagantly any more forever? In view of the future or
   </p>
   <p>
    possible, we should live quite laxly and undefined in front, our
   </p>
   <p>
    outlines dim and misty on that side; as our shadows reveal an
   </p>
   <p>
    insensible perspiration toward the sun. The volatile truth of our words
   </p>
   <p>
    should continually betray the inadequacy of the residual statement.
   </p>
   <p>
    Their truth is instantly _translated_; its literal monument alone
   </p>
   <p>
    remains. The words which express our faith and piety are not definite;
   </p>
   <p>
    yet they are significant and fragrant like frankincense to superior
   </p>
   <p>
    natures.
   </p>
   <p>
    Why level downward to our dullest perception always, and praise that as
   </p>
   <p>
    common sense? The commonest sense is the sense of men asleep, which
   </p>
   <p>
    they express by snoring. Sometimes we are inclined to class those who
   </p>
   <p>
    are once-and-a-half-witted with the half-witted, because we appreciate
   </p>
   <p>
    only a third part of their wit. Some would find fault with the
   </p>
   <p>
    morning-red, if they ever got up early enough. “They pretend,” as I
   </p>
   <p>
    hear, “that the verses of Kabir have four different senses; illusion,
   </p>
   <p>
    spirit, intellect, and the exoteric doctrine of the Vedas;” but in this
   </p>
   <p>
    part of the world it is considered a ground for complaint if a man’s
   </p>
   <p>
    writings admit of more than one interpretation. While England endeavors
   </p>
   <p>
    to cure the potato-rot, will not any endeavor to cure the brain-rot,
   </p>
   <p>
    which prevails so much more widely and fatally?
   </p>
   <p>
    I do not suppose that I have attained to obscurity, but I should be
   </p>
   <p>
    proud if no more fatal fault were found with my pages on this score
   </p>
   <p>
    than was found with the Walden ice. Southern customers objected to its
   </p>
   <p>
    blue color, which is the evidence of its purity, as if it were muddy,
   </p>
   <p>
    and preferred the Cambridge ice, which is white, but tastes of weeds.
   </p>
   <p>
    The purity men love is like the mists which envelop the earth, and not
   </p>
   <p>
    like the azure ether beyond.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some are dinning in our ears that we Americans, and moderns generally,
   </p>
   <p>
    are intellectual dwarfs compared with the ancients, or even the
   </p>
   <p>
    Elizabethan men. But what is that to the purpose? A living dog is
   </p>
   <p>
    better than a dead lion. Shall a man go and hang himself because he
   </p>
   <p>
    belongs to the race of pygmies, and not be the biggest pygmy that he
   </p>
   <p>
    can? Let every one mind his own business, and endeavor to be what he
   </p>
   <p>
    was made.
   </p>
   <p>
    Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed, and in such
   </p>
   <p>
    desperate enterprises? If a man does not keep pace with his companions,
   </p>
   <p>
    perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the
   </p>
   <p>
    music which he hears, however measured or far away. It is not important
   </p>
   <p>
    that he should mature as soon as an apple-tree or an oak. Shall he turn
   </p>
   <p>
    his spring into summer? If the condition of things which we were made
   </p>
   <p>
    for is not yet, what were any reality which we can substitute? We will
   </p>
   <p>
    not be shipwrecked on a vain reality. Shall we with pains erect a
   </p>
   <p>
    heaven of blue glass over ourselves, though when it is done we shall be
   </p>
   <p>
    sure to gaze still at the true ethereal heaven far above, as if the
   </p>
   <p>
    former were not?
   </p>
   <p>
    There was an artist in the city of Kouroo who was disposed to strive
   </p>
   <p>
    after perfection. One day it came into his mind to make a staff. Having
   </p>
   <p>
    considered that in an imperfect work time is an ingredient, but into a
   </p>
   <p>
    perfect work time does not enter, he said to himself, It shall be
   </p>
   <p>
    perfect in all respects, though I should do nothing else in my life. He
   </p>
   <p>
    proceeded instantly to the forest for wood, being resolved that it
   </p>
   <p>
    should not be made of unsuitable material; and as he searched for and
   </p>
   <p>
    rejected stick after stick, his friends gradually deserted him, for
   </p>
   <p>
    they grew old in their works and died, but he grew not older by a
   </p>
   <p>
    moment. His singleness of purpose and resolution, and his elevated
   </p>
   <p>
    piety, endowed him, without his knowledge, with perennial youth. As he
   </p>
   <p>
    made no compromise with Time, Time kept out of his way, and only sighed
   </p>
   <p>
    at a distance because he could not overcome him. Before he had found a
   </p>
   <p>
    stock in all respects suitable the city of Kouroo was a hoary ruin, and
   </p>
   <p>
    he sat on one of its mounds to peel the stick. Before he had given it
   </p>
   <p>
    the proper shape the dynasty of the Candahars was at an end, and with
   </p>
   <p>
    the point of the stick he wrote the name of the last of that race in
   </p>
   <p>
    the sand, and then resumed his work. By the time he had smoothed and
   </p>
   <p>
    polished the staff Kalpa was no longer the pole-star; and ere he had
   </p>
   <p>
    put on the ferrule and the head adorned with precious stones, Brahma
   </p>
   <p>
    had awoke and slumbered many times. But why do I stay to mention these
   </p>
   <p>
    things? When the finishing stroke was put to his work, it suddenly
   </p>
   <p>
    expanded before the eyes of the astonished artist into the fairest of
   </p>
   <p>
    all the creations of Brahma. He had made a new system in making a
   </p>
   <p>
    staff, a world with full and fair proportions; in which, though the old
   </p>
   <p>
    cities and dynasties had passed away, fairer and more glorious ones had
   </p>
   <p>
    taken their places. And now he saw by the heap of shavings still fresh
   </p>
   <p>
    at his feet, that, for him and his work, the former lapse of time had
   </p>
   <p>
    been an illusion, and that no more time had elapsed than is required
   </p>
   <p>
    for a single scintillation from the brain of Brahma to fall on and
   </p>
   <p>
    inflame the tinder of a mortal brain. The material was pure, and his
   </p>
   <p>
    art was pure; how could the result be other than wonderful?
   </p>
   <p>
    No face which we can give to a matter will stead us so well at last as
   </p>
   <p>
    the truth. This alone wears well. For the most part, we are not where
   </p>
   <p>
    we are, but in a false position. Through an infinity of our natures, we
   </p>
   <p>
    suppose a case, and put ourselves into it, and hence are in two cases
   </p>
   <p>
    at the same time, and it is doubly difficult to get out. In sane
   </p>
   <p>
    moments we regard only the facts, the case that is. Say what you have
   </p>
   <p>
    to say, not what you ought. Any truth is better than make-believe. Tom
   </p>
   <p>
    Hyde, the tinker, standing on the gallows, was asked if he had anything
   </p>
   <p>
    to say. “Tell the tailors,” said he, “to remember to make a knot in
   </p>
   <p>
    their thread before they take the first stitch.” His companion’s prayer
   </p>
   <p>
    is forgotten.
   </p>
   <p>
    However mean your life is, meet it and live it; do not shun it and call
   </p>
   <p>
    it hard names. It is not so bad as you are. It looks poorest when you
   </p>
   <p>
    are richest. The fault-finder will find faults even in paradise. Love
   </p>
   <p>
    your life, poor as it is. You may perhaps have some pleasant,
   </p>
   <p>
    thrilling, glorious hours, even in a poor-house. The setting sun is
   </p>
   <p>
    reflected from the windows of the alms-house as brightly as from the
   </p>
   <p>
    rich man’s abode; the snow melts before its door as early in the
   </p>
   <p>
    spring. I do not see but a quiet mind may live as contentedly there,
   </p>
   <p>
    and have as cheering thoughts, as in a palace. The town’s poor seem to
   </p>
   <p>
    me often to live the most independent lives of any. May be they are
   </p>
   <p>
    simply great enough to receive without misgiving. Most think that they
   </p>
   <p>
    are above being supported by the town; but it oftener happens that they
   </p>
   <p>
    are not above supporting themselves by dishonest means, which should be
   </p>
   <p>
    more disreputable. Cultivate poverty like a garden herb, like sage. Do
   </p>
   <p>
    not trouble yourself much to get new things, whether clothes or
   </p>
   <p>
    friends. Turn the old; return to them. Things do not change; we change.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sell your clothes and keep your thoughts. God will see that you do not
   </p>
   <p>
    want society. If I were confined to a corner of a garret all my days,
   </p>
   <p>
    like a spider, the world would be just as large to me while I had my
   </p>
   <p>
    thoughts about me. The philosopher said: “From an army of three
   </p>
   <p>
    divisions one can take away its general, and put it in disorder; from
   </p>
   <p>
    the man the most abject and vulgar one cannot take away his thought.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Do not seek so anxiously to be developed, to subject yourself to many
   </p>
   <p>
    influences to be played on; it is all dissipation. Humility like
   </p>
   <p>
    darkness reveals the heavenly lights. The shadows of poverty and
   </p>
   <p>
    meanness gather around us, “and lo! creation widens to our view.” We
   </p>
   <p>
    are often reminded that if there were bestowed on us the wealth of
   </p>
   <p>
    Crœsus, our aims must still be the same, and our means essentially the
   </p>
   <p>
    same. Moreover, if you are restricted in your range by poverty, if you
   </p>
   <p>
    cannot buy books and newspapers, for instance, you are but confined to
   </p>
   <p>
    the most significant and vital experiences; you are compelled to deal
   </p>
   <p>
    with the material which yields the most sugar and the most starch. It
   </p>
   <p>
    is life near the bone where it is sweetest. You are defended from being
   </p>
   <p>
    a trifler. No man loses ever on a lower level by magnanimity on a
   </p>
   <p>
    higher. Superfluous wealth can buy superfluities only. Money is not
   </p>
   <p>
    required to buy one necessary of the soul.
   </p>
   <p>
    I live in the angle of a leaden wall, into whose composition was poured
   </p>
   <p>
    a little alloy of bell metal. Often, in the repose of my mid-day, there
   </p>
   <p>
    reaches my ears a confused _tintinnabulum_ from without. It is the
   </p>
   <p>
    noise of my contemporaries. My neighbors tell me of their adventures
   </p>
   <p>
    with famous gentlemen and ladies, what notabilities they met at the
   </p>
   <p>
    dinner-table; but I am no more interested in such things than in the
   </p>
   <p>
    contents of the Daily Times. The interest and the conversation are
   </p>
   <p>
    about costume and manners chiefly; but a goose is a goose still, dress
   </p>
   <p>
    it as you will. They tell me of California and Texas, of England and
   </p>
   <p>
    the Indies, of the Hon. Mr. —— of Georgia or of Massachusetts, all
   </p>
   <p>
    transient and fleeting phenomena, till I am ready to leap from their
   </p>
   <p>
    court-yard like the Mameluke bey. I delight to come to my bearings,—not
   </p>
   <p>
    walk in procession with pomp and parade, in a conspicuous place, but to
   </p>
   <p>
    walk even with the Builder of the universe, if I may,—not to live in
   </p>
   <p>
    this restless, nervous, bustling, trivial Nineteenth Century, but stand
   </p>
   <p>
    or sit thoughtfully while it goes by. What are men celebrating? They
   </p>
   <p>
    are all on a committee of arrangements, and hourly expect a speech from
   </p>
   <p>
    somebody. God is only the president of the day, and Webster is his
   </p>
   <p>
    orator. I love to weigh, to settle, to gravitate toward that which most
   </p>
   <p>
    strongly and rightfully attracts me;—not hang by the beam of the scale
   </p>
   <p>
    and try to weigh less,—not suppose a case, but take the case that is;
   </p>
   <p>
    to travel the only path I can, and that on which no power can resist
   </p>
   <p>
    me. It affords me no satisfaction to commence to spring an arch before
   </p>
   <p>
    I have got a solid foundation. Let us not play at kittly-benders. There
   </p>
   <p>
    is a solid bottom every where. We read that the traveller asked the boy
   </p>
   <p>
    if the swamp before him had a hard bottom. The boy replied that it had.
   </p>
   <p>
    But presently the traveller’s horse sank in up to the girths, and he
   </p>
   <p>
    observed to the boy, “I thought you said that this bog had a hard
   </p>
   <p>
    bottom.” “So it has,” answered the latter, “but you have not got half
   </p>
   <p>
    way to it yet.” So it is with the bogs and quicksands of society; but
   </p>
   <p>
    he is an old boy that knows it. Only what is thought, said, or done at a
   </p>
   <p>
    certain rare coincidence is good. I would not be one of those who will
   </p>
   <p>
    foolishly drive a nail into mere lath and plastering; such a deed would
   </p>
   <p>
    keep me awake nights. Give me a hammer, and let me feel for the
   </p>
   <p>
    furring. Do not depend on the putty. Drive a nail home and clinch it so
   </p>
   <p>
    faithfully that you can wake up in the night and think of your work
   </p>
   <p>
    with satisfaction,—a work at which you would not be ashamed to invoke
   </p>
   <p>
    the Muse. So will help you God, and so only. Every nail driven should
   </p>
   <p>
    be as another rivet in the machine of the universe, you carrying on the
   </p>
   <p>
    work.
   </p>
   <p>
    Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth. I sat at a
   </p>
   <p>
    table where were rich food and wine in abundance, and obsequious
   </p>
   <p>
    attendance, but sincerity and truth were not; and I went away hungry
   </p>
   <p>
    from the inhospitable board. The hospitality was as cold as the ices. I
   </p>
   <p>
    thought that there was no need of ice to freeze them. They talked to me
   </p>
   <p>
    of the age of the wine and the fame of the vintage; but I thought of an
   </p>
   <p>
    older, a newer, and purer wine, of a more glorious vintage, which they
   </p>
   <p>
    had not got, and could not buy. The style, the house and grounds and
   </p>
   <p>
    “entertainment” pass for nothing with me. I called on the king, but he
   </p>
   <p>
    made me wait in his hall, and conducted like a man incapacitated for
   </p>
   <p>
    hospitality. There was a man in my neighborhood who lived in a hollow
   </p>
   <p>
    tree. His manners were truly regal. I should have done better had I
   </p>
   <p>
    called on him.
   </p>
   <p>
    How long shall we sit in our porticoes practising idle and musty
   </p>
   <p>
    virtues, which any work would make impertinent? As if one were to begin
   </p>
   <p>
    the day with long-suffering, and hire a man to hoe his potatoes; and in
   </p>
   <p>
    the afternoon go forth to practise Christian meekness and charity with
   </p>
   <p>
    goodness aforethought! Consider the China pride and stagnant
   </p>
   <p>
    self-complacency of mankind. This generation inclines a little to
   </p>
   <p>
    congratulate itself on being the last of an illustrious line; and in
   </p>
   <p>
    Boston and London and Paris and Rome, thinking of its long descent, it
   </p>
   <p>
    speaks of its progress in art and science and literature with
   </p>
   <p>
    satisfaction. There are the Records of the Philosophical Societies, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the public Eulogies of _Great Men!_ It is the good Adam contemplating
   </p>
   <p>
    his own virtue. “Yes, we have done great deeds, and sung divine songs,
   </p>
   <p>
    which shall never die,”—that is, as long as _we_ can remember them. The
   </p>
   <p>
    learned societies and great men of Assyria,—where are they? What
   </p>
   <p>
    youthful philosophers and experimentalists we are! There is not one of
   </p>
   <p>
    my readers who has yet lived a whole human life. These may be but the
   </p>
   <p>
    spring months in the life of the race. If we have had the seven-years’
   </p>
   <p>
    itch, we have not seen the seventeen-year locust yet in Concord. We are
   </p>
   <p>
    acquainted with a mere pellicle of the globe on which we live. Most
   </p>
   <p>
    have not delved six feet beneath the surface, nor leaped as many above
   </p>
   <p>
    it. We know not where we are. Beside, we are sound asleep nearly half
   </p>
   <p>
    our time. Yet we esteem ourselves wise, and have an established order
   </p>
   <p>
    on the surface. Truly, we are deep thinkers, we are ambitious spirits!
   </p>
   <p>
    As I stand over the insect crawling amid the pine needles on the forest
   </p>
   <p>
    floor, and endeavoring to conceal itself from my sight, and ask myself
   </p>
   <p>
    why it will cherish those humble thoughts, and hide its head from me
   </p>
   <p>
    who might, perhaps, be its benefactor, and impart to its race some
   </p>
   <p>
    cheering information, I am reminded of the greater Benefactor and
   </p>
   <p>
    Intelligence that stands over me the human insect.
   </p>
   <p>
    There is an incessant influx of novelty into the world, and yet we
   </p>
   <p>
    tolerate incredible dulness. I need only suggest what kind of sermons
   </p>
   <p>
    are still listened to in the most enlightened countries. There are such
   </p>
   <p>
    words as joy and sorrow, but they are only the burden of a psalm, sung
   </p>
   <p>
    with a nasal twang, while we believe in the ordinary and mean. We think
   </p>
   <p>
    that we can change our clothes only. It is said that the British Empire
   </p>
   <p>
    is very large and respectable, and that the United States are a
   </p>
   <p>
    first-rate power. We do not believe that a tide rises and falls behind
   </p>
   <p>
    every man which can float the British Empire like a chip, if he should
   </p>
   <p>
    ever harbor it in his mind. Who knows what sort of seventeen-year
   </p>
   <p>
    locust will next come out of the ground? The government of the world I
   </p>
   <p>
    live in was not framed, like that of Britain, in after-dinner
   </p>
   <p>
    conversations over the wine.
   </p>
   <p>
    The life in us is like the water in the river. It may rise this year
   </p>
   <p>
    higher than man has ever known it, and flood the parched uplands; even
   </p>
   <p>
    this may be the eventful year, which will drown out all our muskrats.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was not always dry land where we dwell. I see far inland the banks
   </p>
   <p>
    which the stream anciently washed, before science began to record its
   </p>
   <p>
    freshets. Every one has heard the story which has gone the rounds of
   </p>
   <p>
    New England, of a strong and beautiful bug which came out of the dry
   </p>
   <p>
    leaf of an old table of apple-tree wood, which had stood in a farmer’s
   </p>
   <p>
    kitchen for sixty years, first in Connecticut, and afterward in
   </p>
   <p>
    Massachusetts,—from an egg deposited in the living tree many years
   </p>
   <p>
    earlier still, as appeared by counting the annual layers beyond it;
   </p>
   <p>
    which was heard gnawing out for several weeks, hatched perchance by the
   </p>
   <p>
    heat of an urn. Who does not feel his faith in a resurrection and
   </p>
   <p>
    immortality strengthened by hearing of this? Who knows what beautiful
   </p>
   <p>
    and winged life, whose egg has been buried for ages under many
   </p>
   <p>
    concentric layers of woodenness in the dead dry life of society,
   </p>
   <p>
    deposited at first in the alburnum of the green and living tree, which
   </p>
   <p>
    has been gradually converted into the semblance of its well-seasoned
   </p>
   <p>
    tomb,—heard perchance gnawing out now for years by the astonished
   </p>
   <p>
    family of man, as they sat round the festive board,—may unexpectedly
   </p>
   <p>
    come forth from amidst society’s most trivial and handselled furniture,
   </p>
   <p>
    to enjoy its perfect summer life at last!
   </p>
   <p>
    I do not say that John or Jonathan will realize all this; but such is
   </p>
   <p>
    the character of that morrow which mere lapse of time can never make to
   </p>
   <p>
    dawn. The light which puts out our eyes is darkness to us. Only that
   </p>
   <p>
    day dawns to which we are awake. There is more day to dawn. The sun is
   </p>
   <p>
    but a morning star.
   </p>
   <p>
    THE END
   </p>
   <p>
    ON THE DUTY OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE
   </p>
   <p>
    I heartily accept the motto,—“That government is best which governs
   </p>
   <p>
    least;” and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and
   </p>
   <p>
    systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I
   </p>
   <p>
    believe—“That government is best which governs not at all;” and when
   </p>
   <p>
    men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they
   </p>
   <p>
    will have. Government is at best but an expedient; but most governments
   </p>
   <p>
    are usually, and all governments are sometimes, inexpedient. The
   </p>
   <p>
    objections which have been brought against a standing army, and they
   </p>
   <p>
    are many and weighty, and deserve to prevail, may also at last be
   </p>
   <p>
    brought against a standing government. The standing army is only an arm
   </p>
   <p>
    of the standing government. The government itself, which is only the
   </p>
   <p>
    mode which the people have chosen to execute their will, is equally
   </p>
   <p>
    liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Witness the present Mexican war, the work of comparatively a few
   </p>
   <p>
    individuals using the standing government as their tool; for, in the
   </p>
   <p>
    outset, the people would not have consented to this measure.
   </p>
   <p>
    This American government,—what is it but a tradition, though a recent
   </p>
   <p>
    one, endeavoring to transmit itself unimpaired to posterity, but each
   </p>
   <p>
    instant losing some of its integrity? It has not the vitality and force
   </p>
   <p>
    of a single living man; for a single man can bend it to his will. It is
   </p>
   <p>
    a sort of wooden gun to the people themselves; and, if ever they should
   </p>
   <p>
    use it in earnest as a real one against each other, it will surely
   </p>
   <p>
    split. But it is not the less necessary for this; for the people must
   </p>
   <p>
    have some complicated machinery or other, and hear its din, to satisfy
   </p>
   <p>
    that idea of government which they have. Governments show thus how
   </p>
   <p>
    successfully men can be imposed on, even impose on themselves, for
   </p>
   <p>
    their own advantage. It is excellent, we must all allow; yet this
   </p>
   <p>
    government never of itself furthered any enterprise, but by the
   </p>
   <p>
    alacrity with which it got out of its way. _It_ does not keep the
   </p>
   <p>
    country free. _It_ does not settle the West. _It_ does not educate. The
   </p>
   <p>
    character inherent in the American people has done all that has been
   </p>
   <p>
    accomplished; and it would have done somewhat more, if the government
   </p>
   <p>
    had not sometimes got in its way. For government is an expedient, by
   </p>
   <p>
    which men would fain succeed in letting one another alone; and, as has
   </p>
   <p>
    been said, when it is most expedient, the governed are most let alone
   </p>
   <p>
    by it. Trade and commerce, if they were not made of India rubber, would
   </p>
   <p>
    never manage to bounce over obstacles which legislators are continually
   </p>
   <p>
    putting in their way; and, if one were to judge these men wholly by the
   </p>
   <p>
    effects of their actions, and not partly by their intentions, they
   </p>
   <p>
    would deserve to be classed and punished with those mischievous persons
   </p>
   <p>
    who put obstructions on the railroads.
   </p>
   <p>
    But, to speak practically and as a citizen, unlike those who call
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves no-government men, I ask for, not at once no government, but
   </p>
   <p>
    _at once_ a better government. Let every man make known what kind of
   </p>
   <p>
    government would command his respect, and that will be one step toward
   </p>
   <p>
    obtaining it.
   </p>
   <p>
    After all, the practical reason why, when the power is once in the
   </p>
   <p>
    hands of the people, a majority are permitted, and for a long period
   </p>
   <p>
    continue, to rule, is not because they are most likely to be in the
   </p>
   <p>
    right, nor because this seems fairest to the minority, but because they
   </p>
   <p>
    are physically the strongest. But a government in which the majority
   </p>
   <p>
    rule in all cases can not be based on justice, even as far as men
   </p>
   <p>
    understand it. Can there not be a government in which the majorities do
   </p>
   <p>
    not virtually decide right and wrong, but conscience?—in which
   </p>
   <p>
    majorities decide only those questions to which the rule of expediency
   </p>
   <p>
    is applicable? Must the citizen ever for a moment, or in the least
   </p>
   <p>
    degree, resign his conscience to the legislator? Why has every man a
   </p>
   <p>
    conscience, then? I think that we should be men first, and subjects
   </p>
   <p>
    afterward. It is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law, so
   </p>
   <p>
    much as for the right. The only obligation which I have a right to
   </p>
   <p>
    assume, is to do at any time what I think right. It is truly enough
   </p>
   <p>
    said that a corporation has no conscience; but a corporation of
   </p>
   <p>
    conscientious men is a corporation _with_ a conscience. Law never made
   </p>
   <p>
    men a whit more just; and, by means of their respect for it, even the
   </p>
   <p>
    well-disposed are daily made the agents of injustice. A common and
   </p>
   <p>
    natural result of an undue respect for the law is, that you may see a
   </p>
   <p>
    file of soldiers, colonel, captain, corporal, privates, powder-monkeys
   </p>
   <p>
    and all, marching in admirable order over hill and dale to the wars,
   </p>
   <p>
    against their wills, aye, against their common sense and consciences,
   </p>
   <p>
    which makes it very steep marching indeed, and produces a palpitation
   </p>
   <p>
    of the heart. They have no doubt that it is a damnable business in
   </p>
   <p>
    which they are concerned; they are all peaceably inclined. Now, what
   </p>
   <p>
    are they? Men at all? or small movable forts and magazines, at the
   </p>
   <p>
    service of some unscrupulous man in power? Visit the Navy Yard, and
   </p>
   <p>
    behold a marine, such a man as an American government can make, or such
   </p>
   <p>
    as it can make a man with its black arts, a mere shadow and
   </p>
   <p>
    reminiscence of humanity, a man laid out alive and standing, and
   </p>
   <p>
    already, as one may say, buried under arms with funeral accompaniment,
   </p>
   <p>
    though it may be
   </p>
   <p>
    “Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note,
   </p>
   <p>
    As his corpse to the ramparts we hurried;
   </p>
   <p>
    Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot
   </p>
   <p>
    O’er the grave where our hero we buried.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The mass of men serve the State thus, not as men mainly, but as
   </p>
   <p>
    machines, with their bodies. They are the standing army, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    militia, jailers, constables, _posse comitatus_, &amp;c. In most cases
   </p>
   <p>
    there is no free exercise whatever of the judgment or of the moral
   </p>
   <p>
    sense; but they put themselves on a level with wood and earth and
   </p>
   <p>
    stones; and wooden men can perhaps be manufactured that will serve the
   </p>
   <p>
    purpose as well. Such command no more respect than men of straw, or a
   </p>
   <p>
    lump of dirt. They have the same sort of worth only as horses and dogs.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet such as these even are commonly esteemed good citizens. Others, as
   </p>
   <p>
    most legislators, politicians, lawyers, ministers, and office-holders,
   </p>
   <p>
    serve the state chiefly with their heads; and, as they rarely make any
   </p>
   <p>
    moral distinctions, they are as likely to serve the devil, without
   </p>
   <p>
    _intending_ it, as God. A very few, as heroes, patriots, martyrs,
   </p>
   <p>
    reformers in the great sense, and _men_, serve the State with their
   </p>
   <p>
    consciences also, and so necessarily resist it for the most part; and
   </p>
   <p>
    they are commonly treated by it as enemies. A wise man will only be
   </p>
   <p>
    useful as a man, and will not submit to be “clay,” and “stop a hole to
   </p>
   <p>
    keep the wind away,” but leave that office to his dust at least:
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am too high-born to be propertied,
   </p>
   <p>
    To be a secondary at control,
   </p>
   <p>
    Or useful serving-man and instrument
   </p>
   <p>
    To any sovereign state throughout the world.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He who gives himself entirely to his fellow-men appears to them useless
   </p>
   <p>
    and selfish; but he who gives himself partially to them is pronounced a
   </p>
   <p>
    benefactor and philanthropist.
   </p>
   <p>
    How does it become a man to behave toward the American government
   </p>
   <p>
    today? I answer that he cannot without disgrace be associated with it.
   </p>
   <p>
    I cannot for an instant recognize that political organization as _my_
   </p>
   <p>
    government which is the _slave’s_ government also.
   </p>
   <p>
    All men recognize the right of revolution; that is, the right to refuse
   </p>
   <p>
    allegiance to and to resist the government, when its tyranny or its
   </p>
   <p>
    inefficiency are great and unendurable. But almost all say that such is
   </p>
   <p>
    not the case now. But such was the case, they think, in the Revolution
   </p>
   <p>
    of ’75. If one were to tell me that this was a bad government because
   </p>
   <p>
    it taxed certain foreign commodities brought to its ports, it is most
   </p>
   <p>
    probable that I should not make an ado about it, for I can do without
   </p>
   <p>
    them: all machines have their friction; and possibly this does enough
   </p>
   <p>
    good to counter-balance the evil. At any rate, it is a great evil to
   </p>
   <p>
    make a stir about it. But when the friction comes to have its machine,
   </p>
   <p>
    and oppression and robbery are organized, I say, let us not have such a
   </p>
   <p>
    machine any longer. In other words, when a sixth of the population of a
   </p>
   <p>
    nation which has undertaken to be the refuge of liberty are slaves, and
   </p>
   <p>
    a whole country is unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army,
   </p>
   <p>
    and subjected to military law, I think that it is not too soon for
   </p>
   <p>
    honest men to rebel and revolutionize. What makes this duty the more
   </p>
   <p>
    urgent is that fact, that the country so overrun is not our own, but
   </p>
   <p>
    ours is the invading army.
   </p>
   <p>
    Paley, a common authority with many on moral questions, in his chapter
   </p>
   <p>
    on the “Duty of Submission to Civil Government,” resolves all civil
   </p>
   <p>
    obligation into expediency; and he proceeds to say, “that so long as
   </p>
   <p>
    the interest of the whole society requires it, that is, so long as the
   </p>
   <p>
    established government cannot be resisted or changed without public
   </p>
   <p>
    inconveniency, it is the will of God that the established government be
   </p>
   <p>
    obeyed, and no longer.”—“This principle being admitted, the justice of
   </p>
   <p>
    every particular case of resistance is reduced to a computation of the
   </p>
   <p>
    quantity of the danger and grievance on the one side, and of the
   </p>
   <p>
    probability and expense of redressing it on the other.” Of this, he
   </p>
   <p>
    says, every man shall judge for himself. But Paley appears never to
   </p>
   <p>
    have contemplated those cases to which the rule of expediency does not
   </p>
   <p>
    apply, in which a people, as well as an individual, must do justice,
   </p>
   <p>
    cost what it may. If I have unjustly wrested a plank from a drowning
   </p>
   <p>
    man, I must restore it to him though I drown myself. This, according to
   </p>
   <p>
    Paley, would be inconvenient. But he that would save his life, in such
   </p>
   <p>
    a case, shall lose it. This people must cease to hold slaves, and to
   </p>
   <p>
    make war on Mexico, though it cost them their existence as a people.
   </p>
   <p>
    In their practice, nations agree with Paley; but does anyone think that
   </p>
   <p>
    Massachusetts does exactly what is right at the present crisis?
   </p>
   <p>
    “A drab of state, a cloth-o’-silver slut,
   </p>
   <p>
    To have her train borne up, and her soul trail in the dirt.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Practically speaking, the opponents to a reform in Massachusetts are
   </p>
   <p>
    not a hundred thousand politicians at the South, but a hundred thousand
   </p>
   <p>
    merchants and farmers here, who are more interested in commerce and
   </p>
   <p>
    agriculture than they are in humanity, and are not prepared to do
   </p>
   <p>
    justice to the slave and to Mexico, _cost what it may_. I quarrel not
   </p>
   <p>
    with far-off foes, but with those who, near at home, co-operate with,
   </p>
   <p>
    and do the bidding of those far away, and without whom the latter would
   </p>
   <p>
    be harmless. We are accustomed to say, that the mass of men are
   </p>
   <p>
    unprepared; but improvement is slow, because the few are not materially
   </p>
   <p>
    wiser or better than the many. It is not so important that many should
   </p>
   <p>
    be as good as you, as that there be some absolute goodness somewhere;
   </p>
   <p>
    for that will leaven the whole lump. There are thousands who are _in
   </p>
   <p>
    opinion_ opposed to slavery and to the war, who yet in effect do
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing to put an end to them; who, esteeming themselves children of
   </p>
   <p>
    Washington and Franklin, sit down with their hands in their pockets,
   </p>
   <p>
    and say that they know not what to do, and do nothing; who even
   </p>
   <p>
    postpone the question of freedom to the question of free-trade, and
   </p>
   <p>
    quietly read the prices-current along with the latest advices from
   </p>
   <p>
    Mexico, after dinner, and, it may be, fall asleep over them both. What
   </p>
   <p>
    is the price-current of an honest man and patriot today? They hesitate,
   </p>
   <p>
    and they regret, and sometimes they petition; but they do nothing in
   </p>
   <p>
    earnest and with effect. They will wait, well disposed, for others to
   </p>
   <p>
    remedy the evil, that they may no longer have it to regret. At most,
   </p>
   <p>
    they give only a cheap vote, and a feeble countenance and Godspeed, to
   </p>
   <p>
    the right, as it goes by them. There are nine hundred and ninety-nine
   </p>
   <p>
    patrons of virtue to one virtuous man; but it is easier to deal with
   </p>
   <p>
    the real possessor of a thing than with the temporary guardian of it.
   </p>
   <p>
    All voting is a sort of gaming, like chequers or backgammon, with a
   </p>
   <p>
    slight moral tinge to it, a playing with right and wrong, with moral
   </p>
   <p>
    questions; and betting naturally accompanies it. The character of the
   </p>
   <p>
    voters is not staked. I cast my vote, perchance, as I think right; but
   </p>
   <p>
    I am not vitally concerned that that right should prevail. I am willing
   </p>
   <p>
    to leave it to the majority. Its obligation, therefore, never exceeds
   </p>
   <p>
    that of expediency. Even voting _for the right_ is _doing_ nothing for
   </p>
   <p>
    it. It is only expressing to men feebly your desire that it should
   </p>
   <p>
    prevail. A wise man will not leave the right to the mercy of chance,
   </p>
   <p>
    nor wish it to prevail through the power of the majority. There is but
   </p>
   <p>
    little virtue in the action of masses of men. When the majority shall
   </p>
   <p>
    at length vote for the abolition of slavery, it will be because they
   </p>
   <p>
    are indifferent to slavery, or because there is but little slavery left
   </p>
   <p>
    to be abolished by their vote. _They_ will then be the only slaves.
   </p>
   <p>
    Only _his_ vote can hasten the abolition of slavery who asserts his own
   </p>
   <p>
    freedom by his vote.
   </p>
   <p>
    I hear of a convention to be held at Baltimore, or elsewhere, for the
   </p>
   <p>
    selection of a candidate for the Presidency, made up chiefly of
   </p>
   <p>
    editors, and men who are politicians by profession; but I think, what
   </p>
   <p>
    is it to any independent, intelligent, and respectable man what
   </p>
   <p>
    decision they may come to, shall we not have the advantage of his
   </p>
   <p>
    wisdom and honesty, nevertheless? Can we not count upon some
   </p>
   <p>
    independent votes? Are there not many individuals in the country who do
   </p>
   <p>
    not attend conventions? But no: I find that the respectable man, so
   </p>
   <p>
    called, has immediately drifted from his position, and despairs of his
   </p>
   <p>
    country, when his country has more reasons to despair of him. He
   </p>
   <p>
    forthwith adopts one of the candidates thus selected as the only
   </p>
   <p>
    _available_ one, thus proving that he is himself _available_ for any
   </p>
   <p>
    purposes of the demagogue. His vote is of no more worth than that of
   </p>
   <p>
    any unprincipled foreigner or hireling native, who may have been
   </p>
   <p>
    bought. Oh for a man who is a _man_, and, as my neighbor says, has a
   </p>
   <p>
    bone in his back which you cannot pass your hand through! Our
   </p>
   <p>
    statistics are at fault: the population has been returned too large.
   </p>
   <p>
    How many _men_ are there to a square thousand miles in the country?
   </p>
   <p>
    Hardly one. Does not America offer any inducement for men to settle
   </p>
   <p>
    here? The American has dwindled into an Odd Fellow,—one who may be
   </p>
   <p>
    known by the development of his organ of gregariousness, and a manifest
   </p>
   <p>
    lack of intellect and cheerful self-reliance; whose first and chief
   </p>
   <p>
    concern, on coming into the world, is to see that the alms-houses are
   </p>
   <p>
    in good repair; and, before yet he has lawfully donned the virile garb,
   </p>
   <p>
    to collect a fund for the support of the widows and orphans that may
   </p>
   <p>
    be; who, in short, ventures to live only by the aid of the Mutual
   </p>
   <p>
    Insurance company, which has promised to bury him decently.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is not a man’s duty, as a matter of course, to devote himself to the
   </p>
   <p>
    eradication of any, even the most enormous wrong; he may still properly
   </p>
   <p>
    have other concerns to engage him; but it is his duty, at least, to
   </p>
   <p>
    wash his hands of it, and, if he gives it no thought longer, not to
   </p>
   <p>
    give it practically his support. If I devote myself to other pursuits
   </p>
   <p>
    and contemplations, I must first see, at least, that I do not pursue
   </p>
   <p>
    them sitting upon another man’s shoulders. I must get off him first,
   </p>
   <p>
    that he may pursue his contemplations too. See what gross inconsistency
   </p>
   <p>
    is tolerated. I have heard some of my townsmen say, “I should like to
   </p>
   <p>
    have them order me out to help put down an insurrection of the slaves,
   </p>
   <p>
    or to march to Mexico,—see if I would go;” and yet these very men have
   </p>
   <p>
    each, directly by their allegiance, and so indirectly, at least, by
   </p>
   <p>
    their money, furnished a substitute. The soldier is applauded who
   </p>
   <p>
    refuses to serve in an unjust war by those who do not refuse to sustain
   </p>
   <p>
    the unjust government which makes the war; is applauded by those whose
   </p>
   <p>
    own act and authority he disregards and sets at naught; as if the State
   </p>
   <p>
    were penitent to that degree that it hired one to scourge it while it
   </p>
   <p>
    sinned, but not to that degree that it left off sinning for a moment.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus, under the name of Order and Civil Government, we are all made at
   </p>
   <p>
    last to pay homage to and support our own meanness. After the first
   </p>
   <p>
    blush of sin, comes its indifference; and from immoral it becomes, as
   </p>
   <p>
    it were, _un_moral, and not quite unnecessary to that life which we
   </p>
   <p>
    have made.
   </p>
   <p>
    The broadest and most prevalent error requires the most disinterested
   </p>
   <p>
    virtue to sustain it. The slight reproach to which the virtue of
   </p>
   <p>
    patriotism is commonly liable, the noble are most likely to incur.
   </p>
   <p>
    Those who, while they disapprove of the character and measures of a
   </p>
   <p>
    government, yield to it their allegiance and support, are undoubtedly
   </p>
   <p>
    its most conscientious supporters, and so frequently the most serious
   </p>
   <p>
    obstacles to reform. Some are petitioning the State to dissolve the
   </p>
   <p>
    Union, to disregard the requisitions of the President. Why do they not
   </p>
   <p>
    dissolve it themselves,—the union between themselves and the State,—and
   </p>
   <p>
    refuse to pay their quota into its treasury? Do not they stand in same
   </p>
   <p>
    relation to the State, that the State does to the Union? And have not
   </p>
   <p>
    the same reasons prevented the State from resisting the Union, which
   </p>
   <p>
    have prevented them from resisting the State?
   </p>
   <p>
    How can a man be satisfied to entertain an opinion merely, and enjoy
   </p>
   <p>
    _it?_ Is there any enjoyment in it, if his opinion is that he is
   </p>
   <p>
    aggrieved? If you are cheated out of a single dollar by your neighbor,
   </p>
   <p>
    you do not rest satisfied with knowing you are cheated, or with saying
   </p>
   <p>
    that you are cheated, or even with petitioning him to pay you your due;
   </p>
   <p>
    but you take effectual steps at once to obtain the full amount, and see
   </p>
   <p>
    that you are never cheated again. Action from principle,—the perception
   </p>
   <p>
    and the performance of right,—changes things and relations; it is
   </p>
   <p>
    essentially revolutionary, and does not consist wholly with anything
   </p>
   <p>
    which was. It not only divided states and churches, it divides
   </p>
   <p>
    families; aye, it divides the _individual_, separating the diabolical
   </p>
   <p>
    in him from the divine.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unjust laws exist: shall we be content to obey them, or shall we
   </p>
   <p>
    endeavor to amend them, and obey them until we have succeeded, or shall
   </p>
   <p>
    we transgress them at once? Men generally, under such a government as
   </p>
   <p>
    this, think that they ought to wait until they have persuaded the
   </p>
   <p>
    majority to alter them. They think that, if they should resist, the
   </p>
   <p>
    remedy would be worse than the evil. But it is the fault of the
   </p>
   <p>
    government itself that the remedy _is_ worse than the evil. _It_ makes
   </p>
   <p>
    it worse. Why is it not more apt to anticipate and provide for reform?
   </p>
   <p>
    Why does it not cherish its wise minority? Why does it cry and resist
   </p>
   <p>
    before it is hurt? Why does it not encourage its citizens to be on the
   </p>
   <p>
    alert to point out its faults, and _do_ better than it would have them?
   </p>
   <p>
    Why does it always crucify Christ, and excommunicate Copernicus and
   </p>
   <p>
    Luther, and pronounce Washington and Franklin rebels?
   </p>
   <p>
    One would think, that a deliberate and practical denial of its
   </p>
   <p>
    authority was the only offence never contemplated by government; else,
   </p>
   <p>
    why has it not assigned its definite, its suitable and proportionate
   </p>
   <p>
    penalty? If a man who has no property refuses but once to earn nine
   </p>
   <p>
    shillings for the State, he is put in prison for a period unlimited by
   </p>
   <p>
    any law that I know, and determined only by the discretion of those who
   </p>
   <p>
    placed him there; but if he should steal ninety times nine shillings
   </p>
   <p>
    from the State, he is soon permitted to go at large again.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of the machine of
   </p>
   <p>
    government, let it go, let it go: perchance it will wear
   </p>
   <p>
    smooth,—certainly the machine will wear out. If the injustice has a
   </p>
   <p>
    spring, or a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself,
   </p>
   <p>
    then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy will not be worse than
   </p>
   <p>
    the evil; but if it is of such a nature that it requires you to be the
   </p>
   <p>
    agent of injustice to another, then, I say, break the law. Let your
   </p>
   <p>
    life be a counter friction to stop the machine. What I have to do is to
   </p>
   <p>
    see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to the wrong which I
   </p>
   <p>
    condemn.
   </p>
   <p>
    As for adopting the ways which the State has provided for remedying the
   </p>
   <p>
    evil, I know not of such ways. They take too much time, and a man’s
   </p>
   <p>
    life will be gone. I have other affairs to attend to. I came into this
   </p>
   <p>
    world, not chiefly to make this a good place to live in, but to live in
   </p>
   <p>
    it, be it good or bad. A man has not every thing to do, but something;
   </p>
   <p>
    and because he cannot do _every thing_, it is not necessary that he
   </p>
   <p>
    should do _something_ wrong. It is not my business to be petitioning
   </p>
   <p>
    the Governor or the Legislature any more than it is theirs to petition
   </p>
   <p>
    me; and, if they should not hear my petition, what should I do then?
   </p>
   <p>
    But in this case the State has provided no way: its very Constitution
   </p>
   <p>
    is the evil. This may seem to be harsh and stubborn and
   </p>
   <p>
    unconcilliatory; but it is to treat with the utmost kindness and
   </p>
   <p>
    consideration the only spirit that can appreciate or deserves it. So is
   </p>
   <p>
    all change for the better, like birth and death which convulse the
   </p>
   <p>
    body.
   </p>
   <p>
    I do not hesitate to say, that those who call themselves abolitionists
   </p>
   <p>
    should at once effectually withdraw their support, both in person and
   </p>
   <p>
    property, from the government of Massachusetts, and not wait till they
   </p>
   <p>
    constitute a majority of one, before they suffer the right to prevail
   </p>
   <p>
    through them. I think that it is enough if they have God on their side,
   </p>
   <p>
    without waiting for that other one. Moreover, any man more right than
   </p>
   <p>
    his neighbors constitutes a majority of one already.
   </p>
   <p>
    I meet this American government, or its representative, the State
   </p>
   <p>
    government, directly, and face to face, once a year, no more, in the
   </p>
   <p>
    person of its tax-gatherer; this is the only mode in which a man
   </p>
   <p>
    situated as I am necessarily meets it; and it then says distinctly,
   </p>
   <p>
    Recognize me; and the simplest, the most effectual, and, in the present
   </p>
   <p>
    posture of affairs, the indispensablest mode of treating with it on
   </p>
   <p>
    this head, of expressing your little satisfaction with and love for it,
   </p>
   <p>
    is to deny it then. My civil neighbor, the tax-gatherer, is the very
   </p>
   <p>
    man I have to deal with,—for it is, after all, with men and not with
   </p>
   <p>
    parchment that I quarrel,—and he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent
   </p>
   <p>
    of the government. How shall he ever know well what he is and does as
   </p>
   <p>
    an officer of the government, or as a man, until he is obliged to
   </p>
   <p>
    consider whether he shall treat me, his neighbor, for whom he has
   </p>
   <p>
    respect, as a neighbor and well-disposed man, or as a maniac and
   </p>
   <p>
    disturber of the peace, and see if he can get over this obstruction to
   </p>
   <p>
    his neighborliness without a ruder and more impetuous thought or speech
   </p>
   <p>
    corresponding with his action? I know this well, that if one thousand,
   </p>
   <p>
    if one hundred, if ten men whom I could name,—if ten _honest_ men
   </p>
   <p>
    only,—aye, if _one_ HONEST man, in this State of Massachusetts,
   </p>
   <p>
    _ceasing to hold slaves_, were actually to withdraw from this
   </p>
   <p>
    copartnership, and be locked up in the county jail therefor, it would
   </p>
   <p>
    be the abolition of slavery in America. For it matters not how small
   </p>
   <p>
    the beginning may seem to be: what is once well done is done for ever.
   </p>
   <p>
    But we love better to talk about it: that we say is our mission. Reform
   </p>
   <p>
    keeps many scores of newspapers in its service, but not one man. If my
   </p>
   <p>
    esteemed neighbor, the State’s ambassador, who will devote his days to
   </p>
   <p>
    the settlement of the question of human rights in the Council Chamber,
   </p>
   <p>
    instead of being threatened with the prisons of Carolina, were to sit
   </p>
   <p>
    down the prisoner of Massachusetts, that State which is so anxious to
   </p>
   <p>
    foist the sin of slavery upon her sister,—though at present she can
   </p>
   <p>
    discover only an act of inhospitality to be the ground of a quarrel
   </p>
   <p>
    with her,—the Legislature would not wholly waive the subject of the
   </p>
   <p>
    following winter.
   </p>
   <p>
    Under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a
   </p>
   <p>
    just man is also a prison. The proper place today, the only place which
   </p>
   <p>
    Massachusetts has provided for her freer and less desponding spirits,
   </p>
   <p>
    is in her prisons, to be put out and locked out of the State by her own
   </p>
   <p>
    act, as they have already put themselves out by their principles. It is
   </p>
   <p>
    there that the fugitive slave, and the Mexican prisoner on parole, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the Indian come to plead the wrongs of his race, should find them; on
   </p>
   <p>
    that separate, but more free and honorable ground, where the State
   </p>
   <p>
    places those who are not _with_ her but _against_ her,—the only house
   </p>
   <p>
    in a slave-state in which a free man can abide with honor. If any think
   </p>
   <p>
    that their influence would be lost there, and their voices no longer
   </p>
   <p>
    afflict the ear of the State, that they would not be as an enemy within
   </p>
   <p>
    its walls, they do not know by how much truth is stronger than error,
   </p>
   <p>
    nor how much more eloquently and effectively he can combat injustice
   </p>
   <p>
    who has experienced a little in his own person. Cast your whole vote,
   </p>
   <p>
    not a strip of paper merely, but your whole influence. A minority is
   </p>
   <p>
    powerless while it conforms to the majority; it is not even a minority
   </p>
   <p>
    then; but it is irresistible when it clogs by its whole weight. If the
   </p>
   <p>
    alternative is to keep all just men in prison, or give up war and
   </p>
   <p>
    slavery, the State will not hesitate which to choose. If a thousand men
   </p>
   <p>
    were not to pay their tax-bills this year, that would not be a violent
   </p>
   <p>
    and bloody measure, as it would be to pay them, and enable the State to
   </p>
   <p>
    commit violence and shed innocent blood. This is, in fact, the
   </p>
   <p>
    definition of a peaceable revolution, if any such is possible. If the
   </p>
   <p>
    tax-gatherer, or any other public officer, asks me, as one has done,
   </p>
   <p>
    “But what shall I do?” my answer is, “If you really wish to do any
   </p>
   <p>
    thing, resign your office.” When the subject has refused allegiance,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the officer has resigned his office, then the revolution is
   </p>
   <p>
    accomplished. But even suppose blood should flow. Is there not a sort
   </p>
   <p>
    of blood shed when the conscience is wounded? Through this wound a
   </p>
   <p>
    man’s real manhood and immortality flow out, and he bleeds to an
   </p>
   <p>
    everlasting death. I see this blood flowing now.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have contemplated the imprisonment of the offender, rather than the
   </p>
   <p>
    seizure of his goods,—though both will serve the same purpose,—because
   </p>
   <p>
    they who assert the purest right, and consequently are most dangerous
   </p>
   <p>
    to a corrupt State, commonly have not spent much time in accumulating
   </p>
   <p>
    property. To such the State renders comparatively small service, and a
   </p>
   <p>
    slight tax is wont to appear exorbitant, particularly if they are
   </p>
   <p>
    obliged to earn it by special labor with their hands. If there were one
   </p>
   <p>
    who lived wholly without the use of money, the State itself would
   </p>
   <p>
    hesitate to demand it of him. But the rich man—not to make any
   </p>
   <p>
    invidious comparison—is always sold to the institution which makes him
   </p>
   <p>
    rich. Absolutely speaking, the more money, the less virtue; for money
   </p>
   <p>
    comes between a man and his objects, and obtains them for him; it was
   </p>
   <p>
    certainly no great virtue to obtain it. It puts to rest many questions
   </p>
   <p>
    which he would otherwise be taxed to answer; while the only new
   </p>
   <p>
    question which it puts is the hard but superfluous one, how to spend
   </p>
   <p>
    it. Thus his moral ground is taken from under his feet. The
   </p>
   <p>
    opportunities of living are diminished in proportion as what are called
   </p>
   <p>
    the “means” are increased. The best thing a man can do for his culture
   </p>
   <p>
    when he is rich is to endeavor to carry out those schemes which he
   </p>
   <p>
    entertained when he was poor. Christ answered the Herodians according
   </p>
   <p>
    to their condition. “Show me the tribute-money,” said he;—and one took
   </p>
   <p>
    a penny out of his pocket;—if you use money which has the image of
   </p>
   <p>
    Cæsar on it, and which he has made current and valuable, that is, _if
   </p>
   <p>
    you are men of the State_, and gladly enjoy the advantages of Cæsar’s
   </p>
   <p>
    government, then pay him back some of his own when he demands it;
   </p>
   <p>
    “Render therefore to Cæsar that which is Cæsar’s and to God those
   </p>
   <p>
    things which are God’s,”—leaving them no wiser than before as to which
   </p>
   <p>
    was which; for they did not wish to know.
   </p>
   <p>
    When I converse with the freest of my neighbors, I perceive that,
   </p>
   <p>
    whatever they may say about the magnitude and seriousness of the
   </p>
   <p>
    question, and their regard for the public tranquillity, the long and
   </p>
   <p>
    the short of the matter is, that they cannot spare the protection of
   </p>
   <p>
    the existing government, and they dread the consequences of
   </p>
   <p>
    disobedience to it to their property and families. For my own part, I
   </p>
   <p>
    should not like to think that I ever rely on the protection of the
   </p>
   <p>
    State. But, if I deny the authority of the State when it presents its
   </p>
   <p>
    tax-bill, it will soon take and waste all my property, and so harass me
   </p>
   <p>
    and my children without end. This is hard. This makes it impossible for
   </p>
   <p>
    a man to live honestly and at the same time comfortably in outward
   </p>
   <p>
    respects. It will not be worth the while to accumulate property; that
   </p>
   <p>
    would be sure to go again. You must hire or squat somewhere, and raise
   </p>
   <p>
    but a small crop, and eat that soon. You must live within yourself, and
   </p>
   <p>
    depend upon yourself, always tucked up and ready for a start, and not
   </p>
   <p>
    have many affairs. A man may grow rich in Turkey even, if he will be in
   </p>
   <p>
    all respects a good subject of the Turkish government. Confucius
   </p>
   <p>
    said,—“If a State is governed by the principles of reason, poverty and
   </p>
   <p>
    misery are subjects of shame; if a State is not governed by the
   </p>
   <p>
    principles of reason, riches and honors are the subjects of shame.” No:
   </p>
   <p>
    until I want the protection of Massachusetts to be extended to me in
   </p>
   <p>
    some distant southern port, where my liberty is endangered, or until I
   </p>
   <p>
    am bent solely on building up an estate at home by peaceful enterprise,
   </p>
   <p>
    I can afford to refuse allegiance to Massachusetts, and her right to my
   </p>
   <p>
    property and life. It costs me less in every sense to incur the penalty
   </p>
   <p>
    of disobedience to the State, than it would to obey. I should feel as
   </p>
   <p>
    if I were worth less in that case.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some years ago, the State met me in behalf of the church, and commanded
   </p>
   <p>
    me to pay a certain sum toward the support of a clergyman whose
   </p>
   <p>
    preaching my father attended, but never I myself. “Pay it,” it said,
   </p>
   <p>
    “or be locked up in the jail.” I declined to pay. But, unfortunately,
   </p>
   <p>
    another man saw fit to pay it. I did not see why the schoolmaster
   </p>
   <p>
    should be taxed to support the priest, and not the priest the
   </p>
   <p>
    schoolmaster; for I was not the State’s schoolmaster, but I supported
   </p>
   <p>
    myself by voluntary subscription. I did not see why the lyceum should
   </p>
   <p>
    not present its tax-bill, and have the State to back its demand, as
   </p>
   <p>
    well as the church. However, at the request of the selectmen, I
   </p>
   <p>
    condescended to make some such statement as this in writing:—“Know all
   </p>
   <p>
    men by these presents, that I, Henry Thoreau, do not wish to be
   </p>
   <p>
    regarded as a member of any incorporated society which I have not
   </p>
   <p>
    joined.” This I gave to the town-clerk; and he has it. The State,
   </p>
   <p>
    having thus learned that I did not wish to be regarded as a member of
   </p>
   <p>
    that church, has never made a like demand on me since; though it said
   </p>
   <p>
    that it must adhere to its original presumption that time. If I had
   </p>
   <p>
    known how to name them, I should then have signed off in detail from
   </p>
   <p>
    all the societies which I never signed on to; but I did not know where
   </p>
   <p>
    to find such a complete list.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have paid no poll-tax for six years. I was put into a jail once on
   </p>
   <p>
    this account, for one night; and, as I stood considering the walls of
   </p>
   <p>
    solid stone, two or three feet thick, the door of wood and iron, a foot
   </p>
   <p>
    thick, and the iron grating which strained the light, I could not help
   </p>
   <p>
    being struck with the foolishness of that institution which treated me
   </p>
   <p>
    as if I were mere flesh and blood and bones, to be locked up. I
   </p>
   <p>
    wondered that it should have concluded at length that this was the best
   </p>
   <p>
    use it could put me to, and had never thought to avail itself of my
   </p>
   <p>
    services in some way. I saw that, if there was a wall of stone between
   </p>
   <p>
    me and my townsmen, there was a still more difficult one to climb or
   </p>
   <p>
    break through, before they could get to be as free as I was. I did nor
   </p>
   <p>
    for a moment feel confined, and the walls seemed a great waste of stone
   </p>
   <p>
    and mortar. I felt as if I alone of all my townsmen had paid my tax.
   </p>
   <p>
    They plainly did not know how to treat me, but behaved like persons who
   </p>
   <p>
    are underbred. In every threat and in every compliment there was a
   </p>
   <p>
    blunder; for they thought that my chief desire was to stand the other
   </p>
   <p>
    side of that stone wall. I could not but smile to see how industriously
   </p>
   <p>
    they locked the door on my meditations, which followed them out again
   </p>
   <p>
    without let or hindrance, and _they_ were really all that was
   </p>
   <p>
    dangerous. As they could not reach me, they had resolved to punish my
   </p>
   <p>
    body; just as boys, if they cannot come at some person against whom
   </p>
   <p>
    they have a spite, will abuse his dog. I saw that the State was
   </p>
   <p>
    half-witted, that it was timid as a lone woman with her silver spoons,
   </p>
   <p>
    and that it did not know its friends from its foes, and I lost all my
   </p>
   <p>
    remaining respect for it, and pitied it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus the state never intentionally confronts a man’s sense,
   </p>
   <p>
    intellectual or moral, but only his body, his senses. It is not armed
   </p>
   <p>
    with superior wit or honesty, but with superior physical strength. I
   </p>
   <p>
    was not born to be forced. I will breathe after my own fashion. Let us
   </p>
   <p>
    see who is the strongest. What force has a multitude? They only can
   </p>
   <p>
    force me who obey a higher law than I. They force me to become like
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves. I do not hear of _men_ being _forced_ to live this way or
   </p>
   <p>
    that by masses of men. What sort of life were that to live? When I meet
   </p>
   <p>
    a government which says to me, “Your money or your life,” why should I
   </p>
   <p>
    be in haste to give it my money? It may be in a great strait, and not
   </p>
   <p>
    know what to do: I cannot help that. It must help itself; do as I do.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is not worth the while to snivel about it. I am not responsible for
   </p>
   <p>
    the successful working of the machinery of society. I am not the son of
   </p>
   <p>
    the engineer. I perceive that, when an acorn and a chestnut fall side
   </p>
   <p>
    by side, the one does not remain inert to make way for the other, but
   </p>
   <p>
    both obey their own laws, and spring and grow and flourish as best they
   </p>
   <p>
    can, till one, perchance, overshadows and destroys the other. If a
   </p>
   <p>
    plant cannot live according to its nature, it dies; and so a man.
   </p>
   <p>
    The night in prison was novel and interesting enough. The prisoners in
   </p>
   <p>
    their shirt-sleeves were enjoying a chat and the evening air in the
   </p>
   <p>
    door-way, when I entered. But the jailer said, “Come, boys, it is time
   </p>
   <p>
    to lock up;” and so they dispersed, and I heard the sound of their
   </p>
   <p>
    steps returning into the hollow apartments. My room-mate was introduced
   </p>
   <p>
    to me by the jailer as “a first-rate fellow and a clever man.” When the
   </p>
   <p>
    door was locked, he showed me where to hang my hat, and how he managed
   </p>
   <p>
    matters there. The rooms were whitewashed once a month; and this one,
   </p>
   <p>
    at least, was the whitest, most simply furnished, and probably the
   </p>
   <p>
    neatest apartment in town. He naturally wanted to know where I came
   </p>
   <p>
    from, and what brought me there; and, when I had told him, I asked him
   </p>
   <p>
    in my turn how he came there, presuming him to be an honest man, of
   </p>
   <p>
    course; and, as the world goes, I believe he was. “Why,” said he, “they
   </p>
   <p>
    accuse me of burning a barn; but I never did it.” As near as I could
   </p>
   <p>
    discover, he had probably gone to bed in a barn when drunk, and smoked
   </p>
   <p>
    his pipe there; and so a barn was burnt. He had the reputation of being
   </p>
   <p>
    a clever man, had been there some three months waiting for his trial to
   </p>
   <p>
    come on, and would have to wait as much longer; but he was quite
   </p>
   <p>
    domesticated and contented, since he got his board for nothing, and
   </p>
   <p>
    thought that he was well treated.
   </p>
   <p>
    He occupied one window, and I the other; and I saw, that, if one stayed
   </p>
   <p>
    there long, his principal business would be to look out the window. I
   </p>
   <p>
    had soon read all the tracts that were left there, and examined where
   </p>
   <p>
    former prisoners had broken out, and where a grate had been sawed off,
   </p>
   <p>
    and heard the history of the various occupants of that room; for I
   </p>
   <p>
    found that even here there was a history and a gossip which never
   </p>
   <p>
    circulated beyond the walls of the jail. Probably this is the only
   </p>
   <p>
    house in the town where verses are composed, which are afterward
   </p>
   <p>
    printed in a circular form, but not published. I was shown quite a long
   </p>
   <p>
    list of verses which were composed by some young men who had been
   </p>
   <p>
    detected in an attempt to escape, who avenged themselves by singing
   </p>
   <p>
    them.
   </p>
   <p>
    I pumped my fellow-prisoner as dry as I could, for fear I should never
   </p>
   <p>
    see him again; but at length he showed me which was my bed, and left me
   </p>
   <p>
    to blow out the lamp.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was like travelling into a far country, such as I had never expected
   </p>
   <p>
    to behold, to lie there for one night. It seemed to me that I never had
   </p>
   <p>
    heard the town-clock strike before, nor the evening sounds of the
   </p>
   <p>
    village; for we slept with the windows open, which were inside the
   </p>
   <p>
    grating. It was to see my native village in the light of the Middle
   </p>
   <p>
    Ages, and our Concord was turned into a Rhine stream, and visions of
   </p>
   <p>
    knights and castles passed before me. They were the voices of old
   </p>
   <p>
    burghers that I heard in the streets. I was an involuntary spectator
   </p>
   <p>
    and auditor of whatever was done and said in the kitchen of the
   </p>
   <p>
    adjacent village-inn—a wholly new and rare experience to me. It was a
   </p>
   <p>
    closer view of my native town. I was fairly inside of it. I never had
   </p>
   <p>
    seen its institutions before. This is one of its peculiar institutions;
   </p>
   <p>
    for it is a shire town. I began to comprehend what its inhabitants were
   </p>
   <p>
    about.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the morning, our breakfasts were put through the hole in the door,
   </p>
   <p>
    in small oblong-square tin pans, made to fit, and holding a pint of
   </p>
   <p>
    chocolate, with brown bread, and an iron spoon. When they called for
   </p>
   <p>
    the vessels again, I was green enough to return what bread I had left;
   </p>
   <p>
    but my comrade seized it, and said that I should lay that up for lunch
   </p>
   <p>
    or dinner. Soon after, he was let out to work at haying in a
   </p>
   <p>
    neighboring field, whither he went every day, and would not be back
   </p>
   <p>
    till noon; so he bade me good-day, saying that he doubted if he should
   </p>
   <p>
    see me again.
   </p>
   <p>
    When I came out of prison,—for some one interfered, and paid the tax,—I
   </p>
   <p>
    did not perceive that great changes had taken place on the common, such
   </p>
   <p>
    as he observed who went in a youth, and emerged a gray-headed man; and
   </p>
   <p>
    yet a change had to my eyes come over the scene,—the town, and State,
   </p>
   <p>
    and country,—greater than any that mere time could effect. I saw yet
   </p>
   <p>
    more distinctly the State in which I lived. I saw to what extent the
   </p>
   <p>
    people among whom I lived could be trusted as good neighbors and
   </p>
   <p>
    friends; that their friendship was for summer weather only; that they
   </p>
   <p>
    did not greatly purpose to do right; that they were a distinct race
   </p>
   <p>
    from me by their prejudices and superstitions, as the Chinamen and
   </p>
   <p>
    Malays are; that, in their sacrifices to humanity they ran no risks,
   </p>
   <p>
    not even to their property; that, after all, they were not so noble but
   </p>
   <p>
    they treated the thief as he had treated them, and hoped, by a certain
   </p>
   <p>
    outward observance and a few prayers, and by walking in a particular
   </p>
   <p>
    straight though useless path from time to time, to save their souls.
   </p>
   <p>
    This may be to judge my neighbors harshly; for I believe that most of
   </p>
   <p>
    them are not aware that they have such an institution as the jail in
   </p>
   <p>
    their village.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was formerly the custom in our village, when a poor debtor came out
   </p>
   <p>
    of jail, for his acquaintances to salute him, looking through their
   </p>
   <p>
    fingers, which were crossed to represent the grating of a jail window,
   </p>
   <p>
    “How do ye do?” My neighbors did not thus salute me, but first looked
   </p>
   <p>
    at me, and then at one another, as if I had returned from a long
   </p>
   <p>
    journey. I was put into jail as I was going to the shoemaker’s to get a
   </p>
   <p>
    shoe which was mended. When I was let out the next morning, I proceeded
   </p>
   <p>
    to finish my errand, and, having put on my mended shoe, joined a
   </p>
   <p>
    huckleberry party, who were impatient to put themselves under my
   </p>
   <p>
    conduct; and in half an hour,—for the horse was soon tackled,—was in
   </p>
   <p>
    the midst of a huckleberry field, on one of our highest hills, two
   </p>
   <p>
    miles off; and then the State was nowhere to be seen.
   </p>
   <p>
    This is the whole history of “My Prisons.”
   </p>
   <p>
    I have never declined paying the highway tax, because I am as desirous
   </p>
   <p>
    of being a good neighbor as I am of being a bad subject; and, as for
   </p>
   <p>
    supporting schools, I am doing my part to educate my fellow-countrymen
   </p>
   <p>
    now. It is for no particular item in the tax-bill that I refuse to pay
   </p>
   <p>
    it. I simply wish to refuse allegiance to the State, to withdraw and
   </p>
   <p>
    stand aloof from it effectually. I do not care to trace the course of
   </p>
   <p>
    my dollar, if I could, till it buys a man, or a musket to shoot one
   </p>
   <p>
    with,—the dollar is innocent,—but I am concerned to trace the effects
   </p>
   <p>
    of my allegiance. In fact, I quietly declare war with the State, after
   </p>
   <p>
    my fashion, though I will still make use and get what advantages of her
   </p>
   <p>
    I can, as is usual in such cases.
   </p>
   <p>
    If others pay the tax which is demanded of me, from a sympathy with the
   </p>
   <p>
    State, they do but what they have already done in their own case, or
   </p>
   <p>
    rather they abet injustice to a greater extent than the State requires.
   </p>
   <p>
    If they pay the tax from a mistaken interest in the individual taxed,
   </p>
   <p>
    to save his property or prevent his going to jail, it is because they
   </p>
   <p>
    have not considered wisely how far they let their private feelings
   </p>
   <p>
    interfere with the public good.
   </p>
   <p>
    This, then, is my position at present. But one cannot be too much on
   </p>
   <p>
    his guard in such a case, lest his actions be biassed by obstinacy, or
   </p>
   <p>
    an undue regard for the opinions of men. Let him see that he does only
   </p>
   <p>
    what belongs to himself and to the hour.
   </p>
   <p>
    I think sometimes, Why, this people mean well; they are only ignorant;
   </p>
   <p>
    they would do better if they knew how: why give your neighbors this
   </p>
   <p>
    pain to treat you as they are not inclined to? But I think, again, this
   </p>
   <p>
    is no reason why I should do as they do, or permit others to suffer
   </p>
   <p>
    much greater pain of a different kind. Again, I sometimes say to
   </p>
   <p>
    myself, When many millions of men, without heat, without ill-will,
   </p>
   <p>
    without personal feeling of any kind, demand of you a few shillings
   </p>
   <p>
    only, without the possibility, such is their constitution, of
   </p>
   <p>
    retracting or altering their present demand, and without the
   </p>
   <p>
    possibility, on your side, of appeal to any other millions, why expose
   </p>
   <p>
    yourself to this overwhelming brute force? You do not resist cold and
   </p>
   <p>
    hunger, the winds and the waves, thus obstinately; you quietly submit
   </p>
   <p>
    to a thousand similar necessities. You do not put your head into the
   </p>
   <p>
    fire. But just in proportion as I regard this as not wholly a brute
   </p>
   <p>
    force, but partly a human force, and consider that I have relations to
   </p>
   <p>
    those millions as to so many millions of men, and not of mere brute or
   </p>
   <p>
    inanimate things, I see that appeal is possible, first and
   </p>
   <p>
    instantaneously, from them to the Maker of them, and, secondly, from
   </p>
   <p>
    them to themselves. But, if I put my head deliberately into the fire,
   </p>
   <p>
    there is no appeal to fire or to the Maker of fire, and I have only
   </p>
   <p>
    myself to blame. If I could convince myself that I have any right to be
   </p>
   <p>
    satisfied with men as they are, and to treat them accordingly, and not
   </p>
   <p>
    according, in some respects, to my requisitions and expectations of
   </p>
   <p>
    what they and I ought to be, then, like a good Mussulman and fatalist,
   </p>
   <p>
    I should endeavor to be satisfied with things as they are, and say it
   </p>
   <p>
    is the will of God. And, above all, there is this difference between
   </p>
   <p>
    resisting this and a purely brute or natural force, that I can resist
   </p>
   <p>
    this with some effect; but I cannot expect, like Orpheus, to change the
   </p>
   <p>
    nature of the rocks and trees and beasts.
   </p>
   <p>
    I do not wish to quarrel with any man or nation. I do not wish to split
   </p>
   <p>
    hairs, to make fine distinctions, or set myself up as better than my
   </p>
   <p>
    neighbors. I seek rather, I may say, even an excuse for conforming to
   </p>
   <p>
    the laws of the land. I am but too ready to conform to them. Indeed I
   </p>
   <p>
    have reason to suspect myself on this head; and each year, as the
   </p>
   <p>
    tax-gatherer comes round, I find myself disposed to review the acts and
   </p>
   <p>
    position of the general and state governments, and the spirit of the
   </p>
   <p>
    people to discover a pretext for conformity.
   </p>
   <p>
    “We must affect our country as our parents,
   </p>
   <p>
    And if at any time we alienate
   </p>
   <p>
    Out love of industry from doing it honor,
   </p>
   <p>
    We must respect effects and teach the soul
   </p>
   <p>
    Matter of conscience and religion,
   </p>
   <p>
    And not desire of rule or benefit.”
   </p>
   <p>
    I believe that the State will soon be able to take all my work of this
   </p>
   <p>
    sort out of my hands, and then I shall be no better patriot than my
   </p>
   <p>
    fellow-countrymen. Seen from a lower point of view, the Constitution,
   </p>
   <p>
    with all its faults, is very good; the law and the courts are very
   </p>
   <p>
    respectable; even this State and this American government are, in many
   </p>
   <p>
    respects, very admirable, and rare things, to be thankful for, such as
   </p>
   <p>
    a great many have described them; seen from a higher still, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    highest, who shall say what they are, or that they are worth looking at
   </p>
   <p>
    or thinking of at all?
   </p>
   <p>
    However, the government does not concern me much, and I shall bestow
   </p>
   <p>
    the fewest possible thoughts on it. It is not many moments that I live
   </p>
   <p>
    under a government, even in this world. If a man is thought-free,
   </p>
   <p>
    fancy-free, imagination-free, that which _is not_ never for a long time
   </p>
   <p>
    appearing _to be_ to him, unwise rulers or reformers cannot fatally
   </p>
   <p>
    interrupt him.
   </p>
   <p>
    I know that most men think differently from myself; but those whose
   </p>
   <p>
    lives are by profession devoted to the study of these or kindred
   </p>
   <p>
    subjects content me as little as any. Statesmen and legislators,
   </p>
   <p>
    standing so completely within the institution, never distinctly and
   </p>
   <p>
    nakedly behold it. They speak of moving society, but have no
   </p>
   <p>
    resting-place without it. They may be men of a certain experience and
   </p>
   <p>
    discrimination, and have no doubt invented ingenious and even useful
   </p>
   <p>
    systems, for which we sincerely thank them; but all their wit and
   </p>
   <p>
    usefulness lie within certain not very wide limits. They are wont to
   </p>
   <p>
    forget that the world is not governed by policy and expediency. Webster
   </p>
   <p>
    never goes behind government, and so cannot speak with authority about
   </p>
   <p>
    it. His words are wisdom to those legislators who contemplate no
   </p>
   <p>
    essential reform in the existing government; but for thinkers, and
   </p>
   <p>
    those who legislate for all time, he never once glances at the subject.
   </p>
   <p>
    I know of those whose serene and wise speculations on this theme would
   </p>
   <p>
    soon reveal the limits of his mind’s range and hospitality. Yet,
   </p>
   <p>
    compared with the cheap professions of most reformers, and the still
   </p>
   <p>
    cheaper wisdom and eloquence of politicians in general, his are almost
   </p>
   <p>
    the only sensible and valuable words, and we thank Heaven for him.
   </p>
   <p>
    Comparatively, he is always strong, original, and, above all,
   </p>
   <p>
    practical. Still his quality is not wisdom, but prudence. The lawyer’s
   </p>
   <p>
    truth is not Truth, but consistency or a consistent expediency. Truth
   </p>
   <p>
    is always in harmony with herself, and is not concerned chiefly to
   </p>
   <p>
    reveal the justice that may consist with wrong-doing. He well deserves
   </p>
   <p>
    to be called, as he has been called, the Defender of the Constitution.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are really no blows to be given by him but defensive ones. He is
   </p>
   <p>
    not a leader, but a follower. His leaders are the men of ’87. “I have
   </p>
   <p>
    never made an effort,” he says, “and never propose to make an effort; I
   </p>
   <p>
    have never countenanced an effort, and never mean to countenance an
   </p>
   <p>
    effort, to disturb the arrangement as originally made, by which the
   </p>
   <p>
    various States came into the Union.” Still thinking of the sanction
   </p>
   <p>
    which the Constitution gives to slavery, he says, “Because it was part
   </p>
   <p>
    of the original compact,—let it stand.” Notwithstanding his special
   </p>
   <p>
    acuteness and ability, he is unable to take a fact out of its merely
   </p>
   <p>
    political relations, and behold it as it lies absolutely to be disposed
   </p>
   <p>
    of by the intellect,—what, for instance, it behoves a man to do here in
   </p>
   <p>
    America today with regard to slavery, but ventures, or is driven, to
   </p>
   <p>
    make some such desperate answer as the following, while professing to
   </p>
   <p>
    speak absolutely, and as a private man,—from which what new and
   </p>
   <p>
    singular code of social duties might be inferred?—“The manner,” says
   </p>
   <p>
    he, “in which the governments of those States where slavery exists are
   </p>
   <p>
    to regulate it, is for their own consideration, under the
   </p>
   <p>
    responsibility to their constituents, to the general laws of propriety,
   </p>
   <p>
    humanity, and justice, and to God. Associations formed elsewhere,
   </p>
   <p>
    springing from a feeling of humanity, or any other cause, have nothing
   </p>
   <p>
    whatever to do with it. They have never received any encouragement from
   </p>
   <p>
    me and they never will.”
   </p>
   <p>
    They who know of no purer sources of truth, who have traced up its
   </p>
   <p>
    stream no higher, stand, and wisely stand, by the Bible and the
   </p>
   <p>
    Constitution, and drink at it there with reverence and humanity; but
   </p>
   <p>
    they who behold where it comes trickling into this lake or that pool,
   </p>
   <p>
    gird up their loins once more, and continue their pilgrimage toward its
   </p>
   <p>
    fountain-head.
   </p>
   <p>
    No man with a genius for legislation has appeared in America. They are
   </p>
   <p>
    rare in the history of the world. There are orators, politicians, and
   </p>
   <p>
    eloquent men, by the thousand; but the speaker has not yet opened his
   </p>
   <p>
    mouth to speak who is capable of settling the much-vexed questions of
   </p>
   <p>
    the day. We love eloquence for its own sake, and not for any truth
   </p>
   <p>
    which it may utter, or any heroism it may inspire. Our legislators have
   </p>
   <p>
    not yet learned the comparative value of free-trade and of freedom, of
   </p>
   <p>
    union, and of rectitude, to a nation. They have no genius or talent for
   </p>
   <p>
    comparatively humble questions of taxation and finance, commerce and
   </p>
   <p>
    manufactures and agriculture. If we were left solely to the wordy wit
   </p>
   <p>
    of legislators in Congress for our guidance, uncorrected by the
   </p>
   <p>
    seasonable experience and the effectual complaints of the people,
   </p>
   <p>
    America would not long retain her rank among the nations. For eighteen
   </p>
   <p>
    hundred years, though perchance I have no right to say it, the New
   </p>
   <p>
    Testament has been written; yet where is the legislator who has wisdom
   </p>
   <p>
    and practical talent enough to avail himself of the light which it
   </p>
   <p>
    sheds on the science of legislation.
   </p>
   <p>
    The authority of government, even such as I am willing to submit
   </p>
   <p>
    to,—for I will cheerfully obey those who know and can do better than I,
   </p>
   <p>
    and in many things even those who neither know nor can do so well,—is
   </p>
   <p>
    still an impure one: to be strictly just, it must have the sanction and
   </p>
   <p>
    consent of the governed. It can have no pure right over my person and
   </p>
   <p>
    property but what I concede to it. The progress from an absolute to a
   </p>
   <p>
    limited monarchy, from a limited monarchy to a democracy, is a progress
   </p>
   <p>
    toward a true respect for the individual. Even the Chinese philosopher
   </p>
   <p>
    was wise enough to regard the individual as the basis of the empire. Is
   </p>
   <p>
    a democracy, such as we know it, the last improvement possible in
   </p>
   <p>
    government? Is it not possible to take a step further towards
   </p>
   <p>
    recognizing and organizing the rights of man? There will never be a
   </p>
   <p>
    really free and enlightened State, until the State comes to recognize
   </p>
   <p>
    the individual as a higher and independent power, from which all its
   </p>
   <p>
    own power and authority are derived, and treats him accordingly. I
   </p>
   <p>
    please myself with imagining a State at last which can afford to be
   </p>
   <p>
    just to all men, and to treat the individual with respect as a
   </p>
   <p>
    neighbor; which even would not think it inconsistent with its own
   </p>
   <p>
    repose, if a few were to live aloof from it, not meddling with it, nor
   </p>
   <p>
    embraced by it, who fulfilled all the duties of neighbors and
   </p>
   <p>
    fellow-men. A State which bore this kind of fruit, and suffered it to
   </p>
   <p>
    drop off as fast as it ripened, would prepare the way for a still more
   </p>
   <p>
    perfect and glorious State, which also I have imagined, but not yet
   </p>
   <p>
    anywhere seen.
