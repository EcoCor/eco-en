   <p>
    Tess of the d’Urbervilles
   </p>
   <p>
    Phase the First:
   </p>
   <p>
    The Maiden
   </p>
   <p>
    I
   </p>
   <p>
    On an evening in the latter part of May a middle-aged man was walking
   </p>
   <p>
    homeward from Shaston to the village of Marlott, in the adjoining Vale
   </p>
   <p>
    of Blakemore, or Blackmoor. The pair of legs that carried him were
   </p>
   <p>
    rickety, and there was a bias in his gait which inclined him somewhat
   </p>
   <p>
    to the left of a straight line. He occasionally gave a smart nod, as if
   </p>
   <p>
    in confirmation of some opinion, though he was not thinking of anything
   </p>
   <p>
    in particular. An empty egg-basket was slung upon his arm, the nap of
   </p>
   <p>
    his hat was ruffled, a patch being quite worn away at its brim where
   </p>
   <p>
    his thumb came in taking it off. Presently he was met by an elderly
   </p>
   <p>
    parson astride on a gray mare, who, as he rode, hummed a wandering
   </p>
   <p>
    tune.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Good night t’ee,” said the man with the basket.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Good night, Sir John,” said the parson.
   </p>
   <p>
    The pedestrian, after another pace or two, halted, and turned round.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Now, sir, begging your pardon; we met last market-day on this road
   </p>
   <p>
    about this time, and I said ‘Good night,’ and you made reply ‘_Good
   </p>
   <p>
    night, Sir John_,’ as now.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I did,” said the parson.
   </p>
   <p>
    “And once before that—near a month ago.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I may have.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Then what might your meaning be in calling me ‘Sir John’ these
   </p>
   <p>
    different times, when I be plain Jack Durbeyfield, the haggler?”
   </p>
   <p>
    The parson rode a step or two nearer.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It was only my whim,” he said; and, after a moment’s hesitation: “It
   </p>
   <p>
    was on account of a discovery I made some little time ago, whilst I was
   </p>
   <p>
    hunting up pedigrees for the new county history. I am Parson Tringham,
   </p>
   <p>
    the antiquary, of Stagfoot Lane. Don’t you really know, Durbeyfield,
   </p>
   <p>
    that you are the lineal representative of the ancient and knightly
   </p>
   <p>
    family of the d’Urbervilles, who derive their descent from Sir Pagan
   </p>
   <p>
    d’Urberville, that renowned knight who came from Normandy with William
   </p>
   <p>
    the Conqueror, as appears by Battle Abbey Roll?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Never heard it before, sir!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well it’s true. Throw up your chin a moment, so that I may catch the
   </p>
   <p>
    profile of your face better. Yes, that’s the d’Urberville nose and
   </p>
   <p>
    chin—a little debased. Your ancestor was one of the twelve knights who
   </p>
   <p>
    assisted the Lord of Estremavilla in Normandy in his conquest of
   </p>
   <p>
    Glamorganshire. Branches of your family held manors over all this part
   </p>
   <p>
    of England; their names appear in the Pipe Rolls in the time of King
   </p>
   <p>
    Stephen. In the reign of King John one of them was rich enough to give
   </p>
   <p>
    a manor to the Knights Hospitallers; and in Edward the Second’s time
   </p>
   <p>
    your forefather Brian was summoned to Westminster to attend the great
   </p>
   <p>
    Council there. You declined a little in Oliver Cromwell’s time, but to
   </p>
   <p>
    no serious extent, and in Charles the Second’s reign you were made
   </p>
   <p>
    Knights of the Royal Oak for your loyalty. Aye, there have been
   </p>
   <p>
    generations of Sir Johns among you, and if knighthood were hereditary,
   </p>
   <p>
    like a baronetcy, as it practically was in old times, when men were
   </p>
   <p>
    knighted from father to son, you would be Sir John now.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ye don’t say so!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “In short,” concluded the parson, decisively smacking his leg with his
   </p>
   <p>
    switch, “there’s hardly such another family in England.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Daze my eyes, and isn’t there?” said Durbeyfield. “And here have I
   </p>
   <p>
    been knocking about, year after year, from pillar to post, as if I was
   </p>
   <p>
    no more than the commonest feller in the parish.... And how long hev
   </p>
   <p>
    this news about me been knowed, Pa’son Tringham?”
   </p>
   <p>
    The clergyman explained that, as far as he was aware, it had quite died
   </p>
   <p>
    out of knowledge, and could hardly be said to be known at all. His own
   </p>
   <p>
    investigations had begun on a day in the preceding spring when, having
   </p>
   <p>
    been engaged in tracing the vicissitudes of the d’Urberville family, he
   </p>
   <p>
    had observed Durbeyfield’s name on his waggon, and had thereupon been
   </p>
   <p>
    led to make inquiries about his father and grandfather till he had no
   </p>
   <p>
    doubt on the subject.
   </p>
   <p>
    “At first I resolved not to disturb you with such a useless piece of
   </p>
   <p>
    information,” said he. “However, our impulses are too strong for our
   </p>
   <p>
    judgement sometimes. I thought you might perhaps know something of it
   </p>
   <p>
    all the while.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, I have heard once or twice, ’tis true, that my family had seen
   </p>
   <p>
    better days afore they came to Blackmoor. But I took no notice o’t,
   </p>
   <p>
    thinking it to mean that we had once kept two horses where we now keep
   </p>
   <p>
    only one. I’ve got a wold silver spoon, and a wold graven seal at home,
   </p>
   <p>
    too; but, Lord, what’s a spoon and seal?... And to think that I and
   </p>
   <p>
    these noble d’Urbervilles were one flesh all the time. ’Twas said that
   </p>
   <p>
    my gr’t-granfer had secrets, and didn’t care to talk of where he came
   </p>
   <p>
    from.... And where do we raise our smoke, now, parson, if I may make so
   </p>
   <p>
    bold; I mean, where do we d’Urbervilles live?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You don’t live anywhere. You are extinct—as a county family.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “That’s bad.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes—what the mendacious family chronicles call extinct in the male
   </p>
   <p>
    line—that is, gone down—gone under.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Then where do we lie?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “At Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill: rows and rows of you in your vaults, with
   </p>
   <p>
    your effigies under Purbeck-marble canopies.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And where be our family mansions and estates?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You haven’t any.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh? No lands neither?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “None; though you once had ’em in abundance, as I said, for your family
   </p>
   <p>
    consisted of numerous branches. In this county there was a seat of
   </p>
   <p>
    yours at Kingsbere, and another at Sherton, and another in Millpond,
   </p>
   <p>
    and another at Lullstead, and another at Wellbridge.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And shall we ever come into our own again?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah—that I can’t tell!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And what had I better do about it, sir?” asked Durbeyfield, after a
   </p>
   <p>
    pause.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh—nothing, nothing; except chasten yourself with the thought of ‘how
   </p>
   <p>
    are the mighty fallen.’ It is a fact of some interest to the local
   </p>
   <p>
    historian and genealogist, nothing more. There are several families
   </p>
   <p>
    among the cottagers of this county of almost equal lustre. Good night.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But you’ll turn back and have a quart of beer wi’ me on the strength
   </p>
   <p>
    o’t, Pa’son Tringham? There’s a very pretty brew in tap at The Pure
   </p>
   <p>
    Drop—though, to be sure, not so good as at Rolliver’s.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No, thank you—not this evening, Durbeyfield. You’ve had enough
   </p>
   <p>
    already.” Concluding thus, the parson rode on his way, with doubts as
   </p>
   <p>
    to his discretion in retailing this curious bit of lore.
   </p>
   <p>
    When he was gone, Durbeyfield walked a few steps in a profound reverie,
   </p>
   <p>
    and then sat down upon the grassy bank by the roadside, depositing his
   </p>
   <p>
    basket before him. In a few minutes a youth appeared in the distance,
   </p>
   <p>
    walking in the same direction as that which had been pursued by
   </p>
   <p>
    Durbeyfield. The latter, on seeing him, held up his hand, and the lad
   </p>
   <p>
    quickened his pace and came near.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Boy, take up that basket! I want ’ee to go on an errand for me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The lath-like stripling frowned. “Who be you, then, John Durbeyfield,
   </p>
   <p>
    to order me about and call me ‘boy’? You know my name as well as I know
   </p>
   <p>
    yours!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Do you, do you? That’s the secret—that’s the secret! Now obey my
   </p>
   <p>
    orders, and take the message I’m going to charge ’ee wi’... Well, Fred,
   </p>
   <p>
    I don’t mind telling you that the secret is that I’m one of a noble
   </p>
   <p>
    race—it has been just found out by me this present afternoon, p.m.” And
   </p>
   <p>
    as he made the announcement, Durbeyfield, declining from his sitting
   </p>
   <p>
    position, luxuriously stretched himself out upon the bank among the
   </p>
   <p>
    daisies.
   </p>
   <p>
    The lad stood before Durbeyfield, and contemplated his length from
   </p>
   <p>
    crown to toe.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Sir John d’Urberville—that’s who I am,” continued the prostrate man.
   </p>
   <p>
    “That is if knights were baronets—which they be. ’Tis recorded in
   </p>
   <p>
    history all about me. Dost know of such a place, lad, as
   </p>
   <p>
    Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ees. I’ve been there to Greenhill Fair.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, under the church of that city there lie—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “’Tisn’t a city, the place I mean; leastwise ’twaddn’ when I was
   </p>
   <p>
    there—’twas a little one-eyed, blinking sort o’ place.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Never you mind the place, boy, that’s not the question before us.
   </p>
   <p>
    Under the church of that there parish lie my ancestors—hundreds of
   </p>
   <p>
    ’em—in coats of mail and jewels, in gr’t lead coffins weighing tons and
   </p>
   <p>
    tons. There’s not a man in the county o’ South-Wessex that’s got
   </p>
   <p>
    grander and nobler skillentons in his family than I.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Now take up that basket, and goo on to Marlott, and when you’ve come
   </p>
   <p>
    to The Pure Drop Inn, tell ’em to send a horse and carriage to me
   </p>
   <p>
    immed’ately, to carry me hwome. And in the bottom o’ the carriage they
   </p>
   <p>
    be to put a noggin o’ rum in a small bottle, and chalk it up to my
   </p>
   <p>
    account. And when you’ve done that goo on to my house with the basket,
   </p>
   <p>
    and tell my wife to put away that washing, because she needn’t finish
   </p>
   <p>
    it, and wait till I come hwome, as I’ve news to tell her.”
   </p>
   <p>
    As the lad stood in a dubious attitude, Durbeyfield put his hand in his
   </p>
   <p>
    pocket, and produced a shilling, one of the chronically few that he
   </p>
   <p>
    possessed.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Here’s for your labour, lad.”
   </p>
   <p>
    This made a difference in the young man’s estimate of the position.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, Sir John. Thank ’ee. Anything else I can do for ’ee, Sir John?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tell ’em at hwome that I should like for supper,—well, lamb’s fry if
   </p>
   <p>
    they can get it; and if they can’t, black-pot; and if they can’t get
   </p>
   <p>
    that, well chitterlings will do.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, Sir John.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The boy took up the basket, and as he set out the notes of a brass band
   </p>
   <p>
    were heard from the direction of the village.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What’s that?” said Durbeyfield. “Not on account o’ I?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “’Tis the women’s club-walking, Sir John. Why, your da’ter is one o’
   </p>
   <p>
    the members.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “To be sure—I’d quite forgot it in my thoughts of greater things! Well,
   </p>
   <p>
    vamp on to Marlott, will ye, and order that carriage, and maybe I’ll
   </p>
   <p>
    drive round and inspect the club.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The lad departed, and Durbeyfield lay waiting on the grass and daisies
   </p>
   <p>
    in the evening sun. Not a soul passed that way for a long while, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the faint notes of the band were the only human sounds audible within
   </p>
   <p>
    the rim of blue hills.
   </p>
   <p>
    II
   </p>
   <p>
    The village of Marlott lay amid the north-eastern undulations of the
   </p>
   <p>
    beautiful Vale of Blakemore, or Blackmoor, aforesaid, an engirdled and
   </p>
   <p>
    secluded region, for the most part untrodden as yet by tourist or
   </p>
   <p>
    landscape-painter, though within a four hours’ journey from London.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is a vale whose acquaintance is best made by viewing it from the
   </p>
   <p>
    summits of the hills that surround it—except perhaps during the
   </p>
   <p>
    droughts of summer. An unguided ramble into its recesses in bad weather
   </p>
   <p>
    is apt to engender dissatisfaction with its narrow, tortuous, and miry
   </p>
   <p>
    ways.
   </p>
   <p>
    This fertile and sheltered tract of country, in which the fields are
   </p>
   <p>
    never brown and the springs never dry, is bounded on the south by the
   </p>
   <p>
    bold chalk ridge that embraces the prominences of Hambledon Hill,
   </p>
   <p>
    Bulbarrow, Nettlecombe-Tout, Dogbury, High Stoy, and Bubb Down. The
   </p>
   <p>
    traveller from the coast, who, after plodding northward for a score of
   </p>
   <p>
    miles over calcareous downs and corn-lands, suddenly reaches the verge
   </p>
   <p>
    of one of these escarpments, is surprised and delighted to behold,
   </p>
   <p>
    extended like a map beneath him, a country differing absolutely from
   </p>
   <p>
    that which he has passed through. Behind him the hills are open, the
   </p>
   <p>
    sun blazes down upon fields so large as to give an unenclosed character
   </p>
   <p>
    to the landscape, the lanes are white, the hedges low and plashed, the
   </p>
   <p>
    atmosphere colourless. Here, in the valley, the world seems to be
   </p>
   <p>
    constructed upon a smaller and more delicate scale; the fields are mere
   </p>
   <p>
    paddocks, so reduced that from this height their hedgerows appear a
   </p>
   <p>
    network of dark green threads overspreading the paler green of the
   </p>
   <p>
    grass. The atmosphere beneath is languorous, and is so tinged with
   </p>
   <p>
    azure that what artists call the middle distance partakes also of that
   </p>
   <p>
    hue, while the horizon beyond is of the deepest ultramarine. Arable
   </p>
   <p>
    lands are few and limited; with but slight exceptions the prospect is a
   </p>
   <p>
    broad rich mass of grass and trees, mantling minor hills and dales
   </p>
   <p>
    within the major. Such is the Vale of Blackmoor.
   </p>
   <p>
    The district is of historic, no less than of topographical interest.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Vale was known in former times as the Forest of White Hart, from a
   </p>
   <p>
    curious legend of King Henry III’s reign, in which the killing by a
   </p>
   <p>
    certain Thomas de la Lynd of a beautiful white hart which the king had
   </p>
   <p>
    run down and spared, was made the occasion of a heavy fine. In those
   </p>
   <p>
    days, and till comparatively recent times, the country was densely
   </p>
   <p>
    wooded. Even now, traces of its earlier condition are to be found in
   </p>
   <p>
    the old oak copses and irregular belts of timber that yet survive upon
   </p>
   <p>
    its slopes, and the hollow-trunked trees that shade so many of its
   </p>
   <p>
    pastures.
   </p>
   <p>
    The forests have departed, but some old customs of their shades remain.
   </p>
   <p>
    Many, however, linger only in a metamorphosed or disguised form. The
   </p>
   <p>
    May-Day dance, for instance, was to be discerned on the afternoon under
   </p>
   <p>
    notice, in the guise of the club revel, or “club-walking,” as it was
   </p>
   <p>
    there called.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was an interesting event to the younger inhabitants of Marlott,
   </p>
   <p>
    though its real interest was not observed by the participators in the
   </p>
   <p>
    ceremony. Its singularity lay less in the retention of a custom of
   </p>
   <p>
    walking in procession and dancing on each anniversary than in the
   </p>
   <p>
    members being solely women. In men’s clubs such celebrations were,
   </p>
   <p>
    though expiring, less uncommon; but either the natural shyness of the
   </p>
   <p>
    softer sex, or a sarcastic attitude on the part of male relatives, had
   </p>
   <p>
    denuded such women’s clubs as remained (if any other did) or this their
   </p>
   <p>
    glory and consummation. The club of Marlott alone lived to uphold the
   </p>
   <p>
    local Cerealia. It had walked for hundreds of years, if not as
   </p>
   <p>
    benefit-club, as votive sisterhood of some sort; and it walked still.
   </p>
   <p>
    The banded ones were all dressed in white gowns—a gay survival from Old
   </p>
   <p>
    Style days, when cheerfulness and May-time were synonyms—days before
   </p>
   <p>
    the habit of taking long views had reduced emotions to a monotonous
   </p>
   <p>
    average. Their first exhibition of themselves was in a processional
   </p>
   <p>
    march of two and two round the parish. Ideal and real clashed slightly
   </p>
   <p>
    as the sun lit up their figures against the green hedges and
   </p>
   <p>
    creeper-laced house-fronts; for, though the whole troop wore white
   </p>
   <p>
    garments, no two whites were alike among them. Some approached pure
   </p>
   <p>
    blanching; some had a bluish pallor; some worn by the older characters
   </p>
   <p>
    (which had possibly lain by folded for many a year) inclined to a
   </p>
   <p>
    cadaverous tint, and to a Georgian style.
   </p>
   <p>
    In addition to the distinction of a white frock, every woman and girl
   </p>
   <p>
    carried in her right hand a peeled willow wand, and in her left a bunch
   </p>
   <p>
    of white flowers. The peeling of the former, and the selection of the
   </p>
   <p>
    latter, had been an operation of personal care.
   </p>
   <p>
    There were a few middle-aged and even elderly women in the train, their
   </p>
   <p>
    silver-wiry hair and wrinkled faces, scourged by time and trouble,
   </p>
   <p>
    having almost a grotesque, certainly a pathetic, appearance in such a
   </p>
   <p>
    jaunty situation. In a true view, perhaps, there was more to be
   </p>
   <p>
    gathered and told of each anxious and experienced one, to whom the
   </p>
   <p>
    years were drawing nigh when she should say, “I have no pleasure in
   </p>
   <p>
    them,” than of her juvenile comrades. But let the elder be passed over
   </p>
   <p>
    here for those under whose bodices the life throbbed quick and warm.
   </p>
   <p>
    The young girls formed, indeed, the majority of the band, and their
   </p>
   <p>
    heads of luxuriant hair reflected in the sunshine every tone of gold,
   </p>
   <p>
    and black, and brown. Some had beautiful eyes, others a beautiful nose,
   </p>
   <p>
    others a beautiful mouth and figure: few, if any, had all. A difficulty
   </p>
   <p>
    of arranging their lips in this crude exposure to public scrutiny, an
   </p>
   <p>
    inability to balance their heads, and to dissociate self-consciousness
   </p>
   <p>
    from their features, was apparent in them, and showed that they were
   </p>
   <p>
    genuine country girls, unaccustomed to many eyes.
   </p>
   <p>
    And as each and all of them were warmed without by the sun, so each had
   </p>
   <p>
    a private little sun for her soul to bask in; some dream, some
   </p>
   <p>
    affection, some hobby, at least some remote and distant hope which,
   </p>
   <p>
    though perhaps starving to nothing, still lived on, as hopes will. They
   </p>
   <p>
    were all cheerful, and many of them merry.
   </p>
   <p>
    They came round by The Pure Drop Inn, and were turning out of the high
   </p>
   <p>
    road to pass through a wicket-gate into the meadows, when one of the
   </p>
   <p>
    women said—
   </p>
   <p>
    “The Load-a-Lord! Why, Tess Durbeyfield, if there isn’t thy father
   </p>
   <p>
    riding hwome in a carriage!”
   </p>
   <p>
    A young member of the band turned her head at the exclamation. She was
   </p>
   <p>
    a fine and handsome girl—not handsomer than some others, possibly—but
   </p>
   <p>
    her mobile peony mouth and large innocent eyes added eloquence to
   </p>
   <p>
    colour and shape. She wore a red ribbon in her hair, and was the only
   </p>
   <p>
    one of the white company who could boast of such a pronounced
   </p>
   <p>
    adornment. As she looked round Durbeyfield was seen moving along the
   </p>
   <p>
    road in a chaise belonging to The Pure Drop, driven by a frizzle-headed
   </p>
   <p>
    brawny damsel with her gown-sleeves rolled above her elbows. This was
   </p>
   <p>
    the cheerful servant of that establishment, who, in her part of
   </p>
   <p>
    factotum, turned groom and ostler at times. Durbeyfield, leaning back,
   </p>
   <p>
    and with his eyes closed luxuriously, was waving his hand above his
   </p>
   <p>
    head, and singing in a slow recitative—
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’ve-got-a-gr’t-family-vault-at-Kingsbere—and
   </p>
   <p>
    knighted-forefathers-in-lead-coffins-there!”
   </p>
   <p>
    The clubbists tittered, except the girl called Tess—in whom a slow heat
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed to rise at the sense that her father was making himself foolish
   </p>
   <p>
    in their eyes.
   </p>
   <p>
    “He’s tired, that’s all,” she said hastily, “and he has got a lift
   </p>
   <p>
    home, because our own horse has to rest to-day.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Bless thy simplicity, Tess,” said her companions. “He’s got his
   </p>
   <p>
    market-nitch. Haw-haw!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Look here; I won’t walk another inch with you, if you say any jokes
   </p>
   <p>
    about him!” Tess cried, and the colour upon her cheeks spread over her
   </p>
   <p>
    face and neck. In a moment her eyes grew moist, and her glance drooped
   </p>
   <p>
    to the ground. Perceiving that they had really pained her they said no
   </p>
   <p>
    more, and order again prevailed. Tess’s pride would not allow her to
   </p>
   <p>
    turn her head again, to learn what her father’s meaning was, if he had
   </p>
   <p>
    any; and thus she moved on with the whole body to the enclosure where
   </p>
   <p>
    there was to be dancing on the green. By the time the spot was reached
   </p>
   <p>
    she had recovered her equanimity, and tapped her neighbour with her
   </p>
   <p>
    wand and talked as usual.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess Durbeyfield at this time of her life was a mere vessel of emotion
   </p>
   <p>
    untinctured by experience. The dialect was on her tongue to some
   </p>
   <p>
    extent, despite the village school: the characteristic intonation of
   </p>
   <p>
    that dialect for this district being the voicing approximately rendered
   </p>
   <p>
    by the syllable UR, probably as rich an utterance as any to be found in
   </p>
   <p>
    human speech. The pouted-up deep red mouth to which this syllable was
   </p>
   <p>
    native had hardly as yet settled into its definite shape, and her lower
   </p>
   <p>
    lip had a way of thrusting the middle of her top one upward, when they
   </p>
   <p>
    closed together after a word.
   </p>
   <p>
    Phases of her childhood lurked in her aspect still. As she walked along
   </p>
   <p>
    to-day, for all her bouncing handsome womanliness, you could sometimes
   </p>
   <p>
    see her twelfth year in her cheeks, or her ninth sparkling from her
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes; and even her fifth would flit over the curves of her mouth now
   </p>
   <p>
    and then.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet few knew, and still fewer considered this. A small minority, mainly
   </p>
   <p>
    strangers, would look long at her in casually passing by, and grow
   </p>
   <p>
    momentarily fascinated by her freshness, and wonder if they would ever
   </p>
   <p>
    see her again: but to almost everybody she was a fine and picturesque
   </p>
   <p>
    country girl, and no more.
   </p>
   <p>
    Nothing was seen or heard further of Durbeyfield in his triumphal
   </p>
   <p>
    chariot under the conduct of the ostleress, and the club having entered
   </p>
   <p>
    the allotted space, dancing began. As there were no men in the company,
   </p>
   <p>
    the girls danced at first with each other, but when the hour for the
   </p>
   <p>
    close of labour drew on, the masculine inhabitants of the village,
   </p>
   <p>
    together with other idlers and pedestrians, gathered round the spot,
   </p>
   <p>
    and appeared inclined to negotiate for a partner.
   </p>
   <p>
    Among these on-lookers were three young men of a superior class,
   </p>
   <p>
    carrying small knapsacks strapped to their shoulders, and stout sticks
   </p>
   <p>
    in their hands. Their general likeness to each other, and their
   </p>
   <p>
    consecutive ages, would almost have suggested that they might be, what
   </p>
   <p>
    in fact they were, brothers. The eldest wore the white tie, high
   </p>
   <p>
    waistcoat, and thin-brimmed hat of the regulation curate; the second
   </p>
   <p>
    was the normal undergraduate; the appearance of the third and youngest
   </p>
   <p>
    would hardly have been sufficient to characterize him; there was an
   </p>
   <p>
    uncribbed, uncabined aspect in his eyes and attire, implying that he
   </p>
   <p>
    had hardly as yet found the entrance to his professional groove. That
   </p>
   <p>
    he was a desultory tentative student of something and everything might
   </p>
   <p>
    only have been predicted of him.
   </p>
   <p>
    These three brethren told casual acquaintance that they were spending
   </p>
   <p>
    their Whitsun holidays in a walking tour through the Vale of Blackmoor,
   </p>
   <p>
    their course being south-westerly from the town of Shaston on the
   </p>
   <p>
    north-east.
   </p>
   <p>
    They leant over the gate by the highway, and inquired as to the meaning
   </p>
   <p>
    of the dance and the white-frocked maids. The two elder of the brothers
   </p>
   <p>
    were plainly not intending to linger more than a moment, but the
   </p>
   <p>
    spectacle of a bevy of girls dancing without male partners seemed to
   </p>
   <p>
    amuse the third, and make him in no hurry to move on. He unstrapped his
   </p>
   <p>
    knapsack, put it, with his stick, on the hedge-bank, and opened the
   </p>
   <p>
    gate.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What are you going to do, Angel?” asked the eldest.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am inclined to go and have a fling with them. Why not all of us—just
   </p>
   <p>
    for a minute or two—it will not detain us long?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No—no; nonsense!” said the first. “Dancing in public with a troop of
   </p>
   <p>
    country hoydens—suppose we should be seen! Come along, or it will be
   </p>
   <p>
    dark before we get to Stourcastle, and there’s no place we can sleep at
   </p>
   <p>
    nearer than that; besides, we must get through another chapter of _A
   </p>
   <p>
    Counterblast to Agnosticism_ before we turn in, now I have taken the
   </p>
   <p>
    trouble to bring the book.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “All right—I’ll overtake you and Cuthbert in five minutes; don’t stop;
   </p>
   <p>
    I give my word that I will, Felix.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The two elder reluctantly left him and walked on, taking their
   </p>
   <p>
    brother’s knapsack to relieve him in following, and the youngest
   </p>
   <p>
    entered the field.
   </p>
   <p>
    “This is a thousand pities,” he said gallantly, to two or three of the
   </p>
   <p>
    girls nearest him, as soon as there was a pause in the dance. “Where
   </p>
   <p>
    are your partners, my dears?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “They’ve not left off work yet,” answered one of the boldest. “They’ll
   </p>
   <p>
    be here by and by. Till then, will you be one, sir?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Certainly. But what’s one among so many!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Better than none. ’Tis melancholy work facing and footing it to one of
   </p>
   <p>
    your own sort, and no clipsing and colling at all. Now, pick and
   </p>
   <p>
    choose.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “’Ssh—don’t be so for’ard!” said a shyer girl.
   </p>
   <p>
    The young man, thus invited, glanced them over, and attempted some
   </p>
   <p>
    discrimination; but, as the group were all so new to him, he could not
   </p>
   <p>
    very well exercise it. He took almost the first that came to hand,
   </p>
   <p>
    which was not the speaker, as she had expected; nor did it happen to be
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess Durbeyfield. Pedigree, ancestral skeletons, monumental record, the
   </p>
   <p>
    d’Urberville lineaments, did not help Tess in her life’s battle as yet,
   </p>
   <p>
    even to the extent of attracting to her a dancing-partner over the
   </p>
   <p>
    heads of the commonest peasantry. So much for Norman blood unaided by
   </p>
   <p>
    Victorian lucre.
   </p>
   <p>
    The name of the eclipsing girl, whatever it was, has not been handed
   </p>
   <p>
    down; but she was envied by all as the first who enjoyed the luxury of
   </p>
   <p>
    a masculine partner that evening. Yet such was the force of example
   </p>
   <p>
    that the village young men, who had not hastened to enter the gate
   </p>
   <p>
    while no intruder was in the way, now dropped in quickly, and soon the
   </p>
   <p>
    couples became leavened with rustic youth to a marked extent, till at
   </p>
   <p>
    length the plainest woman in the club was no longer compelled to foot
   </p>
   <p>
    it on the masculine side of the figure.
   </p>
   <p>
    The church clock struck, when suddenly the student said that he must
   </p>
   <p>
    leave—he had been forgetting himself—he had to join his companions. As
   </p>
   <p>
    he fell out of the dance his eyes lighted on Tess Durbeyfield, whose
   </p>
   <p>
    own large orbs wore, to tell the truth, the faintest aspect of reproach
   </p>
   <p>
    that he had not chosen her. He, too, was sorry then that, owing to her
   </p>
   <p>
    backwardness, he had not observed her; and with that in his mind he
   </p>
   <p>
    left the pasture.
   </p>
   <p>
    On account of his long delay he started in a flying-run down the lane
   </p>
   <p>
    westward, and had soon passed the hollow and mounted the next rise. He
   </p>
   <p>
    had not yet overtaken his brothers, but he paused to get breath, and
   </p>
   <p>
    looked back. He could see the white figures of the girls in the green
   </p>
   <p>
    enclosure whirling about as they had whirled when he was among them.
   </p>
   <p>
    They seemed to have quite forgotten him already.
   </p>
   <p>
    All of them, except, perhaps, one. This white shape stood apart by the
   </p>
   <p>
    hedge alone. From her position he knew it to be the pretty maiden with
   </p>
   <p>
    whom he had not danced. Trifling as the matter was, he yet
   </p>
   <p>
    instinctively felt that she was hurt by his oversight. He wished that
   </p>
   <p>
    he had asked her; he wished that he had inquired her name. She was so
   </p>
   <p>
    modest, so expressive, she had looked so soft in her thin white gown
   </p>
   <p>
    that he felt he had acted stupidly.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, it could not be helped, and turning, and bending himself to a
   </p>
   <p>
    rapid walk, he dismissed the subject from his mind.
   </p>
   <p>
    III
   </p>
   <p>
    As for Tess Durbeyfield, she did not so easily dislodge the incident
   </p>
   <p>
    from her consideration. She had no spirit to dance again for a long
   </p>
   <p>
    time, though she might have had plenty of partners; but ah! they did
   </p>
   <p>
    not speak so nicely as the strange young man had done. It was not till
   </p>
   <p>
    the rays of the sun had absorbed the young stranger’s retreating figure
   </p>
   <p>
    on the hill that she shook off her temporary sadness and answered her
   </p>
   <p>
    would-be partner in the affirmative.
   </p>
   <p>
    She remained with her comrades till dusk, and participated with a
   </p>
   <p>
    certain zest in the dancing; though, being heart-whole as yet, she
   </p>
   <p>
    enjoyed treading a measure purely for its own sake; little divining
   </p>
   <p>
    when she saw “the soft torments, the bitter sweets, the pleasing pains,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the agreeable distresses” of those girls who had been wooed and
   </p>
   <p>
    won, what she herself was capable of in that kind. The struggles and
   </p>
   <p>
    wrangles of the lads for her hand in a jig were an amusement to her—no
   </p>
   <p>
    more; and when they became fierce she rebuked them.
   </p>
   <p>
    She might have stayed even later, but the incident of her father’s odd
   </p>
   <p>
    appearance and manner returned upon the girl’s mind to make her
   </p>
   <p>
    anxious, and wondering what had become of him she dropped away from the
   </p>
   <p>
    dancers and bent her steps towards the end of the village at which the
   </p>
   <p>
    parental cottage lay.
   </p>
   <p>
    While yet many score yards off, other rhythmic sounds than those she
   </p>
   <p>
    had quitted became audible to her; sounds that she knew well—so well.
   </p>
   <p>
    They were a regular series of thumpings from the interior of the house,
   </p>
   <p>
    occasioned by the violent rocking of a cradle upon a stone floor, to
   </p>
   <p>
    which movement a feminine voice kept time by singing, in a vigorous
   </p>
   <p>
    gallopade, the favourite ditty of “The Spotted Cow”—
   </p>
   <p>
    I saw her lie do′-own in yon′-der green gro′-ove;
   </p>
   <p>
    Come, love!′ and I'll tell′ you where!′
   </p>
   <p>
    The cradle-rocking and the song would cease simultaneously for a
   </p>
   <p>
    moment, and an exclamation at highest vocal pitch would take the place
   </p>
   <p>
    of the melody.
   </p>
   <p>
    “God bless thy diment eyes! And thy waxen cheeks! And thy cherry mouth!
   </p>
   <p>
    And thy Cubit’s thighs! And every bit o’ thy blessed body!”
   </p>
   <p>
    After this invocation the rocking and the singing would recommence, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the “Spotted Cow” proceed as before. So matters stood when Tess opened
   </p>
   <p>
    the door and paused upon the mat within it, surveying the scene.
   </p>
   <p>
    The interior, in spite of the melody, struck upon the girl’s senses
   </p>
   <p>
    with an unspeakable dreariness. From the holiday gaieties of the
   </p>
   <p>
    field—the white gowns, the nosegays, the willow-wands, the whirling
   </p>
   <p>
    movements on the green, the flash of gentle sentiment towards the
   </p>
   <p>
    stranger—to the yellow melancholy of this one-candled spectacle, what a
   </p>
   <p>
    step! Besides the jar of contrast there came to her a chill
   </p>
   <p>
    self-reproach that she had not returned sooner, to help her mother in
   </p>
   <p>
    these domesticities, instead of indulging herself out-of-doors.
   </p>
   <p>
    There stood her mother amid the group of children, as Tess had left
   </p>
   <p>
    her, hanging over the Monday washing-tub, which had now, as always,
   </p>
   <p>
    lingered on to the end of the week. Out of that tub had come the day
   </p>
   <p>
    before—Tess felt it with a dreadful sting of remorse—the very white
   </p>
   <p>
    frock upon her back which she had so carelessly greened about the skirt
   </p>
   <p>
    on the damping grass—which had been wrung up and ironed by her mother’s
   </p>
   <p>
    own hands.
   </p>
   <p>
    As usual, Mrs Durbeyfield was balanced on one foot beside the tub, the
   </p>
   <p>
    other being engaged in the aforesaid business of rocking her youngest
   </p>
   <p>
    child. The cradle-rockers had done hard duty for so many years, under
   </p>
   <p>
    the weight of so many children, on that flagstone floor, that they were
   </p>
   <p>
    worn nearly flat, in consequence of which a huge jerk accompanied each
   </p>
   <p>
    swing of the cot, flinging the baby from side to side like a weaver’s
   </p>
   <p>
    shuttle, as Mrs Durbeyfield, excited by her song, trod the rocker with
   </p>
   <p>
    all the spring that was left in her after a long day’s seething in the
   </p>
   <p>
    suds.
   </p>
   <p>
    Nick-knock, nick-knock, went the cradle; the candle-flame stretched
   </p>
   <p>
    itself tall, and began jigging up and down; the water dribbled from the
   </p>
   <p>
    matron’s elbows, and the song galloped on to the end of the verse, Mrs
   </p>
   <p>
    Durbeyfield regarding her daughter the while. Even now, when burdened
   </p>
   <p>
    with a young family, Joan Durbeyfield was a passionate lover of tune.
   </p>
   <p>
    No ditty floated into Blackmoor Vale from the outer world but Tess’s
   </p>
   <p>
    mother caught up its notation in a week.
   </p>
   <p>
    There still faintly beamed from the woman’s features something of the
   </p>
   <p>
    freshness, and even the prettiness, of her youth; rendering it probable
   </p>
   <p>
    that the personal charms which Tess could boast of were in main part
   </p>
   <p>
    her mother’s gift, and therefore unknightly, unhistorical.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’ll rock the cradle for ’ee, mother,” said the daughter gently. “Or
   </p>
   <p>
    I’ll take off my best frock and help you wring up? I thought you had
   </p>
   <p>
    finished long ago.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Her mother bore Tess no ill-will for leaving the housework to her
   </p>
   <p>
    single-handed efforts for so long; indeed, Joan seldom upbraided her
   </p>
   <p>
    thereon at any time, feeling but slightly the lack of Tess’s assistance
   </p>
   <p>
    whilst her instinctive plan for relieving herself of her labours lay in
   </p>
   <p>
    postponing them. To-night, however, she was even in a blither mood than
   </p>
   <p>
    usual. There was a dreaminess, a pre-occupation, an exaltation, in the
   </p>
   <p>
    maternal look which the girl could not understand.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, I’m glad you’ve come,” her mother said, as soon as the last note
   </p>
   <p>
    had passed out of her. “I want to go and fetch your father; but what’s
   </p>
   <p>
    more’n that, I want to tell ’ee what have happened. Y’ll be fess
   </p>
   <p>
    enough, my poppet, when th’st know!” (Mrs Durbeyfield habitually spoke
   </p>
   <p>
    the dialect; her daughter, who had passed the Sixth Standard in the
   </p>
   <p>
    National School under a London-trained mistress, spoke two languages:
   </p>
   <p>
    the dialect at home, more or less; ordinary English abroad and to
   </p>
   <p>
    persons of quality.)
   </p>
   <p>
    “Since I’ve been away?” Tess asked.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ay!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Had it anything to do with father’s making such a mommet of himself in
   </p>
   <p>
    thik carriage this afternoon? Why did ’er? I felt inclined to sink into
   </p>
   <p>
    the ground with shame!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “That wer all a part of the larry! We’ve been found to be the greatest
   </p>
   <p>
    gentlefolk in the whole county—reaching all back long before Oliver
   </p>
   <p>
    Grumble’s time—to the days of the Pagan Turks—with monuments, and
   </p>
   <p>
    vaults, and crests, and ’scutcheons, and the Lord knows what all. In
   </p>
   <p>
    Saint Charles’s days we was made Knights o’ the Royal Oak, our real
   </p>
   <p>
    name being d’Urberville!... Don’t that make your bosom plim? ’Twas on
   </p>
   <p>
    this account that your father rode home in the vlee; not because he’d
   </p>
   <p>
    been drinking, as people supposed.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’m glad of that. Will it do us any good, mother?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O yes! ’Tis thoughted that great things may come o’t. No doubt a
   </p>
   <p>
    mampus of volk of our own rank will be down here in their carriages as
   </p>
   <p>
    soon as ’tis known. Your father learnt it on his way hwome from
   </p>
   <p>
    Shaston, and he has been telling me the whole pedigree of the matter.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Where is father now?” asked Tess suddenly.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her mother gave irrelevant information by way of answer: “He called to
   </p>
   <p>
    see the doctor to-day in Shaston. It is not consumption at all, it
   </p>
   <p>
    seems. It is fat round his heart, ’a says. There, it is like this.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Joan Durbeyfield, as she spoke, curved a sodden thumb and forefinger to
   </p>
   <p>
    the shape of the letter C, and used the other forefinger as a pointer.
   </p>
   <p>
    “‘At the present moment,’ he says to your father, ‘your heart is
   </p>
   <p>
    enclosed all round there, and all round there; this space is still
   </p>
   <p>
    open,’ ’a says. ‘As soon as it do meet, so,’”—Mrs Durbeyfield closed
   </p>
   <p>
    her fingers into a circle complete—“‘off you will go like a shadder, Mr
   </p>
   <p>
    Durbeyfield,’ ’a says. ‘You mid last ten years; you mid go off in ten
   </p>
   <p>
    months, or ten days.’”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess looked alarmed. Her father possibly to go behind the eternal cloud
   </p>
   <p>
    so soon, notwithstanding this sudden greatness!
   </p>
   <p>
    “But where _is_ father?” she asked again.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her mother put on a deprecating look. “Now don’t you be bursting out
   </p>
   <p>
    angry! The poor man—he felt so rafted after his uplifting by the
   </p>
   <p>
    pa’son’s news—that he went up to Rolliver’s half an hour ago. He do
   </p>
   <p>
    want to get up his strength for his journey to-morrow with that load of
   </p>
   <p>
    beehives, which must be delivered, family or no. He’ll have to start
   </p>
   <p>
    shortly after twelve to-night, as the distance is so long.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Get up his strength!” said Tess impetuously, the tears welling to her
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes. “O my God! Go to a public-house to get up his strength! And you
   </p>
   <p>
    as well agreed as he, mother!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Her rebuke and her mood seemed to fill the whole room, and to impart a
   </p>
   <p>
    cowed look to the furniture, and candle, and children playing about,
   </p>
   <p>
    and to her mother’s face.
   </p>
   <p>
    “No,” said the latter touchily, “I be not agreed. I have been waiting
   </p>
   <p>
    for ’ee to bide and keep house while I go fetch him.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’ll go.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O no, Tess. You see, it would be no use.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess did not expostulate. She knew what her mother’s objection meant.
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs Durbeyfield’s jacket and bonnet were already hanging slily upon a
   </p>
   <p>
    chair by her side, in readiness for this contemplated jaunt, the reason
   </p>
   <p>
    for which the matron deplored more than its necessity.
   </p>
   <p>
    “And take the _Compleat Fortune-Teller_ to the outhouse,” Joan
   </p>
   <p>
    continued, rapidly wiping her hands, and donning the garments.
   </p>
   <p>
    The _Compleat Fortune-Teller_ was an old thick volume, which lay on a
   </p>
   <p>
    table at her elbow, so worn by pocketing that the margins had reached
   </p>
   <p>
    the edge of the type. Tess took it up, and her mother started.
   </p>
   <p>
    This going to hunt up her shiftless husband at the inn was one of Mrs
   </p>
   <p>
    Durbeyfield’s still extant enjoyments in the muck and muddle of rearing
   </p>
   <p>
    children. To discover him at Rolliver’s, to sit there for an hour or
   </p>
   <p>
    two by his side and dismiss all thought and care of the children during
   </p>
   <p>
    the interval, made her happy. A sort of halo, an occidental glow, came
   </p>
   <p>
    over life then. Troubles and other realities took on themselves a
   </p>
   <p>
    metaphysical impalpability, sinking to mere mental phenomena for serene
   </p>
   <p>
    contemplation, and no longer stood as pressing concretions which chafed
   </p>
   <p>
    body and soul. The youngsters, not immediately within sight, seemed
   </p>
   <p>
    rather bright and desirable appurtenances than otherwise; the incidents
   </p>
   <p>
    of daily life were not without humorousness and jollity in their aspect
   </p>
   <p>
    there. She felt a little as she had used to feel when she sat by her
   </p>
   <p>
    now wedded husband in the same spot during his wooing, shutting her
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes to his defects of character, and regarding him only in his ideal
   </p>
   <p>
    presentation as lover.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess, being left alone with the younger children, went first to the
   </p>
   <p>
    outhouse with the fortune-telling book, and stuffed it into the thatch.
   </p>
   <p>
    A curious fetishistic fear of this grimy volume on the part of her
   </p>
   <p>
    mother prevented her ever allowing it to stay in the house all night,
   </p>
   <p>
    and hither it was brought back whenever it had been consulted. Between
   </p>
   <p>
    the mother, with her fast-perishing lumber of superstitions, folk-lore,
   </p>
   <p>
    dialect, and orally transmitted ballads, and the daughter, with her
   </p>
   <p>
    trained National teachings and Standard knowledge under an infinitely
   </p>
   <p>
    Revised Code, there was a gap of two hundred years as ordinarily
   </p>
   <p>
    understood. When they were together the Jacobean and the Victorian ages
   </p>
   <p>
    were juxtaposed.
   </p>
   <p>
    Returning along the garden path Tess mused on what the mother could
   </p>
   <p>
    have wished to ascertain from the book on this particular day. She
   </p>
   <p>
    guessed the recent ancestral discovery to bear upon it, but did not
   </p>
   <p>
    divine that it solely concerned herself. Dismissing this, however, she
   </p>
   <p>
    busied herself with sprinkling the linen dried during the day-time, in
   </p>
   <p>
    company with her nine-year-old brother Abraham, and her sister
   </p>
   <p>
    Eliza-Louisa of twelve and a half, called “’Liza-Lu,” the youngest ones
   </p>
   <p>
    being put to bed. There was an interval of four years and more between
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess and the next of the family, the two who had filled the gap having
   </p>
   <p>
    died in their infancy, and this lent her a deputy-maternal attitude
   </p>
   <p>
    when she was alone with her juniors. Next in juvenility to Abraham came
   </p>
   <p>
    two more girls, Hope and Modesty; then a boy of three, and then the
   </p>
   <p>
    baby, who had just completed his first year.
   </p>
   <p>
    All these young souls were passengers in the Durbeyfield ship—entirely
   </p>
   <p>
    dependent on the judgement of the two Durbeyfield adults for their
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasures, their necessities, their health, even their existence. If
   </p>
   <p>
    the heads of the Durbeyfield household chose to sail into difficulty,
   </p>
   <p>
    disaster, starvation, disease, degradation, death, thither were these
   </p>
   <p>
    half-dozen little captives under hatches compelled to sail with
   </p>
   <p>
    them—six helpless creatures, who had never been asked if they wished
   </p>
   <p>
    for life on any terms, much less if they wished for it on such hard
   </p>
   <p>
    conditions as were involved in being of the shiftless house of
   </p>
   <p>
    Durbeyfield. Some people would like to know whence the poet whose
   </p>
   <p>
    philosophy is in these days deemed as profound and trustworthy as his
   </p>
   <p>
    song is breezy and pure, gets his authority for speaking of “Nature’s
   </p>
   <p>
    holy plan.”
   </p>
   <p>
    It grew later, and neither father nor mother reappeared. Tess looked
   </p>
   <p>
    out of the door, and took a mental journey through Marlott. The village
   </p>
   <p>
    was shutting its eyes. Candles and lamps were being put out everywhere:
   </p>
   <p>
    she could inwardly behold the extinguisher and the extended hand.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her mother’s fetching simply meant one more to fetch. Tess began to
   </p>
   <p>
    perceive that a man in indifferent health, who proposed to start on a
   </p>
   <p>
    journey before one in the morning, ought not to be at an inn at this
   </p>
   <p>
    late hour celebrating his ancient blood.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Abraham,” she said to her little brother, “do you put on your hat—you
   </p>
   <p>
    bain’t afraid?—and go up to Rolliver’s, and see what has gone wi’
   </p>
   <p>
    father and mother.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The boy jumped promptly from his seat, and opened the door, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    night swallowed him up. Half an hour passed yet again; neither man,
   </p>
   <p>
    woman, nor child returned. Abraham, like his parents, seemed to have
   </p>
   <p>
    been limed and caught by the ensnaring inn.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I must go myself,” she said.
   </p>
   <p>
    ’Liza-Lu then went to bed, and Tess, locking them all in, started on
   </p>
   <p>
    her way up the dark and crooked lane or street not made for hasty
   </p>
   <p>
    progress; a street laid out before inches of land had value, and when
   </p>
   <p>
    one-handed clocks sufficiently subdivided the day.
   </p>
   <p>
    IV
   </p>
   <p>
    Rolliver’s inn, the single alehouse at this end of the long and broken
   </p>
   <p>
    village, could only boast of an off-licence; hence, as nobody could
   </p>
   <p>
    legally drink on the premises, the amount of overt accommodation for
   </p>
   <p>
    consumers was strictly limited to a little board about six inches wide
   </p>
   <p>
    and two yards long, fixed to the garden palings by pieces of wire, so
   </p>
   <p>
    as to form a ledge. On this board thirsty strangers deposited their
   </p>
   <p>
    cups as they stood in the road and drank, and threw the dregs on the
   </p>
   <p>
    dusty ground to the pattern of Polynesia, and wished they could have a
   </p>
   <p>
    restful seat inside.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus the strangers. But there were also local customers who felt the
   </p>
   <p>
    same wish; and where there’s a will there’s a way.
   </p>
   <p>
    In a large bedroom upstairs, the window of which was thickly curtained
   </p>
   <p>
    with a great woollen shawl lately discarded by the landlady, Mrs
   </p>
   <p>
    Rolliver, were gathered on this evening nearly a dozen persons, all
   </p>
   <p>
    seeking beatitude; all old inhabitants of the nearer end of Marlott,
   </p>
   <p>
    and frequenters of this retreat. Not only did the distance to the The
   </p>
   <p>
    Pure Drop, the fully-licensed tavern at the further part of the
   </p>
   <p>
    dispersed village, render its accommodation practically unavailable for
   </p>
   <p>
    dwellers at this end; but the far more serious question, the quality of
   </p>
   <p>
    the liquor, confirmed the prevalent opinion that it was better to drink
   </p>
   <p>
    with Rolliver in a corner of the housetop than with the other landlord
   </p>
   <p>
    in a wide house.
   </p>
   <p>
    A gaunt four-post bedstead which stood in the room afforded
   </p>
   <p>
    sitting-space for several persons gathered round three of its sides; a
   </p>
   <p>
    couple more men had elevated themselves on a chest of drawers; another
   </p>
   <p>
    rested on the oak-carved “cwoffer”; two on the wash-stand; another on
   </p>
   <p>
    the stool; and thus all were, somehow, seated at their ease. The stage
   </p>
   <p>
    of mental comfort to which they had arrived at this hour was one
   </p>
   <p>
    wherein their souls expanded beyond their skins, and spread their
   </p>
   <p>
    personalities warmly through the room. In this process the chamber and
   </p>
   <p>
    its furniture grew more and more dignified and luxurious; the shawl
   </p>
   <p>
    hanging at the window took upon itself the richness of tapestry; the
   </p>
   <p>
    brass handles of the chest of drawers were as golden knockers; and the
   </p>
   <p>
    carved bedposts seemed to have some kinship with the magnificent
   </p>
   <p>
    pillars of Solomon’s temple.
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs Durbeyfield, having quickly walked hitherward after parting from
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess, opened the front door, crossed the downstairs room, which was in
   </p>
   <p>
    deep gloom, and then unfastened the stair-door like one whose fingers
   </p>
   <p>
    knew the tricks of the latches well. Her ascent of the crooked
   </p>
   <p>
    staircase was a slower process, and her face, as it rose into the light
   </p>
   <p>
    above the last stair, encountered the gaze of all the party assembled
   </p>
   <p>
    in the bedroom.
   </p>
   <p>
    “—Being a few private friends I’ve asked in to keep up club-walking at
   </p>
   <p>
    my own expense,” the landlady exclaimed at the sound of footsteps, as
   </p>
   <p>
    glibly as a child repeating the Catechism, while she peered over the
   </p>
   <p>
    stairs. “Oh, ’tis you, Mrs Durbeyfield—Lard—how you frightened me!—I
   </p>
   <p>
    thought it might be some gaffer sent by Gover’ment.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs Durbeyfield was welcomed with glances and nods by the remainder of
   </p>
   <p>
    the conclave, and turned to where her husband sat. He was humming
   </p>
   <p>
    absently to himself, in a low tone: “I be as good as some folks here
   </p>
   <p>
    and there! I’ve got a great family vault at Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill,
   </p>
   <p>
    and finer skillentons than any man in Wessex!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’ve something to tell ’ee that’s come into my head about that—a grand
   </p>
   <p>
    projick!” whispered his cheerful wife. “Here, John, don’t ’ee see me?”
   </p>
   <p>
    She nudged him, while he, looking through her as through a window-pane,
   </p>
   <p>
    went on with his recitative.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Hush! Don’t ’ee sing so loud, my good man,” said the landlady; “in
   </p>
   <p>
    case any member of the Gover’ment should be passing, and take away my
   </p>
   <p>
    licends.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “He’s told ’ee what’s happened to us, I suppose?” asked Mrs
   </p>
   <p>
    Durbeyfield.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes—in a way. D’ye think there’s any money hanging by it?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah, that’s the secret,” said Joan Durbeyfield sagely. “However, ’tis
   </p>
   <p>
    well to be kin to a coach, even if you don’t ride in ’en.” She dropped
   </p>
   <p>
    her public voice, and continued in a low tone to her husband: “I’ve
   </p>
   <p>
    been thinking since you brought the news that there’s a great rich lady
   </p>
   <p>
    out by Trantridge, on the edge o’ The Chase, of the name of
   </p>
   <p>
    d’Urberville.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Hey—what’s that?” said Sir John.
   </p>
   <p>
    She repeated the information. “That lady must be our relation,” she
   </p>
   <p>
    said. “And my projick is to send Tess to claim kin.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “There _is_ a lady of the name, now you mention it,” said Durbeyfield.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Pa’son Tringham didn’t think of that. But she’s nothing beside we—a
   </p>
   <p>
    junior branch of us, no doubt, hailing long since King Norman’s day.”
   </p>
   <p>
    While this question was being discussed neither of the pair noticed, in
   </p>
   <p>
    their preoccupation, that little Abraham had crept into the room, and
   </p>
   <p>
    was awaiting an opportunity of asking them to return.
   </p>
   <p>
    “She is rich, and she’d be sure to take notice o’ the maid,” continued
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs Durbeyfield; “and ’twill be a very good thing. I don’t see why two
   </p>
   <p>
    branches o’ one family should not be on visiting terms.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes; and we’ll all claim kin!” said Abraham brightly from under the
   </p>
   <p>
    bedstead. “And we’ll all go and see her when Tess has gone to live with
   </p>
   <p>
    her; and we’ll ride in her coach and wear black clothes!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “How do you come here, child? What nonsense be ye talking! Go away, and
   </p>
   <p>
    play on the stairs till father and mother be ready!... Well, Tess ought
   </p>
   <p>
    to go to this other member of our family. She’d be sure to win the
   </p>
   <p>
    lady—Tess would; and likely enough ’twould lead to some noble gentleman
   </p>
   <p>
    marrying her. In short, I know it.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “How?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I tried her fate in the _Fortune-Teller_, and it brought out that very
   </p>
   <p>
    thing!... You should ha’ seen how pretty she looked to-day; her skin is
   </p>
   <p>
    as sumple as a duchess’.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “What says the maid herself to going?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’ve not asked her. She don’t know there is any such lady-relation
   </p>
   <p>
    yet. But it would certainly put her in the way of a grand marriage, and
   </p>
   <p>
    she won’t say nay to going.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tess is queer.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But she’s tractable at bottom. Leave her to me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Though this conversation had been private, sufficient of its import
   </p>
   <p>
    reached the understandings of those around to suggest to them that the
   </p>
   <p>
    Durbeyfields had weightier concerns to talk of now than common folks
   </p>
   <p>
    had, and that Tess, their pretty eldest daughter, had fine prospects in
   </p>
   <p>
    store.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tess is a fine figure o’ fun, as I said to myself to-day when I zeed
   </p>
   <p>
    her vamping round parish with the rest,” observed one of the elderly
   </p>
   <p>
    boozers in an undertone. “But Joan Durbeyfield must mind that she don’t
   </p>
   <p>
    get green malt in floor.” It was a local phrase which had a peculiar
   </p>
   <p>
    meaning, and there was no reply.
   </p>
   <p>
    The conversation became inclusive, and presently other footsteps were
   </p>
   <p>
    heard crossing the room below.
   </p>
   <p>
    “—Being a few private friends asked in to-night to keep up club-walking
   </p>
   <p>
    at my own expense.” The landlady had rapidly re-used the formula she
   </p>
   <p>
    kept on hand for intruders before she recognized that the newcomer was
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    Even to her mother’s gaze the girl’s young features looked sadly out of
   </p>
   <p>
    place amid the alcoholic vapours which floated here as no unsuitable
   </p>
   <p>
    medium for wrinkled middle-age; and hardly was a reproachful flash from
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess’s dark eyes needed to make her father and mother rise from their
   </p>
   <p>
    seats, hastily finish their ale, and descend the stairs behind her, Mrs
   </p>
   <p>
    Rolliver’s caution following their footsteps.
   </p>
   <p>
    “No noise, please, if ye’ll be so good, my dears; or I mid lose my
   </p>
   <p>
    licends, and be summons’d, and I don’t know what all! ’Night t’ye!”
   </p>
   <p>
    They went home together, Tess holding one arm of her father, and Mrs
   </p>
   <p>
    Durbeyfield the other. He had, in truth, drunk very little—not a fourth
   </p>
   <p>
    of the quantity which a systematic tippler could carry to church on a
   </p>
   <p>
    Sunday afternoon without a hitch in his eastings or genuflections; but
   </p>
   <p>
    the weakness of Sir John’s constitution made mountains of his petty
   </p>
   <p>
    sins in this kind. On reaching the fresh air he was sufficiently
   </p>
   <p>
    unsteady to incline the row of three at one moment as if they were
   </p>
   <p>
    marching to London, and at another as if they were marching to
   </p>
   <p>
    Bath—which produced a comical effect, frequent enough in families on
   </p>
   <p>
    nocturnal homegoings; and, like most comical effects, not quite so
   </p>
   <p>
    comic after all. The two women valiantly disguised these forced
   </p>
   <p>
    excursions and countermarches as well as they could from Durbeyfield,
   </p>
   <p>
    their cause, and from Abraham, and from themselves; and so they
   </p>
   <p>
    approached by degrees their own door, the head of the family bursting
   </p>
   <p>
    suddenly into his former refrain as he drew near, as if to fortify his
   </p>
   <p>
    soul at sight of the smallness of his present residence—
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’ve got a fam—ily vault at Kingsbere!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Hush—don’t be so silly, Jacky,” said his wife. “Yours is not the only
   </p>
   <p>
    family that was of ’count in wold days. Look at the Anktells, and
   </p>
   <p>
    Horseys, and the Tringhams themselves—gone to seed a’most as much as
   </p>
   <p>
    you—though you was bigger folks than they, that’s true. Thank God, I
   </p>
   <p>
    was never of no family, and have nothing to be ashamed of in that way!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Don’t you be so sure o’ that. From your nater ’tis my belief you’ve
   </p>
   <p>
    disgraced yourselves more than any o’ us, and was kings and queens
   </p>
   <p>
    outright at one time.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess turned the subject by saying what was far more prominent in her
   </p>
   <p>
    own mind at the moment than thoughts of her ancestry—“I am afraid
   </p>
   <p>
    father won’t be able to take the journey with the beehives to-morrow so
   </p>
   <p>
    early.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I? I shall be all right in an hour or two,” said Durbeyfield.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was eleven o’clock before the family were all in bed, and two
   </p>
   <p>
    o’clock next morning was the latest hour for starting with the beehives
   </p>
   <p>
    if they were to be delivered to the retailers in Casterbridge before
   </p>
   <p>
    the Saturday market began, the way thither lying by bad roads over a
   </p>
   <p>
    distance of between twenty and thirty miles, and the horse and waggon
   </p>
   <p>
    being of the slowest. At half-past one Mrs Durbeyfield came into the
   </p>
   <p>
    large bedroom where Tess and all her little brothers and sisters slept.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The poor man can’t go,” she said to her eldest daughter, whose great
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes had opened the moment her mother’s hand touched the door.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess sat up in bed, lost in a vague interspace between a dream and this
   </p>
   <p>
    information.
   </p>
   <p>
    “But somebody must go,” she replied. “It is late for the hives already.
   </p>
   <p>
    Swarming will soon be over for the year; and it we put off taking ’em
   </p>
   <p>
    till next week’s market the call for ’em will be past, and they’ll be
   </p>
   <p>
    thrown on our hands.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs Durbeyfield looked unequal to the emergency. “Some young feller,
   </p>
   <p>
    perhaps, would go? One of them who were so much after dancing with ’ee
   </p>
   <p>
    yesterday,” she presently suggested.
   </p>
   <p>
    “O no—I wouldn’t have it for the world!” declared Tess proudly. “And
   </p>
   <p>
    letting everybody know the reason—such a thing to be ashamed of! I
   </p>
   <p>
    think _I_ could go if Abraham could go with me to kip me company.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Her mother at length agreed to this arrangement. Little Abraham was
   </p>
   <p>
    aroused from his deep sleep in a corner of the same apartment, and made
   </p>
   <p>
    to put on his clothes while still mentally in the other world.
   </p>
   <p>
    Meanwhile Tess had hastily dressed herself; and the twain, lighting a
   </p>
   <p>
    lantern, went out to the stable. The rickety little waggon was already
   </p>
   <p>
    laden, and the girl led out the horse, Prince, only a degree less
   </p>
   <p>
    rickety than the vehicle.
   </p>
   <p>
    The poor creature looked wonderingly round at the night, at the
   </p>
   <p>
    lantern, at their two figures, as if he could not believe that at that
   </p>
   <p>
    hour, when every living thing was intended to be in shelter and at
   </p>
   <p>
    rest, he was called upon to go out and labour. They put a stock of
   </p>
   <p>
    candle-ends into the lantern, hung the latter to the off-side of the
   </p>
   <p>
    load, and directed the horse onward, walking at his shoulder at first
   </p>
   <p>
    during the uphill parts of the way, in order not to overload an animal
   </p>
   <p>
    of so little vigour. To cheer themselves as well as they could, they
   </p>
   <p>
    made an artificial morning with the lantern, some bread and butter, and
   </p>
   <p>
    their own conversation, the real morning being far from come. Abraham,
   </p>
   <p>
    as he more fully awoke (for he had moved in a sort of trance so far),
   </p>
   <p>
    began to talk of the strange shapes assumed by the various dark objects
   </p>
   <p>
    against the sky; of this tree that looked like a raging tiger springing
   </p>
   <p>
    from a lair; of that which resembled a giant’s head.
   </p>
   <p>
    When they had passed the little town of Stourcastle, dumbly somnolent
   </p>
   <p>
    under its thick brown thatch, they reached higher ground. Still higher,
   </p>
   <p>
    on their left, the elevation called Bulbarrow, or Bealbarrow, well-nigh
   </p>
   <p>
    the highest in South Wessex, swelled into the sky, engirdled by its
   </p>
   <p>
    earthen trenches. From hereabout the long road was fairly level for
   </p>
   <p>
    some distance onward. They mounted in front of the waggon, and Abraham
   </p>
   <p>
    grew reflective.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tess!” he said in a preparatory tone, after a silence.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, Abraham.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Bain’t you glad that we’ve become gentlefolk?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Not particular glad.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But you be glad that you ’m going to marry a gentleman?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “What?” said Tess, lifting her face.
   </p>
   <p>
    “That our great relation will help ’ee to marry a gentleman.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I? Our great relation? We have no such relation. What has put that
   </p>
   <p>
    into your head?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I heard ’em talking about it up at Rolliver’s when I went to find
   </p>
   <p>
    father. There’s a rich lady of our family out at Trantridge, and mother
   </p>
   <p>
    said that if you claimed kin with the lady, she’d put ’ee in the way of
   </p>
   <p>
    marrying a gentleman.”
   </p>
   <p>
    His sister became abruptly still, and lapsed into a pondering silence.
   </p>
   <p>
    Abraham talked on, rather for the pleasure of utterance than for
   </p>
   <p>
    audition, so that his sister’s abstraction was of no account. He leant
   </p>
   <p>
    back against the hives, and with upturned face made observations on the
   </p>
   <p>
    stars, whose cold pulses were beating amid the black hollows above, in
   </p>
   <p>
    serene dissociation from these two wisps of human life. He asked how
   </p>
   <p>
    far away those twinklers were, and whether God was on the other side of
   </p>
   <p>
    them. But ever and anon his childish prattle recurred to what impressed
   </p>
   <p>
    his imagination even more deeply than the wonders of creation. If Tess
   </p>
   <p>
    were made rich by marrying a gentleman, would she have money enough to
   </p>
   <p>
    buy a spyglass so large that it would draw the stars as near to her as
   </p>
   <p>
    Nettlecombe-Tout?
   </p>
   <p>
    The renewed subject, which seemed to have impregnated the whole family,
   </p>
   <p>
    filled Tess with impatience.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Never mind that now!” she exclaimed.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Did you say the stars were worlds, Tess?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “All like ours?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t know; but I think so. They sometimes seem to be like the
   </p>
   <p>
    apples on our stubbard-tree. Most of them splendid and sound—a few
   </p>
   <p>
    blighted.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Which do we live on—a splendid one or a blighted one?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “A blighted one.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “’Tis very unlucky that we didn’t pitch on a sound one, when there were
   </p>
   <p>
    so many more of ’em!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Is it like that _really_, Tess?” said Abraham, turning to her much
   </p>
   <p>
    impressed, on reconsideration of this rare information. “How would it
   </p>
   <p>
    have been if we had pitched on a sound one?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, father wouldn’t have coughed and creeped about as he does, and
   </p>
   <p>
    wouldn’t have got too tipsy to go on this journey; and mother wouldn’t
   </p>
   <p>
    have been always washing, and never getting finished.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And you would have been a rich lady ready-made, and not have had to be
   </p>
   <p>
    made rich by marrying a gentleman?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O Aby, don’t—don’t talk of that any more!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Left to his reflections Abraham soon grew drowsy. Tess was not skilful
   </p>
   <p>
    in the management of a horse, but she thought that she could take upon
   </p>
   <p>
    herself the entire conduct of the load for the present and allow
   </p>
   <p>
    Abraham to go to sleep if he wished to do so. She made him a sort of
   </p>
   <p>
    nest in front of the hives, in such a manner that he could not fall,
   </p>
   <p>
    and, taking the reins into her own hands, jogged on as before.
   </p>
   <p>
    Prince required but slight attention, lacking energy for superfluous
   </p>
   <p>
    movements of any sort. With no longer a companion to distract her, Tess
   </p>
   <p>
    fell more deeply into reverie than ever, her back leaning against the
   </p>
   <p>
    hives. The mute procession past her shoulders of trees and hedges
   </p>
   <p>
    became attached to fantastic scenes outside reality, and the occasional
   </p>
   <p>
    heave of the wind became the sigh of some immense sad soul,
   </p>
   <p>
    conterminous with the universe in space, and with history in time.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then, examining the mesh of events in her own life, she seemed to see
   </p>
   <p>
    the vanity of her father’s pride; the gentlemanly suitor awaiting
   </p>
   <p>
    herself in her mother’s fancy; to see him as a grimacing personage,
   </p>
   <p>
    laughing at her poverty and her shrouded knightly ancestry. Everything
   </p>
   <p>
    grew more and more extravagant, and she no longer knew how time passed.
   </p>
   <p>
    A sudden jerk shook her in her seat, and Tess awoke from the sleep into
   </p>
   <p>
    which she, too, had fallen.
   </p>
   <p>
    They were a long way further on than when she had lost consciousness,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the waggon had stopped. A hollow groan, unlike anything she had
   </p>
   <p>
    ever heard in her life, came from the front, followed by a shout of
   </p>
   <p>
    “Hoi there!”
   </p>
   <p>
    The lantern hanging at her waggon had gone out, but another was shining
   </p>
   <p>
    in her face—much brighter than her own had been. Something terrible had
   </p>
   <p>
    happened. The harness was entangled with an object which blocked the
   </p>
   <p>
    way.
   </p>
   <p>
    In consternation Tess jumped down, and discovered the dreadful truth.
   </p>
   <p>
    The groan had proceeded from her father’s poor horse Prince. The
   </p>
   <p>
    morning mail-cart, with its two noiseless wheels, speeding along these
   </p>
   <p>
    lanes like an arrow, as it always did, had driven into her slow and
   </p>
   <p>
    unlighted equipage. The pointed shaft of the cart had entered the
   </p>
   <p>
    breast of the unhappy Prince like a sword, and from the wound his
   </p>
   <p>
    life’s blood was spouting in a stream, and falling with a hiss into the
   </p>
   <p>
    road.
   </p>
   <p>
    In her despair Tess sprang forward and put her hand upon the hole, with
   </p>
   <p>
    the only result that she became splashed from face to skirt with the
   </p>
   <p>
    crimson drops. Then she stood helplessly looking on. Prince also stood
   </p>
   <p>
    firm and motionless as long as he could; till he suddenly sank down in
   </p>
   <p>
    a heap.
   </p>
   <p>
    By this time the mail-cart man had joined her, and began dragging and
   </p>
   <p>
    unharnessing the hot form of Prince. But he was already dead, and,
   </p>
   <p>
    seeing that nothing more could be done immediately, the mail-cart man
   </p>
   <p>
    returned to his own animal, which was uninjured.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You was on the wrong side,” he said. “I am bound to go on with the
   </p>
   <p>
    mail-bags, so that the best thing for you to do is bide here with your
   </p>
   <p>
    load. I’ll send somebody to help you as soon as I can. It is getting
   </p>
   <p>
    daylight, and you have nothing to fear.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He mounted and sped on his way; while Tess stood and waited. The
   </p>
   <p>
    atmosphere turned pale, the birds shook themselves in the hedges,
   </p>
   <p>
    arose, and twittered; the lane showed all its white features, and Tess
   </p>
   <p>
    showed hers, still whiter. The huge pool of blood in front of her was
   </p>
   <p>
    already assuming the iridescence of coagulation; and when the sun rose
   </p>
   <p>
    a hundred prismatic hues were reflected from it. Prince lay alongside,
   </p>
   <p>
    still and stark; his eyes half open, the hole in his chest looking
   </p>
   <p>
    scarcely large enough to have let out all that had animated him.
   </p>
   <p>
    “’Tis all my doing—all mine!” the girl cried, gazing at the spectacle.
   </p>
   <p>
    “No excuse for me—none. What will mother and father live on now? Aby,
   </p>
   <p>
    Aby!” She shook the child, who had slept soundly through the whole
   </p>
   <p>
    disaster. “We can’t go on with our load—Prince is killed!”
   </p>
   <p>
    When Abraham realized all, the furrows of fifty years were extemporized
   </p>
   <p>
    on his young face.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why, I danced and laughed only yesterday!” she went on to herself. “To
   </p>
   <p>
    think that I was such a fool!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “’Tis because we be on a blighted star, and not a sound one, isn’t it,
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess?” murmured Abraham through his tears.
   </p>
   <p>
    In silence they waited through an interval which seemed endless. At
   </p>
   <p>
    length a sound, and an approaching object, proved to them that the
   </p>
   <p>
    driver of the mail-car had been as good as his word. A farmer’s man
   </p>
   <p>
    from near Stourcastle came up, leading a strong cob. He was harnessed
   </p>
   <p>
    to the waggon of beehives in the place of Prince, and the load taken on
   </p>
   <p>
    towards Casterbridge.
   </p>
   <p>
    The evening of the same day saw the empty waggon reach again the spot
   </p>
   <p>
    of the accident. Prince had lain there in the ditch since the morning;
   </p>
   <p>
    but the place of the blood-pool was still visible in the middle of the
   </p>
   <p>
    road, though scratched and scraped over by passing vehicles. All that
   </p>
   <p>
    was left of Prince was now hoisted into the waggon he had formerly
   </p>
   <p>
    hauled, and with his hoofs in the air, and his shoes shining in the
   </p>
   <p>
    setting sunlight, he retraced the eight or nine miles to Marlott.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess had gone back earlier. How to break the news was more than she
   </p>
   <p>
    could think. It was a relief to her tongue to find from the faces of
   </p>
   <p>
    her parents that they already knew of their loss, though this did not
   </p>
   <p>
    lessen the self-reproach which she continued to heap upon herself for
   </p>
   <p>
    her negligence.
   </p>
   <p>
    But the very shiftlessness of the household rendered the misfortune a
   </p>
   <p>
    less terrifying one to them than it would have been to a thriving
   </p>
   <p>
    family, though in the present case it meant ruin, and in the other it
   </p>
   <p>
    would only have meant inconvenience. In the Durbeyfield countenances
   </p>
   <p>
    there was nothing of the red wrath that would have burnt upon the girl
   </p>
   <p>
    from parents more ambitious for her welfare. Nobody blamed Tess as she
   </p>
   <p>
    blamed herself.
   </p>
   <p>
    When it was discovered that the knacker and tanner would give only a
   </p>
   <p>
    very few shillings for Prince’s carcase because of his decrepitude,
   </p>
   <p>
    Durbeyfield rose to the occasion.
   </p>
   <p>
    “No,” said he stoically, “I won’t sell his old body. When we
   </p>
   <p>
    d’Urbervilles was knights in the land, we didn’t sell our chargers for
   </p>
   <p>
    cat’s meat. Let ’em keep their shillings! He’ve served me well in his
   </p>
   <p>
    lifetime, and I won’t part from him now.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He worked harder the next day in digging a grave for Prince in the
   </p>
   <p>
    garden than he had worked for months to grow a crop for his family.
   </p>
   <p>
    When the hole was ready, Durbeyfield and his wife tied a rope round the
   </p>
   <p>
    horse and dragged him up the path towards it, the children following in
   </p>
   <p>
    funeral train. Abraham and ’Liza-Lu sobbed, Hope and Modesty discharged
   </p>
   <p>
    their griefs in loud blares which echoed from the walls; and when
   </p>
   <p>
    Prince was tumbled in they gathered round the grave. The bread-winner
   </p>
   <p>
    had been taken away from them; what would they do?
   </p>
   <p>
    “Is he gone to heaven?” asked Abraham, between the sobs.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then Durbeyfield began to shovel in the earth, and the children cried
   </p>
   <p>
    anew. All except Tess. Her face was dry and pale, as though she
   </p>
   <p>
    regarded herself in the light of a murderess.
   </p>
   <p>
    V
   </p>
   <p>
    The haggling business, which had mainly depended on the horse, became
   </p>
   <p>
    disorganized forthwith. Distress, if not penury, loomed in the
   </p>
   <p>
    distance. Durbeyfield was what was locally called a slack-twisted
   </p>
   <p>
    fellow; he had good strength to work at times; but the times could not
   </p>
   <p>
    be relied on to coincide with the hours of requirement; and, having
   </p>
   <p>
    been unaccustomed to the regular toil of the day-labourer, he was not
   </p>
   <p>
    particularly persistent when they did so coincide.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess, meanwhile, as the one who had dragged her parents into this
   </p>
   <p>
    quagmire, was silently wondering what she could do to help them out of
   </p>
   <p>
    it; and then her mother broached her scheme.
   </p>
   <p>
    “We must take the ups wi’ the downs, Tess,” said she; “and never could
   </p>
   <p>
    your high blood have been found out at a more called-for moment. You
   </p>
   <p>
    must try your friends. Do ye know that there is a very rich Mrs
   </p>
   <p>
    d’Urberville living on the outskirts o’ The Chase, who must be our
   </p>
   <p>
    relation? You must go to her and claim kin, and ask for some help in
   </p>
   <p>
    our trouble.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I shouldn’t care to do that,” says Tess. “If there is such a lady,
   </p>
   <p>
    ’twould be enough for us if she were friendly—not to expect her to give
   </p>
   <p>
    us help.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You could win her round to do anything, my dear. Besides, perhaps
   </p>
   <p>
    there’s more in it than you know of. I’ve heard what I’ve heard,
   </p>
   <p>
    good-now.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The oppressive sense of the harm she had done led Tess to be more
   </p>
   <p>
    deferential than she might otherwise have been to the maternal wish;
   </p>
   <p>
    but she could not understand why her mother should find such
   </p>
   <p>
    satisfaction in contemplating an enterprise of, to her, such doubtful
   </p>
   <p>
    profit. Her mother might have made inquiries, and have discovered that
   </p>
   <p>
    this Mrs d’Urberville was a lady of unequalled virtues and charity. But
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess’s pride made the part of poor relation one of particular distaste
   </p>
   <p>
    to her.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’d rather try to get work,” she murmured.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Durbeyfield, you can settle it,” said his wife, turning to where he
   </p>
   <p>
    sat in the background. “If you say she ought to go, she will go.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t like my children going and making themselves beholden to
   </p>
   <p>
    strange kin,” murmured he. “I’m the head of the noblest branch o’ the
   </p>
   <p>
    family, and I ought to live up to it.”
   </p>
   <p>
    His reasons for staying away were worse to Tess than her own objections
   </p>
   <p>
    to going. “Well, as I killed the horse, mother,” she said mournfully,
   </p>
   <p>
    “I suppose I ought to do something. I don’t mind going and seeing her,
   </p>
   <p>
    but you must leave it to me about asking for help. And don’t go
   </p>
   <p>
    thinking about her making a match for me—it is silly.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Very well said, Tess!” observed her father sententiously.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Who said I had such a thought?” asked Joan.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I fancy it is in your mind, mother. But I’ll go.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Rising early next day she walked to the hill-town called Shaston, and
   </p>
   <p>
    there took advantage of a van which twice in the week ran from Shaston
   </p>
   <p>
    eastward to Chaseborough, passing near Trantridge, the parish in which
   </p>
   <p>
    the vague and mysterious Mrs d’Urberville had her residence.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess Durbeyfield’s route on this memorable morning lay amid the
   </p>
   <p>
    north-eastern undulations of the Vale in which she had been born, and
   </p>
   <p>
    in which her life had unfolded. The Vale of Blackmoor was to her the
   </p>
   <p>
    world, and its inhabitants the races thereof. From the gates and stiles
   </p>
   <p>
    of Marlott she had looked down its length in the wondering days of
   </p>
   <p>
    infancy, and what had been mystery to her then was not much less than
   </p>
   <p>
    mystery to her now. She had seen daily from her chamber-window towers,
   </p>
   <p>
    villages, faint white mansions; above all, the town of Shaston standing
   </p>
   <p>
    majestically on its height; its windows shining like lamps in the
   </p>
   <p>
    evening sun. She had hardly ever visited the place, only a small tract
   </p>
   <p>
    even of the Vale and its environs being known to her by close
   </p>
   <p>
    inspection. Much less had she been far outside the valley. Every
   </p>
   <p>
    contour of the surrounding hills was as personal to her as that of her
   </p>
   <p>
    relatives’ faces; but for what lay beyond, her judgment was dependent
   </p>
   <p>
    on the teaching of the village school, where she had held a leading
   </p>
   <p>
    place at the time of her leaving, a year or two before this date.
   </p>
   <p>
    In those early days she had been much loved by others of her own sex
   </p>
   <p>
    and age, and had used to be seen about the village as one of three—all
   </p>
   <p>
    nearly of the same year—walking home from school side by side; Tess the
   </p>
   <p>
    middle one—in a pink print pinafore, of a finely reticulated pattern,
   </p>
   <p>
    worn over a stuff frock that had lost its original colour for a
   </p>
   <p>
    nondescript tertiary—marching on upon long stalky legs, in tight
   </p>
   <p>
    stockings which had little ladder-like holes at the knees, torn by
   </p>
   <p>
    kneeling in the roads and banks in search of vegetable and mineral
   </p>
   <p>
    treasures; her then earth-coloured hair hanging like pot-hooks; the
   </p>
   <p>
    arms of the two outside girls resting round the waist of Tess; her arms
   </p>
   <p>
    on the shoulders of the two supporters.
   </p>
   <p>
    As Tess grew older, and began to see how matters stood, she felt quite
   </p>
   <p>
    a Malthusian towards her mother for thoughtlessly giving her so many
   </p>
   <p>
    little sisters and brothers, when it was such a trouble to nurse and
   </p>
   <p>
    provide for them. Her mother’s intelligence was that of a happy child:
   </p>
   <p>
    Joan Durbeyfield was simply an additional one, and that not the eldest,
   </p>
   <p>
    to her own long family of waiters on Providence.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, Tess became humanely beneficent towards the small ones, and to
   </p>
   <p>
    help them as much as possible she used, as soon as she left school, to
   </p>
   <p>
    lend a hand at haymaking or harvesting on neighbouring farms; or, by
   </p>
   <p>
    preference, at milking or butter-making processes, which she had learnt
   </p>
   <p>
    when her father had owned cows; and being deft-fingered it was a kind
   </p>
   <p>
    of work in which she excelled.
   </p>
   <p>
    Every day seemed to throw upon her young shoulders more of the family
   </p>
   <p>
    burdens, and that Tess should be the representative of the Durbeyfields
   </p>
   <p>
    at the d’Urberville mansion came as a thing of course. In this instance
   </p>
   <p>
    it must be admitted that the Durbeyfields were putting their fairest
   </p>
   <p>
    side outward.
   </p>
   <p>
    She alighted from the van at Trantridge Cross, and ascended on foot a
   </p>
   <p>
    hill in the direction of the district known as The Chase, on the
   </p>
   <p>
    borders of which, as she had been informed, Mrs d’Urberville’s seat,
   </p>
   <p>
    The Slopes, would be found. It was not a manorial home in the ordinary
   </p>
   <p>
    sense, with fields, and pastures, and a grumbling farmer, out of whom
   </p>
   <p>
    the owner had to squeeze an income for himself and his family by hook
   </p>
   <p>
    or by crook. It was more, far more; a country-house built for enjoyment
   </p>
   <p>
    pure and simple, with not an acre of troublesome land attached to it
   </p>
   <p>
    beyond what was required for residential purposes, and for a little
   </p>
   <p>
    fancy farm kept in hand by the owner, and tended by a bailiff.
   </p>
   <p>
    The crimson brick lodge came first in sight, up to its eaves in dense
   </p>
   <p>
    evergreens. Tess thought this was the mansion itself till, passing
   </p>
   <p>
    through the side wicket with some trepidation, and onward to a point at
   </p>
   <p>
    which the drive took a turn, the house proper stood in full view. It
   </p>
   <p>
    was of recent erection—indeed almost new—and of the same rich red
   </p>
   <p>
    colour that formed such a contrast with the evergreens of the lodge.
   </p>
   <p>
    Far behind the corner of the house—which rose like a geranium bloom
   </p>
   <p>
    against the subdued colours around—stretched the soft azure landscape
   </p>
   <p>
    of The Chase—a truly venerable tract of forest land, one of the few
   </p>
   <p>
    remaining woodlands in England of undoubted primaeval date, wherein
   </p>
   <p>
    Druidical mistletoe was still found on aged oaks, and where enormous
   </p>
   <p>
    yew-trees, not planted by the hand of man grew as they had grown when
   </p>
   <p>
    they were pollarded for bows. All this sylvan antiquity, however,
   </p>
   <p>
    though visible from The Slopes, was outside the immediate boundaries of
   </p>
   <p>
    the estate.
   </p>
   <p>
    Everything on this snug property was bright, thriving, and well kept;
   </p>
   <p>
    acres of glass-houses stretched down the inclines to the copses at
   </p>
   <p>
    their feet. Everything looked like money—like the last coin issued from
   </p>
   <p>
    the Mint. The stables, partly screened by Austrian pines and evergreen
   </p>
   <p>
    oaks, and fitted with every late appliance, were as dignified as
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapels-of-Ease. On the extensive lawn stood an ornamental tent, its
   </p>
   <p>
    door being towards her.
   </p>
   <p>
    Simple Tess Durbeyfield stood at gaze, in a half-alarmed attitude, on
   </p>
   <p>
    the edge of the gravel sweep. Her feet had brought her onward to this
   </p>
   <p>
    point before she had quite realized where she was; and now all was
   </p>
   <p>
    contrary to her expectation.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I thought we were an old family; but this is all new!” she said, in
   </p>
   <p>
    her artlessness. She wished that she had not fallen in so readily with
   </p>
   <p>
    her mother’s plans for “claiming kin,” and had endeavoured to gain
   </p>
   <p>
    assistance nearer home.
   </p>
   <p>
    The d’Urbervilles—or Stoke-d’Urbervilles, as they at first called
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves—who owned all this, were a somewhat unusual family to find
   </p>
   <p>
    in such an old-fashioned part of the country. Parson Tringham had
   </p>
   <p>
    spoken truly when he said that our shambling John Durbeyfield was the
   </p>
   <p>
    only really lineal representative of the old d’Urberville family
   </p>
   <p>
    existing in the county, or near it; he might have added, what he knew
   </p>
   <p>
    very well, that the Stoke-d’Urbervilles were no more d’Urbervilles of
   </p>
   <p>
    the true tree then he was himself. Yet it must be admitted that this
   </p>
   <p>
    family formed a very good stock whereon to regraft a name which sadly
   </p>
   <p>
    wanted such renovation.
   </p>
   <p>
    When old Mr Simon Stoke, latterly deceased, had made his fortune as an
   </p>
   <p>
    honest merchant (some said money-lender) in the North, he decided to
   </p>
   <p>
    settle as a county man in the South of England, out of hail of his
   </p>
   <p>
    business district; and in doing this he felt the necessity of
   </p>
   <p>
    recommencing with a name that would not too readily identify him with
   </p>
   <p>
    the smart tradesman of the past, and that would be less commonplace
   </p>
   <p>
    than the original bald, stark words. Conning for an hour in the British
   </p>
   <p>
    Museum the pages of works devoted to extinct, half-extinct, obscured,
   </p>
   <p>
    and ruined families appertaining to the quarter of England in which he
   </p>
   <p>
    proposed to settle, he considered that _d’Urberville_ looked and
   </p>
   <p>
    sounded as well as any of them: and d’Urberville accordingly was
   </p>
   <p>
    annexed to his own name for himself and his heirs eternally. Yet he was
   </p>
   <p>
    not an extravagant-minded man in this, and in constructing his family
   </p>
   <p>
    tree on the new basis was duly reasonable in framing his
   </p>
   <p>
    inter-marriages and aristocratic links, never inserting a single title
   </p>
   <p>
    above a rank of strict moderation.
   </p>
   <p>
    Of this work of imagination poor Tess and her parents were naturally in
   </p>
   <p>
    ignorance—much to their discomfiture; indeed, the very possibility of
   </p>
   <p>
    such annexations was unknown to them; who supposed that, though to be
   </p>
   <p>
    well-favoured might be the gift of fortune, a family name came by
   </p>
   <p>
    nature.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess still stood hesitating like a bather about to make his plunge,
   </p>
   <p>
    hardly knowing whether to retreat or to persevere, when a figure came
   </p>
   <p>
    forth from the dark triangular door of the tent. It was that of a tall
   </p>
   <p>
    young man, smoking.
   </p>
   <p>
    He had an almost swarthy complexion, with full lips, badly moulded,
   </p>
   <p>
    though red and smooth, above which was a well-groomed black moustache
   </p>
   <p>
    with curled points, though his age could not be more than three- or
   </p>
   <p>
    four-and-twenty. Despite the touches of barbarism in his contours,
   </p>
   <p>
    there was a singular force in the gentleman’s face, and in his bold
   </p>
   <p>
    rolling eye.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, my Beauty, what can I do for you?” said he, coming forward. And
   </p>
   <p>
    perceiving that she stood quite confounded: “Never mind me. I am Mr
   </p>
   <p>
    d’Urberville. Have you come to see me or my mother?”
   </p>
   <p>
    This embodiment of a d’Urberville and a namesake differed even more
   </p>
   <p>
    from what Tess had expected than the house and grounds had differed.
   </p>
   <p>
    She had dreamed of an aged and dignified face, the sublimation of all
   </p>
   <p>
    the d’Urberville lineaments, furrowed with incarnate memories
   </p>
   <p>
    representing in hieroglyphic the centuries of her family’s and
   </p>
   <p>
    England’s history. But she screwed herself up to the work in hand,
   </p>
   <p>
    since she could not get out of it, and answered—
   </p>
   <p>
    “I came to see your mother, sir.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am afraid you cannot see her—she is an invalid,” replied the present
   </p>
   <p>
    representative of the spurious house; for this was Mr Alec, the only
   </p>
   <p>
    son of the lately deceased gentleman. “Cannot I answer your purpose?
   </p>
   <p>
    What is the business you wish to see her about?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It isn’t business—it is—I can hardly say what!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Pleasure?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh no. Why, sir, if I tell you, it will seem—”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess’s sense of a certain ludicrousness in her errand was now so strong
   </p>
   <p>
    that, notwithstanding her awe of him, and her general discomfort at
   </p>
   <p>
    being here, her rosy lips curved towards a smile, much to the
   </p>
   <p>
    attraction of the swarthy Alexander.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It is so very foolish,” she stammered; “I fear I can’t tell you!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Never mind; I like foolish things. Try again, my dear,” said he
   </p>
   <p>
    kindly.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Mother asked me to come,” Tess continued; “and, indeed, I was in the
   </p>
   <p>
    mind to do so myself likewise. But I did not think it would be like
   </p>
   <p>
    this. I came, sir, to tell you that we are of the same family as you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ho! Poor relations?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Stokes?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No; d’Urbervilles.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ay, ay; I mean d’Urbervilles.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Our names are worn away to Durbeyfield; but we have several proofs
   </p>
   <p>
    that we are d’Urbervilles. Antiquarians hold we are,—and—and we have an
   </p>
   <p>
    old seal, marked with a ramping lion on a shield, and a castle over
   </p>
   <p>
    him. And we have a very old silver spoon, round in the bowl like a
   </p>
   <p>
    little ladle, and marked with the same castle. But it is so worn that
   </p>
   <p>
    mother uses it to stir the pea-soup.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “A castle argent is certainly my crest,” said he blandly. “And my arms
   </p>
   <p>
    a lion rampant.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And so mother said we ought to make ourselves beknown to you—as we’ve
   </p>
   <p>
    lost our horse by a bad accident, and are the oldest branch o’ the
   </p>
   <p>
    family.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Very kind of your mother, I’m sure. And I, for one, don’t regret her
   </p>
   <p>
    step.” Alec looked at Tess as he spoke, in a way that made her blush a
   </p>
   <p>
    little. “And so, my pretty girl, you’ve come on a friendly visit to us,
   </p>
   <p>
    as relations?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I suppose I have,” faltered Tess, looking uncomfortable again.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well—there’s no harm in it. Where do you live? What are you?”
   </p>
   <p>
    She gave him brief particulars; and responding to further inquiries
   </p>
   <p>
    told him that she was intending to go back by the same carrier who had
   </p>
   <p>
    brought her.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It is a long while before he returns past Trantridge Cross. Supposing
   </p>
   <p>
    we walk round the grounds to pass the time, my pretty Coz?”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess wished to abridge her visit as much as possible; but the young man
   </p>
   <p>
    was pressing, and she consented to accompany him. He conducted her
   </p>
   <p>
    about the lawns, and flower-beds, and conservatories; and thence to the
   </p>
   <p>
    fruit-garden and greenhouses, where he asked her if she liked
   </p>
   <p>
    strawberries.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes,” said Tess, “when they come.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “They are already here.” D’Urberville began gathering specimens of the
   </p>
   <p>
    fruit for her, handing them back to her as he stooped; and, presently,
   </p>
   <p>
    selecting a specially fine product of the “British Queen” variety, he
   </p>
   <p>
    stood up and held it by the stem to her mouth.
   </p>
   <p>
    “No—no!” she said quickly, putting her fingers between his hand and her
   </p>
   <p>
    lips. “I would rather take it in my own hand.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Nonsense!” he insisted; and in a slight distress she parted her lips
   </p>
   <p>
    and took it in.
   </p>
   <p>
    They had spent some time wandering desultorily thus, Tess eating in a
   </p>
   <p>
    half-pleased, half-reluctant state whatever d’Urberville offered her.
   </p>
   <p>
    When she could consume no more of the strawberries he filled her little
   </p>
   <p>
    basket with them; and then the two passed round to the rose-trees,
   </p>
   <p>
    whence he gathered blossoms and gave her to put in her bosom. She
   </p>
   <p>
    obeyed like one in a dream, and when she could affix no more he himself
   </p>
   <p>
    tucked a bud or two into her hat, and heaped her basket with others in
   </p>
   <p>
    the prodigality of his bounty. At last, looking at his watch, he said,
   </p>
   <p>
    “Now, by the time you have had something to eat, it will be time for
   </p>
   <p>
    you to leave, if you want to catch the carrier to Shaston. Come here,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I’ll see what grub I can find.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Stoke d’Urberville took her back to the lawn and into the tent, where
   </p>
   <p>
    he left her, soon reappearing with a basket of light luncheon, which he
   </p>
   <p>
    put before her himself. It was evidently the gentleman’s wish not to be
   </p>
   <p>
    disturbed in this pleasant _tête-à-tête_ by the servantry.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Do you mind my smoking?” he asked.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh, not at all, sir.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He watched her pretty and unconscious munching through the skeins of
   </p>
   <p>
    smoke that pervaded the tent, and Tess Durbeyfield did not divine, as
   </p>
   <p>
    she innocently looked down at the roses in her bosom, that there behind
   </p>
   <p>
    the blue narcotic haze was potentially the “tragic mischief” of her
   </p>
   <p>
    drama—one who stood fair to be the blood-red ray in the spectrum of her
   </p>
   <p>
    young life. She had an attribute which amounted to a disadvantage just
   </p>
   <p>
    now; and it was this that caused Alec d’Urberville’s eyes to rivet
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves upon her. It was a luxuriance of aspect, a fulness of
   </p>
   <p>
    growth, which made her appear more of a woman than she really was. She
   </p>
   <p>
    had inherited the feature from her mother without the quality it
   </p>
   <p>
    denoted. It had troubled her mind occasionally, till her companions had
   </p>
   <p>
    said that it was a fault which time would cure.
   </p>
   <p>
    She soon had finished her lunch. “Now I am going home, sir,” she said,
   </p>
   <p>
    rising.
   </p>
   <p>
    “And what do they call you?” he asked, as he accompanied her along the
   </p>
   <p>
    drive till they were out of sight of the house.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tess Durbeyfield, down at Marlott.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And you say your people have lost their horse?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I—killed him!” she answered, her eyes filling with tears as she gave
   </p>
   <p>
    particulars of Prince’s death. “And I don’t know what to do for father
   </p>
   <p>
    on account of it!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I must think if I cannot do something. My mother must find a berth for
   </p>
   <p>
    you. But, Tess, no nonsense about ‘d’Urberville’;—‘Durbeyfield’ only,
   </p>
   <p>
    you know—quite another name.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I wish for no better, sir,” said she with something of dignity.
   </p>
   <p>
    For a moment—only for a moment—when they were in the turning of the
   </p>
   <p>
    drive, between the tall rhododendrons and conifers, before the lodge
   </p>
   <p>
    became visible, he inclined his face towards her as if—but, no: he
   </p>
   <p>
    thought better of it, and let her go.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus the thing began. Had she perceived this meeting’s import she might
   </p>
   <p>
    have asked why she was doomed to be seen and coveted that day by the
   </p>
   <p>
    wrong man, and not by some other man, the right and desired one in all
   </p>
   <p>
    respects—as nearly as humanity can supply the right and desired; yet to
   </p>
   <p>
    him who amongst her acquaintance might have approximated to this kind,
   </p>
   <p>
    she was but a transient impression, half forgotten.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the ill-judged execution of the well-judged plan of things the call
   </p>
   <p>
    seldom produces the comer, the man to love rarely coincides with the
   </p>
   <p>
    hour for loving. Nature does not often say “See!” to her poor creature
   </p>
   <p>
    at a time when seeing can lead to happy doing; or reply “Here!” to a
   </p>
   <p>
    body’s cry of “Where?” till the hide-and-seek has become an irksome,
   </p>
   <p>
    outworn game. We may wonder whether at the acme and summit of the human
   </p>
   <p>
    progress these anachronisms will be corrected by a finer intuition, a
   </p>
   <p>
    closer interaction of the social machinery than that which now jolts us
   </p>
   <p>
    round and along; but such completeness is not to be prophesied, or even
   </p>
   <p>
    conceived as possible. Enough that in the present case, as in millions,
   </p>
   <p>
    it was not the two halves of a perfect whole that confronted each other
   </p>
   <p>
    at the perfect moment; a missing counterpart wandered independently
   </p>
   <p>
    about the earth waiting in crass obtuseness till the late time came.
   </p>
   <p>
    Out of which maladroit delay sprang anxieties, disappointments, shocks,
   </p>
   <p>
    catastrophes, and passing-strange destinies.
   </p>
   <p>
    When d’Urberville got back to the tent he sat down astride on a chair,
   </p>
   <p>
    reflecting, with a pleased gleam in his face. Then he broke into a loud
   </p>
   <p>
    laugh.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, I’m damned! What a funny thing! Ha-ha-ha! And what a crumby
   </p>
   <p>
    girl!”
   </p>
   <p>
    VI
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess went down the hill to Trantridge Cross, and inattentively waited
   </p>
   <p>
    to take her seat in the van returning from Chaseborough to Shaston. She
   </p>
   <p>
    did not know what the other occupants said to her as she entered,
   </p>
   <p>
    though she answered them; and when they had started anew she rode along
   </p>
   <p>
    with an inward and not an outward eye.
   </p>
   <p>
    One among her fellow-travellers addressed her more pointedly than any
   </p>
   <p>
    had spoken before: “Why, you be quite a posy! And such roses in early
   </p>
   <p>
    June!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Then she became aware of the spectacle she presented to their surprised
   </p>
   <p>
    vision: roses at her breasts; roses in her hat; roses and strawberries
   </p>
   <p>
    in her basket to the brim. She blushed, and said confusedly that the
   </p>
   <p>
    flowers had been given to her. When the passengers were not looking she
   </p>
   <p>
    stealthily removed the more prominent blooms from her hat and placed
   </p>
   <p>
    them in the basket, where she covered them with her handkerchief. Then
   </p>
   <p>
    she fell to reflecting again, and in looking downwards a thorn of the
   </p>
   <p>
    rose remaining in her breast accidentally pricked her chin. Like all
   </p>
   <p>
    the cottagers in Blackmoor Vale, Tess was steeped in fancies and
   </p>
   <p>
    prefigurative superstitions; she thought this an ill omen—the first she
   </p>
   <p>
    had noticed that day.
   </p>
   <p>
    The van travelled only so far as Shaston, and there were several miles
   </p>
   <p>
    of pedestrian descent from that mountain-town into the vale to Marlott.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her mother had advised her to stay here for the night, at the house of
   </p>
   <p>
    a cottage-woman they knew, if she should feel too tired to come on; and
   </p>
   <p>
    this Tess did, not descending to her home till the following afternoon.
   </p>
   <p>
    When she entered the house she perceived in a moment from her mother’s
   </p>
   <p>
    triumphant manner that something had occurred in the interim.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh yes; I know all about it! I told ’ee it would be all right, and now
   </p>
   <p>
    ’tis proved!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Since I’ve been away? What has?” said Tess rather wearily.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her mother surveyed the girl up and down with arch approval, and went
   </p>
   <p>
    on banteringly: “So you’ve brought ’em round!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “How do you know, mother?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’ve had a letter.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess then remembered that there would have been time for this.
   </p>
   <p>
    “They say—Mrs d’Urberville says—that she wants you to look after a
   </p>
   <p>
    little fowl-farm which is her hobby. But this is only her artful way of
   </p>
   <p>
    getting ’ee there without raising your hopes. She’s going to own ’ee as
   </p>
   <p>
    kin—that’s the meaning o’t.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But I didn’t see her.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You zid somebody, I suppose?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I saw her son.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And did he own ’ee?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well—he called me Coz.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “An’ I knew it! Jacky—he called her Coz!” cried Joan to her husband.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, he spoke to his mother, of course, and she do want ’ee there.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But I don’t know that I am apt at tending fowls,” said the dubious
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Then I don’t know who is apt. You’ve be’n born in the business, and
   </p>
   <p>
    brought up in it. They that be born in a business always know more
   </p>
   <p>
    about it than any ’prentice. Besides, that’s only just a show of
   </p>
   <p>
    something for you to do, that you midn’t feel beholden.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t altogether think I ought to go,” said Tess thoughtfully. “Who
   </p>
   <p>
    wrote the letter? Will you let me look at it?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Mrs d’Urberville wrote it. Here it is.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The letter was in the third person, and briefly informed Mrs
   </p>
   <p>
    Durbeyfield that her daughter’s services would be useful to that lady
   </p>
   <p>
    in the management of her poultry-farm, that a comfortable room would be
   </p>
   <p>
    provided for her if she could come, and that the wages would be on a
   </p>
   <p>
    liberal scale if they liked her.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh—that’s all!” said Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You couldn’t expect her to throw her arms round ’ee, an’ to kiss and
   </p>
   <p>
    to coll ’ee all at once.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess looked out of the window.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I would rather stay here with father and you,” she said.
   </p>
   <p>
    “But why?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’d rather not tell you why, mother; indeed, I don’t quite know why.”
   </p>
   <p>
    A week afterwards she came in one evening from an unavailing search for
   </p>
   <p>
    some light occupation in the immediate neighbourhood. Her idea had been
   </p>
   <p>
    to get together sufficient money during the summer to purchase another
   </p>
   <p>
    horse. Hardly had she crossed the threshold before one of the children
   </p>
   <p>
    danced across the room, saying, “The gentleman’s been here!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Her mother hastened to explain, smiles breaking from every inch of her
   </p>
   <p>
    person. Mrs d’Urberville’s son had called on horseback, having been
   </p>
   <p>
    riding by chance in the direction of Marlott. He had wished to know,
   </p>
   <p>
    finally, in the name of his mother, if Tess could really come to manage
   </p>
   <p>
    the old lady’s fowl-farm or not; the lad who had hitherto superintended
   </p>
   <p>
    the birds having proved untrustworthy. “Mr d’Urberville says you must
   </p>
   <p>
    be a good girl if you are at all as you appear; he knows you must be
   </p>
   <p>
    worth your weight in gold. He is very much interested in ’ee—truth to
   </p>
   <p>
    tell.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess seemed for the moment really pleased to hear that she had won such
   </p>
   <p>
    high opinion from a stranger when, in her own esteem, she had sunk so
   </p>
   <p>
    low.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It is very good of him to think that,” she murmured; “and if I was
   </p>
   <p>
    quite sure how it would be living there, I would go any-when.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “He is a mighty handsome man!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t think so,” said Tess coldly.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, there’s your chance, whether or no; and I’m sure he wears a
   </p>
   <p>
    beautiful diamond ring!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes,” said little Abraham, brightly, from the window-bench; “and I
   </p>
   <p>
    seed it! and it did twinkle when he put his hand up to his mistarshers.
   </p>
   <p>
    Mother, why did our grand relation keep on putting his hand up to his
   </p>
   <p>
    mistarshers?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Hark at that child!” cried Mrs Durbeyfield, with parenthetic
   </p>
   <p>
    admiration.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Perhaps to show his diamond ring,” murmured Sir John, dreamily, from
   </p>
   <p>
    his chair.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’ll think it over,” said Tess, leaving the room.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, she’s made a conquest o’ the younger branch of us, straight
   </p>
   <p>
    off,” continued the matron to her husband, “and she’s a fool if she
   </p>
   <p>
    don’t follow it up.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t quite like my children going away from home,” said the
   </p>
   <p>
    haggler. “As the head of the family, the rest ought to come to me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But do let her go, Jacky,” coaxed his poor witless wife. “He’s struck
   </p>
   <p>
    wi’ her—you can see that. He called her Coz! He’ll marry her, most
   </p>
   <p>
    likely, and make a lady of her; and then she’ll be what her forefathers
   </p>
   <p>
    was.”
   </p>
   <p>
    John Durbeyfield had more conceit than energy or health, and this
   </p>
   <p>
    supposition was pleasant to him.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, perhaps that’s what young Mr d’Urberville means,” he admitted;
   </p>
   <p>
    “and sure enough he mid have serious thoughts about improving his blood
   </p>
   <p>
    by linking on to the old line. Tess, the little rogue! And have she
   </p>
   <p>
    really paid ’em a visit to such an end as this?”
   </p>
   <p>
    Meanwhile Tess was walking thoughtfully among the gooseberry-bushes in
   </p>
   <p>
    the garden, and over Prince’s grave. When she came in her mother
   </p>
   <p>
    pursued her advantage.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, what be you going to do?” she asked.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I wish I had seen Mrs d’Urberville,” said Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I think you mid as well settle it. Then you’ll see her soon enough.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Her father coughed in his chair.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t know what to say!” answered the girl restlessly. “It is for
   </p>
   <p>
    you to decide. I killed the old horse, and I suppose I ought to do
   </p>
   <p>
    something to get ye a new one. But—but—I don’t quite like Mr
   </p>
   <p>
    d’Urberville being there!”
   </p>
   <p>
    The children, who had made use of this idea of Tess being taken up by
   </p>
   <p>
    their wealthy kinsfolk (which they imagined the other family to be) as
   </p>
   <p>
    a species of dolorifuge after the death of the horse, began to cry at
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess’s reluctance, and teased and reproached her for hesitating.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tess won’t go-o-o and be made a la-a-dy of!—no, she says she
   </p>
   <p>
    wo-o-on’t!” they wailed, with square mouths. “And we shan’t have a nice
   </p>
   <p>
    new horse, and lots o’ golden money to buy fairlings! And Tess won’t
   </p>
   <p>
    look pretty in her best cloze no mo-o-ore!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Her mother chimed in to the same tune: a certain way she had of making
   </p>
   <p>
    her labours in the house seem heavier than they were by prolonging them
   </p>
   <p>
    indefinitely, also weighed in the argument. Her father alone preserved
   </p>
   <p>
    an attitude of neutrality.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I will go,” said Tess at last.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her mother could not repress her consciousness of the nuptial vision
   </p>
   <p>
    conjured up by the girl’s consent.
   </p>
   <p>
    “That’s right! For such a pretty maid as ’tis, this is a fine chance!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess smiled crossly.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I hope it is a chance for earning money. It is no other kind of
   </p>
   <p>
    chance. You had better say nothing of that silly sort about parish.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs Durbeyfield did not promise. She was not quite sure that she did
   </p>
   <p>
    not feel proud enough, after the visitor’s remarks, to say a good deal.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus it was arranged; and the young girl wrote, agreeing to be ready to
   </p>
   <p>
    set out on any day on which she might be required. She was duly
   </p>
   <p>
    informed that Mrs d’Urberville was glad of her decision, and that a
   </p>
   <p>
    spring-cart should be sent to meet her and her luggage at the top of
   </p>
   <p>
    the Vale on the day after the morrow, when she must hold herself
   </p>
   <p>
    prepared to start. Mrs d’Urberville’s handwriting seemed rather
   </p>
   <p>
    masculine.
   </p>
   <p>
    “A cart?” murmured Joan Durbeyfield doubtingly. “It might have been a
   </p>
   <p>
    carriage for her own kin!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Having at last taken her course Tess was less restless and abstracted,
   </p>
   <p>
    going about her business with some self-assurance in the thought of
   </p>
   <p>
    acquiring another horse for her father by an occupation which would not
   </p>
   <p>
    be onerous. She had hoped to be a teacher at the school, but the fates
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed to decide otherwise. Being mentally older than her mother she
   </p>
   <p>
    did not regard Mrs Durbeyfield’s matrimonial hopes for her in a serious
   </p>
   <p>
    aspect for a moment. The light-minded woman had been discovering good
   </p>
   <p>
    matches for her daughter almost from the year of her birth.
   </p>
   <p>
    VII
   </p>
   <p>
    On the morning appointed for her departure Tess was awake before
   </p>
   <p>
    dawn—at the marginal minute of the dark when the grove is still mute,
   </p>
   <p>
    save for one prophetic bird who sings with a clear-voiced conviction
   </p>
   <p>
    that he at least knows the correct time of day, the rest preserving
   </p>
   <p>
    silence as if equally convinced that he is mistaken. She remained
   </p>
   <p>
    upstairs packing till breakfast-time, and then came down in her
   </p>
   <p>
    ordinary week-day clothes, her Sunday apparel being carefully folded in
   </p>
   <p>
    her box.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her mother expostulated. “You will never set out to see your folks
   </p>
   <p>
    without dressing up more the dand than that?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But I am going to work!” said Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, yes,” said Mrs Durbeyfield; and in a private tone, “at first
   </p>
   <p>
    there mid be a little pretence o’t.... But I think it will be wiser of
   </p>
   <p>
    ’ee to put your best side outward,” she added.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Very well; I suppose you know best,” replied Tess with calm
   </p>
   <p>
    abandonment.
   </p>
   <p>
    And to please her parent the girl put herself quite in Joan’s hands,
   </p>
   <p>
    saying serenely—“Do what you like with me, mother.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs Durbeyfield was only too delighted at this tractability. First she
   </p>
   <p>
    fetched a great basin, and washed Tess’s hair with such thoroughness
   </p>
   <p>
    that when dried and brushed it looked twice as much as at other times.
   </p>
   <p>
    She tied it with a broader pink ribbon than usual. Then she put upon
   </p>
   <p>
    her the white frock that Tess had worn at the club-walking, the airy
   </p>
   <p>
    fulness of which, supplementing her enlarged _coiffure_, imparted to
   </p>
   <p>
    her developing figure an amplitude which belied her age, and might
   </p>
   <p>
    cause her to be estimated as a woman when she was not much more than a
   </p>
   <p>
    child.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I declare there’s a hole in my stocking-heel!” said Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Never mind holes in your stockings—they don’t speak! When I was a
   </p>
   <p>
    maid, so long as I had a pretty bonnet the devil might ha’ found me in
   </p>
   <p>
    heels.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Her mother’s pride in the girl’s appearance led her to step back, like
   </p>
   <p>
    a painter from his easel, and survey her work as a whole.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You must zee yourself!” she cried. “It is much better than you was
   </p>
   <p>
    t’other day.”
   </p>
   <p>
    As the looking-glass was only large enough to reflect a very small
   </p>
   <p>
    portion of Tess’s person at one time, Mrs Durbeyfield hung a black
   </p>
   <p>
    cloak outside the casement, and so made a large reflector of the panes,
   </p>
   <p>
    as it is the wont of bedecking cottagers to do. After this she went
   </p>
   <p>
    downstairs to her husband, who was sitting in the lower room.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’ll tell ’ee what ’tis, Durbeyfield,” said she exultingly; “he’ll
   </p>
   <p>
    never have the heart not to love her. But whatever you do, don’t zay
   </p>
   <p>
    too much to Tess of his fancy for her, and this chance she has got. She
   </p>
   <p>
    is such an odd maid that it mid zet her against him, or against going
   </p>
   <p>
    there, even now. If all goes well, I shall certainly be for making some
   </p>
   <p>
    return to pa’son at Stagfoot Lane for telling us—dear, good man!”
   </p>
   <p>
    However, as the moment for the girl’s setting out drew nigh, when the
   </p>
   <p>
    first excitement of the dressing had passed off, a slight misgiving
   </p>
   <p>
    found place in Joan Durbeyfield’s mind. It prompted the matron to say
   </p>
   <p>
    that she would walk a little way—as far as to the point where the
   </p>
   <p>
    acclivity from the valley began its first steep ascent to the outer
   </p>
   <p>
    world. At the top Tess was going to be met with the spring-cart sent by
   </p>
   <p>
    the Stoke-d’Urbervilles, and her box had already been wheeled ahead
   </p>
   <p>
    towards this summit by a lad with trucks, to be in readiness.
   </p>
   <p>
    Seeing their mother put on her bonnet, the younger children clamoured
   </p>
   <p>
    to go with her.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I do want to walk a little-ways wi’ Sissy, now she’s going to marry
   </p>
   <p>
    our gentleman-cousin, and wear fine cloze!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Now,” said Tess, flushing and turning quickly, “I’ll hear no more o’
   </p>
   <p>
    that! Mother, how could you ever put such stuff into their heads?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Going to work, my dears, for our rich relation, and help get enough
   </p>
   <p>
    money for a new horse,” said Mrs Durbeyfield pacifically.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Goodbye, father,” said Tess, with a lumpy throat.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Goodbye, my maid,” said Sir John, raising his head from his breast as
   </p>
   <p>
    he suspended his nap, induced by a slight excess this morning in honour
   </p>
   <p>
    of the occasion. “Well, I hope my young friend will like such a comely
   </p>
   <p>
    sample of his own blood. And tell’n, Tess, that being sunk, quite, from
   </p>
   <p>
    our former grandeur, I’ll sell him the title—yes, sell it—and at no
   </p>
   <p>
    onreasonable figure.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Not for less than a thousand pound!” cried Lady Durbeyfield.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tell’n—I’ll take a thousand pound. Well, I’ll take less, when I come
   </p>
   <p>
    to think o’t. He’ll adorn it better than a poor lammicken feller like
   </p>
   <p>
    myself can. Tell’n he shall hae it for a hundred. But I won’t stand
   </p>
   <p>
    upon trifles—tell’n he shall hae it for fifty—for twenty pound! Yes,
   </p>
   <p>
    twenty pound—that’s the lowest. Dammy, family honour is family honour,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I won’t take a penny less!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess’s eyes were too full and her voice too choked to utter the
   </p>
   <p>
    sentiments that were in her. She turned quickly, and went out.
   </p>
   <p>
    So the girls and their mother all walked together, a child on each side
   </p>
   <p>
    of Tess, holding her hand and looking at her meditatively from time to
   </p>
   <p>
    time, as at one who was about to do great things; her mother just
   </p>
   <p>
    behind with the smallest; the group forming a picture of honest beauty
   </p>
   <p>
    flanked by innocence, and backed by simple-souled vanity. They followed
   </p>
   <p>
    the way till they reached the beginning of the ascent, on the crest of
   </p>
   <p>
    which the vehicle from Trantridge was to receive her, this limit having
   </p>
   <p>
    been fixed to save the horse the labour of the last slope. Far away
   </p>
   <p>
    behind the first hills the cliff-like dwellings of Shaston broke the
   </p>
   <p>
    line of the ridge. Nobody was visible in the elevated road which
   </p>
   <p>
    skirted the ascent save the lad whom they had sent on before them,
   </p>
   <p>
    sitting on the handle of the barrow that contained all Tess’s worldly
   </p>
   <p>
    possessions.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Bide here a bit, and the cart will soon come, no doubt,” said Mrs
   </p>
   <p>
    Durbeyfield. “Yes, I see it yonder!”
   </p>
   <p>
    It had come—appearing suddenly from behind the forehead of the nearest
   </p>
   <p>
    upland, and stopping beside the boy with the barrow. Her mother and the
   </p>
   <p>
    children thereupon decided to go no farther, and bidding them a hasty
   </p>
   <p>
    goodbye, Tess bent her steps up the hill.
   </p>
   <p>
    They saw her white shape draw near to the spring-cart, on which her box
   </p>
   <p>
    was already placed. But before she had quite reached it another vehicle
   </p>
   <p>
    shot out from a clump of trees on the summit, came round the bend of
   </p>
   <p>
    the road there, passed the luggage-cart, and halted beside Tess, who
   </p>
   <p>
    looked up as if in great surprise.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her mother perceived, for the first time, that the second vehicle was
   </p>
   <p>
    not a humble conveyance like the first, but a spick-and-span gig or
   </p>
   <p>
    dog-cart, highly varnished and equipped. The driver was a young man of
   </p>
   <p>
    three- or four-and-twenty, with a cigar between his teeth; wearing a
   </p>
   <p>
    dandy cap, drab jacket, breeches of the same hue, white neckcloth,
   </p>
   <p>
    stick-up collar, and brown driving-gloves—in short, he was the
   </p>
   <p>
    handsome, horsey young buck who had visited Joan a week or two before
   </p>
   <p>
    to get her answer about Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs Durbeyfield clapped her hands like a child. Then she looked down,
   </p>
   <p>
    then stared again. Could she be deceived as to the meaning of this?
   </p>
   <p>
    “Is dat the gentleman-kinsman who’ll make Sissy a lady?” asked the
   </p>
   <p>
    youngest child.
   </p>
   <p>
    Meanwhile the muslined form of Tess could be seen standing still,
   </p>
   <p>
    undecided, beside this turn-out, whose owner was talking to her. Her
   </p>
   <p>
    seeming indecision was, in fact, more than indecision: it was
   </p>
   <p>
    misgiving. She would have preferred the humble cart. The young man
   </p>
   <p>
    dismounted, and appeared to urge her to ascend. She turned her face
   </p>
   <p>
    down the hill to her relatives, and regarded the little group.
   </p>
   <p>
    Something seemed to quicken her to a determination; possibly the
   </p>
   <p>
    thought that she had killed Prince. She suddenly stepped up; he mounted
   </p>
   <p>
    beside her, and immediately whipped on the horse. In a moment they had
   </p>
   <p>
    passed the slow cart with the box, and disappeared behind the shoulder
   </p>
   <p>
    of the hill.
   </p>
   <p>
    Directly Tess was out of sight, and the interest of the matter as a
   </p>
   <p>
    drama was at an end, the little ones’ eyes filled with tears. The
   </p>
   <p>
    youngest child said, “I wish poor, poor Tess wasn’t gone away to be a
   </p>
   <p>
    lady!” and, lowering the corners of his lips, burst out crying. The new
   </p>
   <p>
    point of view was infectious, and the next child did likewise, and then
   </p>
   <p>
    the next, till the whole three of them wailed loud.
   </p>
   <p>
    There were tears also in Joan Durbeyfield’s eyes as she turned to go
   </p>
   <p>
    home. But by the time she had got back to the village she was passively
   </p>
   <p>
    trusting to the favour of accident. However, in bed that night she
   </p>
   <p>
    sighed, and her husband asked her what was the matter.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh, I don’t know exactly,” she said. “I was thinking that perhaps it
   </p>
   <p>
    would ha’ been better if Tess had not gone.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oughtn’t ye to have thought of that before?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, ’tis a chance for the maid—Still, if ’twere the doing again, I
   </p>
   <p>
    wouldn’t let her go till I had found out whether the gentleman is
   </p>
   <p>
    really a good-hearted young man and choice over her as his kinswoman.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, you ought, perhaps, to ha’ done that,” snored Sir John.
   </p>
   <p>
    Joan Durbeyfield always managed to find consolation somewhere: “Well,
   </p>
   <p>
    as one of the genuine stock, she ought to make her way with ’en, if she
   </p>
   <p>
    plays her trump card aright. And if he don’t marry her afore he will
   </p>
   <p>
    after. For that he’s all afire wi’ love for her any eye can see.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “What’s her trump card? Her d’Urberville blood, you mean?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No, stupid; her face—as ’twas mine.”
   </p>
   <p>
    VIII
   </p>
   <p>
    Having mounted beside her, Alec d’Urberville drove rapidly along the
   </p>
   <p>
    crest of the first hill, chatting compliments to Tess as they went, the
   </p>
   <p>
    cart with her box being left far behind. Rising still, an immense
   </p>
   <p>
    landscape stretched around them on every side; behind, the green valley
   </p>
   <p>
    of her birth, before, a gray country of which she knew nothing except
   </p>
   <p>
    from her first brief visit to Trantridge. Thus they reached the verge
   </p>
   <p>
    of an incline down which the road stretched in a long straight descent
   </p>
   <p>
    of nearly a mile.
   </p>
   <p>
    Ever since the accident with her father’s horse Tess Durbeyfield,
   </p>
   <p>
    courageous as she naturally was, had been exceedingly timid on wheels;
   </p>
   <p>
    the least irregularity of motion startled her. She began to get uneasy
   </p>
   <p>
    at a certain recklessness in her conductor’s driving.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You will go down slow, sir, I suppose?” she said with attempted
   </p>
   <p>
    unconcern.
   </p>
   <p>
    D’Urberville looked round upon her, nipped his cigar with the tips of
   </p>
   <p>
    his large white centre-teeth, and allowed his lips to smile slowly of
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why, Tess,” he answered, after another whiff or two, “it isn’t a brave
   </p>
   <p>
    bouncing girl like you who asks that? Why, I always go down at full
   </p>
   <p>
    gallop. There’s nothing like it for raising your spirits.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But perhaps you need not now?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah,” he said, shaking his head, “there are two to be reckoned with. It
   </p>
   <p>
    is not me alone. Tib has to be considered, and she has a very queer
   </p>
   <p>
    temper.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Who?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why, this mare. I fancy she looked round at me in a very grim way just
   </p>
   <p>
    then. Didn’t you notice it?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Don’t try to frighten me, sir,” said Tess stiffly.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, I don’t. If any living man can manage this horse I can: I won’t
   </p>
   <p>
    say any living man can do it—but if such has the power, I am he.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why do you have such a horse?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah, well may you ask it! It was my fate, I suppose. Tib has killed one
   </p>
   <p>
    chap; and just after I bought her she nearly killed me. And then, take
   </p>
   <p>
    my word for it, I nearly killed her. But she’s touchy still, very
   </p>
   <p>
    touchy; and one’s life is hardly safe behind her sometimes.”
   </p>
   <p>
    They were just beginning to descend; and it was evident that the horse,
   </p>
   <p>
    whether of her own will or of his (the latter being the more likely),
   </p>
   <p>
    knew so well the reckless performance expected of her that she hardly
   </p>
   <p>
    required a hint from behind.
   </p>
   <p>
    Down, down, they sped, the wheels humming like a top, the dog-cart
   </p>
   <p>
    rocking right and left, its axis acquiring a slightly oblique set in
   </p>
   <p>
    relation to the line of progress; the figure of the horse rising and
   </p>
   <p>
    falling in undulations before them. Sometimes a wheel was off the
   </p>
   <p>
    ground, it seemed, for many yards; sometimes a stone was sent spinning
   </p>
   <p>
    over the hedge, and flinty sparks from the horse’s hoofs outshone the
   </p>
   <p>
    daylight. The aspect of the straight road enlarged with their advance,
   </p>
   <p>
    the two banks dividing like a splitting stick; one rushing past at each
   </p>
   <p>
    shoulder.
   </p>
   <p>
    The wind blew through Tess’s white muslin to her very skin, and her
   </p>
   <p>
    washed hair flew out behind. She was determined to show no open fear,
   </p>
   <p>
    but she clutched d’Urberville’s rein-arm.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Don’t touch my arm! We shall be thrown out if you do! Hold on round my
   </p>
   <p>
    waist!”
   </p>
   <p>
    She grasped his waist, and so they reached the bottom.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Safe, thank God, in spite of your fooling!” said she, her face on
   </p>
   <p>
    fire.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tess—fie! that’s temper!” said d’Urberville.
   </p>
   <p>
    “’Tis truth.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, you need not let go your hold of me so thanklessly the moment
   </p>
   <p>
    you feel yourself out of danger.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She had not considered what she had been doing; whether he were man or
   </p>
   <p>
    woman, stick or stone, in her involuntary hold on him. Recovering her
   </p>
   <p>
    reserve, she sat without replying, and thus they reached the summit of
   </p>
   <p>
    another declivity.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Now then, again!” said d’Urberville.
   </p>
   <p>
    “No, no!” said Tess. “Show more sense, do, please.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But when people find themselves on one of the highest points in the
   </p>
   <p>
    county, they must get down again,” he retorted.
   </p>
   <p>
    He loosened rein, and away they went a second time. D’Urberville turned
   </p>
   <p>
    his face to her as they rocked, and said, in playful raillery: “Now
   </p>
   <p>
    then, put your arms round my waist again, as you did before, my
   </p>
   <p>
    Beauty.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Never!” said Tess independently, holding on as well as she could
   </p>
   <p>
    without touching him.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Let me put one little kiss on those holmberry lips, Tess, or even on
   </p>
   <p>
    that warmed cheek, and I’ll stop—on my honour, I will!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess, surprised beyond measure, slid farther back still on her seat, at
   </p>
   <p>
    which he urged the horse anew, and rocked her the more.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Will nothing else do?” she cried at length, in desperation, her large
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes staring at him like those of a wild animal. This dressing her up
   </p>
   <p>
    so prettily by her mother had apparently been to lamentable purpose.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Nothing, dear Tess,” he replied.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh, I don’t know—very well; I don’t mind!” she panted miserably.
   </p>
   <p>
    He drew rein, and as they slowed he was on the point of imprinting the
   </p>
   <p>
    desired salute, when, as if hardly yet aware of her own modesty, she
   </p>
   <p>
    dodged aside. His arms being occupied with the reins there was left him
   </p>
   <p>
    no power to prevent her manœuvre.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Now, damn it—I’ll break both our necks!” swore her capriciously
   </p>
   <p>
    passionate companion. “So you can go from your word like that, you
   </p>
   <p>
    young witch, can you?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Very well,” said Tess, “I’ll not move since you be so determined! But
   </p>
   <p>
    I—thought you would be kind to me, and protect me, as my kinsman!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Kinsman be hanged! Now!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But I don’t want anybody to kiss me, sir!” she implored, a big tear
   </p>
   <p>
    beginning to roll down her face, and the corners of her mouth trembling
   </p>
   <p>
    in her attempts not to cry. “And I wouldn’t ha’ come if I had known!”
   </p>
   <p>
    He was inexorable, and she sat still, and d’Urberville gave her the
   </p>
   <p>
    kiss of mastery. No sooner had he done so than she flushed with shame,
   </p>
   <p>
    took out her handkerchief, and wiped the spot on her cheek that had
   </p>
   <p>
    been touched by his lips. His ardour was nettled at the sight, for the
   </p>
   <p>
    act on her part had been unconsciously done.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You are mighty sensitive for a cottage girl!” said the young man.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess made no reply to this remark, of which, indeed, she did not quite
   </p>
   <p>
    comprehend the drift, unheeding the snub she had administered by her
   </p>
   <p>
    instinctive rub upon her cheek. She had, in fact, undone the kiss, as
   </p>
   <p>
    far as such a thing was physically possible. With a dim sense that he
   </p>
   <p>
    was vexed she looked steadily ahead as they trotted on near Melbury
   </p>
   <p>
    Down and Wingreen, till she saw, to her consternation, that there was
   </p>
   <p>
    yet another descent to be undergone.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You shall be made sorry for that!” he resumed, his injured tone still
   </p>
   <p>
    remaining, as he flourished the whip anew. “Unless, that is, you agree
   </p>
   <p>
    willingly to let me do it again, and no handkerchief.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She sighed. “Very well, sir!” she said. “Oh—let me get my hat!”
   </p>
   <p>
    At the moment of speaking her hat had blown off into the road, their
   </p>
   <p>
    present speed on the upland being by no means slow. D’Urberville pulled
   </p>
   <p>
    up, and said he would get it for her, but Tess was down on the other
   </p>
   <p>
    side.
   </p>
   <p>
    She turned back and picked up the article.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You look prettier with it off, upon my soul, if that’s possible,” he
   </p>
   <p>
    said, contemplating her over the back of the vehicle. “Now then, up
   </p>
   <p>
    again! What’s the matter?”
   </p>
   <p>
    The hat was in place and tied, but Tess had not stepped forward.
   </p>
   <p>
    “No, sir,” she said, revealing the red and ivory of her mouth as her
   </p>
   <p>
    eye lit in defiant triumph; “not again, if I know it!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “What—you won’t get up beside me?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No; I shall walk.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “’Tis five or six miles yet to Trantridge.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t care if ’tis dozens. Besides, the cart is behind.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You artful hussy! Now, tell me—didn’t you make that hat blow off on
   </p>
   <p>
    purpose? I’ll swear you did!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Her strategic silence confirmed his suspicion.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then d’Urberville cursed and swore at her, and called her everything he
   </p>
   <p>
    could think of for the trick. Turning the horse suddenly he tried to
   </p>
   <p>
    drive back upon her, and so hem her in between the gig and the hedge.
   </p>
   <p>
    But he could not do this short of injuring her.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You ought to be ashamed of yourself for using such wicked words!”
   </p>
   <p>
    cried Tess with spirit, from the top of the hedge into which she had
   </p>
   <p>
    scrambled. “I don’t like ’ee at all! I hate and detest you! I’ll go
   </p>
   <p>
    back to mother, I will!”
   </p>
   <p>
    D’Urberville’s bad temper cleared up at sight of hers; and he laughed
   </p>
   <p>
    heartily.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, I like you all the better,” he said. “Come, let there be peace.
   </p>
   <p>
    I’ll never do it any more against your will. My life upon it now!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Still Tess could not be induced to remount. She did not, however,
   </p>
   <p>
    object to his keeping his gig alongside her; and in this manner, at a
   </p>
   <p>
    slow pace, they advanced towards the village of Trantridge. From time
   </p>
   <p>
    to time d’Urberville exhibited a sort of fierce distress at the sight
   </p>
   <p>
    of the tramping he had driven her to undertake by his misdemeanour. She
   </p>
   <p>
    might in truth have safely trusted him now; but he had forfeited her
   </p>
   <p>
    confidence for the time, and she kept on the ground progressing
   </p>
   <p>
    thoughtfully, as if wondering whether it would be wiser to return home.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her resolve, however, had been taken, and it seemed vacillating even to
   </p>
   <p>
    childishness to abandon it now, unless for graver reasons. How could
   </p>
   <p>
    she face her parents, get back her box, and disconcert the whole scheme
   </p>
   <p>
    for the rehabilitation of her family on such sentimental grounds?
   </p>
   <p>
    A few minutes later the chimneys of The Slopes appeared in view, and in
   </p>
   <p>
    a snug nook to the right the poultry-farm and cottage of Tess’s
   </p>
   <p>
    destination.
   </p>
   <p>
    IX
   </p>
   <p>
    The community of fowls to which Tess had been appointed as supervisor,
   </p>
   <p>
    purveyor, nurse, surgeon, and friend made its headquarters in an old
   </p>
   <p>
    thatched cottage standing in an enclosure that had once been a garden,
   </p>
   <p>
    but was now a trampled and sanded square. The house was overrun with
   </p>
   <p>
    ivy, its chimney being enlarged by the boughs of the parasite to the
   </p>
   <p>
    aspect of a ruined tower. The lower rooms were entirely given over to
   </p>
   <p>
    the birds, who walked about them with a proprietary air, as though the
   </p>
   <p>
    place had been built by themselves, and not by certain dusty
   </p>
   <p>
    copyholders who now lay east and west in the churchyard. The
   </p>
   <p>
    descendants of these bygone owners felt it almost as a slight to their
   </p>
   <p>
    family when the house which had so much of their affection, had cost so
   </p>
   <p>
    much of their forefathers’ money, and had been in their possession for
   </p>
   <p>
    several generations before the d’Urbervilles came and built here, was
   </p>
   <p>
    indifferently turned into a fowl-house by Mrs Stoke-d’Urberville as
   </p>
   <p>
    soon as the property fell into hand according to law. “’Twas good
   </p>
   <p>
    enough for Christians in grandfather’s time,” they said.
   </p>
   <p>
    The rooms wherein dozens of infants had wailed at their nursing now
   </p>
   <p>
    resounded with the tapping of nascent chicks. Distracted hens in coops
   </p>
   <p>
    occupied spots where formerly stood chairs supporting sedate
   </p>
   <p>
    agriculturists. The chimney-corner and once-blazing hearth was now
   </p>
   <p>
    filled with inverted beehives, in which the hens laid their eggs; while
   </p>
   <p>
    out of doors the plots that each succeeding householder had carefully
   </p>
   <p>
    shaped with his spade were torn by the cocks in wildest fashion.
   </p>
   <p>
    The garden in which the cottage stood was surrounded by a wall, and
   </p>
   <p>
    could only be entered through a door.
   </p>
   <p>
    When Tess had occupied herself about an hour the next morning in
   </p>
   <p>
    altering and improving the arrangements, according to her skilled ideas
   </p>
   <p>
    as the daughter of a professed poulterer, the door in the wall opened
   </p>
   <p>
    and a servant in white cap and apron entered. She had come from the
   </p>
   <p>
    manor-house.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Mrs d’Urberville wants the fowls as usual,” she said; but perceiving
   </p>
   <p>
    that Tess did not quite understand, she explained, “Mis’ess is a old
   </p>
   <p>
    lady, and blind.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Blind!” said Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    Almost before her misgiving at the news could find time to shape itself
   </p>
   <p>
    she took, under her companion’s direction, two of the most beautiful of
   </p>
   <p>
    the Hamburghs in her arms, and followed the maid-servant, who had
   </p>
   <p>
    likewise taken two, to the adjacent mansion, which, though ornate and
   </p>
   <p>
    imposing, showed traces everywhere on this side that some occupant of
   </p>
   <p>
    its chambers could bend to the love of dumb creatures—feathers floating
   </p>
   <p>
    within view of the front, and hen-coops standing on the grass.
   </p>
   <p>
    In a sitting-room on the ground-floor, ensconced in an armchair with
   </p>
   <p>
    her back to the light, was the owner and mistress of the estate, a
   </p>
   <p>
    white-haired woman of not more than sixty, or even less, wearing a
   </p>
   <p>
    large cap. She had the mobile face frequent in those whose sight has
   </p>
   <p>
    decayed by stages, has been laboriously striven after, and reluctantly
   </p>
   <p>
    let go, rather than the stagnant mien apparent in persons long
   </p>
   <p>
    sightless or born blind. Tess walked up to this lady with her feathered
   </p>
   <p>
    charges—one sitting on each arm.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah, you are the young woman come to look after my birds?” said Mrs
   </p>
   <p>
    d’Urberville, recognizing a new footstep. “I hope you will be kind to
   </p>
   <p>
    them. My bailiff tells me you are quite the proper person. Well, where
   </p>
   <p>
    are they? Ah, this is Strut! But he is hardly so lively to-day, is he?
   </p>
   <p>
    He is alarmed at being handled by a stranger, I suppose. And Phena
   </p>
   <p>
    too—yes, they are a little frightened—aren’t you, dears? But they will
   </p>
   <p>
    soon get used to you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    While the old lady had been speaking Tess and the other maid, in
   </p>
   <p>
    obedience to her gestures, had placed the fowls severally in her lap,
   </p>
   <p>
    and she had felt them over from head to tail, examining their beaks,
   </p>
   <p>
    their combs, the manes of the cocks, their wings, and their claws. Her
   </p>
   <p>
    touch enabled her to recognize them in a moment, and to discover if a
   </p>
   <p>
    single feather were crippled or draggled. She handled their crops, and
   </p>
   <p>
    knew what they had eaten, and if too little or too much; her face
   </p>
   <p>
    enacting a vivid pantomime of the criticisms passing in her mind.
   </p>
   <p>
    The birds that the two girls had brought in were duly returned to the
   </p>
   <p>
    yard, and the process was repeated till all the pet cocks and hens had
   </p>
   <p>
    been submitted to the old woman—Hamburghs, Bantams, Cochins, Brahmas,
   </p>
   <p>
    Dorkings, and such other sorts as were in fashion just then—her
   </p>
   <p>
    perception of each visitor being seldom at fault as she received the
   </p>
   <p>
    bird upon her knees.
   </p>
   <p>
    It reminded Tess of a Confirmation, in which Mrs d’Urberville was the
   </p>
   <p>
    bishop, the fowls the young people presented, and herself and the
   </p>
   <p>
    maid-servant the parson and curate of the parish bringing them up. At
   </p>
   <p>
    the end of the ceremony Mrs d’Urberville abruptly asked Tess, wrinkling
   </p>
   <p>
    and twitching her face into undulations, “Can you whistle?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Whistle, Ma’am?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, whistle tunes.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess could whistle like most other country-girls, though the
   </p>
   <p>
    accomplishment was one which she did not care to profess in genteel
   </p>
   <p>
    company. However, she blandly admitted that such was the fact.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Then you will have to practise it every day. I had a lad who did it
   </p>
   <p>
    very well, but he has left. I want you to whistle to my bullfinches; as
   </p>
   <p>
    I cannot see them, I like to hear them, and we teach ’em airs that way.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tell her where the cages are, Elizabeth. You must begin to-morrow, or
   </p>
   <p>
    they will go back in their piping. They have been neglected these
   </p>
   <p>
    several days.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Mr d’Urberville whistled to ’em this morning, ma’am,” said Elizabeth.
   </p>
   <p>
    “He! Pooh!”
   </p>
   <p>
    The old lady’s face creased into furrows of repugnance, and she made no
   </p>
   <p>
    further reply.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus the reception of Tess by her fancied kinswoman terminated, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    birds were taken back to their quarters. The girl’s surprise at Mrs
   </p>
   <p>
    d’Urberville’s manner was not great; for since seeing the size of the
   </p>
   <p>
    house she had expected no more. But she was far from being aware that
   </p>
   <p>
    the old lady had never heard a word of the so-called kinship. She
   </p>
   <p>
    gathered that no great affection flowed between the blind woman and her
   </p>
   <p>
    son. But in that, too, she was mistaken. Mrs d’Urberville was not the
   </p>
   <p>
    first mother compelled to love her offspring resentfully, and to be
   </p>
   <p>
    bitterly fond.
   </p>
   <p>
    In spite of the unpleasant initiation of the day before, Tess inclined
   </p>
   <p>
    to the freedom and novelty of her new position in the morning when the
   </p>
   <p>
    sun shone, now that she was once installed there; and she was curious
   </p>
   <p>
    to test her powers in the unexpected direction asked of her, so as to
   </p>
   <p>
    ascertain her chance of retaining her post. As soon as she was alone
   </p>
   <p>
    within the walled garden she sat herself down on a coop, and seriously
   </p>
   <p>
    screwed up her mouth for the long-neglected practice. She found her
   </p>
   <p>
    former ability to have degenerated to the production of a hollow rush
   </p>
   <p>
    of wind through the lips, and no clear note at all.
   </p>
   <p>
    She remained fruitlessly blowing and blowing, wondering how she could
   </p>
   <p>
    have so grown out of the art which had come by nature, till she became
   </p>
   <p>
    aware of a movement among the ivy-boughs which cloaked the garden-wall
   </p>
   <p>
    no less then the cottage. Looking that way she beheld a form springing
   </p>
   <p>
    from the coping to the plot. It was Alec d’Urberville, whom she had not
   </p>
   <p>
    set eyes on since he had conducted her the day before to the door of
   </p>
   <p>
    the gardener’s cottage where she had lodgings.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Upon my honour!” cried he, “there was never before such a beautiful
   </p>
   <p>
    thing in Nature or Art as you look, ‘Cousin’ Tess (‘Cousin’ had a faint
   </p>
   <p>
    ring of mockery). I have been watching you from over the wall—sitting
   </p>
   <p>
    like _Im_-patience on a monument, and pouting up that pretty red mouth
   </p>
   <p>
    to whistling shape, and whooing and whooing, and privately swearing,
   </p>
   <p>
    and never being able to produce a note. Why, you are quite cross
   </p>
   <p>
    because you can’t do it.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I may be cross, but I didn’t swear.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah! I understand why you are trying—those bullies! My mother wants you
   </p>
   <p>
    to carry on their musical education. How selfish of her! As if
   </p>
   <p>
    attending to these curst cocks and hens here were not enough work for
   </p>
   <p>
    any girl. I would flatly refuse, if I were you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But she wants me particularly to do it, and to be ready by to-morrow
   </p>
   <p>
    morning.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Does she? Well then—I’ll give you a lesson or two.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh no, you won’t!” said Tess, withdrawing towards the door.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Nonsense; I don’t want to touch you. See—I’ll stand on this side of
   </p>
   <p>
    the wire-netting, and you can keep on the other; so you may feel quite
   </p>
   <p>
    safe. Now, look here; you screw up your lips too harshly. There
   </p>
   <p>
    ’tis—so.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He suited the action to the word, and whistled a line of “Take, O take
   </p>
   <p>
    those lips away.” But the allusion was lost upon Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Now try,” said d’Urberville.
   </p>
   <p>
    She attempted to look reserved; her face put on a sculptural severity.
   </p>
   <p>
    But he persisted in his demand, and at last, to get rid of him, she did
   </p>
   <p>
    put up her lips as directed for producing a clear note; laughing
   </p>
   <p>
    distressfully, however, and then blushing with vexation that she had
   </p>
   <p>
    laughed.
   </p>
   <p>
    He encouraged her with “Try again!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess was quite serious, painfully serious by this time; and she
   </p>
   <p>
    tried—ultimately and unexpectedly emitting a real round sound. The
   </p>
   <p>
    momentary pleasure of success got the better of her; her eyes enlarged,
   </p>
   <p>
    and she involuntarily smiled in his face.
   </p>
   <p>
    “That’s it! Now I have started you—you’ll go on beautifully. There—I
   </p>
   <p>
    said I would not come near you; and, in spite of such temptation as
   </p>
   <p>
    never before fell to mortal man, I’ll keep my word.... Tess, do you
   </p>
   <p>
    think my mother a queer old soul?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t know much of her yet, sir.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You’ll find her so; she must be, to make you learn to whistle to her
   </p>
   <p>
    bullfinches. I am rather out of her books just now, but you will be
   </p>
   <p>
    quite in favour if you treat her live-stock well. Good morning. If you
   </p>
   <p>
    meet with any difficulties and want help here, don’t go to the bailiff,
   </p>
   <p>
    come to me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    It was in the economy of this _régime_ that Tess Durbeyfield had
   </p>
   <p>
    undertaken to fill a place. Her first day’s experiences were fairly
   </p>
   <p>
    typical of those which followed through many succeeding days. A
   </p>
   <p>
    familiarity with Alec d’Urberville’s presence—which that young man
   </p>
   <p>
    carefully cultivated in her by playful dialogue, and by jestingly
   </p>
   <p>
    calling her his cousin when they were alone—removed much of her
   </p>
   <p>
    original shyness of him, without, however, implanting any feeling which
   </p>
   <p>
    could engender shyness of a new and tenderer kind. But she was more
   </p>
   <p>
    pliable under his hands than a mere companionship would have made her,
   </p>
   <p>
    owing to her unavoidable dependence upon his mother, and, through that
   </p>
   <p>
    lady’s comparative helplessness, upon him.
   </p>
   <p>
    She soon found that whistling to the bullfinches in Mrs d’Urberville’s
   </p>
   <p>
    room was no such onerous business when she had regained the art, for
   </p>
   <p>
    she had caught from her musical mother numerous airs that suited those
   </p>
   <p>
    songsters admirably. A far more satisfactory time than when she
   </p>
   <p>
    practised in the garden was this whistling by the cages each morning.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unrestrained by the young man’s presence she threw up her mouth, put
   </p>
   <p>
    her lips near the bars, and piped away in easeful grace to the
   </p>
   <p>
    attentive listeners.
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs d’Urberville slept in a large four-post bedstead hung with heavy
   </p>
   <p>
    damask curtains, and the bullfinches occupied the same apartment, where
   </p>
   <p>
    they flitted about freely at certain hours, and made little white spots
   </p>
   <p>
    on the furniture and upholstery. Once while Tess was at the window
   </p>
   <p>
    where the cages were ranged, giving her lesson as usual, she thought
   </p>
   <p>
    she heard a rustling behind the bed. The old lady was not present, and
   </p>
   <p>
    turning round the girl had an impression that the toes of a pair of
   </p>
   <p>
    boots were visible below the fringe of the curtains. Thereupon her
   </p>
   <p>
    whistling became so disjointed that the listener, if such there were,
   </p>
   <p>
    must have discovered her suspicion of his presence. She searched the
   </p>
   <p>
    curtains every morning after that, but never found anybody within them.
   </p>
   <p>
    Alec d’Urberville had evidently thought better of his freak to terrify
   </p>
   <p>
    her by an ambush of that kind.
   </p>
   <p>
    X
   </p>
   <p>
    Every village has its idiosyncrasy, its constitution, often its own
   </p>
   <p>
    code of morality. The levity of some of the younger women in and about
   </p>
   <p>
    Trantridge was marked, and was perhaps symptomatic of the choice spirit
   </p>
   <p>
    who ruled The Slopes in that vicinity. The place had also a more
   </p>
   <p>
    abiding defect; it drank hard. The staple conversation on the farms
   </p>
   <p>
    around was on the uselessness of saving money; and smock-frocked
   </p>
   <p>
    arithmeticians, leaning on their ploughs or hoes, would enter into
   </p>
   <p>
    calculations of great nicety to prove that parish relief was a fuller
   </p>
   <p>
    provision for a man in his old age than any which could result from
   </p>
   <p>
    savings out of their wages during a whole lifetime.
   </p>
   <p>
    The chief pleasure of these philosophers lay in going every Saturday
   </p>
   <p>
    night, when work was done, to Chaseborough, a decayed market-town two
   </p>
   <p>
    or three miles distant; and, returning in the small hours of the next
   </p>
   <p>
    morning, to spend Sunday in sleeping off the dyspeptic effects of the
   </p>
   <p>
    curious compounds sold to them as beer by the monopolizers of the
   </p>
   <p>
    once-independent inns.
   </p>
   <p>
    For a long time Tess did not join in the weekly pilgrimages. But under
   </p>
   <p>
    pressure from matrons not much older than herself—for a field-man’s
   </p>
   <p>
    wages being as high at twenty-one as at forty, marriage was early
   </p>
   <p>
    here—Tess at length consented to go. Her first experience of the
   </p>
   <p>
    journey afforded her more enjoyment than she had expected, the
   </p>
   <p>
    hilariousness of the others being quite contagious after her monotonous
   </p>
   <p>
    attention to the poultry-farm all the week. She went again and again.
   </p>
   <p>
    Being graceful and interesting, standing moreover on the momentary
   </p>
   <p>
    threshold of womanhood, her appearance drew down upon her some sly
   </p>
   <p>
    regards from loungers in the streets of Chaseborough; hence, though
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes her journey to the town was made independently, she always
   </p>
   <p>
    searched for her fellows at nightfall, to have the protection of their
   </p>
   <p>
    companionship homeward.
   </p>
   <p>
    This had gone on for a month or two when there came a Saturday in
   </p>
   <p>
    September, on which a fair and a market coincided; and the pilgrims
   </p>
   <p>
    from Trantridge sought double delights at the inns on that account.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess’s occupations made her late in setting out, so that her comrades
   </p>
   <p>
    reached the town long before her. It was a fine September evening, just
   </p>
   <p>
    before sunset, when yellow lights struggle with blue shades in hairlike
   </p>
   <p>
    lines, and the atmosphere itself forms a prospect without aid from more
   </p>
   <p>
    solid objects, except the innumerable winged insects that dance in it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Through this low-lit mistiness Tess walked leisurely along.
   </p>
   <p>
    She did not discover the coincidence of the market with the fair till
   </p>
   <p>
    she had reached the place, by which time it was close upon dusk. Her
   </p>
   <p>
    limited marketing was soon completed; and then as usual she began to
   </p>
   <p>
    look about for some of the Trantridge cottagers.
   </p>
   <p>
    At first she could not find them, and she was informed that most of
   </p>
   <p>
    them had gone to what they called a private little jig at the house of
   </p>
   <p>
    a hay-trusser and peat-dealer who had transactions with their farm. He
   </p>
   <p>
    lived in an out-of-the-way nook of the townlet, and in trying to find
   </p>
   <p>
    her course thither her eyes fell upon Mr d’Urberville standing at a
   </p>
   <p>
    street corner.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What—my Beauty? You here so late?” he said.
   </p>
   <p>
    She told him that she was simply waiting for company homeward.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’ll see you again,” said he over her shoulder as she went on down the
   </p>
   <p>
    back lane.
   </p>
   <p>
    Approaching the hay-trussers, she could hear the fiddled notes of a
   </p>
   <p>
    reel proceeding from some building in the rear; but no sound of dancing
   </p>
   <p>
    was audible—an exceptional state of things for these parts, where as a
   </p>
   <p>
    rule the stamping drowned the music. The front door being open she
   </p>
   <p>
    could see straight through the house into the garden at the back as far
   </p>
   <p>
    as the shades of night would allow; and nobody appearing to her knock,
   </p>
   <p>
    she traversed the dwelling and went up the path to the outhouse whence
   </p>
   <p>
    the sound had attracted her.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was a windowless erection used for storage, and from the open door
   </p>
   <p>
    there floated into the obscurity a mist of yellow radiance, which at
   </p>
   <p>
    first Tess thought to be illuminated smoke. But on drawing nearer she
   </p>
   <p>
    perceived that it was a cloud of dust, lit by candles within the
   </p>
   <p>
    outhouse, whose beams upon the haze carried forward the outline of the
   </p>
   <p>
    doorway into the wide night of the garden.
   </p>
   <p>
    When she came close and looked in she beheld indistinct forms racing up
   </p>
   <p>
    and down to the figure of the dance, the silence of their footfalls
   </p>
   <p>
    arising from their being overshoe in “scroff”—that is to say, the
   </p>
   <p>
    powdery residuum from the storage of peat and other products, the
   </p>
   <p>
    stirring of which by their turbulent feet created the nebulosity that
   </p>
   <p>
    involved the scene. Through this floating, fusty _débris_ of peat and
   </p>
   <p>
    hay, mixed with the perspirations and warmth of the dancers, and
   </p>
   <p>
    forming together a sort of vegeto-human pollen, the muted fiddles
   </p>
   <p>
    feebly pushed their notes, in marked contrast to the spirit with which
   </p>
   <p>
    the measure was trodden out. They coughed as they danced, and laughed
   </p>
   <p>
    as they coughed. Of the rushing couples there could barely be discerned
   </p>
   <p>
    more than the high lights—the indistinctness shaping them to satyrs
   </p>
   <p>
    clasping nymphs—a multiplicity of Pans whirling a multiplicity of
   </p>
   <p>
    Syrinxes; Lotis attempting to elude Priapus, and always failing.
   </p>
   <p>
    At intervals a couple would approach the doorway for air, and the haze
   </p>
   <p>
    no longer veiling their features, the demigods resolved themselves into
   </p>
   <p>
    the homely personalities of her own next-door neighbours. Could
   </p>
   <p>
    Trantridge in two or three short hours have metamorphosed itself thus
   </p>
   <p>
    madly!
   </p>
   <p>
    Some Sileni of the throng sat on benches and hay-trusses by the wall;
   </p>
   <p>
    and one of them recognized her.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The maids don’t think it respectable to dance at The Flower-de-Luce,”
   </p>
   <p>
    he explained. “They don’t like to let everybody see which be their
   </p>
   <p>
    fancy-men. Besides, the house sometimes shuts up just when their jints
   </p>
   <p>
    begin to get greased. So we come here and send out for liquor.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But when be any of you going home?” asked Tess with some anxiety.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Now—a’most directly. This is all but the last jig.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She waited. The reel drew to a close, and some of the party were in the
   </p>
   <p>
    mind of starting. But others would not, and another dance was formed.
   </p>
   <p>
    This surely would end it, thought Tess. But it merged in yet another.
   </p>
   <p>
    She became restless and uneasy; yet, having waited so long, it was
   </p>
   <p>
    necessary to wait longer; on account of the fair the roads were dotted
   </p>
   <p>
    with roving characters of possibly ill intent; and, though not fearful
   </p>
   <p>
    of measurable dangers, she feared the unknown. Had she been near
   </p>
   <p>
    Marlott she would have had less dread.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Don’t ye be nervous, my dear good soul,” expostulated, between his
   </p>
   <p>
    coughs, a young man with a wet face and his straw hat so far back upon
   </p>
   <p>
    his head that the brim encircled it like the nimbus of a saint. “What’s
   </p>
   <p>
    yer hurry? To-morrow is Sunday, thank God, and we can sleep it off in
   </p>
   <p>
    church-time. Now, have a turn with me?”
   </p>
   <p>
    She did not abhor dancing, but she was not going to dance here. The
   </p>
   <p>
    movement grew more passionate: the fiddlers behind the luminous pillar
   </p>
   <p>
    of cloud now and then varied the air by playing on the wrong side of
   </p>
   <p>
    the bridge or with the back of the bow. But it did not matter; the
   </p>
   <p>
    panting shapes spun onwards.
   </p>
   <p>
    They did not vary their partners if their inclination were to stick to
   </p>
   <p>
    previous ones. Changing partners simply meant that a satisfactory
   </p>
   <p>
    choice had not as yet been arrived at by one or other of the pair, and
   </p>
   <p>
    by this time every couple had been suitably matched. It was then that
   </p>
   <p>
    the ecstasy and the dream began, in which emotion was the matter of the
   </p>
   <p>
    universe, and matter but an adventitious intrusion likely to hinder you
   </p>
   <p>
    from spinning where you wanted to spin.
   </p>
   <p>
    Suddenly there was a dull thump on the ground: a couple had fallen, and
   </p>
   <p>
    lay in a mixed heap. The next couple, unable to check its progress,
   </p>
   <p>
    came toppling over the obstacle. An inner cloud of dust rose around the
   </p>
   <p>
    prostrate figures amid the general one of the room, in which a
   </p>
   <p>
    twitching entanglement of arms and legs was discernible.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You shall catch it for this, my gentleman, when you get home!” burst
   </p>
   <p>
    in female accents from the human heap—those of the unhappy partner of
   </p>
   <p>
    the man whose clumsiness had caused the mishap; she happened also to be
   </p>
   <p>
    his recently married wife, in which assortment there was nothing
   </p>
   <p>
    unusual at Trantridge as long as any affection remained between wedded
   </p>
   <p>
    couples; and, indeed, it was not uncustomary in their later lives, to
   </p>
   <p>
    avoid making odd lots of the single people between whom there might be
   </p>
   <p>
    a warm understanding.
   </p>
   <p>
    A loud laugh from behind Tess’s back, in the shade of the garden,
   </p>
   <p>
    united with the titter within the room. She looked round, and saw the
   </p>
   <p>
    red coal of a cigar: Alec d’Urberville was standing there alone. He
   </p>
   <p>
    beckoned to her, and she reluctantly retreated towards him.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, my Beauty, what are you doing here?”
   </p>
   <p>
    She was so tired after her long day and her walk that she confided her
   </p>
   <p>
    trouble to him—that she had been waiting ever since he saw her to have
   </p>
   <p>
    their company home, because the road at night was strange to her. “But
   </p>
   <p>
    it seems they will never leave off, and I really think I will wait no
   </p>
   <p>
    longer.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Certainly do not. I have only a saddle-horse here to-day; but come to
   </p>
   <p>
    The Flower-de-Luce, and I’ll hire a trap, and drive you home with me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess, though flattered, had never quite got over her original mistrust
   </p>
   <p>
    of him, and, despite their tardiness, she preferred to walk home with
   </p>
   <p>
    the work-folk. So she answered that she was much obliged to him, but
   </p>
   <p>
    would not trouble him. “I have said that I will wait for ’em, and they
   </p>
   <p>
    will expect me to now.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Very well, Miss Independence. Please yourself... Then I shall not
   </p>
   <p>
    hurry... My good Lord, what a kick-up they are having there!”
   </p>
   <p>
    He had not put himself forward into the light, but some of them had
   </p>
   <p>
    perceived him, and his presence led to a slight pause and a
   </p>
   <p>
    consideration of how the time was flying. As soon as he had re-lit a
   </p>
   <p>
    cigar and walked away the Trantridge people began to collect themselves
   </p>
   <p>
    from amid those who had come in from other farms, and prepared to leave
   </p>
   <p>
    in a body. Their bundles and baskets were gathered up, and half an hour
   </p>
   <p>
    later, when the clock-chime sounded a quarter past eleven, they were
   </p>
   <p>
    straggling along the lane which led up the hill towards their homes.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was a three-mile walk, along a dry white road, made whiter to-night
   </p>
   <p>
    by the light of the moon.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess soon perceived as she walked in the flock, sometimes with this
   </p>
   <p>
    one, sometimes with that, that the fresh night air was producing
   </p>
   <p>
    staggerings and serpentine courses among the men who had partaken too
   </p>
   <p>
    freely; some of the more careless women also were wandering in their
   </p>
   <p>
    gait—to wit, a dark virago, Car Darch, dubbed Queen of Spades, till
   </p>
   <p>
    lately a favourite of d’Urberville’s; Nancy, her sister, nicknamed the
   </p>
   <p>
    Queen of Diamonds; and the young married woman who had already tumbled
   </p>
   <p>
    down. Yet however terrestrial and lumpy their appearance just now to
   </p>
   <p>
    the mean unglamoured eye, to themselves the case was different. They
   </p>
   <p>
    followed the road with a sensation that they were soaring along in a
   </p>
   <p>
    supporting medium, possessed of original and profound thoughts,
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves and surrounding nature forming an organism of which all the
   </p>
   <p>
    parts harmoniously and joyously interpenetrated each other. They were
   </p>
   <p>
    as sublime as the moon and stars above them, and the moon and stars
   </p>
   <p>
    were as ardent as they.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess, however, had undergone such painful experiences of this kind in
   </p>
   <p>
    her father’s house that the discovery of their condition spoilt the
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasure she was beginning to feel in the moonlight journey. Yet she
   </p>
   <p>
    stuck to the party, for reasons above given.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the open highway they had progressed in scattered order; but now
   </p>
   <p>
    their route was through a field-gate, and the foremost finding a
   </p>
   <p>
    difficulty in opening it, they closed up together.
   </p>
   <p>
    This leading pedestrian was Car the Queen of Spades, who carried a
   </p>
   <p>
    wicker-basket containing her mother’s groceries, her own draperies, and
   </p>
   <p>
    other purchases for the week. The basket being large and heavy, Car had
   </p>
   <p>
    placed it for convenience of porterage on the top of her head, where it
   </p>
   <p>
    rode on in jeopardized balance as she walked with arms akimbo.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well—whatever is that a-creeping down thy back, Car Darch?” said one
   </p>
   <p>
    of the group suddenly.
   </p>
   <p>
    All looked at Car. Her gown was a light cotton print, and from the back
   </p>
   <p>
    of her head a kind of rope could be seen descending to some distance
   </p>
   <p>
    below her waist, like a Chinaman’s queue.
   </p>
   <p>
    “’Tis her hair falling down,” said another.
   </p>
   <p>
    No; it was not her hair: it was a black stream of something oozing from
   </p>
   <p>
    her basket, and it glistened like a slimy snake in the cold still rays
   </p>
   <p>
    of the moon.
   </p>
   <p>
    “’Tis treacle,” said an observant matron.
   </p>
   <p>
    Treacle it was. Car’s poor old grandmother had a weakness for the sweet
   </p>
   <p>
    stuff. Honey she had in plenty out of her own hives, but treacle was
   </p>
   <p>
    what her soul desired, and Car had been about to give her a treat of
   </p>
   <p>
    surprise. Hastily lowering the basket the dark girl found that the
   </p>
   <p>
    vessel containing the syrup had been smashed within.
   </p>
   <p>
    By this time there had arisen a shout of laughter at the extraordinary
   </p>
   <p>
    appearance of Car’s back, which irritated the dark queen into getting
   </p>
   <p>
    rid of the disfigurement by the first sudden means available, and
   </p>
   <p>
    independently of the help of the scoffers. She rushed excitedly into
   </p>
   <p>
    the field they were about to cross, and flinging herself flat on her
   </p>
   <p>
    back upon the grass, began to wipe her gown as well as she could by
   </p>
   <p>
    spinning horizontally on the herbage and dragging herself over it upon
   </p>
   <p>
    her elbows.
   </p>
   <p>
    The laughter rang louder; they clung to the gate, to the posts, rested
   </p>
   <p>
    on their staves, in the weakness engendered by their convulsions at the
   </p>
   <p>
    spectacle of Car. Our heroine, who had hitherto held her peace, at this
   </p>
   <p>
    wild moment could not help joining in with the rest.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was a misfortune—in more ways than one. No sooner did the dark queen
   </p>
   <p>
    hear the soberer richer note of Tess among those of the other
   </p>
   <p>
    work-people than a long-smouldering sense of rivalry inflamed her to
   </p>
   <p>
    madness. She sprang to her feet and closely faced the object of her
   </p>
   <p>
    dislike.
   </p>
   <p>
    “How darest th’ laugh at me, hussy!” she cried.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I couldn’t really help it when t’others did,” apologized Tess, still
   </p>
   <p>
    tittering.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah, th’st think th’ beest everybody, dostn’t, because th’ beest first
   </p>
   <p>
    favourite with He just now! But stop a bit, my lady, stop a bit! I’m as
   </p>
   <p>
    good as two of such! Look here—here’s at ’ee!”
   </p>
   <p>
    To Tess’s horror the dark queen began stripping off the bodice of her
   </p>
   <p>
    gown—which for the added reason of its ridiculed condition she was only
   </p>
   <p>
    too glad to be free of—till she had bared her plump neck, shoulders,
   </p>
   <p>
    and arms to the moonshine, under which they looked as luminous and
   </p>
   <p>
    beautiful as some Praxitelean creation, in their possession of the
   </p>
   <p>
    faultless rotundities of a lusty country-girl. She closed her fists and
   </p>
   <p>
    squared up at Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Indeed, then, I shall not fight!” said the latter majestically; “and
   </p>
   <p>
    if I had known you was of that sort, I wouldn’t have so let myself down
   </p>
   <p>
    as to come with such a whorage as this is!”
   </p>
   <p>
    The rather too inclusive speech brought down a torrent of vituperation
   </p>
   <p>
    from other quarters upon fair Tess’s unlucky head, particularly from
   </p>
   <p>
    the Queen of Diamonds, who having stood in the relations to
   </p>
   <p>
    d’Urberville that Car had also been suspected of, united with the
   </p>
   <p>
    latter against the common enemy. Several other women also chimed in,
   </p>
   <p>
    with an animus which none of them would have been so fatuous as to show
   </p>
   <p>
    but for the rollicking evening they had passed. Thereupon, finding Tess
   </p>
   <p>
    unfairly browbeaten, the husbands and lovers tried to make peace by
   </p>
   <p>
    defending her; but the result of that attempt was directly to increase
   </p>
   <p>
    the war.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess was indignant and ashamed. She no longer minded the loneliness of
   </p>
   <p>
    the way and the lateness of the hour; her one object was to get away
   </p>
   <p>
    from the whole crew as soon as possible. She knew well enough that the
   </p>
   <p>
    better among them would repent of their passion next day. They were all
   </p>
   <p>
    now inside the field, and she was edging back to rush off alone when a
   </p>
   <p>
    horseman emerged almost silently from the corner of the hedge that
   </p>
   <p>
    screened the road, and Alec d’Urberville looked round upon them.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What the devil is all this row about, work-folk?” he asked.
   </p>
   <p>
    The explanation was not readily forthcoming; and, in truth, he did not
   </p>
   <p>
    require any. Having heard their voices while yet some way off he had
   </p>
   <p>
    ridden creepingly forward, and learnt enough to satisfy himself.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess was standing apart from the rest, near the gate. He bent over
   </p>
   <p>
    towards her. “Jump up behind me,” he whispered, “and we’ll get shot of
   </p>
   <p>
    the screaming cats in a jiffy!”
   </p>
   <p>
    She felt almost ready to faint, so vivid was her sense of the crisis.
   </p>
   <p>
    At almost any other moment of her life she would have refused such
   </p>
   <p>
    proffered aid and company, as she had refused them several times
   </p>
   <p>
    before; and now the loneliness would not of itself have forced her to
   </p>
   <p>
    do otherwise. But coming as the invitation did at the particular
   </p>
   <p>
    juncture when fear and indignation at these adversaries could be
   </p>
   <p>
    transformed by a spring of the foot into a triumph over them, she
   </p>
   <p>
    abandoned herself to her impulse, climbed the gate, put her toe upon
   </p>
   <p>
    his instep, and scrambled into the saddle behind him. The pair were
   </p>
   <p>
    speeding away into the distant gray by the time that the contentious
   </p>
   <p>
    revellers became aware of what had happened.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Queen of Spades forgot the stain on her bodice, and stood beside
   </p>
   <p>
    the Queen of Diamonds and the new-married, staggering young woman—all
   </p>
   <p>
    with a gaze of fixity in the direction in which the horse’s tramp was
   </p>
   <p>
    diminishing into silence on the road.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What be ye looking at?” asked a man who had not observed the incident.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ho-ho-ho!” laughed dark Car.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Hee-hee-hee!” laughed the tippling bride, as she steadied herself on
   </p>
   <p>
    the arm of her fond husband.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Heu-heu-heu!” laughed dark Car’s mother, stroking her moustache as she
   </p>
   <p>
    explained laconically: “Out of the frying-pan into the fire!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Then these children of the open air, whom even excess of alcohol could
   </p>
   <p>
    scarce injure permanently, betook themselves to the field-path; and as
   </p>
   <p>
    they went there moved onward with them, around the shadow of each one’s
   </p>
   <p>
    head, a circle of opalized light, formed by the moon’s rays upon the
   </p>
   <p>
    glistening sheet of dew. Each pedestrian could see no halo but his or
   </p>
   <p>
    her own, which never deserted the head-shadow, whatever its vulgar
   </p>
   <p>
    unsteadiness might be; but adhered to it, and persistently beautified
   </p>
   <p>
    it; till the erratic motions seemed an inherent part of the
   </p>
   <p>
    irradiation, and the fumes of their breathing a component of the
   </p>
   <p>
    night’s mist; and the spirit of the scene, and of the moonlight, and of
   </p>
   <p>
    Nature, seemed harmoniously to mingle with the spirit of wine.
   </p>
   <p>
    XI
   </p>
   <p>
    The twain cantered along for some time without speech, Tess as she
   </p>
   <p>
    clung to him still panting in her triumph, yet in other respects
   </p>
   <p>
    dubious. She had perceived that the horse was not the spirited one he
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes rose, and felt no alarm on that score, though her seat was
   </p>
   <p>
    precarious enough despite her tight hold of him. She begged him to slow
   </p>
   <p>
    the animal to a walk, which Alec accordingly did.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Neatly done, was it not, dear Tess?” he said by and by.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes!” said she. “I am sure I ought to be much obliged to you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And are you?”
   </p>
   <p>
    She did not reply.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tess, why do you always dislike my kissing you?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I suppose—because I don’t love you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You are quite sure?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am angry with you sometimes!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah, I half feared as much.” Nevertheless, Alec did not object to that
   </p>
   <p>
    confession. He knew that anything was better then frigidity. “Why
   </p>
   <p>
    haven’t you told me when I have made you angry?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You know very well why. Because I cannot help myself here.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I haven’t offended you often by love-making?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You have sometimes.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “How many times?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You know as well as I—too many times.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Every time I have tried?”
   </p>
   <p>
    She was silent, and the horse ambled along for a considerable distance,
   </p>
   <p>
    till a faint luminous fog, which had hung in the hollows all the
   </p>
   <p>
    evening, became general and enveloped them. It seemed to hold the
   </p>
   <p>
    moonlight in suspension, rendering it more pervasive than in clear air.
   </p>
   <p>
    Whether on this account, or from absent-mindedness, or from sleepiness,
   </p>
   <p>
    she did not perceive that they had long ago passed the point at which
   </p>
   <p>
    the lane to Trantridge branched from the highway, and that her
   </p>
   <p>
    conductor had not taken the Trantridge track.
   </p>
   <p>
    She was inexpressibly weary. She had risen at five o’clock every
   </p>
   <p>
    morning of that week, had been on foot the whole of each day, and on
   </p>
   <p>
    this evening had in addition walked the three miles to Chaseborough,
   </p>
   <p>
    waited three hours for her neighbours without eating or drinking, her
   </p>
   <p>
    impatience to start them preventing either; she had then walked a mile
   </p>
   <p>
    of the way home, and had undergone the excitement of the quarrel, till,
   </p>
   <p>
    with the slow progress of their steed, it was now nearly one o’clock.
   </p>
   <p>
    Only once, however, was she overcome by actual drowsiness. In that
   </p>
   <p>
    moment of oblivion her head sank gently against him.
   </p>
   <p>
    D’Urberville stopped the horse, withdrew his feet from the stirrups,
   </p>
   <p>
    turned sideways on the saddle, and enclosed her waist with his arm to
   </p>
   <p>
    support her.
   </p>
   <p>
    This immediately put her on the defensive, and with one of those sudden
   </p>
   <p>
    impulses of reprisal to which she was liable she gave him a little push
   </p>
   <p>
    from her. In his ticklish position he nearly lost his balance and only
   </p>
   <p>
    just avoided rolling over into the road, the horse, though a powerful
   </p>
   <p>
    one, being fortunately the quietest he rode.
   </p>
   <p>
    “That is devilish unkind!” he said. “I mean no harm—only to keep you
   </p>
   <p>
    from falling.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She pondered suspiciously, till, thinking that this might after all be
   </p>
   <p>
    true, she relented, and said quite humbly, “I beg your pardon, sir.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I won’t pardon you unless you show some confidence in me. Good God!”
   </p>
   <p>
    he burst out, “what am I, to be repulsed so by a mere chit like you?
   </p>
   <p>
    For near three mortal months have you trifled with my feelings, eluded
   </p>
   <p>
    me, and snubbed me; and I won’t stand it!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’ll leave you to-morrow, sir.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No, you will not leave me to-morrow! Will you, I ask once more, show
   </p>
   <p>
    your belief in me by letting me clasp you with my arm? Come, between us
   </p>
   <p>
    two and nobody else, now. We know each other well; and you know that I
   </p>
   <p>
    love you, and think you the prettiest girl in the world, which you are.
   </p>
   <p>
    Mayn’t I treat you as a lover?”
   </p>
   <p>
    She drew a quick pettish breath of objection, writhing uneasily on her
   </p>
   <p>
    seat, looked far ahead, and murmured, “I don’t know—I wish—how can I
   </p>
   <p>
    say yes or no when—”
   </p>
   <p>
    He settled the matter by clasping his arm round her as he desired, and
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess expressed no further negative. Thus they sidled slowly onward till
   </p>
   <p>
    it struck her they had been advancing for an unconscionable time—far
   </p>
   <p>
    longer than was usually occupied by the short journey from
   </p>
   <p>
    Chaseborough, even at this walking pace, and that they were no longer
   </p>
   <p>
    on hard road, but in a mere trackway.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why, where be we?” she exclaimed.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Passing by a wood.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “A wood—what wood? Surely we are quite out of the road?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “A bit of The Chase—the oldest wood in England. It is a lovely night,
   </p>
   <p>
    and why should we not prolong our ride a little?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “How could you be so treacherous!” said Tess, between archness and real
   </p>
   <p>
    dismay, and getting rid of his arm by pulling open his fingers one by
   </p>
   <p>
    one, though at the risk of slipping off herself. “Just when I’ve been
   </p>
   <p>
    putting such trust in you, and obliging you to please you, because I
   </p>
   <p>
    thought I had wronged you by that push! Please set me down, and let me
   </p>
   <p>
    walk home.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You cannot walk home, darling, even if the air were clear. We are
   </p>
   <p>
    miles away from Trantridge, if I must tell you, and in this growing fog
   </p>
   <p>
    you might wander for hours among these trees.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Never mind that,” she coaxed. “Put me down, I beg you. I don’t mind
   </p>
   <p>
    where it is; only let me get down, sir, please!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Very well, then, I will—on one condition. Having brought you here to
   </p>
   <p>
    this out-of-the-way place, I feel myself responsible for your
   </p>
   <p>
    safe-conduct home, whatever you may yourself feel about it. As to your
   </p>
   <p>
    getting to Trantridge without assistance, it is quite impossible; for,
   </p>
   <p>
    to tell the truth, dear, owing to this fog, which so disguises
   </p>
   <p>
    everything, I don’t quite know where we are myself. Now, if you will
   </p>
   <p>
    promise to wait beside the horse while I walk through the bushes till I
   </p>
   <p>
    come to some road or house, and ascertain exactly our whereabouts, I’ll
   </p>
   <p>
    deposit you here willingly. When I come back I’ll give you full
   </p>
   <p>
    directions, and if you insist upon walking you may; or you may ride—at
   </p>
   <p>
    your pleasure.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She accepted these terms, and slid off on the near side, though not
   </p>
   <p>
    till he had stolen a cursory kiss. He sprang down on the other side.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I suppose I must hold the horse?” said she.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh no; it’s not necessary,” replied Alec, patting the panting
   </p>
   <p>
    creature. “He’s had enough of it for to-night.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He turned the horse’s head into the bushes, hitched him on to a bough,
   </p>
   <p>
    and made a sort of couch or nest for her in the deep mass of dead
   </p>
   <p>
    leaves.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Now, you sit there,” he said. “The leaves have not got damp as yet.
   </p>
   <p>
    Just give an eye to the horse—it will be quite sufficient.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He took a few steps away from her, but, returning, said, “By the bye,
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess, your father has a new cob to-day. Somebody gave it to him.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Somebody? You!”
   </p>
   <p>
    D’Urberville nodded.
   </p>
   <p>
    “O how very good of you that is!” she exclaimed, with a painful sense
   </p>
   <p>
    of the awkwardness of having to thank him just then.
   </p>
   <p>
    “And the children have some toys.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I didn’t know—you ever sent them anything!” she murmured, much moved.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I almost wish you had not—yes, I almost wish it!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why, dear?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It—hampers me so.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tessy—don’t you love me ever so little now?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’m grateful,” she reluctantly admitted. “But I fear I do not—” The
   </p>
   <p>
    sudden vision of his passion for herself as a factor in this result so
   </p>
   <p>
    distressed her that, beginning with one slow tear, and then following
   </p>
   <p>
    with another, she wept outright.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Don’t cry, dear, dear one! Now sit down here, and wait till I come.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She passively sat down amid the leaves he had heaped, and shivered
   </p>
   <p>
    slightly. “Are you cold?” he asked.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Not very—a little.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He touched her with his fingers, which sank into her as into down. “You
   </p>
   <p>
    have only that puffy muslin dress on—how’s that?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It’s my best summer one. ’Twas very warm when I started, and I didn’t
   </p>
   <p>
    know I was going to ride, and that it would be night.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Nights grow chilly in September. Let me see.” He pulled off a light
   </p>
   <p>
    overcoat that he had worn, and put it round her tenderly. “That’s
   </p>
   <p>
    it—now you’ll feel warmer,” he continued. “Now, my pretty, rest there;
   </p>
   <p>
    I shall soon be back again.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Having buttoned the overcoat round her shoulders he plunged into the
   </p>
   <p>
    webs of vapour which by this time formed veils between the trees. She
   </p>
   <p>
    could hear the rustling of the branches as he ascended the adjoining
   </p>
   <p>
    slope, till his movements were no louder than the hopping of a bird,
   </p>
   <p>
    and finally died away. With the setting of the moon the pale light
   </p>
   <p>
    lessened, and Tess became invisible as she fell into reverie upon the
   </p>
   <p>
    leaves where he had left her.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the meantime Alec d’Urberville had pushed on up the slope to clear
   </p>
   <p>
    his genuine doubt as to the quarter of The Chase they were in. He had,
   </p>
   <p>
    in fact, ridden quite at random for over an hour, taking any turning
   </p>
   <p>
    that came to hand in order to prolong companionship with her, and
   </p>
   <p>
    giving far more attention to Tess’s moonlit person than to any wayside
   </p>
   <p>
    object. A little rest for the jaded animal being desirable, he did not
   </p>
   <p>
    hasten his search for landmarks. A clamber over the hill into the
   </p>
   <p>
    adjoining vale brought him to the fence of a highway whose contours he
   </p>
   <p>
    recognized, which settled the question of their whereabouts.
   </p>
   <p>
    D’Urberville thereupon turned back; but by this time the moon had quite
   </p>
   <p>
    gone down, and partly on account of the fog The Chase was wrapped in
   </p>
   <p>
    thick darkness, although morning was not far off. He was obliged to
   </p>
   <p>
    advance with outstretched hands to avoid contact with the boughs, and
   </p>
   <p>
    discovered that to hit the exact spot from which he had started was at
   </p>
   <p>
    first entirely beyond him. Roaming up and down, round and round, he at
   </p>
   <p>
    length heard a slight movement of the horse close at hand; and the
   </p>
   <p>
    sleeve of his overcoat unexpectedly caught his foot.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tess!” said d’Urberville.
   </p>
   <p>
    There was no answer. The obscurity was now so great that he could see
   </p>
   <p>
    absolutely nothing but a pale nebulousness at his feet, which
   </p>
   <p>
    represented the white muslin figure he had left upon the dead leaves.
   </p>
   <p>
    Everything else was blackness alike. D’Urberville stooped; and heard a
   </p>
   <p>
    gentle regular breathing. He knelt and bent lower, till her breath
   </p>
   <p>
    warmed his face, and in a moment his cheek was in contact with hers.
   </p>
   <p>
    She was sleeping soundly, and upon her eyelashes there lingered tears.
   </p>
   <p>
    Darkness and silence ruled everywhere around. Above them rose the
   </p>
   <p>
    primaeval yews and oaks of The Chase, in which there poised gentle
   </p>
   <p>
    roosting birds in their last nap; and about them stole the hopping
   </p>
   <p>
    rabbits and hares. But, might some say, where was Tess’s guardian
   </p>
   <p>
    angel? where was the providence of her simple faith? Perhaps, like that
   </p>
   <p>
    other god of whom the ironical Tishbite spoke, he was talking, or he
   </p>
   <p>
    was pursuing, or he was in a journey, or he was sleeping and not to be
   </p>
   <p>
    awaked.
   </p>
   <p>
    Why it was that upon this beautiful feminine tissue, sensitive as
   </p>
   <p>
    gossamer, and practically blank as snow as yet, there should have been
   </p>
   <p>
    traced such a coarse pattern as it was doomed to receive; why so often
   </p>
   <p>
    the coarse appropriates the finer thus, the wrong man the woman, the
   </p>
   <p>
    wrong woman the man, many thousand years of analytical philosophy have
   </p>
   <p>
    failed to explain to our sense of order. One may, indeed, admit the
   </p>
   <p>
    possibility of a retribution lurking in the present catastrophe.
   </p>
   <p>
    Doubtless some of Tess d’Urberville’s mailed ancestors rollicking home
   </p>
   <p>
    from a fray had dealt the same measure even more ruthlessly towards
   </p>
   <p>
    peasant girls of their time. But though to visit the sins of the
   </p>
   <p>
    fathers upon the children may be a morality good enough for divinities,
   </p>
   <p>
    it is scorned by average human nature; and it therefore does not mend
   </p>
   <p>
    the matter.
   </p>
   <p>
    As Tess’s own people down in those retreats are never tired of saying
   </p>
   <p>
    among each other in their fatalistic way: “It was to be.” There lay the
   </p>
   <p>
    pity of it. An immeasurable social chasm was to divide our heroine’s
   </p>
   <p>
    personality thereafter from that previous self of hers who stepped from
   </p>
   <p>
    her mother’s door to try her fortune at Trantridge poultry-farm.
   </p>
   <p>
    End of Phase the First
   </p>
   <p>
    Phase the Second:
   </p>
   <p>
    Maiden No More
   </p>
   <p>
    XII
   </p>
   <p>
    The basket was heavy and the bundle was large, but she lugged them
   </p>
   <p>
    along like a person who did not find her especial burden in material
   </p>
   <p>
    things. Occasionally she stopped to rest in a mechanical way by some
   </p>
   <p>
    gate or post; and then, giving the baggage another hitch upon her full
   </p>
   <p>
    round arm, went steadily on again.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was a Sunday morning in late October, about four months after Tess
   </p>
   <p>
    Durbeyfield’s arrival at Trantridge, and some few weeks subsequent to
   </p>
   <p>
    the night ride in The Chase. The time was not long past daybreak, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the yellow luminosity upon the horizon behind her back lighted the
   </p>
   <p>
    ridge towards which her face was set—the barrier of the vale wherein
   </p>
   <p>
    she had of late been a stranger—which she would have to climb over to
   </p>
   <p>
    reach her birthplace. The ascent was gradual on this side, and the soil
   </p>
   <p>
    and scenery differed much from those within Blakemore Vale. Even the
   </p>
   <p>
    character and accent of the two peoples had shades of difference,
   </p>
   <p>
    despite the amalgamating effects of a roundabout railway; so that,
   </p>
   <p>
    though less than twenty miles from the place of her sojourn at
   </p>
   <p>
    Trantridge, her native village had seemed a far-away spot. The
   </p>
   <p>
    field-folk shut in there traded northward and westward, travelled,
   </p>
   <p>
    courted, and married northward and westward, thought northward and
   </p>
   <p>
    westward; those on this side mainly directed their energies and
   </p>
   <p>
    attention to the east and south.
   </p>
   <p>
    The incline was the same down which d’Urberville had driven her so
   </p>
   <p>
    wildly on that day in June. Tess went up the remainder of its length
   </p>
   <p>
    without stopping, and on reaching the edge of the escarpment gazed over
   </p>
   <p>
    the familiar green world beyond, now half-veiled in mist. It was always
   </p>
   <p>
    beautiful from here; it was terribly beautiful to Tess to-day, for
   </p>
   <p>
    since her eyes last fell upon it she had learnt that the serpent hisses
   </p>
   <p>
    where the sweet birds sing, and her views of life had been totally
   </p>
   <p>
    changed for her by the lesson. Verily another girl than the simple one
   </p>
   <p>
    she had been at home was she who, bowed by thought, stood still here,
   </p>
   <p>
    and turned to look behind her. She could not bear to look forward into
   </p>
   <p>
    the Vale.
   </p>
   <p>
    Ascending by the long white road that Tess herself had just laboured
   </p>
   <p>
    up, she saw a two-wheeled vehicle, beside which walked a man, who held
   </p>
   <p>
    up his hand to attract her attention.
   </p>
   <p>
    She obeyed the signal to wait for him with unspeculative repose, and in
   </p>
   <p>
    a few minutes man and horse stopped beside her.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why did you slip away by stealth like this?” said d’Urberville, with
   </p>
   <p>
    upbraiding breathlessness; “on a Sunday morning, too, when people were
   </p>
   <p>
    all in bed! I only discovered it by accident, and I have been driving
   </p>
   <p>
    like the deuce to overtake you. Just look at the mare. Why go off like
   </p>
   <p>
    this? You know that nobody wished to hinder your going. And how
   </p>
   <p>
    unnecessary it has been for you to toil along on foot, and encumber
   </p>
   <p>
    yourself with this heavy load! I have followed like a madman, simply to
   </p>
   <p>
    drive you the rest of the distance, if you won’t come back.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I shan’t come back,” said she.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I thought you wouldn’t—I said so! Well, then, put up your basket, and
   </p>
   <p>
    let me help you on.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She listlessly placed her basket and bundle within the dog-cart, and
   </p>
   <p>
    stepped up, and they sat side by side. She had no fear of him now, and
   </p>
   <p>
    in the cause of her confidence her sorrow lay.
   </p>
   <p>
    D’Urberville mechanically lit a cigar, and the journey was continued
   </p>
   <p>
    with broken unemotional conversation on the commonplace objects by the
   </p>
   <p>
    wayside. He had quite forgotten his struggle to kiss her when, in the
   </p>
   <p>
    early summer, they had driven in the opposite direction along the same
   </p>
   <p>
    road. But she had not, and she sat now, like a puppet, replying to his
   </p>
   <p>
    remarks in monosyllables. After some miles they came in view of the
   </p>
   <p>
    clump of trees beyond which the village of Marlott stood. It was only
   </p>
   <p>
    then that her still face showed the least emotion, a tear or two
   </p>
   <p>
    beginning to trickle down.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What are you crying for?” he coldly asked.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I was only thinking that I was born over there,” murmured Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well—we must all be born somewhere.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I wish I had never been born—there or anywhere else!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Pooh! Well, if you didn’t wish to come to Trantridge why did you
   </p>
   <p>
    come?”
   </p>
   <p>
    She did not reply.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You didn’t come for love of me, that I’ll swear.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “’Tis quite true. If I had gone for love o’ you, if I had ever
   </p>
   <p>
    sincerely loved you, if I loved you still, I should not so loathe and
   </p>
   <p>
    hate myself for my weakness as I do now!... My eyes were dazed by you
   </p>
   <p>
    for a little, and that was all.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He shrugged his shoulders. She resumed—
   </p>
   <p>
    “I didn’t understand your meaning till it was too late.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “That’s what every woman says.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “How can you dare to use such words!” she cried, turning impetuously
   </p>
   <p>
    upon him, her eyes flashing as the latent spirit (of which he was to
   </p>
   <p>
    see more some day) awoke in her. “My God! I could knock you out of the
   </p>
   <p>
    gig! Did it never strike your mind that what every woman says some
   </p>
   <p>
    women may feel?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Very well,” he said, laughing; “I am sorry to wound you. I did wrong—I
   </p>
   <p>
    admit it.” He dropped into some little bitterness as he continued:
   </p>
   <p>
    “Only you needn’t be so everlastingly flinging it in my face. I am
   </p>
   <p>
    ready to pay to the uttermost farthing. You know you need not work in
   </p>
   <p>
    the fields or the dairies again. You know you may clothe yourself with
   </p>
   <p>
    the best, instead of in the bald plain way you have lately affected, as
   </p>
   <p>
    if you couldn’t get a ribbon more than you earn.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Her lip lifted slightly, though there was little scorn, as a rule, in
   </p>
   <p>
    her large and impulsive nature.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I have said I will not take anything more from you, and I will not—I
   </p>
   <p>
    cannot! I _should_ be your creature to go on doing that, and I won’t!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “One would think you were a princess from your manner, in addition to a
   </p>
   <p>
    true and original d’Urberville—ha! ha! Well, Tess, dear, I can say no
   </p>
   <p>
    more. I suppose I am a bad fellow—a damn bad fellow. I was born bad,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I have lived bad, and I shall die bad in all probability. But, upon
   </p>
   <p>
    my lost soul, I won’t be bad towards you again, Tess. And if certain
   </p>
   <p>
    circumstances should arise—you understand—in which you are in the least
   </p>
   <p>
    need, the least difficulty, send me one line, and you shall have by
   </p>
   <p>
    return whatever you require. I may not be at Trantridge—I am going to
   </p>
   <p>
    London for a time—I can’t stand the old woman. But all letters will be
   </p>
   <p>
    forwarded.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She said that she did not wish him to drive her further, and they
   </p>
   <p>
    stopped just under the clump of trees. D’Urberville alighted, and
   </p>
   <p>
    lifted her down bodily in his arms, afterwards placing her articles on
   </p>
   <p>
    the ground beside her. She bowed to him slightly, her eye just
   </p>
   <p>
    lingering in his; and then she turned to take the parcels for
   </p>
   <p>
    departure.
   </p>
   <p>
    Alec d’Urberville removed his cigar, bent towards her, and said—
   </p>
   <p>
    “You are not going to turn away like that, dear! Come!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “If you wish,” she answered indifferently. “See how you’ve mastered
   </p>
   <p>
    me!”
   </p>
   <p>
    She thereupon turned round and lifted her face to his, and remained
   </p>
   <p>
    like a marble term while he imprinted a kiss upon her cheek—half
   </p>
   <p>
    perfunctorily, half as if zest had not yet quite died out. Her eyes
   </p>
   <p>
    vaguely rested upon the remotest trees in the lane while the kiss was
   </p>
   <p>
    given, as though she were nearly unconscious of what he did.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Now the other side, for old acquaintance’ sake.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She turned her head in the same passive way, as one might turn at the
   </p>
   <p>
    request of a sketcher or hairdresser, and he kissed the other side, his
   </p>
   <p>
    lips touching cheeks that were damp and smoothly chill as the skin of
   </p>
   <p>
    the mushrooms in the fields around.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You don’t give me your mouth and kiss me back. You never willingly do
   </p>
   <p>
    that—you’ll never love me, I fear.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I have said so, often. It is true. I have never really and truly loved
   </p>
   <p>
    you, and I think I never can.” She added mournfully, “Perhaps, of all
   </p>
   <p>
    things, a lie on this thing would do the most good to me now; but I
   </p>
   <p>
    have honour enough left, little as ’tis, not to tell that lie. If I did
   </p>
   <p>
    love you, I may have the best o’ causes for letting you know it. But I
   </p>
   <p>
    don’t.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He emitted a laboured breath, as if the scene were getting rather
   </p>
   <p>
    oppressive to his heart, or to his conscience, or to his gentility.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, you are absurdly melancholy, Tess. I have no reason for
   </p>
   <p>
    flattering you now, and I can say plainly that you need not be so sad.
   </p>
   <p>
    You can hold your own for beauty against any woman of these parts,
   </p>
   <p>
    gentle or simple; I say it to you as a practical man and well-wisher.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you are wise you will show it to the world more than you do before
   </p>
   <p>
    it fades... And yet, Tess, will you come back to me! Upon my soul, I
   </p>
   <p>
    don’t like to let you go like this!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Never, never! I made up my mind as soon as I saw—what I ought to have
   </p>
   <p>
    seen sooner; and I won’t come.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Then good morning, my four months’ cousin—good-bye!”
   </p>
   <p>
    He leapt up lightly, arranged the reins, and was gone between the tall
   </p>
   <p>
    red-berried hedges.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess did not look after him, but slowly wound along the crooked lane.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was still early, and though the sun’s lower limb was just free of
   </p>
   <p>
    the hill, his rays, ungenial and peering, addressed the eye rather than
   </p>
   <p>
    the touch as yet. There was not a human soul near. Sad October and her
   </p>
   <p>
    sadder self seemed the only two existences haunting that lane.
   </p>
   <p>
    As she walked, however, some footsteps approached behind her, the
   </p>
   <p>
    footsteps of a man; and owing to the briskness of his advance he was
   </p>
   <p>
    close at her heels and had said “Good morning” before she had been long
   </p>
   <p>
    aware of his propinquity. He appeared to be an artisan of some sort,
   </p>
   <p>
    and carried a tin pot of red paint in his hand. He asked in a
   </p>
   <p>
    business-like manner if he should take her basket, which she permitted
   </p>
   <p>
    him to do, walking beside him.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It is early to be astir this Sabbath morn!” he said cheerfully.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes,” said Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    “When most people are at rest from their week’s work.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She also assented to this.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Though I do more real work to-day than all the week besides.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Do you?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “All the week I work for the glory of man, and on Sunday for the glory
   </p>
   <p>
    of God. That’s more real than the other—hey? I have a little to do here
   </p>
   <p>
    at this stile.” The man turned, as he spoke, to an opening at the
   </p>
   <p>
    roadside leading into a pasture. “If you’ll wait a moment,” he added,
   </p>
   <p>
    “I shall not be long.”
   </p>
   <p>
    As he had her basket she could not well do otherwise; and she waited,
   </p>
   <p>
    observing him. He set down her basket and the tin pot, and stirring the
   </p>
   <p>
    paint with the brush that was in it began painting large square letters
   </p>
   <p>
    on the middle board of the three composing the stile, placing a comma
   </p>
   <p>
    after each word, as if to give pause while that word was driven well
   </p>
   <p>
    home to the reader’s heart—
   </p>
   <p>
    THY, DAMNATION, SLUMBERETH, NOT.
   </p>
   <p>
    2 Pet. ii. 3.
   </p>
   <p>
    Against the peaceful landscape, the pale, decaying tints of the copses,
   </p>
   <p>
    the blue air of the horizon, and the lichened stile-boards, these
   </p>
   <p>
    staring vermilion words shone forth. They seemed to shout themselves
   </p>
   <p>
    out and make the atmosphere ring. Some people might have cried “Alas,
   </p>
   <p>
    poor Theology!” at the hideous defacement—the last grotesque phase of a
   </p>
   <p>
    creed which had served mankind well in its time. But the words entered
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess with accusatory horror. It was as if this man had known her recent
   </p>
   <p>
    history; yet he was a total stranger.
   </p>
   <p>
    Having finished his text he picked up her basket, and she mechanically
   </p>
   <p>
    resumed her walk beside him.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Do you believe what you paint?” she asked in low tones.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Believe that tex? Do I believe in my own existence!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But,” said she tremulously, “suppose your sin was not of your own
   </p>
   <p>
    seeking?”
   </p>
   <p>
    He shook his head.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I cannot split hairs on that burning query,” he said. “I have walked
   </p>
   <p>
    hundreds of miles this past summer, painting these texes on every wall,
   </p>
   <p>
    gate, and stile the length and breadth of this district. I leave their
   </p>
   <p>
    application to the hearts of the people who read ’em.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I think they are horrible,” said Tess. “Crushing! Killing!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “That’s what they are meant to be!” he replied in a trade voice. “But
   </p>
   <p>
    you should read my hottest ones—them I kips for slums and seaports.
   </p>
   <p>
    They’d make ye wriggle! Not but what this is a very good tex for rural
   </p>
   <p>
    districts.... Ah—there’s a nice bit of blank wall up by that barn
   </p>
   <p>
    standing to waste. I must put one there—one that it will be good for
   </p>
   <p>
    dangerous young females like yerself to heed. Will ye wait, missy?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No,” said she; and taking her basket Tess trudged on. A little way
   </p>
   <p>
    forward she turned her head. The old gray wall began to advertise a
   </p>
   <p>
    similar fiery lettering to the first, with a strange and unwonted mien,
   </p>
   <p>
    as if distressed at duties it had never before been called upon to
   </p>
   <p>
    perform. It was with a sudden flush that she read and realized what was
   </p>
   <p>
    to be the inscription he was now halfway through—
   </p>
   <p>
    THOU, SHALT, NOT, COMMIT—
   </p>
   <p>
    Her cheerful friend saw her looking, stopped his brush, and shouted—
   </p>
   <p>
    “If you want to ask for edification on these things of moment, there’s
   </p>
   <p>
    a very earnest good man going to preach a charity-sermon to-day in the
   </p>
   <p>
    parish you are going to—Mr Clare of Emminster. I’m not of his
   </p>
   <p>
    persuasion now, but he’s a good man, and he’ll expound as well as any
   </p>
   <p>
    parson I know. ’Twas he began the work in me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    But Tess did not answer; she throbbingly resumed her walk, her eyes
   </p>
   <p>
    fixed on the ground. “Pooh—I don’t believe God said such things!” she
   </p>
   <p>
    murmured contemptuously when her flush had died away.
   </p>
   <p>
    A plume of smoke soared up suddenly from her father’s chimney, the
   </p>
   <p>
    sight of which made her heart ache. The aspect of the interior, when
   </p>
   <p>
    she reached it, made her heart ache more. Her mother, who had just come
   </p>
   <p>
    downstairs, turned to greet her from the fireplace, where she was
   </p>
   <p>
    kindling barked-oak twigs under the breakfast kettle. The young
   </p>
   <p>
    children were still above, as was also her father, it being Sunday
   </p>
   <p>
    morning, when he felt justified in lying an additional half-hour.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well!—my dear Tess!” exclaimed her surprised mother, jumping up and
   </p>
   <p>
    kissing the girl. “How be ye? I didn’t see you till you was in upon me!
   </p>
   <p>
    Have you come home to be married?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No, I have not come for that, mother.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Then for a holiday?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes—for a holiday; for a long holiday,” said Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What, isn’t your cousin going to do the handsome thing?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “He’s not my cousin, and he’s not going to marry me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Her mother eyed her narrowly.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Come, you have not told me all,” she said.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then Tess went up to her mother, put her face upon Joan’s neck, and
   </p>
   <p>
    told.
   </p>
   <p>
    “And yet th’st not got him to marry ’ee!” reiterated her mother. “Any
   </p>
   <p>
    woman would have done it but you, after that!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Perhaps any woman would except me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It would have been something like a story to come back with, if you
   </p>
   <p>
    had!” continued Mrs Durbeyfield, ready to burst into tears of vexation.
   </p>
   <p>
    “After all the talk about you and him which has reached us here, who
   </p>
   <p>
    would have expected it to end like this! Why didn’t ye think of doing
   </p>
   <p>
    some good for your family instead o’ thinking only of yourself? See how
   </p>
   <p>
    I’ve got to teave and slave, and your poor weak father with his heart
   </p>
   <p>
    clogged like a dripping-pan. I did hope for something to come out o’
   </p>
   <p>
    this! To see what a pretty pair you and he made that day when you drove
   </p>
   <p>
    away together four months ago! See what he has given us—all, as we
   </p>
   <p>
    thought, because we were his kin. But if he’s not, it must have been
   </p>
   <p>
    done because of his love for ’ee. And yet you’ve not got him to marry!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Get Alec d’Urberville in the mind to marry her! He marry _her_! On
   </p>
   <p>
    matrimony he had never once said a word. And what if he had? How a
   </p>
   <p>
    convulsive snatching at social salvation might have impelled her to
   </p>
   <p>
    answer him she could not say. But her poor foolish mother little knew
   </p>
   <p>
    her present feeling towards this man. Perhaps it was unusual in the
   </p>
   <p>
    circumstances, unlucky, unaccountable; but there it was; and this, as
   </p>
   <p>
    she had said, was what made her detest herself. She had never wholly
   </p>
   <p>
    cared for him; she did not at all care for him now. She had dreaded
   </p>
   <p>
    him, winced before him, succumbed to adroit advantages he took of her
   </p>
   <p>
    helplessness; then, temporarily blinded by his ardent manners, had been
   </p>
   <p>
    stirred to confused surrender awhile: had suddenly despised and
   </p>
   <p>
    disliked him, and had run away. That was all. Hate him she did not
   </p>
   <p>
    quite; but he was dust and ashes to her, and even for her name’s sake
   </p>
   <p>
    she scarcely wished to marry him.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You ought to have been more careful if you didn’t mean to get him to
   </p>
   <p>
    make you his wife!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O mother, my mother!” cried the agonized girl, turning passionately
   </p>
   <p>
    upon her parent as if her poor heart would break. “How could I be
   </p>
   <p>
    expected to know? I was a child when I left this house four months ago.
   </p>
   <p>
    Why didn’t you tell me there was danger in men-folk? Why didn’t you
   </p>
   <p>
    warn me? Ladies know what to fend hands against, because they read
   </p>
   <p>
    novels that tell them of these tricks; but I never had the chance o’
   </p>
   <p>
    learning in that way, and you did not help me!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Her mother was subdued.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I thought if I spoke of his fond feelings and what they might lead to,
   </p>
   <p>
    you would be hontish wi’ him and lose your chance,” she murmured,
   </p>
   <p>
    wiping her eyes with her apron. “Well, we must make the best of it, I
   </p>
   <p>
    suppose. ’Tis nater, after all, and what do please God!”
   </p>
   <p>
    XIII
   </p>
   <p>
    The event of Tess Durbeyfield’s return from the manor of her bogus
   </p>
   <p>
    kinsfolk was rumoured abroad, if rumour be not too large a word for a
   </p>
   <p>
    space of a square mile. In the afternoon several young girls of
   </p>
   <p>
    Marlott, former schoolfellows and acquaintances of Tess, called to see
   </p>
   <p>
    her, arriving dressed in their best starched and ironed, as became
   </p>
   <p>
    visitors to a person who had made a transcendent conquest (as they
   </p>
   <p>
    supposed), and sat round the room looking at her with great curiosity.
   </p>
   <p>
    For the fact that it was this said thirty-first cousin, Mr
   </p>
   <p>
    d’Urberville, who had fallen in love with her, a gentleman not
   </p>
   <p>
    altogether local, whose reputation as a reckless gallant and
   </p>
   <p>
    heartbreaker was beginning to spread beyond the immediate boundaries of
   </p>
   <p>
    Trantridge, lent Tess’s supposed position, by its fearsomeness, a far
   </p>
   <p>
    higher fascination that it would have exercised if unhazardous.
   </p>
   <p>
    Their interest was so deep that the younger ones whispered when her
   </p>
   <p>
    back was turned—
   </p>
   <p>
    “How pretty she is; and how that best frock do set her off! I believe
   </p>
   <p>
    it cost an immense deal, and that it was a gift from him.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess, who was reaching up to get the tea-things from the
   </p>
   <p>
    corner-cupboard, did not hear these commentaries. If she had heard
   </p>
   <p>
    them, she might soon have set her friends right on the matter. But her
   </p>
   <p>
    mother heard, and Joan’s simple vanity, having been denied the hope of
   </p>
   <p>
    a dashing marriage, fed itself as well as it could upon the sensation
   </p>
   <p>
    of a dashing flirtation. Upon the whole she felt gratified, even though
   </p>
   <p>
    such a limited and evanescent triumph should involve her daughter’s
   </p>
   <p>
    reputation; it might end in marriage yet, and in the warmth of her
   </p>
   <p>
    responsiveness to their admiration she invited her visitors to stay to
   </p>
   <p>
    tea.
   </p>
   <p>
    Their chatter, their laughter, their good-humoured innuendoes, above
   </p>
   <p>
    all, their flashes and flickerings of envy, revived Tess’s spirits
   </p>
   <p>
    also; and, as the evening wore on, she caught the infection of their
   </p>
   <p>
    excitement, and grew almost gay. The marble hardness left her face, she
   </p>
   <p>
    moved with something of her old bounding step, and flushed in all her
   </p>
   <p>
    young beauty.
   </p>
   <p>
    At moments, in spite of thought, she would reply to their inquiries
   </p>
   <p>
    with a manner of superiority, as if recognizing that her experiences in
   </p>
   <p>
    the field of courtship had, indeed, been slightly enviable. But so far
   </p>
   <p>
    was she from being, in the words of Robert South, “in love with her own
   </p>
   <p>
    ruin,” that the illusion was transient as lightning; cold reason came
   </p>
   <p>
    back to mock her spasmodic weakness; the ghastliness of her momentary
   </p>
   <p>
    pride would convict her, and recall her to reserved listlessness again.
   </p>
   <p>
    And the despondency of the next morning’s dawn, when it was no longer
   </p>
   <p>
    Sunday, but Monday; and no best clothes; and the laughing visitors were
   </p>
   <p>
    gone, and she awoke alone in her old bed, the innocent younger children
   </p>
   <p>
    breathing softly around her. In place of the excitement of her return,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the interest it had inspired, she saw before her a long and stony
   </p>
   <p>
    highway which she had to tread, without aid, and with little sympathy.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her depression was then terrible, and she could have hidden herself in
   </p>
   <p>
    a tomb.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the course of a few weeks Tess revived sufficiently to show herself
   </p>
   <p>
    so far as was necessary to get to church one Sunday morning. She liked
   </p>
   <p>
    to hear the chanting—such as it was—and the old Psalms, and to join in
   </p>
   <p>
    the Morning Hymn. That innate love of melody, which she had inherited
   </p>
   <p>
    from her ballad-singing mother, gave the simplest music a power over
   </p>
   <p>
    her which could well-nigh drag her heart out of her bosom at times.
   </p>
   <p>
    To be as much out of observation as possible for reasons of her own,
   </p>
   <p>
    and to escape the gallantries of the young men, she set out before the
   </p>
   <p>
    chiming began, and took a back seat under the gallery, close to the
   </p>
   <p>
    lumber, where only old men and women came, and where the bier stood on
   </p>
   <p>
    end among the churchyard tools.
   </p>
   <p>
    Parishioners dropped in by twos and threes, deposited themselves in
   </p>
   <p>
    rows before her, rested three-quarters of a minute on their foreheads
   </p>
   <p>
    as if they were praying, though they were not; then sat up, and looked
   </p>
   <p>
    around. When the chants came on, one of her favourites happened to be
   </p>
   <p>
    chosen among the rest—the old double chant “Langdon”—but she did not
   </p>
   <p>
    know what it was called, though she would much have liked to know. She
   </p>
   <p>
    thought, without exactly wording the thought, how strange and god-like
   </p>
   <p>
    was a composer’s power, who from the grave could lead through sequences
   </p>
   <p>
    of emotion, which he alone had felt at first, a girl like her who had
   </p>
   <p>
    never heard of his name, and never would have a clue to his
   </p>
   <p>
    personality.
   </p>
   <p>
    The people who had turned their heads turned them again as the service
   </p>
   <p>
    proceeded; and at last observing her, they whispered to each other. She
   </p>
   <p>
    knew what their whispers were about, grew sick at heart, and felt that
   </p>
   <p>
    she could come to church no more.
   </p>
   <p>
    The bedroom which she shared with some of the children formed her
   </p>
   <p>
    retreat more continually than ever. Here, under her few square yards of
   </p>
   <p>
    thatch, she watched winds, and snows, and rains, gorgeous sunsets, and
   </p>
   <p>
    successive moons at their full. So close kept she that at length almost
   </p>
   <p>
    everybody thought she had gone away.
   </p>
   <p>
    The only exercise that Tess took at this time was after dark; and it
   </p>
   <p>
    was then, when out in the woods, that she seemed least solitary. She
   </p>
   <p>
    knew how to hit to a hair’s-breadth that moment of evening when the
   </p>
   <p>
    light and the darkness are so evenly balanced that the constraint of
   </p>
   <p>
    day and the suspense of night neutralize each other, leaving absolute
   </p>
   <p>
    mental liberty. It is then that the plight of being alive becomes
   </p>
   <p>
    attenuated to its least possible dimensions. She had no fear of the
   </p>
   <p>
    shadows; her sole idea seemed to be to shun mankind—or rather that cold
   </p>
   <p>
    accretion called the world, which, so terrible in the mass, is so
   </p>
   <p>
    unformidable, even pitiable, in its units.
   </p>
   <p>
    On these lonely hills and dales her quiescent glide was of a piece with
   </p>
   <p>
    the element she moved in. Her flexuous and stealthy figure became an
   </p>
   <p>
    integral part of the scene. At times her whimsical fancy would
   </p>
   <p>
    intensify natural processes around her till they seemed a part of her
   </p>
   <p>
    own story. Rather they became a part of it; for the world is only a
   </p>
   <p>
    psychological phenomenon, and what they seemed they were. The midnight
   </p>
   <p>
    airs and gusts, moaning amongst the tightly-wrapped buds and bark of
   </p>
   <p>
    the winter twigs, were formulae of bitter reproach. A wet day was the
   </p>
   <p>
    expression of irremediable grief at her weakness in the mind of some
   </p>
   <p>
    vague ethical being whom she could not class definitely as the God of
   </p>
   <p>
    her childhood, and could not comprehend as any other.
   </p>
   <p>
    But this encompassment of her own characterization, based on shreds of
   </p>
   <p>
    convention, peopled by phantoms and voices antipathetic to her, was a
   </p>
   <p>
    sorry and mistaken creation of Tess’s fancy—a cloud of moral hobgoblins
   </p>
   <p>
    by which she was terrified without reason. It was they that were out of
   </p>
   <p>
    harmony with the actual world, not she. Walking among the sleeping
   </p>
   <p>
    birds in the hedges, watching the skipping rabbits on a moonlit warren,
   </p>
   <p>
    or standing under a pheasant-laden bough, she looked upon herself as a
   </p>
   <p>
    figure of Guilt intruding into the haunts of Innocence. But all the
   </p>
   <p>
    while she was making a distinction where there was no difference.
   </p>
   <p>
    Feeling herself in antagonism, she was quite in accord. She had been
   </p>
   <p>
    made to break an accepted social law, but no law known to the
   </p>
   <p>
    environment in which she fancied herself such an anomaly.
   </p>
   <p>
    XIV
   </p>
   <p>
    It was a hazy sunrise in August. The denser nocturnal vapours, attacked
   </p>
   <p>
    by the warm beams, were dividing and shrinking into isolated fleeces
   </p>
   <p>
    within hollows and coverts, where they waited till they should be dried
   </p>
   <p>
    away to nothing.
   </p>
   <p>
    The sun, on account of the mist, had a curious sentient, personal look,
   </p>
   <p>
    demanding the masculine pronoun for its adequate expression. His
   </p>
   <p>
    present aspect, coupled with the lack of all human forms in the scene,
   </p>
   <p>
    explained the old-time heliolatries in a moment. One could feel that a
   </p>
   <p>
    saner religion had never prevailed under the sky. The luminary was a
   </p>
   <p>
    golden-haired, beaming, mild-eyed, God-like creature, gazing down in
   </p>
   <p>
    the vigour and intentness of youth upon an earth that was brimming with
   </p>
   <p>
    interest for him.
   </p>
   <p>
    His light, a little later, broke though chinks of cottage shutters,
   </p>
   <p>
    throwing stripes like red-hot pokers upon cupboards, chests of drawers,
   </p>
   <p>
    and other furniture within; and awakening harvesters who were not
   </p>
   <p>
    already astir.
   </p>
   <p>
    But of all ruddy things that morning the brightest were two broad arms
   </p>
   <p>
    of painted wood, which rose from the margin of yellow cornfield hard by
   </p>
   <p>
    Marlott village. They, with two others below, formed the revolving
   </p>
   <p>
    Maltese cross of the reaping-machine, which had been brought to the
   </p>
   <p>
    field on the previous evening to be ready for operations this day. The
   </p>
   <p>
    paint with which they were smeared, intensified in hue by the sunlight,
   </p>
   <p>
    imparted to them a look of having been dipped in liquid fire.
   </p>
   <p>
    The field had already been “opened”; that is to say, a lane a few feet
   </p>
   <p>
    wide had been hand-cut through the wheat along the whole circumference
   </p>
   <p>
    of the field for the first passage of the horses and machine.
   </p>
   <p>
    Two groups, one of men and lads, the other of women, had come down the
   </p>
   <p>
    lane just at the hour when the shadows of the eastern hedge-top struck
   </p>
   <p>
    the west hedge midway, so that the heads of the groups were enjoying
   </p>
   <p>
    sunrise while their feet were still in the dawn. They disappeared from
   </p>
   <p>
    the lane between the two stone posts which flanked the nearest
   </p>
   <p>
    field-gate.
   </p>
   <p>
    Presently there arose from within a ticking like the love-making of the
   </p>
   <p>
    grasshopper. The machine had begun, and a moving concatenation of three
   </p>
   <p>
    horses and the aforesaid long rickety machine was visible over the
   </p>
   <p>
    gate, a driver sitting upon one of the hauling horses, and an attendant
   </p>
   <p>
    on the seat of the implement. Along one side of the field the whole
   </p>
   <p>
    wain went, the arms of the mechanical reaper revolving slowly, till it
   </p>
   <p>
    passed down the hill quite out of sight. In a minute it came up on the
   </p>
   <p>
    other side of the field at the same equable pace; the glistening brass
   </p>
   <p>
    star in the forehead of the fore horse first catching the eye as it
   </p>
   <p>
    rose into view over the stubble, then the bright arms, and then the
   </p>
   <p>
    whole machine.
   </p>
   <p>
    The narrow lane of stubble encompassing the field grew wider with each
   </p>
   <p>
    circuit, and the standing corn was reduced to a smaller area as the
   </p>
   <p>
    morning wore on. Rabbits, hares, snakes, rats, mice, retreated inwards
   </p>
   <p>
    as into a fastness, unaware of the ephemeral nature of their refuge,
   </p>
   <p>
    and of the doom that awaited them later in the day when, their covert
   </p>
   <p>
    shrinking to a more and more horrible narrowness, they were huddled
   </p>
   <p>
    together, friends and foes, till the last few yards of upright wheat
   </p>
   <p>
    fell also under the teeth of the unerring reaper, and they were every
   </p>
   <p>
    one put to death by the sticks and stones of the harvesters.
   </p>
   <p>
    The reaping-machine left the fallen corn behind it in little heaps,
   </p>
   <p>
    each heap being of the quantity for a sheaf; and upon these the active
   </p>
   <p>
    binders in the rear laid their hands—mainly women, but some of them men
   </p>
   <p>
    in print shirts, and trousers supported round their waists by leather
   </p>
   <p>
    straps, rendering useless the two buttons behind, which twinkled and
   </p>
   <p>
    bristled with sunbeams at every movement of each wearer, as if they
   </p>
   <p>
    were a pair of eyes in the small of his back.
   </p>
   <p>
    But those of the other sex were the most interesting of this company of
   </p>
   <p>
    binders, by reason of the charm which is acquired by woman when she
   </p>
   <p>
    becomes part and parcel of outdoor nature, and is not merely an object
   </p>
   <p>
    set down therein as at ordinary times. A field-man is a personality
   </p>
   <p>
    afield; a field-woman is a portion of the field; she had somehow lost
   </p>
   <p>
    her own margin, imbibed the essence of her surrounding, and assimilated
   </p>
   <p>
    herself with it.
   </p>
   <p>
    The women—or rather girls, for they were mostly young—wore drawn cotton
   </p>
   <p>
    bonnets with great flapping curtains to keep off the sun, and gloves to
   </p>
   <p>
    prevent their hands being wounded by the stubble. There was one wearing
   </p>
   <p>
    a pale pink jacket, another in a cream-coloured tight-sleeved gown,
   </p>
   <p>
    another in a petticoat as red as the arms of the reaping-machine; and
   </p>
   <p>
    others, older, in the brown-rough “wropper” or over-all—the
   </p>
   <p>
    old-established and most appropriate dress of the field-woman, which
   </p>
   <p>
    the young ones were abandoning. This morning the eye returns
   </p>
   <p>
    involuntarily to the girl in the pink cotton jacket, she being the most
   </p>
   <p>
    flexuous and finely-drawn figure of them all. But her bonnet is pulled
   </p>
   <p>
    so far over her brow that none of her face is disclosed while she
   </p>
   <p>
    binds, though her complexion may be guessed from a stray twine or two
   </p>
   <p>
    of dark brown hair which extends below the curtain of her bonnet.
   </p>
   <p>
    Perhaps one reason why she seduces casual attention is that she never
   </p>
   <p>
    courts it, though the other women often gaze around them.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her binding proceeds with clock-like monotony. From the sheaf last
   </p>
   <p>
    finished she draws a handful of ears, patting their tips with her left
   </p>
   <p>
    palm to bring them even. Then, stooping low, she moves forward,
   </p>
   <p>
    gathering the corn with both hands against her knees, and pushing her
   </p>
   <p>
    left gloved hand under the bundle to meet the right on the other side,
   </p>
   <p>
    holding the corn in an embrace like that of a lover. She brings the
   </p>
   <p>
    ends of the bond together, and kneels on the sheaf while she ties it,
   </p>
   <p>
    beating back her skirts now and then when lifted by the breeze. A bit
   </p>
   <p>
    of her naked arm is visible between the buff leather of the gauntlet
   </p>
   <p>
    and the sleeve of her gown; and as the day wears on its feminine
   </p>
   <p>
    smoothness becomes scarified by the stubble and bleeds.
   </p>
   <p>
    At intervals she stands up to rest, and to retie her disarranged apron,
   </p>
   <p>
    or to pull her bonnet straight. Then one can see the oval face of a
   </p>
   <p>
    handsome young woman with deep dark eyes and long heavy clinging
   </p>
   <p>
    tresses, which seem to clasp in a beseeching way anything they fall
   </p>
   <p>
    against. The cheeks are paler, the teeth more regular, the red lips
   </p>
   <p>
    thinner than is usual in a country-bred girl.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is Tess Durbeyfield, otherwise d’Urberville, somewhat changed—the
   </p>
   <p>
    same, but not the same; at the present stage of her existence living as
   </p>
   <p>
    a stranger and an alien here, though it was no strange land that she
   </p>
   <p>
    was in. After a long seclusion she had come to a resolve to undertake
   </p>
   <p>
    outdoor work in her native village, the busiest season of the year in
   </p>
   <p>
    the agricultural world having arrived, and nothing that she could do
   </p>
   <p>
    within the house being so remunerative for the time as harvesting in
   </p>
   <p>
    the fields.
   </p>
   <p>
    The movements of the other women were more or less similar to Tess’s,
   </p>
   <p>
    the whole bevy of them drawing together like dancers in a quadrille at
   </p>
   <p>
    the completion of a sheaf by each, every one placing her sheaf on end
   </p>
   <p>
    against those of the rest, till a shock, or “stitch” as it was here
   </p>
   <p>
    called, of ten or a dozen was formed.
   </p>
   <p>
    They went to breakfast, and came again, and the work proceeded as
   </p>
   <p>
    before. As the hour of eleven drew near a person watching her might
   </p>
   <p>
    have noticed that every now and then Tess’s glance flitted wistfully to
   </p>
   <p>
    the brow of the hill, though she did not pause in her sheafing. On the
   </p>
   <p>
    verge of the hour the heads of a group of children, of ages ranging
   </p>
   <p>
    from six to fourteen, rose over the stubbly convexity of the hill.
   </p>
   <p>
    The face of Tess flushed slightly, but still she did not pause.
   </p>
   <p>
    The eldest of the comers, a girl who wore a triangular shawl, its
   </p>
   <p>
    corner draggling on the stubble, carried in her arms what at first
   </p>
   <p>
    sight seemed to be a doll, but proved to be an infant in long clothes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Another brought some lunch. The harvesters ceased working, took their
   </p>
   <p>
    provisions, and sat down against one of the shocks. Here they fell to,
   </p>
   <p>
    the men plying a stone jar freely, and passing round a cup.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess Durbeyfield had been one of the last to suspend her labours. She
   </p>
   <p>
    sat down at the end of the shock, her face turned somewhat away from
   </p>
   <p>
    her companions. When she had deposited herself a man in a rabbit-skin
   </p>
   <p>
    cap, and with a red handkerchief tucked into his belt, held the cup of
   </p>
   <p>
    ale over the top of the shock for her to drink. But she did not accept
   </p>
   <p>
    his offer. As soon as her lunch was spread she called up the big girl,
   </p>
   <p>
    her sister, and took the baby of her, who, glad to be relieved of the
   </p>
   <p>
    burden, went away to the next shock and joined the other children
   </p>
   <p>
    playing there. Tess, with a curiously stealthy yet courageous movement,
   </p>
   <p>
    and with a still rising colour, unfastened her frock and began suckling
   </p>
   <p>
    the child.
   </p>
   <p>
    The men who sat nearest considerately turned their faces towards the
   </p>
   <p>
    other end of the field, some of them beginning to smoke; one, with
   </p>
   <p>
    absent-minded fondness, regretfully stroking the jar that would no
   </p>
   <p>
    longer yield a stream. All the women but Tess fell into animated talk,
   </p>
   <p>
    and adjusted the disarranged knots of their hair.
   </p>
   <p>
    When the infant had taken its fill, the young mother sat it upright in
   </p>
   <p>
    her lap, and looking into the far distance, dandled it with a gloomy
   </p>
   <p>
    indifference that was almost dislike; then all of a sudden she fell to
   </p>
   <p>
    violently kissing it some dozens of times, as if she could never leave
   </p>
   <p>
    off, the child crying at the vehemence of an onset which strangely
   </p>
   <p>
    combined passionateness with contempt.
   </p>
   <p>
    “She’s fond of that there child, though she mid pretend to hate en, and
   </p>
   <p>
    say she wishes the baby and her too were in the churchyard,” observed
   </p>
   <p>
    the woman in the red petticoat.
   </p>
   <p>
    “She’ll soon leave off saying that,” replied the one in buff. “Lord,
   </p>
   <p>
    ’tis wonderful what a body can get used to o’ that sort in time!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “A little more than persuading had to do wi’ the coming o’t, I reckon.
   </p>
   <p>
    There were they that heard a sobbing one night last year in The Chase;
   </p>
   <p>
    and it mid ha’ gone hard wi’ a certain party if folks had come along.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, a little more, or a little less, ’twas a thousand pities that it
   </p>
   <p>
    should have happened to she, of all others. But ’tis always the
   </p>
   <p>
    comeliest! The plain ones be as safe as churches—hey, Jenny?” The
   </p>
   <p>
    speaker turned to one of the group who certainly was not ill-defined as
   </p>
   <p>
    plain.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was a thousand pities, indeed; it was impossible for even an enemy
   </p>
   <p>
    to feel otherwise on looking at Tess as she sat there, with her
   </p>
   <p>
    flower-like mouth and large tender eyes, neither black nor blue nor
   </p>
   <p>
    grey nor violet; rather all those shades together, and a hundred
   </p>
   <p>
    others, which could be seen if one looked into their irises—shade
   </p>
   <p>
    behind shade—tint beyond tint—around pupils that had no bottom; an
   </p>
   <p>
    almost standard woman, but for the slight incautiousness of character
   </p>
   <p>
    inherited from her race.
   </p>
   <p>
    A resolution which had surprised herself had brought her into the
   </p>
   <p>
    fields this week for the first time during many months. After wearing
   </p>
   <p>
    and wasting her palpitating heart with every engine of regret that
   </p>
   <p>
    lonely inexperience could devise, common sense had illuminated her. She
   </p>
   <p>
    felt that she would do well to be useful again—to taste anew sweet
   </p>
   <p>
    independence at any price. The past was past; whatever it had been, it
   </p>
   <p>
    was no more at hand. Whatever its consequences, time would close over
   </p>
   <p>
    them; they would all in a few years be as if they had never been, and
   </p>
   <p>
    she herself grassed down and forgotten. Meanwhile the trees were just
   </p>
   <p>
    as green as before; the birds sang and the sun shone as clearly now as
   </p>
   <p>
    ever. The familiar surroundings had not darkened because of her grief,
   </p>
   <p>
    nor sickened because of her pain.
   </p>
   <p>
    She might have seen that what had bowed her head so profoundly—the
   </p>
   <p>
    thought of the world’s concern at her situation—was founded on an
   </p>
   <p>
    illusion. She was not an existence, an experience, a passion, a
   </p>
   <p>
    structure of sensations, to anybody but herself. To all humankind
   </p>
   <p>
    besides, Tess was only a passing thought. Even to friends she was no
   </p>
   <p>
    more than a frequently passing thought. If she made herself miserable
   </p>
   <p>
    the livelong night and day it was only this much to them—“Ah, she makes
   </p>
   <p>
    herself unhappy.” If she tried to be cheerful, to dismiss all care, to
   </p>
   <p>
    take pleasure in the daylight, the flowers, the baby, she could only be
   </p>
   <p>
    this idea to them—“Ah, she bears it very well.” Moreover, alone in a
   </p>
   <p>
    desert island would she have been wretched at what had happened to her?
   </p>
   <p>
    Not greatly. If she could have been but just created, to discover
   </p>
   <p>
    herself as a spouseless mother, with no experience of life except as
   </p>
   <p>
    the parent of a nameless child, would the position have caused her to
   </p>
   <p>
    despair? No, she would have taken it calmly, and found pleasure
   </p>
   <p>
    therein. Most of the misery had been generated by her conventional
   </p>
   <p>
    aspect, and not by her innate sensations.
   </p>
   <p>
    Whatever Tess’s reasoning, some spirit had induced her to dress herself
   </p>
   <p>
    up neatly as she had formerly done, and come out into the fields,
   </p>
   <p>
    harvest-hands being greatly in demand just then. This was why she had
   </p>
   <p>
    borne herself with dignity, and had looked people calmly in the face at
   </p>
   <p>
    times, even when holding the baby in her arms.
   </p>
   <p>
    The harvest-men rose from the shock of corn, and stretched their limbs,
   </p>
   <p>
    and extinguished their pipes. The horses, which had been unharnessed
   </p>
   <p>
    and fed, were again attached to the scarlet machine. Tess, having
   </p>
   <p>
    quickly eaten her own meal, beckoned to her eldest sister to come and
   </p>
   <p>
    take away the baby, fastened her dress, put on the buff gloves again,
   </p>
   <p>
    and stooped anew to draw a bond from the last completed sheaf for the
   </p>
   <p>
    tying of the next.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the afternoon and evening the proceedings of the morning were
   </p>
   <p>
    continued, Tess staying on till dusk with the body of harvesters. Then
   </p>
   <p>
    they all rode home in one of the largest wagons, in the company of a
   </p>
   <p>
    broad tarnished moon that had risen from the ground to the eastwards,
   </p>
   <p>
    its face resembling the outworn gold-leaf halo of some worm-eaten
   </p>
   <p>
    Tuscan saint. Tess’s female companions sang songs, and showed
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves very sympathetic and glad at her reappearance out of doors,
   </p>
   <p>
    though they could not refrain from mischievously throwing in a few
   </p>
   <p>
    verses of the ballad about the maid who went to the merry green wood
   </p>
   <p>
    and came back a changed state. There are counterpoises and
   </p>
   <p>
    compensations in life; and the event which had made of her a social
   </p>
   <p>
    warning had also for the moment made her the most interesting personage
   </p>
   <p>
    in the village to many. Their friendliness won her still farther away
   </p>
   <p>
    from herself, their lively spirits were contagious, and she became
   </p>
   <p>
    almost gay.
   </p>
   <p>
    But now that her moral sorrows were passing away a fresh one arose on
   </p>
   <p>
    the natural side of her which knew no social law. When she reached home
   </p>
   <p>
    it was to learn to her grief that the baby had been suddenly taken ill
   </p>
   <p>
    since the afternoon. Some such collapse had been probable, so tender
   </p>
   <p>
    and puny was its frame; but the event came as a shock nevertheless.
   </p>
   <p>
    The baby’s offence against society in coming into the world was
   </p>
   <p>
    forgotten by the girl-mother; her soul’s desire was to continue that
   </p>
   <p>
    offence by preserving the life of the child. However, it soon grew
   </p>
   <p>
    clear that the hour of emancipation for that little prisoner of the
   </p>
   <p>
    flesh was to arrive earlier than her worst misgiving had conjectured.
   </p>
   <p>
    And when she had discovered this she was plunged into a misery which
   </p>
   <p>
    transcended that of the child’s simple loss. Her baby had not been
   </p>
   <p>
    baptized.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess had drifted into a frame of mind which accepted passively the
   </p>
   <p>
    consideration that if she should have to burn for what she had done,
   </p>
   <p>
    burn she must, and there was an end of it. Like all village girls, she
   </p>
   <p>
    was well grounded in the Holy Scriptures, and had dutifully studied the
   </p>
   <p>
    histories of Aholah and Aholibah, and knew the inferences to be drawn
   </p>
   <p>
    therefrom. But when the same question arose with regard to the baby, it
   </p>
   <p>
    had a very different colour. Her darling was about to die, and no
   </p>
   <p>
    salvation.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was nearly bedtime, but she rushed downstairs and asked if she might
   </p>
   <p>
    send for the parson. The moment happened to be one at which her
   </p>
   <p>
    father’s sense of the antique nobility of his family was highest, and
   </p>
   <p>
    his sensitiveness to the smudge which Tess had set upon that nobility
   </p>
   <p>
    most pronounced, for he had just returned from his weekly booze at
   </p>
   <p>
    Rolliver’s Inn. No parson should come inside his door, he declared,
   </p>
   <p>
    prying into his affairs, just then, when, by her shame, it had become
   </p>
   <p>
    more necessary than ever to hide them. He locked the door and put the
   </p>
   <p>
    key in his pocket.
   </p>
   <p>
    The household went to bed, and, distressed beyond measure, Tess retired
   </p>
   <p>
    also. She was continually waking as she lay, and in the middle of the
   </p>
   <p>
    night found that the baby was still worse. It was obviously
   </p>
   <p>
    dying—quietly and painlessly, but none the less surely.
   </p>
   <p>
    In her misery she rocked herself upon the bed. The clock struck the
   </p>
   <p>
    solemn hour of one, that hour when fancy stalks outside reason, and
   </p>
   <p>
    malignant possibilities stand rock-firm as facts. She thought of the
   </p>
   <p>
    child consigned to the nethermost corner of hell, as its double doom
   </p>
   <p>
    for lack of baptism and lack of legitimacy; saw the arch-fiend tossing
   </p>
   <p>
    it with his three-pronged fork, like the one they used for heating the
   </p>
   <p>
    oven on baking days; to which picture she added many other quaint and
   </p>
   <p>
    curious details of torment sometimes taught the young in this Christian
   </p>
   <p>
    country. The lurid presentment so powerfully affected her imagination
   </p>
   <p>
    in the silence of the sleeping house that her nightgown became damp
   </p>
   <p>
    with perspiration, and the bedstead shook with each throb of her heart.
   </p>
   <p>
    The infant’s breathing grew more difficult, and the mother’s mental
   </p>
   <p>
    tension increased. It was useless to devour the little thing with
   </p>
   <p>
    kisses; she could stay in bed no longer, and walked feverishly about
   </p>
   <p>
    the room.
   </p>
   <p>
    “O merciful God, have pity; have pity upon my poor baby!” she cried.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Heap as much anger as you want to upon me, and welcome; but pity the
   </p>
   <p>
    child!”
   </p>
   <p>
    She leant against the chest of drawers, and murmured incoherent
   </p>
   <p>
    supplications for a long while, till she suddenly started up.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah! perhaps baby can be saved! Perhaps it will be just the same!”
   </p>
   <p>
    She spoke so brightly that it seemed as though her face might have
   </p>
   <p>
    shone in the gloom surrounding her. She lit a candle, and went to a
   </p>
   <p>
    second and a third bed under the wall, where she awoke her young
   </p>
   <p>
    sisters and brothers, all of whom occupied the same room. Pulling out
   </p>
   <p>
    the washing-stand so that she could get behind it, she poured some
   </p>
   <p>
    water from a jug, and made them kneel around, putting their hands
   </p>
   <p>
    together with fingers exactly vertical. While the children, scarcely
   </p>
   <p>
    awake, awe-stricken at her manner, their eyes growing larger and
   </p>
   <p>
    larger, remained in this position, she took the baby from her bed—a
   </p>
   <p>
    child’s child—so immature as scarce to seem a sufficient personality to
   </p>
   <p>
    endow its producer with the maternal title. Tess then stood erect with
   </p>
   <p>
    the infant on her arm beside the basin; the next sister held the
   </p>
   <p>
    Prayer-Book open before her, as the clerk at church held it before the
   </p>
   <p>
    parson; and thus the girl set about baptizing her child.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her figure looked singularly tall and imposing as she stood in her long
   </p>
   <p>
    white nightgown, a thick cable of twisted dark hair hanging straight
   </p>
   <p>
    down her back to her waist. The kindly dimness of the weak candle
   </p>
   <p>
    abstracted from her form and features the little blemishes which
   </p>
   <p>
    sunlight might have revealed—the stubble scratches upon her wrists, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the weariness of her eyes—her high enthusiasm having a transfiguring
   </p>
   <p>
    effect upon the face which had been her undoing, showing it as a thing
   </p>
   <p>
    of immaculate beauty, with a touch of dignity which was almost regal.
   </p>
   <p>
    The little ones kneeling round, their sleepy eyes blinking and red,
   </p>
   <p>
    awaited her preparations full of a suspended wonder which their
   </p>
   <p>
    physical heaviness at that hour would not allow to become active.
   </p>
   <p>
    The most impressed of them said:
   </p>
   <p>
    “Be you really going to christen him, Tess?”
   </p>
   <p>
    The girl-mother replied in a grave affirmative.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What’s his name going to be?”
   </p>
   <p>
    She had not thought of that, but a name suggested by a phrase in the
   </p>
   <p>
    book of Genesis came into her head as she proceeded with the baptismal
   </p>
   <p>
    service, and now she pronounced it:
   </p>
   <p>
    “SORROW, I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
   </p>
   <p>
    of the Holy Ghost.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She sprinkled the water, and there was silence.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Say ‘Amen,’ children.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The tiny voices piped in obedient response, “Amen!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess went on:
   </p>
   <p>
    “We receive this child”—and so forth—“and do sign him with the sign of
   </p>
   <p>
    the Cross.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Here she dipped her hand into the basin, and fervently drew an immense
   </p>
   <p>
    cross upon the baby with her forefinger, continuing with the customary
   </p>
   <p>
    sentences as to his manfully fighting against sin, the world, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    devil, and being a faithful soldier and servant unto his life’s end.
   </p>
   <p>
    She duly went on with the Lord’s Prayer, the children lisping it after
   </p>
   <p>
    her in a thin gnat-like wail, till, at the conclusion, raising their
   </p>
   <p>
    voices to clerk’s pitch, they again piped into silence, “Amen!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Then their sister, with much augmented confidence in the efficacy of
   </p>
   <p>
    the sacrament, poured forth from the bottom of her heart the
   </p>
   <p>
    thanksgiving that follows, uttering it boldly and triumphantly in the
   </p>
   <p>
    stopt-diapason note which her voice acquired when her heart was in her
   </p>
   <p>
    speech, and which will never be forgotten by those who knew her. The
   </p>
   <p>
    ecstasy of faith almost apotheosized her; it set upon her face a
   </p>
   <p>
    glowing irradiation, and brought a red spot into the middle of each
   </p>
   <p>
    cheek; while the miniature candle-flame inverted in her eye-pupils
   </p>
   <p>
    shone like a diamond. The children gazed up at her with more and more
   </p>
   <p>
    reverence, and no longer had a will for questioning. She did not look
   </p>
   <p>
    like Sissy to them now, but as a being large, towering, and awful—a
   </p>
   <p>
    divine personage with whom they had nothing in common.
   </p>
   <p>
    Poor Sorrow’s campaign against sin, the world, and the devil was doomed
   </p>
   <p>
    to be of limited brilliancy—luckily perhaps for himself, considering
   </p>
   <p>
    his beginnings. In the blue of the morning that fragile soldier and
   </p>
   <p>
    servant breathed his last, and when the other children awoke they cried
   </p>
   <p>
    bitterly, and begged Sissy to have another pretty baby.
   </p>
   <p>
    The calmness which had possessed Tess since the christening remained
   </p>
   <p>
    with her in the infant’s loss. In the daylight, indeed, she felt her
   </p>
   <p>
    terrors about his soul to have been somewhat exaggerated; whether well
   </p>
   <p>
    founded or not, she had no uneasiness now, reasoning that if Providence
   </p>
   <p>
    would not ratify such an act of approximation she, for one, did not
   </p>
   <p>
    value the kind of heaven lost by the irregularity—either for herself or
   </p>
   <p>
    for her child.
   </p>
   <p>
    So passed away Sorrow the Undesired—that intrusive creature, that
   </p>
   <p>
    bastard gift of shameless Nature, who respects not the social law; a
   </p>
   <p>
    waif to whom eternal Time had been a matter of days merely, who knew
   </p>
   <p>
    not that such things as years and centuries ever were; to whom the
   </p>
   <p>
    cottage interior was the universe, the week’s weather climate, new-born
   </p>
   <p>
    babyhood human existence, and the instinct to suck human knowledge.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess, who mused on the christening a good deal, wondered if it were
   </p>
   <p>
    doctrinally sufficient to secure a Christian burial for the child.
   </p>
   <p>
    Nobody could tell this but the parson of the parish, and he was a
   </p>
   <p>
    new-comer, and did not know her. She went to his house after dusk, and
   </p>
   <p>
    stood by the gate, but could not summon courage to go in. The
   </p>
   <p>
    enterprise would have been abandoned if she had not by accident met him
   </p>
   <p>
    coming homeward as she turned away. In the gloom she did not mind
   </p>
   <p>
    speaking freely.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I should like to ask you something, sir.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He expressed his willingness to listen, and she told the story of the
   </p>
   <p>
    baby’s illness and the extemporized ordinance. “And now, sir,” she
   </p>
   <p>
    added earnestly, “can you tell me this—will it be just the same for him
   </p>
   <p>
    as if you had baptized him?”
   </p>
   <p>
    Having the natural feelings of a tradesman at finding that a job he
   </p>
   <p>
    should have been called in for had been unskilfully botched by his
   </p>
   <p>
    customers among themselves, he was disposed to say no. Yet the dignity
   </p>
   <p>
    of the girl, the strange tenderness in her voice, combined to affect
   </p>
   <p>
    his nobler impulses—or rather those that he had left in him after ten
   </p>
   <p>
    years of endeavour to graft technical belief on actual scepticism. The
   </p>
   <p>
    man and the ecclesiastic fought within him, and the victory fell to the
   </p>
   <p>
    man.
   </p>
   <p>
    “My dear girl,” he said, “it will be just the same.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Then will you give him a Christian burial?” she asked quickly.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Vicar felt himself cornered. Hearing of the baby’s illness, he had
   </p>
   <p>
    conscientiously gone to the house after nightfall to perform the rite,
   </p>
   <p>
    and, unaware that the refusal to admit him had come from Tess’s father
   </p>
   <p>
    and not from Tess, he could not allow the plea of necessity for its
   </p>
   <p>
    irregular administration.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah—that’s another matter,” he said.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Another matter—why?” asked Tess, rather warmly.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well—I would willingly do so if only we two were concerned. But I must
   </p>
   <p>
    not—for certain reasons.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Just for once, sir!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Really I must not.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O sir!” She seized his hand as she spoke.
   </p>
   <p>
    He withdrew it, shaking his head.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Then I don’t like you!” she burst out, “and I’ll never come to your
   </p>
   <p>
    church no more!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Don’t talk so rashly.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Perhaps it will be just the same to him if you don’t?... Will it be
   </p>
   <p>
    just the same? Don’t for God’s sake speak as saint to sinner, but as
   </p>
   <p>
    you yourself to me myself—poor me!”
   </p>
   <p>
    How the Vicar reconciled his answer with the strict notions he supposed
   </p>
   <p>
    himself to hold on these subjects it is beyond a layman’s power to
   </p>
   <p>
    tell, though not to excuse. Somewhat moved, he said in this case also—
   </p>
   <p>
    “It will be just the same.”
   </p>
   <p>
    So the baby was carried in a small deal box, under an ancient woman’s
   </p>
   <p>
    shawl, to the churchyard that night, and buried by lantern-light, at
   </p>
   <p>
    the cost of a shilling and a pint of beer to the sexton, in that shabby
   </p>
   <p>
    corner of God’s allotment where He lets the nettles grow, and where all
   </p>
   <p>
    unbaptized infants, notorious drunkards, suicides, and others of the
   </p>
   <p>
    conjecturally damned are laid. In spite of the untoward surroundings,
   </p>
   <p>
    however, Tess bravely made a little cross of two laths and a piece of
   </p>
   <p>
    string, and having bound it with flowers, she stuck it up at the head
   </p>
   <p>
    of the grave one evening when she could enter the churchyard without
   </p>
   <p>
    being seen, putting at the foot also a bunch of the same flowers in a
   </p>
   <p>
    little jar of water to keep them alive. What matter was it that on the
   </p>
   <p>
    outside of the jar the eye of mere observation noted the words
   </p>
   <p>
    “Keelwell’s Marmalade”? The eye of maternal affection did not see them
   </p>
   <p>
    in its vision of higher things.
   </p>
   <p>
    XV
   </p>
   <p>
    “By experience,” says Roger Ascham, “we find out a short way by a long
   </p>
   <p>
    wandering.” Not seldom that long wandering unfits us for further
   </p>
   <p>
    travel, and of what use is our experience to us then? Tess
   </p>
   <p>
    Durbeyfield’s experience was of this incapacitating kind. At last she
   </p>
   <p>
    had learned what to do; but who would now accept her doing?
   </p>
   <p>
    If before going to the d’Urbervilles’ she had vigorously moved under
   </p>
   <p>
    the guidance of sundry gnomic texts and phrases known to her and to the
   </p>
   <p>
    world in general, no doubt she would never have been imposed on. But it
   </p>
   <p>
    had not been in Tess’s power—nor is it in anybody’s power—to feel the
   </p>
   <p>
    whole truth of golden opinions while it is possible to profit by them.
   </p>
   <p>
    She—and how many more—might have ironically said to God with Saint
   </p>
   <p>
    Augustine: “Thou hast counselled a better course than Thou hast
   </p>
   <p>
    permitted.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She remained at her father’s house during the winter months, plucking
   </p>
   <p>
    fowls, or cramming turkeys and geese, or making clothes for her sisters
   </p>
   <p>
    and brothers out of some finery which d’Urberville had given her, and
   </p>
   <p>
    she had put by with contempt. Apply to him she would not. But she would
   </p>
   <p>
    often clasp her hands behind her head and muse when she was supposed to
   </p>
   <p>
    be working hard.
   </p>
   <p>
    She philosophically noted dates as they came past in the revolution of
   </p>
   <p>
    the year; the disastrous night of her undoing at Trantridge with its
   </p>
   <p>
    dark background of The Chase; also the dates of the baby’s birth and
   </p>
   <p>
    death; also her own birthday; and every other day individualized by
   </p>
   <p>
    incidents in which she had taken some share. She suddenly thought one
   </p>
   <p>
    afternoon, when looking in the glass at her fairness, that there was
   </p>
   <p>
    yet another date, of greater importance to her than those; that of her
   </p>
   <p>
    own death, when all these charms would have disappeared; a day which
   </p>
   <p>
    lay sly and unseen among all the other days of the year, giving no sign
   </p>
   <p>
    or sound when she annually passed over it; but not the less surely
   </p>
   <p>
    there. When was it? Why did she not feel the chill of each yearly
   </p>
   <p>
    encounter with such a cold relation? She had Jeremy Taylor’s thought
   </p>
   <p>
    that some time in the future those who had known her would say: “It is
   </p>
   <p>
    the ——th, the day that poor Tess Durbeyfield died”; and there would be
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing singular to their minds in the statement. Of that day, doomed
   </p>
   <p>
    to be her terminus in time through all the ages, she did not know the
   </p>
   <p>
    place in month, week, season or year.
   </p>
   <p>
    Almost at a leap Tess thus changed from simple girl to complex woman.
   </p>
   <p>
    Symbols of reflectiveness passed into her face, and a note of tragedy
   </p>
   <p>
    at times into her voice. Her eyes grew larger and more eloquent. She
   </p>
   <p>
    became what would have been called a fine creature; her aspect was fair
   </p>
   <p>
    and arresting; her soul that of a woman whom the turbulent experiences
   </p>
   <p>
    of the last year or two had quite failed to demoralize. But for the
   </p>
   <p>
    world’s opinion those experiences would have been simply a liberal
   </p>
   <p>
    education.
   </p>
   <p>
    She had held so aloof of late that her trouble, never generally known,
   </p>
   <p>
    was nearly forgotten in Marlott. But it became evident to her that she
   </p>
   <p>
    could never be really comfortable again in a place which had seen the
   </p>
   <p>
    collapse of her family’s attempt to “claim kin”—and, through her, even
   </p>
   <p>
    closer union—with the rich d’Urbervilles. At least she could not be
   </p>
   <p>
    comfortable there till long years should have obliterated her keen
   </p>
   <p>
    consciousness of it. Yet even now Tess felt the pulse of hopeful life
   </p>
   <p>
    still warm within her; she might be happy in some nook which had no
   </p>
   <p>
    memories. To escape the past and all that appertained thereto was to
   </p>
   <p>
    annihilate it, and to do that she would have to get away.
   </p>
   <p>
    Was once lost always lost really true of chastity? she would ask
   </p>
   <p>
    herself. She might prove it false if she could veil bygones. The
   </p>
   <p>
    recuperative power which pervaded organic nature was surely not denied
   </p>
   <p>
    to maidenhood alone.
   </p>
   <p>
    She waited a long time without finding opportunity for a new departure.
   </p>
   <p>
    A particularly fine spring came round, and the stir of germination was
   </p>
   <p>
    almost audible in the buds; it moved her, as it moved the wild animals,
   </p>
   <p>
    and made her passionate to go. At last, one day in early May, a letter
   </p>
   <p>
    reached her from a former friend of her mother’s, to whom she had
   </p>
   <p>
    addressed inquiries long before—a person whom she had never seen—that a
   </p>
   <p>
    skilful milkmaid was required at a dairy-house many miles to the
   </p>
   <p>
    southward, and that the dairyman would be glad to have her for the
   </p>
   <p>
    summer months.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was not quite so far off as could have been wished; but it was
   </p>
   <p>
    probably far enough, her radius of movement and repute having been so
   </p>
   <p>
    small. To persons of limited spheres, miles are as geographical
   </p>
   <p>
    degrees, parishes as counties, counties as provinces and kingdoms.
   </p>
   <p>
    On one point she was resolved: there should be no more d’Urberville
   </p>
   <p>
    air-castles in the dreams and deeds of her new life. She would be the
   </p>
   <p>
    dairymaid Tess, and nothing more. Her mother knew Tess’s feeling on
   </p>
   <p>
    this point so well, though no words had passed between them on the
   </p>
   <p>
    subject, that she never alluded to the knightly ancestry now.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet such is human inconsistency that one of the interests of the new
   </p>
   <p>
    place to her was the accidental virtues of its lying near her
   </p>
   <p>
    forefathers’ country (for they were not Blakemore men, though her
   </p>
   <p>
    mother was Blakemore to the bone). The dairy called Talbothays, for
   </p>
   <p>
    which she was bound, stood not remotely from some of the former estates
   </p>
   <p>
    of the d’Urbervilles, near the great family vaults of her granddames
   </p>
   <p>
    and their powerful husbands. She would be able to look at them, and
   </p>
   <p>
    think not only that d’Urberville, like Babylon, had fallen, but that
   </p>
   <p>
    the individual innocence of a humble descendant could lapse as
   </p>
   <p>
    silently. All the while she wondered if any strange good thing might
   </p>
   <p>
    come of her being in her ancestral land; and some spirit within her
   </p>
   <p>
    rose automatically as the sap in the twigs. It was unexpected youth,
   </p>
   <p>
    surging up anew after its temporary check, and bringing with it hope,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the invincible instinct towards self-delight.
   </p>
   <p>
    End of Phase the Second

   <p>
    Phase the Third:
   </p>
   <p>
    The Rally
   </p>
   <p>
    XVI
   </p>
   <p>
    On a thyme-scented, bird-hatching morning in May, between two and three
   </p>
   <p>
    years after the return from Trantridge—silent, reconstructive years for
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess Durbeyfield—she left her home for the second time.
   </p>
   <p>
    Having packed up her luggage so that it could be sent to her later, she
   </p>
   <p>
    started in a hired trap for the little town of Stourcastle, through
   </p>
   <p>
    which it was necessary to pass on her journey, now in a direction
   </p>
   <p>
    almost opposite to that of her first adventuring. On the curve of the
   </p>
   <p>
    nearest hill she looked back regretfully at Marlott and her father’s
   </p>
   <p>
    house, although she had been so anxious to get away.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her kindred dwelling there would probably continue their daily lives as
   </p>
   <p>
    heretofore, with no great diminution of pleasure in their
   </p>
   <p>
    consciousness, although she would be far off, and they deprived of her
   </p>
   <p>
    smile. In a few days the children would engage in their games as
   </p>
   <p>
    merrily as ever, without the sense of any gap left by her departure.
   </p>
   <p>
    This leaving of the younger children she had decided to be for the
   </p>
   <p>
    best; were she to remain they would probably gain less good by her
   </p>
   <p>
    precepts than harm by her example.
   </p>
   <p>
    She went through Stourcastle without pausing and onward to a junction
   </p>
   <p>
    of highways, where she could await a carrier’s van that ran to the
   </p>
   <p>
    south-west; for the railways which engirdled this interior tract of
   </p>
   <p>
    country had never yet struck across it. While waiting, however, there
   </p>
   <p>
    came along a farmer in his spring cart, driving approximately in the
   </p>
   <p>
    direction that she wished to pursue. Though he was a stranger to her
   </p>
   <p>
    she accepted his offer of a seat beside him, ignoring that its motive
   </p>
   <p>
    was a mere tribute to her countenance. He was going to Weatherbury, and
   </p>
   <p>
    by accompanying him thither she could walk the remainder of the
   </p>
   <p>
    distance instead of travelling in the van by way of Casterbridge.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess did not stop at Weatherbury, after this long drive, further than
   </p>
   <p>
    to make a slight nondescript meal at noon at a cottage to which the
   </p>
   <p>
    farmer recommended her. Thence she started on foot, basket in hand, to
   </p>
   <p>
    reach the wide upland of heath dividing this district from the
   </p>
   <p>
    low-lying meads of a further valley in which the dairy stood that was
   </p>
   <p>
    the aim and end of her day’s pilgrimage.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess had never before visited this part of the country, and yet she
   </p>
   <p>
    felt akin to the landscape. Not so very far to the left of her she
   </p>
   <p>
    could discern a dark patch in the scenery, which inquiry confirmed her
   </p>
   <p>
    in supposing to be trees marking the environs of Kingsbere—in the
   </p>
   <p>
    church of which parish the bones of her ancestors—her useless
   </p>
   <p>
    ancestors—lay entombed.
   </p>
   <p>
    She had no admiration for them now; she almost hated them for the dance
   </p>
   <p>
    they had led her; not a thing of all that had been theirs did she
   </p>
   <p>
    retain but the old seal and spoon. “Pooh—I have as much of mother as
   </p>
   <p>
    father in me!” she said. “All my prettiness comes from her, and she was
   </p>
   <p>
    only a dairymaid.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The journey over the intervening uplands and lowlands of Egdon, when
   </p>
   <p>
    she reached them, was a more troublesome walk than she had anticipated,
   </p>
   <p>
    the distance being actually but a few miles. It was two hours, owing to
   </p>
   <p>
    sundry wrong turnings, ere she found herself on a summit commanding the
   </p>
   <p>
    long-sought-for vale, the Valley of the Great Dairies, the valley in
   </p>
   <p>
    which milk and butter grew to rankness, and were produced more
   </p>
   <p>
    profusely, if less delicately, than at her home—the verdant plain so
   </p>
   <p>
    well watered by the river Var or Froom.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was intrinsically different from the Vale of Little Dairies,
   </p>
   <p>
    Blackmoor Vale, which, save during her disastrous sojourn at
   </p>
   <p>
    Trantridge, she had exclusively known till now. The world was drawn to
   </p>
   <p>
    a larger pattern here. The enclosures numbered fifty acres instead of
   </p>
   <p>
    ten, the farmsteads were more extended, the groups of cattle formed
   </p>
   <p>
    tribes hereabout; there only families. These myriads of cows stretching
   </p>
   <p>
    under her eyes from the far east to the far west outnumbered any she
   </p>
   <p>
    had ever seen at one glance before. The green lea was speckled as
   </p>
   <p>
    thickly with them as a canvas by Van Alsloot or Sallaert with burghers.
   </p>
   <p>
    The ripe hue of the red and dun kine absorbed the evening sunlight,
   </p>
   <p>
    which the white-coated animals returned to the eye in rays almost
   </p>
   <p>
    dazzling, even at the distant elevation on which she stood.
   </p>
   <p>
    The bird’s-eye perspective before her was not so luxuriantly beautiful,
   </p>
   <p>
    perhaps, as that other one which she knew so well; yet it was more
   </p>
   <p>
    cheering. It lacked the intensely blue atmosphere of the rival vale,
   </p>
   <p>
    and its heavy soils and scents; the new air was clear, bracing,
   </p>
   <p>
    ethereal. The river itself, which nourished the grass and cows of these
   </p>
   <p>
    renowned dairies, flowed not like the streams in Blackmoor. Those were
   </p>
   <p>
    slow, silent, often turbid; flowing over beds of mud into which the
   </p>
   <p>
    incautious wader might sink and vanish unawares. The Froom waters were
   </p>
   <p>
    clear as the pure River of Life shown to the Evangelist, rapid as the
   </p>
   <p>
    shadow of a cloud, with pebbly shallows that prattled to the sky all
   </p>
   <p>
    day long. There the water-flower was the lily; the crow-foot here.
   </p>
   <p>
    Either the change in the quality of the air from heavy to light, or the
   </p>
   <p>
    sense of being amid new scenes where there were no invidious eyes upon
   </p>
   <p>
    her, sent up her spirits wonderfully. Her hopes mingled with the
   </p>
   <p>
    sunshine in an ideal photosphere which surrounded her as she bounded
   </p>
   <p>
    along against the soft south wind. She heard a pleasant voice in every
   </p>
   <p>
    breeze, and in every bird’s note seemed to lurk a joy.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her face had latterly changed with changing states of mind, continually
   </p>
   <p>
    fluctuating between beauty and ordinariness, according as the thoughts
   </p>
   <p>
    were gay or grave. One day she was pink and flawless; another pale and
   </p>
   <p>
    tragical. When she was pink she was feeling less than when pale; her
   </p>
   <p>
    more perfect beauty accorded with her less elevated mood; her more
   </p>
   <p>
    intense mood with her less perfect beauty. It was her best face
   </p>
   <p>
    physically that was now set against the south wind.
   </p>
   <p>
    The irresistible, universal, automatic tendency to find sweet pleasure
   </p>
   <p>
    somewhere, which pervades all life, from the meanest to the highest,
   </p>
   <p>
    had at length mastered Tess. Being even now only a young woman of
   </p>
   <p>
    twenty, one who mentally and sentimentally had not finished growing, it
   </p>
   <p>
    was impossible that any event should have left upon her an impression
   </p>
   <p>
    that was not in time capable of transmutation.
   </p>
   <p>
    And thus her spirits, and her thankfulness, and her hopes, rose higher
   </p>
   <p>
    and higher. She tried several ballads, but found them inadequate; till,
   </p>
   <p>
    recollecting the psalter that her eyes had so often wandered over of a
   </p>
   <p>
    Sunday morning before she had eaten of the tree of knowledge, she
   </p>
   <p>
    chanted: “O ye Sun and Moon ... O ye Stars ... ye Green Things upon the
   </p>
   <p>
    Earth ... ye Fowls of the Air ... Beasts and Cattle ... Children of Men
   </p>
   <p>
    ... bless ye the Lord, praise Him and magnify Him forever!”
   </p>
   <p>
    She suddenly stopped and murmured: “But perhaps I don’t quite know the
   </p>
   <p>
    Lord as yet.”
   </p>
   <p>
    And probably the half-unconscious rhapsody was a Fetishistic utterance
   </p>
   <p>
    in a Monotheistic setting; women whose chief companions are the forms
   </p>
   <p>
    and forces of outdoor Nature retain in their souls far more of the
   </p>
   <p>
    Pagan fantasy of their remote forefathers than of the systematized
   </p>
   <p>
    religion taught their race at later date. However, Tess found at least
   </p>
   <p>
    approximate expression for her feelings in the old _Benedicite_ that
   </p>
   <p>
    she had lisped from infancy; and it was enough. Such high contentment
   </p>
   <p>
    with such a slight initial performance as that of having started
   </p>
   <p>
    towards a means of independent living was a part of the Durbeyfield
   </p>
   <p>
    temperament. Tess really wished to walk uprightly, while her father did
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing of the kind; but she resembled him in being content with
   </p>
   <p>
    immediate and small achievements, and in having no mind for laborious
   </p>
   <p>
    effort towards such petty social advancement as could alone be effected
   </p>
   <p>
    by a family so heavily handicapped as the once powerful d’Urbervilles
   </p>
   <p>
    were now.
   </p>
   <p>
    There was, it might be said, the energy of her mother’s unexpended
   </p>
   <p>
    family, as well as the natural energy of Tess’s years, rekindled after
   </p>
   <p>
    the experience which had so overwhelmed her for the time. Let the truth
   </p>
   <p>
    be told—women do as a rule live through such humiliations, and regain
   </p>
   <p>
    their spirits, and again look about them with an interested eye. While
   </p>
   <p>
    there’s life there’s hope is a conviction not so entirely unknown to
   </p>
   <p>
    the “betrayed” as some amiable theorists would have us believe.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess Durbeyfield, then, in good heart, and full of zest for life,
   </p>
   <p>
    descended the Egdon slopes lower and lower towards the dairy of her
   </p>
   <p>
    pilgrimage.
   </p>
   <p>
    The marked difference, in the final particular, between the rival vales
   </p>
   <p>
    now showed itself. The secret of Blackmoor was best discovered from the
   </p>
   <p>
    heights around; to read aright the valley before her it was necessary
   </p>
   <p>
    to descend into its midst. When Tess had accomplished this feat she
   </p>
   <p>
    found herself to be standing on a carpeted level, which stretched to
   </p>
   <p>
    the east and west as far as the eye could reach.
   </p>
   <p>
    The river had stolen from the higher tracts and brought in particles to
   </p>
   <p>
    the vale all this horizontal land; and now, exhausted, aged, and
   </p>
   <p>
    attenuated, lay serpentining along through the midst of its former
   </p>
   <p>
    spoils.
   </p>
   <p>
    Not quite sure of her direction, Tess stood still upon the hemmed
   </p>
   <p>
    expanse of verdant flatness, like a fly on a billiard-table of
   </p>
   <p>
    indefinite length, and of no more consequence to the surroundings than
   </p>
   <p>
    that fly. The sole effect of her presence upon the placid valley so far
   </p>
   <p>
    had been to excite the mind of a solitary heron, which, after
   </p>
   <p>
    descending to the ground not far from her path, stood with neck erect,
   </p>
   <p>
    looking at her.
   </p>
   <p>
    Suddenly there arose from all parts of the lowland a prolonged and
   </p>
   <p>
    repeated call—“Waow! waow! waow!”
   </p>
   <p>
    From the furthest east to the furthest west the cries spread as if by
   </p>
   <p>
    contagion, accompanied in some cases by the barking of a dog. It was
   </p>
   <p>
    not the expression of the valley’s consciousness that beautiful Tess
   </p>
   <p>
    had arrived, but the ordinary announcement of milking-time—half-past
   </p>
   <p>
    four o’clock, when the dairymen set about getting in the cows.
   </p>
   <p>
    The red and white herd nearest at hand, which had been phlegmatically
   </p>
   <p>
    waiting for the call, now trooped towards the steading in the
   </p>
   <p>
    background, their great bags of milk swinging under them as they
   </p>
   <p>
    walked. Tess followed slowly in their rear, and entered the barton by
   </p>
   <p>
    the open gate through which they had entered before her. Long thatched
   </p>
   <p>
    sheds stretched round the enclosure, their slopes encrusted with vivid
   </p>
   <p>
    green moss, and their eaves supported by wooden posts rubbed to a
   </p>
   <p>
    glossy smoothness by the flanks of infinite cows and calves of bygone
   </p>
   <p>
    years, now passed to an oblivion almost inconceivable in its
   </p>
   <p>
    profundity. Between the post were ranged the milchers, each exhibiting
   </p>
   <p>
    herself at the present moment to a whimsical eye in the rear as a
   </p>
   <p>
    circle on two stalks, down the centre of which a switch moved
   </p>
   <p>
    pendulum-wise; while the sun, lowering itself behind this patient row,
   </p>
   <p>
    threw their shadows accurately inwards upon the wall. Thus it threw
   </p>
   <p>
    shadows of these obscure and homely figures every evening with as much
   </p>
   <p>
    care over each contour as if it had been the profile of a court beauty
   </p>
   <p>
    on a palace wall; copied them as diligently as it had copied Olympian
   </p>
   <p>
    shapes on marble _façades_ long ago, or the outline of Alexander,
   </p>
   <p>
    Caesar, and the Pharaohs.
   </p>
   <p>
    They were the less restful cows that were stalled. Those that would
   </p>
   <p>
    stand still of their own will were milked in the middle of the yard,
   </p>
   <p>
    where many of such better behaved ones stood waiting now—all prime
   </p>
   <p>
    milchers, such as were seldom seen out of this valley, and not always
   </p>
   <p>
    within it; nourished by the succulent feed which the water-meads
   </p>
   <p>
    supplied at this prime season of the year. Those of them that were
   </p>
   <p>
    spotted with white reflected the sunshine in dazzling brilliancy, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the polished brass knobs of their horns glittered with something of
   </p>
   <p>
    military display. Their large-veined udders hung ponderous as sandbags,
   </p>
   <p>
    the teats sticking out like the legs of a gipsy’s crock; and as each
   </p>
   <p>
    animal lingered for her turn to arrive the milk oozed forth and fell in
   </p>
   <p>
    drops to the ground.
   </p>
   <p>
    XVII
   </p>
   <p>
    The dairymaids and men had flocked down from their cottages and out of
   </p>
   <p>
    the dairy-house with the arrival of the cows from the meads; the maids
   </p>
   <p>
    walking in pattens, not on account of the weather, but to keep their
   </p>
   <p>
    shoes above the mulch of the barton. Each girl sat down on her
   </p>
   <p>
    three-legged stool, her face sideways, her right cheek resting against
   </p>
   <p>
    the cow, and looked musingly along the animal’s flank at Tess as she
   </p>
   <p>
    approached. The male milkers, with hat-brims turned down, resting flat
   </p>
   <p>
    on their foreheads and gazing on the ground, did not observe her.
   </p>
   <p>
    One of these was a sturdy middle-aged man—whose long white “pinner” was
   </p>
   <p>
    somewhat finer and cleaner than the wraps of the others, and whose
   </p>
   <p>
    jacket underneath had a presentable marketing aspect—the
   </p>
   <p>
    master-dairyman, of whom she was in quest, his double character as a
   </p>
   <p>
    working milker and butter maker here during six days, and on the
   </p>
   <p>
    seventh as a man in shining broad-cloth in his family pew at church,
   </p>
   <p>
    being so marked as to have inspired a rhyme:
   </p>
   <p>
    Dairyman Dick
   </p>
   <p>
    All the week:
   </p>
   <p>
    On Sundays Mister Richard Crick.
   </p>
   <p>
    Seeing Tess standing at gaze he went across to her.
   </p>
   <p>
    The majority of dairymen have a cross manner at milking time, but it
   </p>
   <p>
    happened that Mr Crick was glad to get a new hand—for the days were
   </p>
   <p>
    busy ones now—and he received her warmly; inquiring for her mother and
   </p>
   <p>
    the rest of the family—(though this as a matter of form merely, for in
   </p>
   <p>
    reality he had not been aware of Mrs Durbeyfield’s existence till
   </p>
   <p>
    apprised of the fact by a brief business-letter about Tess).
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh—ay, as a lad I knowed your part o’ the country very well,” he said
   </p>
   <p>
    terminatively. “Though I’ve never been there since. And a aged woman of
   </p>
   <p>
    ninety that use to live nigh here, but is dead and gone long ago, told
   </p>
   <p>
    me that a family of some such name as yours in Blackmoor Vale came
   </p>
   <p>
    originally from these parts, and that ’twere a old ancient race that
   </p>
   <p>
    had all but perished off the earth—though the new generations didn’t
   </p>
   <p>
    know it. But, Lord, I took no notice of the old woman’s ramblings, not
   </p>
   <p>
    I.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh no—it is nothing,” said Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then the talk was of business only.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You can milk ’em clean, my maidy? I don’t want my cows going azew at
   </p>
   <p>
    this time o’ year.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She reassured him on that point, and he surveyed her up and down. She
   </p>
   <p>
    had been staying indoors a good deal, and her complexion had grown
   </p>
   <p>
    delicate.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Quite sure you can stand it? ’Tis comfortable enough here for rough
   </p>
   <p>
    folk; but we don’t live in a cowcumber frame.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She declared that she could stand it, and her zest and willingness
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed to win him over.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, I suppose you’ll want a dish o’ tay, or victuals of some sort,
   </p>
   <p>
    hey? Not yet? Well, do as ye like about it. But faith, if ’twas I, I
   </p>
   <p>
    should be as dry as a kex wi’ travelling so far.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’ll begin milking now, to get my hand in,” said Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    She drank a little milk as temporary refreshment—to the
   </p>
   <p>
    surprise—indeed, slight contempt—of Dairyman Crick, to whose mind it
   </p>
   <p>
    had apparently never occurred that milk was good as a beverage.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh, if ye can swaller that, be it so,” he said indifferently, while
   </p>
   <p>
    holding up the pail that she sipped from. “’Tis what I hain’t touched
   </p>
   <p>
    for years—not I. Rot the stuff; it would lie in my innerds like lead.
   </p>
   <p>
    You can try your hand upon she,” he pursued, nodding to the nearest
   </p>
   <p>
    cow. “Not but what she do milk rather hard. We’ve hard ones and we’ve
   </p>
   <p>
    easy ones, like other folks. However, you’ll find out that soon
   </p>
   <p>
    enough.”
   </p>
   <p>
    When Tess had changed her bonnet for a hood, and was really on her
   </p>
   <p>
    stool under the cow, and the milk was squirting from her fists into the
   </p>
   <p>
    pail, she appeared to feel that she really had laid a new foundation
   </p>
   <p>
    for her future. The conviction bred serenity, her pulse slowed, and she
   </p>
   <p>
    was able to look about her.
   </p>
   <p>
    The milkers formed quite a little battalion of men and maids, the men
   </p>
   <p>
    operating on the hard-teated animals, the maids on the kindlier
   </p>
   <p>
    natures. It was a large dairy. There were nearly a hundred milchers
   </p>
   <p>
    under Crick’s management, all told; and of the herd the master-dairyman
   </p>
   <p>
    milked six or eight with his own hands, unless away from home. These
   </p>
   <p>
    were the cows that milked hardest of all; for his journey-milkmen being
   </p>
   <p>
    more or less casually hired, he would not entrust this half-dozen to
   </p>
   <p>
    their treatment, lest, from indifference, they should not milk them
   </p>
   <p>
    fully; nor to the maids, lest they should fail in the same way for lack
   </p>
   <p>
    of finger-grip; with the result that in course of time the cows would
   </p>
   <p>
    “go azew”—that is, dry up. It was not the loss for the moment that made
   </p>
   <p>
    slack milking so serious, but that with the decline of demand there
   </p>
   <p>
    came decline, and ultimately cessation, of supply.
   </p>
   <p>
    After Tess had settled down to her cow there was for a time no talk in
   </p>
   <p>
    the barton, and not a sound interfered with the purr of the milk-jets
   </p>
   <p>
    into the numerous pails, except a momentary exclamation to one or other
   </p>
   <p>
    of the beasts requesting her to turn round or stand still. The only
   </p>
   <p>
    movements were those of the milkers’ hands up and down, and the swing
   </p>
   <p>
    of the cows’ tails. Thus they all worked on, encompassed by the vast
   </p>
   <p>
    flat mead which extended to either slope of the valley—a level
   </p>
   <p>
    landscape compounded of old landscapes long forgotten, and, no doubt,
   </p>
   <p>
    differing in character very greatly from the landscape they composed
   </p>
   <p>
    now.
   </p>
   <p>
    “To my thinking,” said the dairyman, rising suddenly from a cow he had
   </p>
   <p>
    just finished off, snatching up his three-legged stool in one hand and
   </p>
   <p>
    the pail in the other, and moving on to the next hard-yielder in his
   </p>
   <p>
    vicinity, “to my thinking, the cows don’t gie down their milk to-day as
   </p>
   <p>
    usual. Upon my life, if Winker do begin keeping back like this, she’ll
   </p>
   <p>
    not be worth going under by midsummer.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “’Tis because there’s a new hand come among us,” said Jonathan Kail.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’ve noticed such things afore.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “To be sure. It may be so. I didn’t think o’t.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’ve been told that it goes up into their horns at such times,” said a
   </p>
   <p>
    dairymaid.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, as to going up into their horns,” replied Dairyman Crick
   </p>
   <p>
    dubiously, as though even witchcraft might be limited by anatomical
   </p>
   <p>
    possibilities, “I couldn’t say; I certainly could not. But as nott cows
   </p>
   <p>
    will keep it back as well as the horned ones, I don’t quite agree to
   </p>
   <p>
    it. Do ye know that riddle about the nott cows, Jonathan? Why do nott
   </p>
   <p>
    cows give less milk in a year than horned?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t!” interposed the milkmaid, “Why do they?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Because there bain’t so many of ’em,” said the dairyman. “Howsomever,
   </p>
   <p>
    these gam’sters do certainly keep back their milk to-day. Folks, we
   </p>
   <p>
    must lift up a stave or two—that’s the only cure for’t.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Songs were often resorted to in dairies hereabout as an enticement to
   </p>
   <p>
    the cows when they showed signs of withholding their usual yield; and
   </p>
   <p>
    the band of milkers at this request burst into melody—in purely
   </p>
   <p>
    business-like tones, it is true, and with no great spontaneity; the
   </p>
   <p>
    result, according to their own belief, being a decided improvement
   </p>
   <p>
    during the song’s continuance. When they had gone through fourteen or
   </p>
   <p>
    fifteen verses of a cheerful ballad about a murderer who was afraid to
   </p>
   <p>
    go to bed in the dark because he saw certain brimstone flames around
   </p>
   <p>
    him, one of the male milkers said—
   </p>
   <p>
    “I wish singing on the stoop didn’t use up so much of a man’s wind! You
   </p>
   <p>
    should get your harp, sir; not but what a fiddle is best.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess, who had given ear to this, thought the words were addressed to
   </p>
   <p>
    the dairyman, but she was wrong. A reply, in the shape of “Why?” came
   </p>
   <p>
    as it were out of the belly of a dun cow in the stalls; it had been
   </p>
   <p>
    spoken by a milker behind the animal, whom she had not hitherto
   </p>
   <p>
    perceived.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh yes; there’s nothing like a fiddle,” said the dairyman. “Though I
   </p>
   <p>
    do think that bulls are more moved by a tune than cows—at least that’s
   </p>
   <p>
    my experience. Once there was an old aged man over at Mellstock—William
   </p>
   <p>
    Dewy by name—one of the family that used to do a good deal of business
   </p>
   <p>
    as tranters over there—Jonathan, do ye mind?—I knowed the man by sight
   </p>
   <p>
    as well as I know my own brother, in a manner of speaking. Well, this
   </p>
   <p>
    man was a coming home along from a wedding, where he had been playing
   </p>
   <p>
    his fiddle, one fine moonlight night, and for shortness’ sake he took a
   </p>
   <p>
    cut across Forty-acres, a field lying that way, where a bull was out to
   </p>
   <p>
    grass. The bull seed William, and took after him, horns aground, begad;
   </p>
   <p>
    and though William runned his best, and hadn’t _much_ drink in him
   </p>
   <p>
    (considering ’twas a wedding, and the folks well off), he found he’d
   </p>
   <p>
    never reach the fence and get over in time to save himself. Well, as a
   </p>
   <p>
    last thought, he pulled out his fiddle as he runned, and struck up a
   </p>
   <p>
    jig, turning to the bull, and backing towards the corner. The bull
   </p>
   <p>
    softened down, and stood still, looking hard at William Dewy, who
   </p>
   <p>
    fiddled on and on; till a sort of a smile stole over the bull’s face.
   </p>
   <p>
    But no sooner did William stop his playing and turn to get over hedge
   </p>
   <p>
    than the bull would stop his smiling and lower his horns towards the
   </p>
   <p>
    seat of William’s breeches. Well, William had to turn about and play
   </p>
   <p>
    on, willy-nilly; and ’twas only three o’clock in the world, and ’a
   </p>
   <p>
    knowed that nobody would come that way for hours, and he so leery and
   </p>
   <p>
    tired that ’a didn’t know what to do. When he had scraped till about
   </p>
   <p>
    four o’clock he felt that he verily would have to give over soon, and
   </p>
   <p>
    he said to himself, ‘There’s only this last tune between me and eternal
   </p>
   <p>
    welfare! Heaven save me, or I’m a done man.’ Well, then he called to
   </p>
   <p>
    mind how he’d seen the cattle kneel o’ Christmas Eves in the dead o’
   </p>
   <p>
    night. It was not Christmas Eve then, but it came into his head to play
   </p>
   <p>
    a trick upon the bull. So he broke into the ’Tivity Hymm, just as at
   </p>
   <p>
    Christmas carol-singing; when, lo and behold, down went the bull on his
   </p>
   <p>
    bended knees, in his ignorance, just as if ’twere the true ’Tivity
   </p>
   <p>
    night and hour. As soon as his horned friend were down, William turned,
   </p>
   <p>
    clinked off like a long-dog, and jumped safe over hedge, before the
   </p>
   <p>
    praying bull had got on his feet again to take after him. William used
   </p>
   <p>
    to say that he’d seen a man look a fool a good many times, but never
   </p>
   <p>
    such a fool as that bull looked when he found his pious feelings had
   </p>
   <p>
    been played upon, and ’twas not Christmas Eve. Yes, William Dewy, that
   </p>
   <p>
    was the man’s name; and I can tell you to a foot where’s he a-lying in
   </p>
   <p>
    Mellstock Churchyard at this very moment—just between the second
   </p>
   <p>
    yew-tree and the north aisle.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It’s a curious story; it carries us back to medieval times, when faith
   </p>
   <p>
    was a living thing!”
   </p>
   <p>
    The remark, singular for a dairy-yard, was murmured by the voice behind
   </p>
   <p>
    the dun cow; but as nobody understood the reference, no notice was
   </p>
   <p>
    taken, except that the narrator seemed to think it might imply
   </p>
   <p>
    scepticism as to his tale.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, ’tis quite true, sir, whether or no. I knowed the man well.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh yes; I have no doubt of it,” said the person behind the dun cow.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess’s attention was thus attracted to the dairyman’s interlocutor, of
   </p>
   <p>
    whom she could see but the merest patch, owing to his burying his head
   </p>
   <p>
    so persistently in the flank of the milcher. She could not understand
   </p>
   <p>
    why he should be addressed as “sir” even by the dairyman himself. But
   </p>
   <p>
    no explanation was discernible; he remained under the cow long enough
   </p>
   <p>
    to have milked three, uttering a private ejaculation now and then, as
   </p>
   <p>
    if he could not get on.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Take it gentle, sir; take it gentle,” said the dairyman. “’Tis knack,
   </p>
   <p>
    not strength, that does it.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “So I find,” said the other, standing up at last and stretching his
   </p>
   <p>
    arms. “I think I have finished her, however, though she made my fingers
   </p>
   <p>
    ache.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess could then see him at full length. He wore the ordinary white
   </p>
   <p>
    pinner and leather leggings of a dairy-farmer when milking, and his
   </p>
   <p>
    boots were clogged with the mulch of the yard; but this was all his
   </p>
   <p>
    local livery. Beneath it was something educated, reserved, subtle, sad,
   </p>
   <p>
    differing.
   </p>
   <p>
    But the details of his aspect were temporarily thrust aside by the
   </p>
   <p>
    discovery that he was one whom she had seen before. Such vicissitudes
   </p>
   <p>
    had Tess passed through since that time that for a moment she could not
   </p>
   <p>
    remember where she had met him; and then it flashed upon her that he
   </p>
   <p>
    was the pedestrian who had joined in the club-dance at Marlott—the
   </p>
   <p>
    passing stranger who had come she knew not whence, had danced with
   </p>
   <p>
    others but not with her, and slightingly left her, and gone on his way
   </p>
   <p>
    with his friends.
   </p>
   <p>
    The flood of memories brought back by this revival of an incident
   </p>
   <p>
    anterior to her troubles produced a momentary dismay lest, recognizing
   </p>
   <p>
    her also, he should by some means discover her story. But it passed
   </p>
   <p>
    away when she found no sign of remembrance in him. She saw by degrees
   </p>
   <p>
    that since their first and only encounter his mobile face had grown
   </p>
   <p>
    more thoughtful, and had acquired a young man’s shapely moustache and
   </p>
   <p>
    beard—the latter of the palest straw colour where it began upon his
   </p>
   <p>
    cheeks, and deepening to a warm brown farther from its root. Under his
   </p>
   <p>
    linen milking-pinner he wore a dark velveteen jacket, cord breeches and
   </p>
   <p>
    gaiters, and a starched white shirt. Without the milking-gear nobody
   </p>
   <p>
    could have guessed what he was. He might with equal probability have
   </p>
   <p>
    been an eccentric landowner or a gentlemanly ploughman. That he was but
   </p>
   <p>
    a novice at dairy work she had realized in a moment, from the time he
   </p>
   <p>
    had spent upon the milking of one cow.
   </p>
   <p>
    Meanwhile many of the milkmaids had said to one another of the
   </p>
   <p>
    newcomer, “How pretty she is!” with something of real generosity and
   </p>
   <p>
    admiration, though with a half hope that the auditors would qualify the
   </p>
   <p>
    assertion—which, strictly speaking, they might have done, prettiness
   </p>
   <p>
    being an inexact definition of what struck the eye in Tess. When the
   </p>
   <p>
    milking was finished for the evening they straggled indoors, where Mrs
   </p>
   <p>
    Crick, the dairyman’s wife—who was too respectable to go out milking
   </p>
   <p>
    herself, and wore a hot stuff gown in warm weather because the
   </p>
   <p>
    dairymaids wore prints—was giving an eye to the leads and things.
   </p>
   <p>
    Only two or three of the maids, Tess learnt, slept in the dairy-house
   </p>
   <p>
    besides herself, most of the helpers going to their homes. She saw
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing at supper-time of the superior milker who had commented on the
   </p>
   <p>
    story, and asked no questions about him, the remainder of the evening
   </p>
   <p>
    being occupied in arranging her place in the bed-chamber. It was a
   </p>
   <p>
    large room over the milk-house, some thirty feet long; the
   </p>
   <p>
    sleeping-cots of the other three indoor milkmaids being in the same
   </p>
   <p>
    apartment. They were blooming young women, and, except one, rather
   </p>
   <p>
    older than herself. By bedtime Tess was thoroughly tired, and fell
   </p>
   <p>
    asleep immediately.
   </p>
   <p>
    But one of the girls, who occupied an adjoining bed, was more wakeful
   </p>
   <p>
    than Tess, and would insist upon relating to the latter various
   </p>
   <p>
    particulars of the homestead into which she had just entered. The
   </p>
   <p>
    girl’s whispered words mingled with the shades, and, to Tess’s drowsy
   </p>
   <p>
    mind, they seemed to be generated by the darkness in which they
   </p>
   <p>
    floated.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Mr Angel Clare—he that is learning milking, and that plays the
   </p>
   <p>
    harp—never says much to us. He is a pa’son’s son, and is too much taken
   </p>
   <p>
    up wi’ his own thoughts to notice girls. He is the dairyman’s
   </p>
   <p>
    pupil—learning farming in all its branches. He has learnt sheep-farming
   </p>
   <p>
    at another place, and he’s now mastering dairy-work.... Yes, he is
   </p>
   <p>
    quite the gentleman-born. His father is the Reverend Mr Clare at
   </p>
   <p>
    Emminster—a good many miles from here.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh—I have heard of him,” said her companion, now awake. “A very
   </p>
   <p>
    earnest clergyman, is he not?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes—that he is—the earnestest man in all Wessex, they say—the last of
   </p>
   <p>
    the old Low Church sort, they tell me—for all about here be what they
   </p>
   <p>
    call High. All his sons, except our Mr Clare, be made pa’sons too.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess had not at this hour the curiosity to ask why the present Mr Clare
   </p>
   <p>
    was not made a parson like his brethren, and gradually fell asleep
   </p>
   <p>
    again, the words of her informant coming to her along with the smell of
   </p>
   <p>
    the cheeses in the adjoining cheeseloft, and the measured dripping of
   </p>
   <p>
    the whey from the wrings downstairs.
   </p>
   <p>
    XVIII
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel Clare rises out of the past not altogether as a distinct figure,
   </p>
   <p>
    but as an appreciative voice, a long regard of fixed, abstracted eyes,
   </p>
   <p>
    and a mobility of mouth somewhat too small and delicately lined for a
   </p>
   <p>
    man’s, though with an unexpectedly firm close of the lower lip now and
   </p>
   <p>
    then; enough to do away with any inference of indecision. Nevertheless,
   </p>
   <p>
    something nebulous, preoccupied, vague, in his bearing and regard,
   </p>
   <p>
    marked him as one who probably had no very definite aim or concern
   </p>
   <p>
    about his material future. Yet as a lad people had said of him that he
   </p>
   <p>
    was one who might do anything if he tried.
   </p>
   <p>
    He was the youngest son of his father, a poor parson at the other end
   </p>
   <p>
    of the county, and had arrived at Talbothays Dairy as a six months’
   </p>
   <p>
    pupil, after going the round of some other farms, his object being to
   </p>
   <p>
    acquire a practical skill in the various processes of farming, with a
   </p>
   <p>
    view either to the Colonies or the tenure of a home-farm, as
   </p>
   <p>
    circumstances might decide.
   </p>
   <p>
    His entry into the ranks of the agriculturists and breeders was a step
   </p>
   <p>
    in the young man’s career which had been anticipated neither by himself
   </p>
   <p>
    nor by others.
   </p>
   <p>
    Mr Clare the elder, whose first wife had died and left him a daughter,
   </p>
   <p>
    married a second late in life. This lady had somewhat unexpectedly
   </p>
   <p>
    brought him three sons, so that between Angel, the youngest, and his
   </p>
   <p>
    father the Vicar there seemed to be almost a missing generation. Of
   </p>
   <p>
    these boys the aforesaid Angel, the child of his old age, was the only
   </p>
   <p>
    son who had not taken a University degree, though he was the single one
   </p>
   <p>
    of them whose early promise might have done full justice to an
   </p>
   <p>
    academical training.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some two or three years before Angel’s appearance at the Marlott dance,
   </p>
   <p>
    on a day when he had left school and was pursuing his studies at home,
   </p>
   <p>
    a parcel came to the Vicarage from the local bookseller’s, directed to
   </p>
   <p>
    the Reverend James Clare. The Vicar having opened it and found it to
   </p>
   <p>
    contain a book, read a few pages; whereupon he jumped up from his seat
   </p>
   <p>
    and went straight to the shop with the book under his arm.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why has this been sent to my house?” he asked peremptorily, holding up
   </p>
   <p>
    the volume.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It was ordered, sir.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Not by me, or any one belonging to me, I am happy to say.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The shopkeeper looked into his order-book.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh, it has been misdirected, sir,” he said. “It was ordered by Mr
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel Clare, and should have been sent to him.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Mr Clare winced as if he had been struck. He went home pale and
   </p>
   <p>
    dejected, and called Angel into his study.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Look into this book, my boy,” he said. “What do you know about it?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I ordered it,” said Angel simply.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What for?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “To read.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “How can you think of reading it?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “How can I? Why—it is a system of philosophy. There is no more moral,
   </p>
   <p>
    or even religious, work published.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes—moral enough; I don’t deny that. But religious!—and for _you_, who
   </p>
   <p>
    intend to be a minister of the Gospel!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Since you have alluded to the matter, father,” said the son, with
   </p>
   <p>
    anxious thought upon his face, “I should like to say, once for all,
   </p>
   <p>
    that I should prefer not to take Orders. I fear I could not
   </p>
   <p>
    conscientiously do so. I love the Church as one loves a parent. I shall
   </p>
   <p>
    always have the warmest affection for her. There is no institution for
   </p>
   <p>
    whose history I have a deeper admiration; but I cannot honestly be
   </p>
   <p>
    ordained her minister, as my brothers are, while she refuses to
   </p>
   <p>
    liberate her mind from an untenable redemptive theolatry.”
   </p>
   <p>
    It had never occurred to the straightforward and simple-minded Vicar
   </p>
   <p>
    that one of his own flesh and blood could come to this! He was
   </p>
   <p>
    stultified, shocked, paralysed. And if Angel were not going to enter
   </p>
   <p>
    the Church, what was the use of sending him to Cambridge? The
   </p>
   <p>
    University as a step to anything but ordination seemed, to this man of
   </p>
   <p>
    fixed ideas, a preface without a volume. He was a man not merely
   </p>
   <p>
    religious, but devout; a firm believer—not as the phrase is now
   </p>
   <p>
    elusively construed by theological thimble-riggers in the Church and
   </p>
   <p>
    out of it, but in the old and ardent sense of the Evangelical school:
   </p>
   <p>
    one who could
   </p>
   <p>
    Indeed opine
   </p>
   <p>
    That the Eternal and Divine
   </p>
   <p>
    Did, eighteen centuries ago
   </p>
   <p>
    In very truth...
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel’s father tried argument, persuasion, entreaty.
   </p>
   <p>
    “No, father; I cannot underwrite Article Four (leave alone the rest),
   </p>
   <p>
    taking it ‘in the literal and grammatical sense’ as required by the
   </p>
   <p>
    Declaration; and, therefore, I can’t be a parson in the present state
   </p>
   <p>
    of affairs,” said Angel. “My whole instinct in matters of religion is
   </p>
   <p>
    towards reconstruction; to quote your favorite Epistle to the Hebrews,
   </p>
   <p>
    ‘the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are
   </p>
   <p>
    made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.’”
   </p>
   <p>
    His father grieved so deeply that it made Angel quite ill to see him.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What is the good of your mother and me economizing and stinting
   </p>
   <p>
    ourselves to give you a University education, if it is not to be used
   </p>
   <p>
    for the honour and glory of God?” his father repeated.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why, that it may be used for the honour and glory of man, father.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Perhaps if Angel had persevered he might have gone to Cambridge like
   </p>
   <p>
    his brothers. But the Vicar’s view of that seat of learning as a
   </p>
   <p>
    stepping-stone to Orders alone was quite a family tradition; and so
   </p>
   <p>
    rooted was the idea in his mind that perseverance began to appear to
   </p>
   <p>
    the sensitive son akin to an intent to misappropriate a trust, and
   </p>
   <p>
    wrong the pious heads of the household, who had been and were, as his
   </p>
   <p>
    father had hinted, compelled to exercise much thrift to carry out this
   </p>
   <p>
    uniform plan of education for the three young men.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I will do without Cambridge,” said Angel at last. “I feel that I have
   </p>
   <p>
    no right to go there in the circumstances.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The effects of this decisive debate were not long in showing
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves. He spent years and years in desultory studies,
   </p>
   <p>
    undertakings, and meditations; he began to evince considerable
   </p>
   <p>
    indifference to social forms and observances. The material distinctions
   </p>
   <p>
    of rank and wealth he increasingly despised. Even the “good old family”
   </p>
   <p>
    (to use a favourite phrase of a late local worthy) had no aroma for him
   </p>
   <p>
    unless there were good new resolutions in its representatives. As a
   </p>
   <p>
    balance to these austerities, when he went to live in London to see
   </p>
   <p>
    what the world was like, and with a view to practising a profession or
   </p>
   <p>
    business there, he was carried off his head, and nearly entrapped by a
   </p>
   <p>
    woman much older than himself, though luckily he escaped not greatly
   </p>
   <p>
    the worse for the experience.
   </p>
   <p>
    Early association with country solitudes had bred in him an
   </p>
   <p>
    unconquerable, and almost unreasonable, aversion to modern town life,
   </p>
   <p>
    and shut him out from such success as he might have aspired to by
   </p>
   <p>
    following a mundane calling in the impracticability of the spiritual
   </p>
   <p>
    one. But something had to be done; he had wasted many valuable years;
   </p>
   <p>
    and having an acquaintance who was starting on a thriving life as a
   </p>
   <p>
    Colonial farmer, it occurred to Angel that this might be a lead in the
   </p>
   <p>
    right direction. Farming, either in the Colonies, America, or at
   </p>
   <p>
    home—farming, at any rate, after becoming well qualified for the
   </p>
   <p>
    business by a careful apprenticeship—that was a vocation which would
   </p>
   <p>
    probably afford an independence without the sacrifice of what he valued
   </p>
   <p>
    even more than a competency—intellectual liberty.
   </p>
   <p>
    So we find Angel Clare at six-and-twenty here at Talbothays as a
   </p>
   <p>
    student of kine, and, as there were no houses near at hand in which he
   </p>
   <p>
    could get a comfortable lodging, a boarder at the dairyman’s.
   </p>
   <p>
    His room was an immense attic which ran the whole length of the
   </p>
   <p>
    dairy-house. It could only be reached by a ladder from the cheese-loft,
   </p>
   <p>
    and had been closed up for a long time till he arrived and selected it
   </p>
   <p>
    as his retreat. Here Clare had plenty of space, and could often be
   </p>
   <p>
    heard by the dairy-folk pacing up and down when the household had gone
   </p>
   <p>
    to rest. A portion was divided off at one end by a curtain, behind
   </p>
   <p>
    which was his bed, the outer part being furnished as a homely
   </p>
   <p>
    sitting-room.
   </p>
   <p>
    At first he lived up above entirely, reading a good deal, and strumming
   </p>
   <p>
    upon an old harp which he had bought at a sale, saying when in a bitter
   </p>
   <p>
    humour that he might have to get his living by it in the streets some
   </p>
   <p>
    day. But he soon preferred to read human nature by taking his meals
   </p>
   <p>
    downstairs in the general dining-kitchen, with the dairyman and his
   </p>
   <p>
    wife, and the maids and men, who all together formed a lively assembly;
   </p>
   <p>
    for though but few milking hands slept in the house, several joined the
   </p>
   <p>
    family at meals. The longer Clare resided here the less objection had
   </p>
   <p>
    he to his company, and the more did he like to share quarters with them
   </p>
   <p>
    in common.
   </p>
   <p>
    Much to his surprise he took, indeed, a real delight in their
   </p>
   <p>
    companionship. The conventional farm-folk of his
   </p>
   <p>
    imagination—personified in the newspaper-press by the pitiable dummy
   </p>
   <p>
    known as Hodge—were obliterated after a few days’ residence. At close
   </p>
   <p>
    quarters no Hodge was to be seen. At first, it is true, when Clare’s
   </p>
   <p>
    intelligence was fresh from a contrasting society, these friends with
   </p>
   <p>
    whom he now hobnobbed seemed a little strange. Sitting down as a level
   </p>
   <p>
    member of the dairyman’s household seemed at the outset an undignified
   </p>
   <p>
    proceeding. The ideas, the modes, the surroundings, appeared
   </p>
   <p>
    retrogressive and unmeaning. But with living on there, day after day,
   </p>
   <p>
    the acute sojourner became conscious of a new aspect in the spectacle.
   </p>
   <p>
    Without any objective change whatever, variety had taken the place of
   </p>
   <p>
    monotonousness. His host and his host’s household, his men and his
   </p>
   <p>
    maids, as they became intimately known to Clare, began to differentiate
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves as in a chemical process. The thought of Pascal’s was
   </p>
   <p>
    brought home to him: “_A mesure qu’on a plus d’esprit, on trouve qu’il
   </p>
   <p>
    y a plus d’hommes originaux. Les gens du commun ne trouvent pas de
   </p>
   <p>
    différence entre les hommes_.” The typical and unvarying Hodge ceased
   </p>
   <p>
    to exist. He had been disintegrated into a number of varied
   </p>
   <p>
    fellow-creatures—beings of many minds, beings infinite in difference;
   </p>
   <p>
    some happy, many serene, a few depressed, one here and there bright
   </p>
   <p>
    even to genius, some stupid, others wanton, others austere; some mutely
   </p>
   <p>
    Miltonic, some potentially Cromwellian—into men who had private views
   </p>
   <p>
    of each other, as he had of his friends; who could applaud or condemn
   </p>
   <p>
    each other, amuse or sadden themselves by the contemplation of each
   </p>
   <p>
    other’s foibles or vices; men every one of whom walked in his own
   </p>
   <p>
    individual way the road to dusty death.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unexpectedly he began to like the outdoor life for its own sake, and
   </p>
   <p>
    for what it brought, apart from its bearing on his own proposed career.
   </p>
   <p>
    Considering his position he became wonderfully free from the chronic
   </p>
   <p>
    melancholy which is taking hold of the civilized races with the decline
   </p>
   <p>
    of belief in a beneficent Power. For the first time of late years he
   </p>
   <p>
    could read as his musings inclined him, without any eye to cramming for
   </p>
   <p>
    a profession, since the few farming handbooks which he deemed it
   </p>
   <p>
    desirable to master occupied him but little time.
   </p>
   <p>
    He grew away from old associations, and saw something new in life and
   </p>
   <p>
    humanity. Secondarily, he made close acquaintance with phenomena which
   </p>
   <p>
    he had before known but darkly—the seasons in their moods, morning and
   </p>
   <p>
    evening, night and noon, winds in their different tempers, trees,
   </p>
   <p>
    waters and mists, shades and silences, and the voices of inanimate
   </p>
   <p>
    things.
   </p>
   <p>
    The early mornings were still sufficiently cool to render a fire
   </p>
   <p>
    acceptable in the large room wherein they breakfasted; and, by Mrs
   </p>
   <p>
    Crick’s orders, who held that he was too genteel to mess at their
   </p>
   <p>
    table, it was Angel Clare’s custom to sit in the yawning chimney-corner
   </p>
   <p>
    during the meal, his cup-and-saucer and plate being placed on a hinged
   </p>
   <p>
    flap at his elbow. The light from the long, wide, mullioned window
   </p>
   <p>
    opposite shone in upon his nook, and, assisted by a secondary light of
   </p>
   <p>
    cold blue quality which shone down the chimney, enabled him to read
   </p>
   <p>
    there easily whenever disposed to do so. Between Clare and the window
   </p>
   <p>
    was the table at which his companions sat, their munching profiles
   </p>
   <p>
    rising sharp against the panes; while to the side was the milk-house
   </p>
   <p>
    door, through which were visible the rectangular leads in rows, full to
   </p>
   <p>
    the brim with the morning’s milk. At the further end the great churn
   </p>
   <p>
    could be seen revolving, and its slip-slopping heard—the moving power
   </p>
   <p>
    being discernible through the window in the form of a spiritless horse
   </p>
   <p>
    walking in a circle and driven by a boy.
   </p>
   <p>
    For several days after Tess’s arrival Clare, sitting abstractedly
   </p>
   <p>
    reading from some book, periodical, or piece of music just come by
   </p>
   <p>
    post, hardly noticed that she was present at table. She talked so
   </p>
   <p>
    little, and the other maids talked so much, that the babble did not
   </p>
   <p>
    strike him as possessing a new note, and he was ever in the habit of
   </p>
   <p>
    neglecting the particulars of an outward scene for the general
   </p>
   <p>
    impression. One day, however, when he had been conning one of his
   </p>
   <p>
    music-scores, and by force of imagination was hearing the tune in his
   </p>
   <p>
    head, he lapsed into listlessness, and the music-sheet rolled to the
   </p>
   <p>
    hearth. He looked at the fire of logs, with its one flame pirouetting
   </p>
   <p>
    on the top in a dying dance after the breakfast-cooking and boiling,
   </p>
   <p>
    and it seemed to jig to his inward tune; also at the two chimney crooks
   </p>
   <p>
    dangling down from the cotterel, or cross-bar, plumed with soot, which
   </p>
   <p>
    quivered to the same melody; also at the half-empty kettle whining an
   </p>
   <p>
    accompaniment. The conversation at the table mixed in with his
   </p>
   <p>
    phantasmal orchestra till he thought: “What a fluty voice one of those
   </p>
   <p>
    milkmaids has! I suppose it is the new one.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare looked round upon her, seated with the others.
   </p>
   <p>
    She was not looking towards him. Indeed, owing to his long silence, his
   </p>
   <p>
    presence in the room was almost forgotten.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t know about ghosts,” she was saying; “but I do know that our
   </p>
   <p>
    souls can be made to go outside our bodies when we are alive.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The dairyman turned to her with his mouth full, his eyes charged with
   </p>
   <p>
    serious inquiry, and his great knife and fork (breakfasts were
   </p>
   <p>
    breakfasts here) planted erect on the table, like the beginning of a
   </p>
   <p>
    gallows.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What—really now? And is it so, maidy?” he said.
   </p>
   <p>
    “A very easy way to feel ’em go,” continued Tess, “is to lie on the
   </p>
   <p>
    grass at night and look straight up at some big bright star; and, by
   </p>
   <p>
    fixing your mind upon it, you will soon find that you are hundreds and
   </p>
   <p>
    hundreds o’ miles away from your body, which you don’t seem to want at
   </p>
   <p>
    all.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The dairyman removed his hard gaze from Tess, and fixed it on his wife.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Now that’s a rum thing, Christianer—hey? To think o’ the miles I’ve
   </p>
   <p>
    vamped o’ starlight nights these last thirty year, courting, or
   </p>
   <p>
    trading, or for doctor, or for nurse, and yet never had the least
   </p>
   <p>
    notion o’ that till now, or feeled my soul rise so much as an inch
   </p>
   <p>
    above my shirt-collar.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The general attention being drawn to her, including that of the
   </p>
   <p>
    dairyman’s pupil, Tess flushed, and remarking evasively that it was
   </p>
   <p>
    only a fancy, resumed her breakfast.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare continued to observe her. She soon finished her eating, and
   </p>
   <p>
    having a consciousness that Clare was regarding her, began to trace
   </p>
   <p>
    imaginary patterns on the tablecloth with her forefinger with the
   </p>
   <p>
    constraint of a domestic animal that perceives itself to be watched.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What a fresh and virginal daughter of Nature that milkmaid is!” he
   </p>
   <p>
    said to himself.
   </p>
   <p>
    And then he seemed to discern in her something that was familiar,
   </p>
   <p>
    something which carried him back into a joyous and unforeseeing past,
   </p>
   <p>
    before the necessity of taking thought had made the heavens gray. He
   </p>
   <p>
    concluded that he had beheld her before; where he could not tell. A
   </p>
   <p>
    casual encounter during some country ramble it certainly had been, and
   </p>
   <p>
    he was not greatly curious about it. But the circumstance was
   </p>
   <p>
    sufficient to lead him to select Tess in preference to the other pretty
   </p>
   <p>
    milkmaids when he wished to contemplate contiguous womankind.
   </p>
   <p>
    XIX
   </p>
   <p>
    In general the cows were milked as they presented themselves, without
   </p>
   <p>
    fancy or choice. But certain cows will show a fondness for a particular
   </p>
   <p>
    pair of hands, sometimes carrying this predilection so far as to refuse
   </p>
   <p>
    to stand at all except to their favourite, the pail of a stranger being
   </p>
   <p>
    unceremoniously kicked over.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was Dairyman Crick’s rule to insist on breaking down these
   </p>
   <p>
    partialities and aversions by constant interchange, since otherwise, in
   </p>
   <p>
    the event of a milkman or maid going away from the dairy, he was placed
   </p>
   <p>
    in a difficulty. The maids’ private aims, however, were the reverse of
   </p>
   <p>
    the dairyman’s rule, the daily selection by each damsel of the eight or
   </p>
   <p>
    ten cows to which she had grown accustomed rendering the operation on
   </p>
   <p>
    their willing udders surprisingly easy and effortless.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess, like her compeers, soon discovered which of the cows had a
   </p>
   <p>
    preference for her style of manipulation, and her fingers having become
   </p>
   <p>
    delicate from the long domiciliary imprisonments to which she had
   </p>
   <p>
    subjected herself at intervals during the last two or three years, she
   </p>
   <p>
    would have been glad to meet the milchers’ views in this respect. Out
   </p>
   <p>
    of the whole ninety-five there were eight in particular—Dumpling,
   </p>
   <p>
    Fancy, Lofty, Mist, Old Pretty, Young Pretty, Tidy, and Loud—who,
   </p>
   <p>
    though the teats of one or two were as hard as carrots, gave down to
   </p>
   <p>
    her with a readiness that made her work on them a mere touch of the
   </p>
   <p>
    fingers. Knowing, however, the dairyman’s wish, she endeavoured
   </p>
   <p>
    conscientiously to take the animals just as they came, excepting the
   </p>
   <p>
    very hard yielders which she could not yet manage.
   </p>
   <p>
    But she soon found a curious correspondence between the ostensibly
   </p>
   <p>
    chance position of the cows and her wishes in this matter, till she
   </p>
   <p>
    felt that their order could not be the result of accident. The
   </p>
   <p>
    dairyman’s pupil had lent a hand in getting the cows together of late,
   </p>
   <p>
    and at the fifth or sixth time she turned her eyes, as she rested
   </p>
   <p>
    against the cow, full of sly inquiry upon him.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Mr Clare, you have ranged the cows!” she said, blushing; and in making
   </p>
   <p>
    the accusation, symptoms of a smile gently lifted her upper lip in
   </p>
   <p>
    spite of her, so as to show the tips of her teeth, the lower lip
   </p>
   <p>
    remaining severely still.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, it makes no difference,” said he. “You will always be here to
   </p>
   <p>
    milk them.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Do you think so? I _hope_ I shall! But I don’t _know_.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She was angry with herself afterwards, thinking that he, unaware of her
   </p>
   <p>
    grave reasons for liking this seclusion, might have mistaken her
   </p>
   <p>
    meaning. She had spoken so earnestly to him, as if his presence were
   </p>
   <p>
    somehow a factor in her wish. Her misgiving was such that at dusk, when
   </p>
   <p>
    the milking was over, she walked in the garden alone, to continue her
   </p>
   <p>
    regrets that she had disclosed to him her discovery of his
   </p>
   <p>
    considerateness.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was a typical summer evening in June, the atmosphere being in such
   </p>
   <p>
    delicate equilibrium and so transmissive that inanimate objects seemed
   </p>
   <p>
    endowed with two or three senses, if not five. There was no distinction
   </p>
   <p>
    between the near and the far, and an auditor felt close to everything
   </p>
   <p>
    within the horizon. The soundlessness impressed her as a positive
   </p>
   <p>
    entity rather than as the mere negation of noise. It was broken by the
   </p>
   <p>
    strumming of strings.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess had heard those notes in the attic above her head. Dim, flattened,
   </p>
   <p>
    constrained by their confinement, they had never appealed to her as
   </p>
   <p>
    now, when they wandered in the still air with a stark quality like that
   </p>
   <p>
    of nudity. To speak absolutely, both instrument and execution were
   </p>
   <p>
    poor; but the relative is all, and as she listened Tess, like a
   </p>
   <p>
    fascinated bird, could not leave the spot. Far from leaving she drew up
   </p>
   <p>
    towards the performer, keeping behind the hedge that he might not guess
   </p>
   <p>
    her presence.
   </p>
   <p>
    The outskirt of the garden in which Tess found herself had been left
   </p>
   <p>
    uncultivated for some years, and was now damp and rank with juicy grass
   </p>
   <p>
    which sent up mists of pollen at a touch; and with tall blooming weeds
   </p>
   <p>
    emitting offensive smells—weeds whose red and yellow and purple hues
   </p>
   <p>
    formed a polychrome as dazzling as that of cultivated flowers. She went
   </p>
   <p>
    stealthily as a cat through this profusion of growth, gathering
   </p>
   <p>
    cuckoo-spittle on her skirts, cracking snails that were underfoot,
   </p>
   <p>
    staining her hands with thistle-milk and slug-slime, and rubbing off
   </p>
   <p>
    upon her naked arms sticky blights which, though snow-white on the
   </p>
   <p>
    apple-tree trunks, made madder stains on her skin; thus she drew quite
   </p>
   <p>
    near to Clare, still unobserved of him.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess was conscious of neither time nor space. The exaltation which she
   </p>
   <p>
    had described as being producible at will by gazing at a star came now
   </p>
   <p>
    without any determination of hers; she undulated upon the thin notes of
   </p>
   <p>
    the second-hand harp, and their harmonies passed like breezes through
   </p>
   <p>
    her, bringing tears into her eyes. The floating pollen seemed to be his
   </p>
   <p>
    notes made visible, and the dampness of the garden the weeping of the
   </p>
   <p>
    garden’s sensibility. Though near nightfall, the rank-smelling
   </p>
   <p>
    weed-flowers glowed as if they would not close for intentness, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    waves of colour mixed with the waves of sound.
   </p>
   <p>
    The light which still shone was derived mainly from a large hole in the
   </p>
   <p>
    western bank of cloud; it was like a piece of day left behind by
   </p>
   <p>
    accident, dusk having closed in elsewhere. He concluded his plaintive
   </p>
   <p>
    melody, a very simple performance, demanding no great skill; and she
   </p>
   <p>
    waited, thinking another might be begun. But, tired of playing, he had
   </p>
   <p>
    desultorily come round the fence, and was rambling up behind her. Tess,
   </p>
   <p>
    her cheeks on fire, moved away furtively, as if hardly moving at all.
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel, however, saw her light summer gown, and he spoke; his low tones
   </p>
   <p>
    reaching her, though he was some distance off.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What makes you draw off in that way, Tess?” said he. “Are you afraid?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh no, sir—not of outdoor things; especially just now when the
   </p>
   <p>
    apple-blooth is falling, and everything is so green.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But you have your indoor fears—eh?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well—yes, sir.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “What of?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I couldn’t quite say.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “The milk turning sour?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Life in general?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, sir.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah—so have I, very often. This hobble of being alive is rather
   </p>
   <p>
    serious, don’t you think so?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It is—now you put it that way.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “All the same, I shouldn’t have expected a young girl like you to see
   </p>
   <p>
    it so just yet. How is it you do?”
   </p>
   <p>
    She maintained a hesitating silence.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Come, Tess, tell me in confidence.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She thought that he meant what were the aspects of things to her, and
   </p>
   <p>
    replied shyly—
   </p>
   <p>
    “The trees have inquisitive eyes, haven’t they?—that is, seem as if
   </p>
   <p>
    they had. And the river says,—‘Why do ye trouble me with your looks?’
   </p>
   <p>
    And you seem to see numbers of to-morrows just all in a line, the first
   </p>
   <p>
    of them the biggest and clearest, the others getting smaller and
   </p>
   <p>
    smaller as they stand farther away; but they all seem very fierce and
   </p>
   <p>
    cruel and as if they said, ‘I’m coming! Beware of me! Beware of me!’
   </p>
   <p>
    ... But _you_, sir, can raise up dreams with your music, and drive all
   </p>
   <p>
    such horrid fancies away!”
   </p>
   <p>
    He was surprised to find this young woman—who though but a milkmaid had
   </p>
   <p>
    just that touch of rarity about her which might make her the envied of
   </p>
   <p>
    her housemates—shaping such sad imaginings. She was expressing in her
   </p>
   <p>
    own native phrases—assisted a little by her Sixth Standard
   </p>
   <p>
    training—feelings which might almost have been called those of the
   </p>
   <p>
    age—the ache of modernism. The perception arrested him less when he
   </p>
   <p>
    reflected that what are called advanced ideas are really in great part
   </p>
   <p>
    but the latest fashion in definition—a more accurate expression, by
   </p>
   <p>
    words in _logy_ and _ism_, of sensations which men and women have
   </p>
   <p>
    vaguely grasped for centuries.
   </p>
   <p>
    Still, it was strange that they should have come to her while yet so
   </p>
   <p>
    young; more than strange; it was impressive, interesting, pathetic. Not
   </p>
   <p>
    guessing the cause, there was nothing to remind him that experience is
   </p>
   <p>
    as to intensity, and not as to duration. Tess’s passing corporeal
   </p>
   <p>
    blight had been her mental harvest.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess, on her part, could not understand why a man of clerical family
   </p>
   <p>
    and good education, and above physical want, should look upon it as a
   </p>
   <p>
    mishap to be alive. For the unhappy pilgrim herself there was very good
   </p>
   <p>
    reason. But how could this admirable and poetic man ever have descended
   </p>
   <p>
    into the Valley of Humiliation, have felt with the man of Uz—as she
   </p>
   <p>
    herself had felt two or three years ago—“My soul chooseth strangling
   </p>
   <p>
    and death rather than my life. I loathe it; I would not live alway.”
   </p>
   <p>
    It was true that he was at present out of his class. But she knew that
   </p>
   <p>
    was only because, like Peter the Great in a shipwright’s yard, he was
   </p>
   <p>
    studying what he wanted to know. He did not milk cows because he was
   </p>
   <p>
    obliged to milk cows, but because he was learning to be a rich and
   </p>
   <p>
    prosperous dairyman, landowner, agriculturist, and breeder of cattle.
   </p>
   <p>
    He would become an American or Australian Abraham, commanding like a
   </p>
   <p>
    monarch his flocks and his herds, his spotted and his ring-straked, his
   </p>
   <p>
    men-servants and his maids. At times, nevertheless, it did seem
   </p>
   <p>
    unaccountable to her that a decidedly bookish, musical, thinking young
   </p>
   <p>
    man should have chosen deliberately to be a farmer, and not a
   </p>
   <p>
    clergyman, like his father and brothers.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus, neither having the clue to the other’s secret, they were
   </p>
   <p>
    respectively puzzled at what each revealed, and awaited new knowledge
   </p>
   <p>
    of each other’s character and mood without attempting to pry into each
   </p>
   <p>
    other’s history.
   </p>
   <p>
    Every day, every hour, brought to him one more little stroke of her
   </p>
   <p>
    nature, and to her one more of his. Tess was trying to lead a repressed
   </p>
   <p>
    life, but she little divined the strength of her own vitality.
   </p>
   <p>
    At first Tess seemed to regard Angel Clare as an intelligence rather
   </p>
   <p>
    than as a man. As such she compared him with herself; and at every
   </p>
   <p>
    discovery of the abundance of his illuminations, of the distance
   </p>
   <p>
    between her own modest mental standpoint and the unmeasurable, Andean
   </p>
   <p>
    altitude of his, she became quite dejected, disheartened from all
   </p>
   <p>
    further effort on her own part whatever.
   </p>
   <p>
    He observed her dejection one day, when he had casually mentioned
   </p>
   <p>
    something to her about pastoral life in ancient Greece. She was
   </p>
   <p>
    gathering the buds called “lords and ladies” from the bank while he
   </p>
   <p>
    spoke.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why do you look so woebegone all of a sudden?” he asked.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh, ’tis only—about my own self,” she said, with a frail laugh of
   </p>
   <p>
    sadness, fitfully beginning to peel “a lady” meanwhile. “Just a sense
   </p>
   <p>
    of what might have been with me! My life looks as if it had been wasted
   </p>
   <p>
    for want of chances! When I see what you know, what you have read, and
   </p>
   <p>
    seen, and thought, I feel what a nothing I am! I’m like the poor Queen
   </p>
   <p>
    of Sheba who lived in the Bible. There is no more spirit in me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Bless my soul, don’t go troubling about that! Why,” he said with some
   </p>
   <p>
    enthusiasm, “I should be only too glad, my dear Tess, to help you to
   </p>
   <p>
    anything in the way of history, or any line of reading you would like
   </p>
   <p>
    to take up—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It is a lady again,” interrupted she, holding out the bud she had
   </p>
   <p>
    peeled.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I meant that there are always more ladies than lords when you come to
   </p>
   <p>
    peel them.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Never mind about the lords and ladies. Would you like to take up any
   </p>
   <p>
    course of study—history, for example?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Sometimes I feel I don’t want to know anything more about it than I
   </p>
   <p>
    know already.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why not?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Because what’s the use of learning that I am one of a long row
   </p>
   <p>
    only—finding out that there is set down in some old book somebody just
   </p>
   <p>
    like me, and to know that I shall only act her part; making me sad,
   </p>
   <p>
    that’s all. The best is not to remember that your nature and your past
   </p>
   <p>
    doings have been just like thousands’ and thousands’, and that your
   </p>
   <p>
    coming life and doings ’ll be like thousands’ and thousands’.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “What, really, then, you don’t want to learn anything?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I shouldn’t mind learning why—why the sun do shine on the just and the
   </p>
   <p>
    unjust alike,” she answered, with a slight quaver in her voice. “But
   </p>
   <p>
    that’s what books will not tell me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tess, fie for such bitterness!” Of course he spoke with a conventional
   </p>
   <p>
    sense of duty only, for that sort of wondering had not been unknown to
   </p>
   <p>
    himself in bygone days. And as he looked at the unpracticed mouth and
   </p>
   <p>
    lips, he thought that such a daughter of the soil could only have
   </p>
   <p>
    caught up the sentiment by rote. She went on peeling the lords and
   </p>
   <p>
    ladies till Clare, regarding for a moment the wave-like curl of her
   </p>
   <p>
    lashes as they dropped with her bent gaze on her soft cheek,
   </p>
   <p>
    lingeringly went away. When he was gone she stood awhile, thoughtfully
   </p>
   <p>
    peeling the last bud; and then, awakening from her reverie, flung it
   </p>
   <p>
    and all the crowd of floral nobility impatiently on the ground, in an
   </p>
   <p>
    ebullition of displeasure with herself for her _niaiseries_, and with a
   </p>
   <p>
    quickening warmth in her heart of hearts.
   </p>
   <p>
    How stupid he must think her! In an access of hunger for his good
   </p>
   <p>
    opinion she bethought herself of what she had latterly endeavoured to
   </p>
   <p>
    forget, so unpleasant had been its issues—the identity of her family
   </p>
   <p>
    with that of the knightly d’Urbervilles. Barren attribute as it was,
   </p>
   <p>
    disastrous as its discovery had been in many ways to her, perhaps Mr
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare, as a gentleman and a student of history, would respect her
   </p>
   <p>
    sufficiently to forget her childish conduct with the lords and ladies
   </p>
   <p>
    if he knew that those Purbeck-marble and alabaster people in Kingsbere
   </p>
   <p>
    Church really represented her own lineal forefathers; that she was no
   </p>
   <p>
    spurious d’Urberville, compounded of money and ambition like those at
   </p>
   <p>
    Trantridge, but true d’Urberville to the bone.
   </p>
   <p>
    But, before venturing to make the revelation, dubious Tess indirectly
   </p>
   <p>
    sounded the dairyman as to its possible effect upon Mr Clare, by asking
   </p>
   <p>
    the former if Mr Clare had any great respect for old county families
   </p>
   <p>
    when they had lost all their money and land.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Mr Clare,” said the dairyman emphatically, “is one of the most
   </p>
   <p>
    rebellest rozums you ever knowed—not a bit like the rest of his family;
   </p>
   <p>
    and if there’s one thing that he do hate more than another ’tis the
   </p>
   <p>
    notion of what’s called a’ old family. He says that it stands to reason
   </p>
   <p>
    that old families have done their spurt of work in past days, and can’t
   </p>
   <p>
    have anything left in ’em now. There’s the Billets and the Drenkhards
   </p>
   <p>
    and the Greys and the St Quintins and the Hardys and the Goulds, who
   </p>
   <p>
    used to own the lands for miles down this valley; you could buy ’em all
   </p>
   <p>
    up now for an old song a’most. Why, our little Retty Priddle here, you
   </p>
   <p>
    know, is one of the Paridelles—the old family that used to own lots o’
   </p>
   <p>
    the lands out by King’s Hintock, now owned by the Earl o’ Wessex, afore
   </p>
   <p>
    even he or his was heard of. Well, Mr Clare found this out, and spoke
   </p>
   <p>
    quite scornful to the poor girl for days. ‘Ah!’ he says to her, ‘you’ll
   </p>
   <p>
    never make a good dairymaid! All your skill was used up ages ago in
   </p>
   <p>
    Palestine, and you must lie fallow for a thousand years to git strength
   </p>
   <p>
    for more deeds!’ A boy came here t’other day asking for a job, and said
   </p>
   <p>
    his name was Matt, and when we asked him his surname he said he’d never
   </p>
   <p>
    heard that ’a had any surname, and when we asked why, he said he
   </p>
   <p>
    supposed his folks hadn’t been ’stablished long enough. ‘Ah! you’re the
   </p>
   <p>
    very boy I want!’ says Mr Clare, jumping up and shaking hands wi’en;
   </p>
   <p>
    ‘I’ve great hopes of you;’ and gave him half-a-crown. O no! he can’t
   </p>
   <p>
    stomach old families!”
   </p>
   <p>
    After hearing this caricature of Clare’s opinion poor Tess was glad
   </p>
   <p>
    that she had not said a word in a weak moment about her family—even
   </p>
   <p>
    though it was so unusually old almost to have gone round the circle and
   </p>
   <p>
    become a new one. Besides, another diary-girl was as good as she, it
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed, in that respect. She held her tongue about the d’Urberville
   </p>
   <p>
    vault and the Knight of the Conqueror whose name she bore. The insight
   </p>
   <p>
    afforded into Clare’s character suggested to her that it was largely
   </p>
   <p>
    owing to her supposed untraditional newness that she had won interest
   </p>
   <p>
    in his eyes.
   </p>
   <p>
    XX
   </p>
   <p>
    The season developed and matured. Another year’s instalment of flowers,
   </p>
   <p>
    leaves, nightingales, thrushes, finches, and such ephemeral creatures,
   </p>
   <p>
    took up their positions where only a year ago others had stood in their
   </p>
   <p>
    place when these were nothing more than germs and inorganic particles.
   </p>
   <p>
    Rays from the sunrise drew forth the buds and stretched them into long
   </p>
   <p>
    stalks, lifted up sap in noiseless streams, opened petals, and sucked
   </p>
   <p>
    out scents in invisible jets and breathings.
   </p>
   <p>
    Dairyman Crick’s household of maids and men lived on comfortably,
   </p>
   <p>
    placidly, even merrily. Their position was perhaps the happiest of all
   </p>
   <p>
    positions in the social scale, being above the line at which neediness
   </p>
   <p>
    ends, and below the line at which the _convenances_ begin to cramp
   </p>
   <p>
    natural feelings, and the stress of threadbare modishness makes too
   </p>
   <p>
    little of enough.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus passed the leafy time when arborescence seems to be the one thing
   </p>
   <p>
    aimed at out of doors. Tess and Clare unconsciously studied each other,
   </p>
   <p>
    ever balanced on the edge of a passion, yet apparently keeping out of
   </p>
   <p>
    it. All the while they were converging, under an irresistible law, as
   </p>
   <p>
    surely as two streams in one vale.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess had never in her recent life been so happy as she was now,
   </p>
   <p>
    possibly never would be so happy again. She was, for one thing,
   </p>
   <p>
    physically and mentally suited among these new surroundings. The
   </p>
   <p>
    sapling which had rooted down to a poisonous stratum on the spot of its
   </p>
   <p>
    sowing had been transplanted to a deeper soil. Moreover she, and Clare
   </p>
   <p>
    also, stood as yet on the debatable land between predilection and love;
   </p>
   <p>
    where no profundities have been reached; no reflections have set in,
   </p>
   <p>
    awkwardly inquiring, “Whither does this new current tend to carry me?
   </p>
   <p>
    What does it mean to my future? How does it stand towards my past?”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess was the merest stray phenomenon to Angel Clare as yet—a rosy,
   </p>
   <p>
    warming apparition which had only just acquired the attribute of
   </p>
   <p>
    persistence in his consciousness. So he allowed his mind to be occupied
   </p>
   <p>
    with her, deeming his preoccupation to be no more than a philosopher’s
   </p>
   <p>
    regard of an exceedingly novel, fresh, and interesting specimen of
   </p>
   <p>
    womankind.
   </p>
   <p>
    They met continually; they could not help it. They met daily in that
   </p>
   <p>
    strange and solemn interval, the twilight of the morning, in the violet
   </p>
   <p>
    or pink dawn; for it was necessary to rise early, so very early, here.
   </p>
   <p>
    Milking was done betimes; and before the milking came the skimming,
   </p>
   <p>
    which began at a little past three. It usually fell to the lot of some
   </p>
   <p>
    one or other of them to wake the rest, the first being aroused by an
   </p>
   <p>
    alarm-clock; and, as Tess was the latest arrival, and they soon
   </p>
   <p>
    discovered that she could be depended upon not to sleep through the
   </p>
   <p>
    alarm as others did, this task was thrust most frequently upon her. No
   </p>
   <p>
    sooner had the hour of three struck and whizzed, than she left her room
   </p>
   <p>
    and ran to the dairyman’s door; then up the ladder to Angel’s, calling
   </p>
   <p>
    him in a loud whisper; then woke her fellow-milkmaids. By the time that
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess was dressed Clare was downstairs and out in the humid air. The
   </p>
   <p>
    remaining maids and the dairyman usually gave themselves another turn
   </p>
   <p>
    on the pillow, and did not appear till a quarter of an hour later.
   </p>
   <p>
    The gray half-tones of daybreak are not the gray half-tones of the
   </p>
   <p>
    day’s close, though the degree of their shade may be the same. In the
   </p>
   <p>
    twilight of the morning, light seems active, darkness passive; in the
   </p>
   <p>
    twilight of evening it is the darkness which is active and crescent,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the light which is the drowsy reverse.
   </p>
   <p>
    Being so often—possibly not always by chance—the first two persons to
   </p>
   <p>
    get up at the dairy-house, they seemed to themselves the first persons
   </p>
   <p>
    up of all the world. In these early days of her residence here Tess did
   </p>
   <p>
    not skim, but went out of doors at once after rising, where he was
   </p>
   <p>
    generally awaiting her. The spectral, half-compounded, aqueous light
   </p>
   <p>
    which pervaded the open mead impressed them with a feeling of
   </p>
   <p>
    isolation, as if they were Adam and Eve. At this dim inceptive stage of
   </p>
   <p>
    the day Tess seemed to Clare to exhibit a dignified largeness both of
   </p>
   <p>
    disposition and physique, an almost regnant power, possibly because he
   </p>
   <p>
    knew that at that preternatural time hardly any woman so well endowed
   </p>
   <p>
    in person as she was likely to be walking in the open air within the
   </p>
   <p>
    boundaries of his horizon; very few in all England. Fair women are
   </p>
   <p>
    usually asleep at mid-summer dawns. She was close at hand, and the rest
   </p>
   <p>
    were nowhere.
   </p>
   <p>
    The mixed, singular, luminous gloom in which they walked along together
   </p>
   <p>
    to the spot where the cows lay often made him think of the Resurrection
   </p>
   <p>
    hour. He little thought that the Magdalen might be at his side. Whilst
   </p>
   <p>
    all the landscape was in neutral shade his companion’s face, which was
   </p>
   <p>
    the focus of his eyes, rising above the mist stratum, seemed to have a
   </p>
   <p>
    sort of phosphorescence upon it. She looked ghostly, as if she were
   </p>
   <p>
    merely a soul at large. In reality her face, without appearing to do
   </p>
   <p>
    so, had caught the cold gleam of day from the north-east; his own face,
   </p>
   <p>
    though he did not think of it, wore the same aspect to her.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was then, as has been said, that she impressed him most deeply. She
   </p>
   <p>
    was no longer the milkmaid, but a visionary essence of woman—a whole
   </p>
   <p>
    sex condensed into one typical form. He called her Artemis, Demeter,
   </p>
   <p>
    and other fanciful names half teasingly, which she did not like because
   </p>
   <p>
    she did not understand them.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Call me Tess,” she would say askance; and he did.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then it would grow lighter, and her features would become simply
   </p>
   <p>
    feminine; they had changed from those of a divinity who could confer
   </p>
   <p>
    bliss to those of a being who craved it.
   </p>
   <p>
    At these non-human hours they could get quite close to the waterfowl.
   </p>
   <p>
    Herons came, with a great bold noise as of opening doors and shutters,
   </p>
   <p>
    out of the boughs of a plantation which they frequented at the side of
   </p>
   <p>
    the mead; or, if already on the spot, hardily maintained their standing
   </p>
   <p>
    in the water as the pair walked by, watching them by moving their heads
   </p>
   <p>
    round in a slow, horizontal, passionless wheel, like the turn of
   </p>
   <p>
    puppets by clockwork.
   </p>
   <p>
    They could then see the faint summer fogs in layers, woolly, level, and
   </p>
   <p>
    apparently no thicker than counterpanes, spread about the meadows in
   </p>
   <p>
    detached remnants of small extent. On the gray moisture of the grass
   </p>
   <p>
    were marks where the cows had lain through the night—dark-green islands
   </p>
   <p>
    of dry herbage the size of their carcasses, in the general sea of dew.
   </p>
   <p>
    From each island proceeded a serpentine trail, by which the cow had
   </p>
   <p>
    rambled away to feed after getting up, at the end of which trail they
   </p>
   <p>
    found her; the snoring puff from her nostrils, when she recognized
   </p>
   <p>
    them, making an intenser little fog of her own amid the prevailing one.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then they drove the animals back to the barton, or sat down to milk
   </p>
   <p>
    them on the spot, as the case might require.
   </p>
   <p>
    Or perhaps the summer fog was more general, and the meadows lay like a
   </p>
   <p>
    white sea, out of which the scattered trees rose like dangerous rocks.
   </p>
   <p>
    Birds would soar through it into the upper radiance, and hang on the
   </p>
   <p>
    wing sunning themselves, or alight on the wet rails subdividing the
   </p>
   <p>
    mead, which now shone like glass rods. Minute diamonds of moisture from
   </p>
   <p>
    the mist hung, too, upon Tess’s eyelashes, and drops upon her hair,
   </p>
   <p>
    like seed pearls. When the day grew quite strong and commonplace these
   </p>
   <p>
    dried off her; moreover, Tess then lost her strange and ethereal
   </p>
   <p>
    beauty; her teeth, lips, and eyes scintillated in the sunbeams and she
   </p>
   <p>
    was again the dazzlingly fair dairymaid only, who had to hold her own
   </p>
   <p>
    against the other women of the world.
   </p>
   <p>
    About this time they would hear Dairyman Crick’s voice, lecturing the
   </p>
   <p>
    non-resident milkers for arriving late, and speaking sharply to old
   </p>
   <p>
    Deborah Fyander for not washing her hands.
   </p>
   <p>
    “For Heaven’s sake, pop thy hands under the pump, Deb! Upon my soul, if
   </p>
   <p>
    the London folk only knowed of thee and thy slovenly ways, they’d
   </p>
   <p>
    swaller their milk and butter more mincing than they do a’ready; and
   </p>
   <p>
    that’s saying a good deal.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The milking progressed, till towards the end Tess and Clare, in common
   </p>
   <p>
    with the rest, could hear the heavy breakfast table dragged out from
   </p>
   <p>
    the wall in the kitchen by Mrs Crick, this being the invariable
   </p>
   <p>
    preliminary to each meal; the same horrible scrape accompanying its
   </p>
   <p>
    return journey when the table had been cleared.
   </p>
   <p>
    XXI
   </p>
   <p>
    There was a great stir in the milk-house just after breakfast. The
   </p>
   <p>
    churn revolved as usual, but the butter would not come. Whenever this
   </p>
   <p>
    happened the dairy was paralyzed. Squish, squash echoed the milk in the
   </p>
   <p>
    great cylinder, but never arose the sound they waited for.
   </p>
   <p>
    Dairyman Crick and his wife, the milkmaids Tess, Marian, Retty Priddle,
   </p>
   <p>
    Izz Huett, and the married ones from the cottages; also Mr Clare,
   </p>
   <p>
    Jonathan Kail, old Deborah, and the rest, stood gazing hopelessly at
   </p>
   <p>
    the churn; and the boy who kept the horse going outside put on
   </p>
   <p>
    moon-like eyes to show his sense of the situation. Even the melancholy
   </p>
   <p>
    horse himself seemed to look in at the window in inquiring despair at
   </p>
   <p>
    each walk round.
   </p>
   <p>
    “’Tis years since I went to Conjuror Trendle’s son in Egdon—years!”
   </p>
   <p>
    said the dairyman bitterly. “And he was nothing to what his father had
   </p>
   <p>
    been. I have said fifty times, if I have said once, that I _don’t_
   </p>
   <p>
    believe in en; though ’a do cast folks’ waters very true. But I shall
   </p>
   <p>
    have to go to ’n if he’s alive. O yes, I shall have to go to ’n, if
   </p>
   <p>
    this sort of thing continnys!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Even Mr Clare began to feel tragical at the dairyman’s desperation.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Conjuror Fall, t’other side of Casterbridge, that they used to call
   </p>
   <p>
    ‘Wide-O’, was a very good man when I was a boy,” said Jonathan Kail.
   </p>
   <p>
    “But he’s rotten as touchwood by now.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “My grandfather used to go to Conjuror Mynterne, out at Owlscombe, and
   </p>
   <p>
    a clever man a’ were, so I’ve heard grandf’er say,” continued Mr Crick.
   </p>
   <p>
    “But there’s no such genuine folk about nowadays!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs Crick’s mind kept nearer to the matter in hand.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Perhaps somebody in the house is in love,” she said tentatively. “I’ve
   </p>
   <p>
    heard tell in my younger days that that will cause it. Why, Crick—that
   </p>
   <p>
    maid we had years ago, do ye mind, and how the butter didn’t come
   </p>
   <p>
    then—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah yes, yes!—but that isn’t the rights o’t. It had nothing to do with
   </p>
   <p>
    the love-making. I can mind all about it—’twas the damage to the
   </p>
   <p>
    churn.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He turned to Clare.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Jack Dollop, a ’hore’s-bird of a fellow we had here as milker at one
   </p>
   <p>
    time, sir, courted a young woman over at Mellstock, and deceived her as
   </p>
   <p>
    he had deceived many afore. But he had another sort o’ woman to reckon
   </p>
   <p>
    wi’ this time, and it was not the girl herself. One Holy Thursday of
   </p>
   <p>
    all days in the almanack, we was here as we mid be now, only there was
   </p>
   <p>
    no churning in hand, when we zid the girl’s mother coming up to the
   </p>
   <p>
    door, wi’ a great brass-mounted umbrella in her hand that would ha’
   </p>
   <p>
    felled an ox, and saying ‘Do Jack Dollop work here?—because I want him!
   </p>
   <p>
    I have a big bone to pick with he, I can assure ’n!’ And some way
   </p>
   <p>
    behind her mother walked Jack’s young woman, crying bitterly into her
   </p>
   <p>
    handkercher. ‘O Lard, here’s a time!’ said Jack, looking out o’ winder
   </p>
   <p>
    at ’em. ‘She’ll murder me! Where shall I get—where shall I—? Don’t tell
   </p>
   <p>
    her where I be!’ And with that he scrambled into the churn through the
   </p>
   <p>
    trap-door, and shut himself inside, just as the young woman’s mother
   </p>
   <p>
    busted into the milk-house. ‘The villain—where is he?’ says she. ‘I’ll
   </p>
   <p>
    claw his face for’n, let me only catch him!’ Well, she hunted about
   </p>
   <p>
    everywhere, ballyragging Jack by side and by seam, Jack lying a’most
   </p>
   <p>
    stifled inside the churn, and the poor maid—or young woman
   </p>
   <p>
    rather—standing at the door crying her eyes out. I shall never forget
   </p>
   <p>
    it, never! ’Twould have melted a marble stone! But she couldn’t find
   </p>
   <p>
    him nowhere at all.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The dairyman paused, and one or two words of comment came from the
   </p>
   <p>
    listeners.
   </p>
   <p>
    Dairyman Crick’s stories often seemed to be ended when they were not
   </p>
   <p>
    really so, and strangers were betrayed into premature interjections of
   </p>
   <p>
    finality; though old friends knew better. The narrator went on—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, how the old woman should have had the wit to guess it I could
   </p>
   <p>
    never tell, but she found out that he was inside that there churn.
   </p>
   <p>
    Without saying a word she took hold of the winch (it was turned by
   </p>
   <p>
    handpower then), and round she swung him, and Jack began to flop about
   </p>
   <p>
    inside. ‘O Lard! stop the churn! let me out!’ says he, popping out his
   </p>
   <p>
    head. ‘I shall be churned into a pummy!’ (He was a cowardly chap in his
   </p>
   <p>
    heart, as such men mostly be). ‘Not till ye make amends for ravaging
   </p>
   <p>
    her virgin innocence!’ says the old woman. ‘Stop the churn you old
   </p>
   <p>
    witch!’ screams he. ‘You call me old witch, do ye, you deceiver!’ says
   </p>
   <p>
    she, ‘when ye ought to ha’ been calling me mother-law these last five
   </p>
   <p>
    months!’ And on went the churn, and Jack’s bones rattled round again.
   </p>
   <p>
    Well, none of us ventured to interfere; and at last ’a promised to make
   </p>
   <p>
    it right wi’ her. ‘Yes—I’ll be as good as my word!’ he said. And so it
   </p>
   <p>
    ended that day.”
   </p>
   <p>
    While the listeners were smiling their comments there was a quick
   </p>
   <p>
    movement behind their backs, and they looked round. Tess, pale-faced,
   </p>
   <p>
    had gone to the door.
   </p>
   <p>
    “How warm ’tis to-day!” she said, almost inaudibly.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was warm, and none of them connected her withdrawal with the
   </p>
   <p>
    reminiscences of the dairyman. He went forward and opened the door for
   </p>
   <p>
    her, saying with tender raillery—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why, maidy” (he frequently, with unconscious irony, gave her this pet
   </p>
   <p>
    name), “the prettiest milker I’ve got in my dairy; you mustn’t get so
   </p>
   <p>
    fagged as this at the first breath of summer weather, or we shall be
   </p>
   <p>
    finely put to for want of ’ee by dog-days, shan’t we, Mr Clare?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I was faint—and—I think I am better out o’ doors,” she said
   </p>
   <p>
    mechanically; and disappeared outside.
   </p>
   <p>
    Fortunately for her the milk in the revolving churn at that moment
   </p>
   <p>
    changed its squashing for a decided flick-flack.
   </p>
   <p>
    “’Tis coming!” cried Mrs Crick, and the attention of all was called off
   </p>
   <p>
    from Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    That fair sufferer soon recovered herself externally; but she remained
   </p>
   <p>
    much depressed all the afternoon. When the evening milking was done she
   </p>
   <p>
    did not care to be with the rest of them, and went out of doors,
   </p>
   <p>
    wandering along she knew not whither. She was wretched—O so wretched—at
   </p>
   <p>
    the perception that to her companions the dairyman’s story had been
   </p>
   <p>
    rather a humorous narration than otherwise; none of them but herself
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed to see the sorrow of it; to a certainty, not one knew how
   </p>
   <p>
    cruelly it touched the tender place in her experience. The evening sun
   </p>
   <p>
    was now ugly to her, like a great inflamed wound in the sky. Only a
   </p>
   <p>
    solitary cracked-voice reed-sparrow greeted her from the bushes by the
   </p>
   <p>
    river, in a sad, machine-made tone, resembling that of a past friend
   </p>
   <p>
    whose friendship she had outworn.
   </p>
   <p>
    In these long June days the milkmaids, and, indeed, most of the
   </p>
   <p>
    household, went to bed at sunset or sooner, the morning work before
   </p>
   <p>
    milking being so early and heavy at a time of full pails. Tess usually
   </p>
   <p>
    accompanied her fellows upstairs. To-night, however, she was the first
   </p>
   <p>
    to go to their common chamber; and she had dozed when the other girls
   </p>
   <p>
    came in. She saw them undressing in the orange light of the vanished
   </p>
   <p>
    sun, which flushed their forms with its colour; she dozed again, but
   </p>
   <p>
    she was reawakened by their voices, and quietly turned her eyes towards
   </p>
   <p>
    them.
   </p>
   <p>
    Neither of her three chamber-companions had got into bed. They were
   </p>
   <p>
    standing in a group, in their nightgowns, barefooted, at the window,
   </p>
   <p>
    the last red rays of the west still warming their faces and necks and
   </p>
   <p>
    the walls around them. All were watching somebody in the garden with
   </p>
   <p>
    deep interest, their three faces close together: a jovial and round
   </p>
   <p>
    one, a pale one with dark hair, and a fair one whose tresses were
   </p>
   <p>
    auburn.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Don’t push! You can see as well as I,” said Retty, the auburn-haired
   </p>
   <p>
    and youngest girl, without removing her eyes from the window.
   </p>
   <p>
    “’Tis no use for you to be in love with him any more than me, Retty
   </p>
   <p>
    Priddle,” said jolly-faced Marian, the eldest, slily. “His thoughts be
   </p>
   <p>
    of other cheeks than thine!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Retty Priddle still looked, and the others looked again.
   </p>
   <p>
    “There he is again!” cried Izz Huett, the pale girl with dark damp hair
   </p>
   <p>
    and keenly cut lips.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You needn’t say anything, Izz,” answered Retty. “For I zid you kissing
   </p>
   <p>
    his shade.”
   </p>
   <p>
    _”What_ did you see her doing?” asked Marian.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why—he was standing over the whey-tub to let off the whey, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    shade of his face came upon the wall behind, close to Izz, who was
   </p>
   <p>
    standing there filling a vat. She put her mouth against the wall and
   </p>
   <p>
    kissed the shade of his mouth; I zid her, though he didn’t.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O Izz Huett!” said Marian.
   </p>
   <p>
    A rosy spot came into the middle of Izz Huett’s cheek.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, there was no harm in it,” she declared, with attempted coolness.
   </p>
   <p>
    “And if I be in love wi’en, so is Retty, too; and so be you, Marian,
   </p>
   <p>
    come to that.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Marian’s full face could not blush past its chronic pinkness.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I!” she said. “What a tale! Ah, there he is again! Dear eyes—dear
   </p>
   <p>
    face—dear Mr Clare!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “There—you’ve owned it!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “So have you—so have we all,” said Marian, with the dry frankness of
   </p>
   <p>
    complete indifference to opinion. “It is silly to pretend otherwise
   </p>
   <p>
    amongst ourselves, though we need not own it to other folks. I would
   </p>
   <p>
    just marry ’n to-morrow!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “So would I—and more,” murmured Izz Huett.
   </p>
   <p>
    “And I too,” whispered the more timid Retty.
   </p>
   <p>
    The listener grew warm.
   </p>
   <p>
    “We can’t all marry him,” said Izz.
   </p>
   <p>
    “We shan’t, either of us; which is worse still,” said the eldest.
   </p>
   <p>
    “There he is again!”
   </p>
   <p>
    They all three blew him a silent kiss.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why?” asked Retty quickly.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Because he likes Tess Durbeyfield best,” said Marian, lowering her
   </p>
   <p>
    voice. “I have watched him every day, and have found it out.”
   </p>
   <p>
    There was a reflective silence.
   </p>
   <p>
    “But she don’t care anything for ’n?” at length breathed Retty.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well—I sometimes think that too.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But how silly all this is!” said Izz Huett impatiently. “Of course he
   </p>
   <p>
    won’t marry any one of us, or Tess either—a gentleman’s son, who’s
   </p>
   <p>
    going to be a great landowner and farmer abroad! More likely to ask us
   </p>
   <p>
    to come wi’en as farm-hands at so much a year!”
   </p>
   <p>
    One sighed, and another sighed, and Marian’s plump figure sighed
   </p>
   <p>
    biggest of all. Somebody in bed hard by sighed too. Tears came into the
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes of Retty Priddle, the pretty red-haired youngest—the last bud of
   </p>
   <p>
    the Paridelles, so important in the county annals. They watched
   </p>
   <p>
    silently a little longer, their three faces still close together as
   </p>
   <p>
    before, and the triple hues of their hair mingling. But the unconscious
   </p>
   <p>
    Mr Clare had gone indoors, and they saw him no more; and, the shades
   </p>
   <p>
    beginning to deepen, they crept into their beds. In a few minutes they
   </p>
   <p>
    heard him ascend the ladder to his own room. Marian was soon snoring,
   </p>
   <p>
    but Izz did not drop into forgetfulness for a long time. Retty Priddle
   </p>
   <p>
    cried herself to sleep.
   </p>
   <p>
    The deeper-passioned Tess was very far from sleeping even then. This
   </p>
   <p>
    conversation was another of the bitter pills she had been obliged to
   </p>
   <p>
    swallow that day. Scarce the least feeling of jealousy arose in her
   </p>
   <p>
    breast. For that matter she knew herself to have the preference. Being
   </p>
   <p>
    more finely formed, better educated, and, though the youngest except
   </p>
   <p>
    Retty, more woman than either, she perceived that only the slightest
   </p>
   <p>
    ordinary care was necessary for holding her own in Angel Clare’s heart
   </p>
   <p>
    against these her candid friends. But the grave question was, ought she
   </p>
   <p>
    to do this? There was, to be sure, hardly a ghost of a chance for
   </p>
   <p>
    either of them, in a serious sense; but there was, or had been, a
   </p>
   <p>
    chance of one or the other inspiring him with a passing fancy for her,
   </p>
   <p>
    and enjoying the pleasure of his attentions while he stayed here. Such
   </p>
   <p>
    unequal attachments had led to marriage; and she had heard from Mrs
   </p>
   <p>
    Crick that Mr Clare had one day asked, in a laughing way, what would be
   </p>
   <p>
    the use of his marrying a fine lady, and all the while ten thousand
   </p>
   <p>
    acres of Colonial pasture to feed, and cattle to rear, and corn to
   </p>
   <p>
    reap. A farm-woman would be the only sensible kind of wife for him. But
   </p>
   <p>
    whether Mr Clare had spoken seriously or not, why should she, who could
   </p>
   <p>
    never conscientiously allow any man to marry her now, and who had
   </p>
   <p>
    religiously determined that she never would be tempted to do so, draw
   </p>
   <p>
    off Mr Clare’s attention from other women, for the brief happiness of
   </p>
   <p>
    sunning herself in his eyes while he remained at Talbothays?
   </p>
   <p>
    XXII
   </p>
   <p>
    They came downstairs yawning next morning; but skimming and milking
   </p>
   <p>
    were proceeded with as usual, and they went indoors to breakfast.
   </p>
   <p>
    Dairyman Crick was discovered stamping about the house. He had received
   </p>
   <p>
    a letter, in which a customer had complained that the butter had a
   </p>
   <p>
    twang.
   </p>
   <p>
    “And begad, so ’t have!” said the dairyman, who held in his left hand a
   </p>
   <p>
    wooden slice on which a lump of butter was stuck. “Yes—taste for
   </p>
   <p>
    yourself!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Several of them gathered round him; and Mr Clare tasted, Tess tasted,
   </p>
   <p>
    also the other indoor milkmaids, one or two of the milking-men, and
   </p>
   <p>
    last of all Mrs Crick, who came out from the waiting breakfast-table.
   </p>
   <p>
    There certainly was a twang.
   </p>
   <p>
    The dairyman, who had thrown himself into abstraction to better realize
   </p>
   <p>
    the taste, and so divine the particular species of noxious weed to
   </p>
   <p>
    which it appertained, suddenly exclaimed—
   </p>
   <p>
    “’Tis garlic! and I thought there wasn’t a blade left in that mead!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Then all the old hands remembered that a certain dry mead, into which a
   </p>
   <p>
    few of the cows had been admitted of late, had, in years gone by,
   </p>
   <p>
    spoilt the butter in the same way. The dairyman had not recognized the
   </p>
   <p>
    taste at that time, and thought the butter bewitched.
   </p>
   <p>
    “We must overhaul that mead,” he resumed; “this mustn’t continny!”
   </p>
   <p>
    All having armed themselves with old pointed knives, they went out
   </p>
   <p>
    together. As the inimical plant could only be present in very
   </p>
   <p>
    microscopic dimensions to have escaped ordinary observation, to find it
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed rather a hopeless attempt in the stretch of rich grass before
   </p>
   <p>
    them. However, they formed themselves into line, all assisting, owing
   </p>
   <p>
    to the importance of the search; the dairyman at the upper end with Mr
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare, who had volunteered to help; then Tess, Marian, Izz Huett, and
   </p>
   <p>
    Retty; then Bill Lewell, Jonathan, and the married dairywomen—Beck
   </p>
   <p>
    Knibbs, with her wooly black hair and rolling eyes; and flaxen Frances,
   </p>
   <p>
    consumptive from the winter damps of the water-meads—who lived in their
   </p>
   <p>
    respective cottages.
   </p>
   <p>
    With eyes fixed upon the ground they crept slowly across a strip of the
   </p>
   <p>
    field, returning a little further down in such a manner that, when they
   </p>
   <p>
    should have finished, not a single inch of the pasture but would have
   </p>
   <p>
    fallen under the eye of some one of them. It was a most tedious
   </p>
   <p>
    business, not more than half a dozen shoots of garlic being
   </p>
   <p>
    discoverable in the whole field; yet such was the herb’s pungency that
   </p>
   <p>
    probably one bite of it by one cow had been sufficient to season the
   </p>
   <p>
    whole dairy’s produce for the day.
   </p>
   <p>
    Differing one from another in natures and moods so greatly as they did,
   </p>
   <p>
    they yet formed, bending, a curiously uniform row—automatic, noiseless;
   </p>
   <p>
    and an alien observer passing down the neighbouring lane might well
   </p>
   <p>
    have been excused for massing them as “Hodge”. As they crept along,
   </p>
   <p>
    stooping low to discern the plant, a soft yellow gleam was reflected
   </p>
   <p>
    from the buttercups into their shaded faces, giving them an elfish,
   </p>
   <p>
    moonlit aspect, though the sun was pouring upon their backs in all the
   </p>
   <p>
    strength of noon.
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel Clare, who communistically stuck to his rule of taking part with
   </p>
   <p>
    the rest in everything, glanced up now and then. It was not, of course,
   </p>
   <p>
    by accident that he walked next to Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, how are you?” he murmured.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Very well, thank you, sir,” she replied demurely.
   </p>
   <p>
    As they had been discussing a score of personal matters only
   </p>
   <p>
    half-an-hour before, the introductory style seemed a little
   </p>
   <p>
    superfluous. But they got no further in speech just then. They crept
   </p>
   <p>
    and crept, the hem of her petticoat just touching his gaiter, and his
   </p>
   <p>
    elbow sometimes brushing hers. At last the dairyman, who came next,
   </p>
   <p>
    could stand it no longer.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Upon my soul and body, this here stooping do fairly make my back open
   </p>
   <p>
    and shut!” he exclaimed, straightening himself slowly with an
   </p>
   <p>
    excruciated look till quite upright. “And you, maidy Tess, you wasn’t
   </p>
   <p>
    well a day or two ago—this will make your head ache finely! Don’t do
   </p>
   <p>
    any more, if you feel fainty; leave the rest to finish it.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Dairyman Crick withdrew, and Tess dropped behind. Mr Clare also stepped
   </p>
   <p>
    out of line, and began privateering about for the weed. When she found
   </p>
   <p>
    him near her, her very tension at what she had heard the night before
   </p>
   <p>
    made her the first to speak.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Don’t they look pretty?” she said.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Who?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Izzy Huett and Retty.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess had moodily decided that either of these maidens would make a good
   </p>
   <p>
    farmer’s wife, and that she ought to recommend them, and obscure her
   </p>
   <p>
    own wretched charms.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Pretty? Well, yes—they are pretty girls—fresh looking. I have often
   </p>
   <p>
    thought so.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Though, poor dears, prettiness won’t last long!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O no, unfortunately.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “They are excellent dairywomen.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes: though not better than you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “They skim better than I.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Do they?”
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare remained observing them—not without their observing him.
   </p>
   <p>
    “She is colouring up,” continued Tess heroically.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Who?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Retty Priddle.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh! Why it that?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Because you are looking at her.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Self-sacrificing as her mood might be, Tess could not well go further
   </p>
   <p>
    and cry, “Marry one of them, if you really do want a dairywoman and not
   </p>
   <p>
    a lady; and don’t think of marrying me!” She followed Dairyman Crick,
   </p>
   <p>
    and had the mournful satisfaction of seeing that Clare remained behind.
   </p>
   <p>
    From this day she forced herself to take pains to avoid him—never
   </p>
   <p>
    allowing herself, as formerly, to remain long in his company, even if
   </p>
   <p>
    their juxtaposition were purely accidental. She gave the other three
   </p>
   <p>
    every chance.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess was woman enough to realize from their avowals to herself that
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel Clare had the honour of all the dairymaids in his keeping, and
   </p>
   <p>
    her perception of his care to avoid compromising the happiness of
   </p>
   <p>
    either in the least degree bred a tender respect in Tess for what she
   </p>
   <p>
    deemed, rightly or wrongly, the self-controlling sense of duty shown by
   </p>
   <p>
    him, a quality which she had never expected to find in one of the
   </p>
   <p>
    opposite sex, and in the absence of which more than one of the simple
   </p>
   <p>
    hearts who were his house-mates might have gone weeping on her
   </p>
   <p>
    pilgrimage.
   </p>
   <p>
    XXIII
   </p>
   <p>
    The hot weather of July had crept upon them unawares, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    atmosphere of the flat vale hung heavy as an opiate over the
   </p>
   <p>
    dairy-folk, the cows, and the trees. Hot steaming rains fell
   </p>
   <p>
    frequently, making the grass where the cows fed yet more rank, and
   </p>
   <p>
    hindering the late hay-making in the other meads.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was Sunday morning; the milking was done; the outdoor milkers had
   </p>
   <p>
    gone home. Tess and the other three were dressing themselves rapidly,
   </p>
   <p>
    the whole bevy having agreed to go together to Mellstock Church, which
   </p>
   <p>
    lay some three or four miles distant from the dairy-house. She had now
   </p>
   <p>
    been two months at Talbothays, and this was her first excursion.
   </p>
   <p>
    All the preceding afternoon and night heavy thunderstorms had hissed
   </p>
   <p>
    down upon the meads, and washed some of the hay into the river; but
   </p>
   <p>
    this morning the sun shone out all the more brilliantly for the deluge,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the air was balmy and clear.
   </p>
   <p>
    The crooked lane leading from their own parish to Mellstock ran along
   </p>
   <p>
    the lowest levels in a portion of its length, and when the girls
   </p>
   <p>
    reached the most depressed spot they found that the result of the rain
   </p>
   <p>
    had been to flood the lane over-shoe to a distance of some fifty yards.
   </p>
   <p>
    This would have been no serious hindrance on a week-day; they would
   </p>
   <p>
    have clicked through it in their high pattens and boots quite
   </p>
   <p>
    unconcerned; but on this day of vanity, this Sun’s-day, when flesh went
   </p>
   <p>
    forth to coquet with flesh while hypocritically affecting business with
   </p>
   <p>
    spiritual things; on this occasion for wearing their white stockings
   </p>
   <p>
    and thin shoes, and their pink, white, and lilac gowns, on which every
   </p>
   <p>
    mud spot would be visible, the pool was an awkward impediment. They
   </p>
   <p>
    could hear the church-bell calling—as yet nearly a mile off.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Who would have expected such a rise in the river in summer-time!” said
   </p>
   <p>
    Marian, from the top of the roadside bank on which they had climbed,
   </p>
   <p>
    and were maintaining a precarious footing in the hope of creeping along
   </p>
   <p>
    its slope till they were past the pool.
   </p>
   <p>
    “We can’t get there anyhow, without walking right through it, or else
   </p>
   <p>
    going round the Turnpike way; and that would make us so very late!”
   </p>
   <p>
    said Retty, pausing hopelessly.
   </p>
   <p>
    “And I do colour up so hot, walking into church late, and all the
   </p>
   <p>
    people staring round,” said Marian, “that I hardly cool down again till
   </p>
   <p>
    we get into the That-it-may-please-Thees.”
   </p>
   <p>
    While they stood clinging to the bank they heard a splashing round the
   </p>
   <p>
    bend of the road, and presently appeared Angel Clare, advancing along
   </p>
   <p>
    the lane towards them through the water.
   </p>
   <p>
    Four hearts gave a big throb simultaneously.
   </p>
   <p>
    His aspect was probably as un-Sabbatarian a one as a dogmatic parson’s
   </p>
   <p>
    son often presented; his attire being his dairy clothes, long wading
   </p>
   <p>
    boots, a cabbage-leaf inside his hat to keep his head cool, with a
   </p>
   <p>
    thistle-spud to finish him off. “He’s not going to church,” said
   </p>
   <p>
    Marian.
   </p>
   <p>
    “No—I wish he was!” murmured Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel, in fact, rightly or wrongly (to adopt the safe phrase of evasive
   </p>
   <p>
    controversialists), preferred sermons in stones to sermons in churches
   </p>
   <p>
    and chapels on fine summer days. This morning, moreover, he had gone
   </p>
   <p>
    out to see if the damage to the hay by the flood was considerable or
   </p>
   <p>
    not. On his walk he observed the girls from a long distance, though
   </p>
   <p>
    they had been so occupied with their difficulties of passage as not to
   </p>
   <p>
    notice him. He knew that the water had risen at that spot, and that it
   </p>
   <p>
    would quite check their progress. So he had hastened on, with a dim
   </p>
   <p>
    idea of how he could help them—one of them in particular.
   </p>
   <p>
    The rosy-cheeked, bright-eyed quartet looked so charming in their light
   </p>
   <p>
    summer attire, clinging to the roadside bank like pigeons on a
   </p>
   <p>
    roof-slope, that he stopped a moment to regard them before coming
   </p>
   <p>
    close. Their gauzy skirts had brushed up from the grass innumerable
   </p>
   <p>
    flies and butterflies which, unable to escape, remained caged in the
   </p>
   <p>
    transparent tissue as in an aviary. Angel’s eye at last fell upon Tess,
   </p>
   <p>
    the hindmost of the four; she, being full of suppressed laughter at
   </p>
   <p>
    their dilemma, could not help meeting his glance radiantly.
   </p>
   <p>
    He came beneath them in the water, which did not rise over his long
   </p>
   <p>
    boots; and stood looking at the entrapped flies and butterflies.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Are you trying to get to church?” he said to Marian, who was in front,
   </p>
   <p>
    including the next two in his remark, but avoiding Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, sir; and ’tis getting late; and my colour do come up so—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’ll carry you through the pool—every Jill of you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The whole four flushed as if one heart beat through them.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I think you can’t, sir,” said Marian.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It is the only way for you to get past. Stand still. Nonsense—you are
   </p>
   <p>
    not too heavy! I’d carry you all four together. Now, Marian, attend,”
   </p>
   <p>
    he continued, “and put your arms round my shoulders, so. Now! Hold on.
   </p>
   <p>
    That’s well done.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Marian had lowered herself upon his arm and shoulder as directed, and
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel strode off with her, his slim figure, as viewed from behind,
   </p>
   <p>
    looking like the mere stem to the great nosegay suggested by hers. They
   </p>
   <p>
    disappeared round the curve of the road, and only his sousing footsteps
   </p>
   <p>
    and the top ribbon of Marian’s bonnet told where they were. In a few
   </p>
   <p>
    minutes he reappeared. Izz Huett was the next in order upon the bank.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Here he comes,” she murmured, and they could hear that her lips were
   </p>
   <p>
    dry with emotion. “And I have to put my arms round his neck and look
   </p>
   <p>
    into his face as Marian did.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “There’s nothing in that,” said Tess quickly.
   </p>
   <p>
    “There’s a time for everything,” continued Izz, unheeding. “A time to
   </p>
   <p>
    embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; the first is now going
   </p>
   <p>
    to be mine.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Fie—it is Scripture, Izz!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes,” said Izz, “I’ve always a’ ear at church for pretty verses.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel Clare, to whom three-quarters of this performance was a
   </p>
   <p>
    commonplace act of kindness, now approached Izz. She quietly and
   </p>
   <p>
    dreamily lowered herself into his arms, and Angel methodically marched
   </p>
   <p>
    off with her. When he was heard returning for the third time Retty’s
   </p>
   <p>
    throbbing heart could be almost seen to shake her. He went up to the
   </p>
   <p>
    red-haired girl, and while he was seizing her he glanced at Tess. His
   </p>
   <p>
    lips could not have pronounced more plainly, “It will soon be you and
   </p>
   <p>
    I.” Her comprehension appeared in her face; she could not help it.
   </p>
   <p>
    There was an understanding between them.
   </p>
   <p>
    Poor little Retty, though by far the lightest weight, was the most
   </p>
   <p>
    troublesome of Clare’s burdens. Marian had been like a sack of meal, a
   </p>
   <p>
    dead weight of plumpness under which he has literally staggered. Izz
   </p>
   <p>
    had ridden sensibly and calmly. Retty was a bunch of hysterics.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, he got through with the disquieted creature, deposited her,
   </p>
   <p>
    and returned. Tess could see over the hedge the distant three in a
   </p>
   <p>
    group, standing as he had placed them on the next rising ground. It was
   </p>
   <p>
    now her turn. She was embarrassed to discover that excitement at the
   </p>
   <p>
    proximity of Mr Clare’s breath and eyes, which she had contemned in her
   </p>
   <p>
    companions, was intensified in herself; and as if fearful of betraying
   </p>
   <p>
    her secret, she paltered with him at the last moment.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I may be able to clim’ along the bank perhaps—I can clim’ better than
   </p>
   <p>
    they. You must be so tired, Mr Clare!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No, no, Tess,” said he quickly. And almost before she was aware, she
   </p>
   <p>
    was seated in his arms and resting against his shoulder.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Three Leahs to get one Rachel,” he whispered.
   </p>
   <p>
    “They are better women than I,” she replied, magnanimously sticking to
   </p>
   <p>
    her resolve.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Not to me,” said Angel.
   </p>
   <p>
    He saw her grow warm at this; and they went some steps in silence.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I hope I am not too heavy?” she said timidly.
   </p>
   <p>
    “O no. You should lift Marian! Such a lump. You are like an undulating
   </p>
   <p>
    billow warmed by the sun. And all this fluff of muslin about you is the
   </p>
   <p>
    froth.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It is very pretty—if I seem like that to you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Do you know that I have undergone three-quarters of this labour
   </p>
   <p>
    entirely for the sake of the fourth quarter?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I did not expect such an event to-day.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Nor I... The water came up so sudden.”
   </p>
   <p>
    That the rise in the water was what she understood him to refer to, the
   </p>
   <p>
    state of breathing belied. Clare stood still and inclinced his face
   </p>
   <p>
    towards hers.
   </p>
   <p>
    “O Tessy!” he exclaimed.
   </p>
   <p>
    The girl’s cheeks burned to the breeze, and she could not look into his
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes for her emotion. It reminded Angel that he was somewhat unfairly
   </p>
   <p>
    taking advantage of an accidental position; and he went no further with
   </p>
   <p>
    it. No definite words of love had crossed their lips as yet, and
   </p>
   <p>
    suspension at this point was desirable now. However, he walked slowly,
   </p>
   <p>
    to make the remainder of the distance as long as possible; but at last
   </p>
   <p>
    they came to the bend, and the rest of their progress was in full view
   </p>
   <p>
    of the other three. The dry land was reached, and he set her down.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her friends were looking with round thoughtful eyes at her and him, and
   </p>
   <p>
    she could see that they had been talking of her. He hastily bade them
   </p>
   <p>
    farewell, and splashed back along the stretch of submerged road.
   </p>
   <p>
    The four moved on together as before, till Marian broke the silence by
   </p>
   <p>
    saying—
   </p>
   <p>
    “No—in all truth; we have no chance against her!” She looked joylessly
   </p>
   <p>
    at Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What do you mean?” asked the latter.
   </p>
   <p>
    “He likes ’ee best—the very best! We could see it as he brought ’ee. He
   </p>
   <p>
    would have kissed ’ee, if you had encouraged him to do it, ever so
   </p>
   <p>
    little.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No, no,” said she.
   </p>
   <p>
    The gaiety with which they had set out had somehow vanished; and yet
   </p>
   <p>
    there was no enmity or malice between them. They were generous young
   </p>
   <p>
    souls; they had been reared in the lonely country nooks where fatalism
   </p>
   <p>
    is a strong sentiment, and they did not blame her. Such supplanting was
   </p>
   <p>
    to be.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess’s heart ached. There was no concealing from herself the fact that
   </p>
   <p>
    she loved Angel Clare, perhaps all the more passionately from knowing
   </p>
   <p>
    that the others had also lost their hearts to him. There is contagion
   </p>
   <p>
    in this sentiment, especially among women. And yet that same hungry
   </p>
   <p>
    nature had fought against this, but too feebly, and the natural result
   </p>
   <p>
    had followed.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I will never stand in your way, nor in the way of either of you!” she
   </p>
   <p>
    declared to Retty that night in the bedroom (her tears running down).
   </p>
   <p>
    “I can’t help this, my dear! I don’t think marrying is in his mind at
   </p>
   <p>
    all; but if he were ever to ask me I should refuse him, as I should
   </p>
   <p>
    refuse any man.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh! would you? Why?” said wondering Retty.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It cannot be! But I will be plain. Putting myself quite on one side, I
   </p>
   <p>
    don’t think he will choose either of you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I have never expected it—thought of it!” moaned Retty. “But O! I wish
   </p>
   <p>
    I was dead!”
   </p>
   <p>
    The poor child, torn by a feeling which she hardly understood, turned
   </p>
   <p>
    to the other two girls who came upstairs just then.
   </p>
   <p>
    “We be friends with her again,” she said to them. “She thinks no more
   </p>
   <p>
    of his choosing her than we do.”
   </p>
   <p>
    So the reserve went off, and they were confiding and warm.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t seem to care what I do now,” said Marian, whose mood was
   </p>
   <p>
    turned to its lowest bass. “I was going to marry a dairyman at
   </p>
   <p>
    Stickleford, who’s asked me twice; but—my soul—I would put an end to
   </p>
   <p>
    myself rather’n be his wife now! Why don’t ye speak, Izz?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “To confess, then,” murmured Izz, “I made sure to-day that he was going
   </p>
   <p>
    to kiss me as he held me; and I lay still against his breast, hoping
   </p>
   <p>
    and hoping, and never moved at all. But he did not. I don’t like biding
   </p>
   <p>
    here at Talbothays any longer! I shall go hwome.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The air of the sleeping-chamber seemed to palpitate with the hopeless
   </p>
   <p>
    passion of the girls. They writhed feverishly under the oppressiveness
   </p>
   <p>
    of an emotion thrust on them by cruel Nature’s law—an emotion which
   </p>
   <p>
    they had neither expected nor desired. The incident of the day had
   </p>
   <p>
    fanned the flame that was burning the inside of their hearts out, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the torture was almost more than they could endure. The differences
   </p>
   <p>
    which distinguished them as individuals were abstracted by this
   </p>
   <p>
    passion, and each was but portion of one organism called sex. There was
   </p>
   <p>
    so much frankness and so little jealousy because there was no hope.
   </p>
   <p>
    Each one was a girl of fair common sense, and she did not delude
   </p>
   <p>
    herself with any vain conceits, or deny her love, or give herself airs,
   </p>
   <p>
    in the idea of outshining the others. The full recognition of the
   </p>
   <p>
    futility of their infatuation, from a social point of view; its
   </p>
   <p>
    purposeless beginning; its self-bounded outlook; its lack of everything
   </p>
   <p>
    to justify its existence in the eye of civilization (while lacking
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing in the eye of Nature); the one fact that it did exist,
   </p>
   <p>
    ecstasizing them to a killing joy—all this imparted to them a
   </p>
   <p>
    resignation, a dignity, which a practical and sordid expectation of
   </p>
   <p>
    winning him as a husband would have destroyed.
   </p>
   <p>
    They tossed and turned on their little beds, and the cheese-wring
   </p>
   <p>
    dripped monotonously downstairs.
   </p>
   <p>
    “B’ you awake, Tess?” whispered one, half-an-hour later.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was Izz Huett’s voice.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess replied in the affirmative, whereupon also Retty and Marian
   </p>
   <p>
    suddenly flung the bedclothes off them, and sighed—
   </p>
   <p>
    “So be we!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I wonder what she is like—the lady they say his family have looked out
   </p>
   <p>
    for him!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I wonder,” said Izz.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Some lady looked out for him?” gasped Tess, starting. “I have never
   </p>
   <p>
    heard o’ that!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O yes—’tis whispered; a young lady of his own rank, chosen by his
   </p>
   <p>
    family; a Doctor of Divinity’s daughter near his father’s parish of
   </p>
   <p>
    Emminster; he don’t much care for her, they say. But he is sure to
   </p>
   <p>
    marry her.”
   </p>
   <p>
    They had heard so very little of this; yet it was enough to build up
   </p>
   <p>
    wretched dolorous dreams upon, there in the shade of the night. They
   </p>
   <p>
    pictured all the details of his being won round to consent, of the
   </p>
   <p>
    wedding preparations, of the bride’s happiness, of her dress and veil,
   </p>
   <p>
    of her blissful home with him, when oblivion would have fallen upon
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves as far as he and their love were concerned. Thus they
   </p>
   <p>
    talked, and ached, and wept till sleep charmed their sorrow away.
   </p>
   <p>
    After this disclosure Tess nourished no further foolish thought that
   </p>
   <p>
    there lurked any grave and deliberate import in Clare’s attentions to
   </p>
   <p>
    her. It was a passing summer love of her face, for love’s own temporary
   </p>
   <p>
    sake—nothing more. And the thorny crown of this sad conception was that
   </p>
   <p>
    she whom he really did prefer in a cursory way to the rest, she who
   </p>
   <p>
    knew herself to be more impassioned in nature, cleverer, more beautiful
   </p>
   <p>
    than they, was in the eyes of propriety far less worthy of him than the
   </p>
   <p>
    homelier ones whom he ignored.
   </p>
   <p>
    XXIV
   </p>
   <p>
    Amid the oozing fatness and warm ferments of the Froom Vale, at a
   </p>
   <p>
    season when the rush of juices could almost be heard below the hiss of
   </p>
   <p>
    fertilization, it was impossible that the most fanciful love should not
   </p>
   <p>
    grow passionate. The ready bosoms existing there were impregnated by
   </p>
   <p>
    their surroundings.
   </p>
   <p>
    July passed over their heads, and the Thermidorean weather which came
   </p>
   <p>
    in its wake seemed an effort on the part of Nature to match the state
   </p>
   <p>
    of hearts at Talbothays Dairy. The air of the place, so fresh in the
   </p>
   <p>
    spring and early summer, was stagnant and enervating now. Its heavy
   </p>
   <p>
    scents weighed upon them, and at mid-day the landscape seemed lying in
   </p>
   <p>
    a swoon. Ethiopic scorchings browned the upper slopes of the pastures,
   </p>
   <p>
    but there was still bright green herbage here where the watercourses
   </p>
   <p>
    purled. And as Clare was oppressed by the outward heats, so was he
   </p>
   <p>
    burdened inwardly by waxing fervour of passion for the soft and silent
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    The rains having passed, the uplands were dry. The wheels of the
   </p>
   <p>
    dairyman’s spring-cart, as he sped home from market, licked up the
   </p>
   <p>
    pulverized surface of the highway, and were followed by white ribands
   </p>
   <p>
    of dust, as if they had set a thin powder-train on fire. The cows
   </p>
   <p>
    jumped wildly over the five-barred barton-gate, maddened by the
   </p>
   <p>
    gad-fly; Dairyman Crick kept his shirt-sleeves permanently rolled up
   </p>
   <p>
    from Monday to Saturday; open windows had no effect in ventilation
   </p>
   <p>
    without open doors, and in the dairy-garden the blackbirds and thrushes
   </p>
   <p>
    crept about under the currant-bushes, rather in the manner of
   </p>
   <p>
    quadrupeds than of winged creatures. The flies in the kitchen were
   </p>
   <p>
    lazy, teasing, and familiar, crawling about in the unwonted places, on
   </p>
   <p>
    the floors, into drawers, and over the backs of the milkmaids’ hands.
   </p>
   <p>
    Conversations were concerning sunstroke; while butter-making, and still
   </p>
   <p>
    more butter-keeping, was a despair.
   </p>
   <p>
    They milked entirely in the meads for coolness and convenience, without
   </p>
   <p>
    driving in the cows. During the day the animals obsequiously followed
   </p>
   <p>
    the shadow of the smallest tree as it moved round the stem with the
   </p>
   <p>
    diurnal roll; and when the milkers came they could hardly stand still
   </p>
   <p>
    for the flies.
   </p>
   <p>
    On one of these afternoons four or five unmilked cows chanced to stand
   </p>
   <p>
    apart from the general herd, behind the corner of a hedge, among them
   </p>
   <p>
    being Dumpling and Old Pretty, who loved Tess’s hands above those of
   </p>
   <p>
    any other maid. When she rose from her stool under a finished cow,
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel Clare, who had been observing her for some time, asked her if she
   </p>
   <p>
    would take the aforesaid creatures next. She silently assented, and
   </p>
   <p>
    with her stool at arm’s length, and the pail against her knee, went
   </p>
   <p>
    round to where they stood. Soon the sound of Old Pretty’s milk fizzing
   </p>
   <p>
    into the pail came through the hedge, and then Angel felt inclined to
   </p>
   <p>
    go round the corner also, to finish off a hard-yielding milcher who had
   </p>
   <p>
    strayed there, he being now as capable of this as the dairyman himself.
   </p>
   <p>
    All the men, and some of the women, when milking, dug their foreheads
   </p>
   <p>
    into the cows and gazed into the pail. But a few—mainly the younger
   </p>
   <p>
    ones—rested their heads sideways. This was Tess Durbeyfield’s habit,
   </p>
   <p>
    her temple pressing the milcher’s flank, her eyes fixed on the far end
   </p>
   <p>
    of the meadow with the quiet of one lost in meditation. She was milking
   </p>
   <p>
    Old Pretty thus, and the sun chancing to be on the milking-side, it
   </p>
   <p>
    shone flat upon her pink-gowned form and her white curtain-bonnet, and
   </p>
   <p>
    upon her profile, rendering it keen as a cameo cut from the dun
   </p>
   <p>
    background of the cow.
   </p>
   <p>
    She did not know that Clare had followed her round, and that he sat
   </p>
   <p>
    under his cow watching her. The stillness of her head and features was
   </p>
   <p>
    remarkable: she might have been in a trance, her eyes open, yet
   </p>
   <p>
    unseeing. Nothing in the picture moved but Old Pretty’s tail and Tess’s
   </p>
   <p>
    pink hands, the latter so gently as to be a rhythmic pulsation only, as
   </p>
   <p>
    if they were obeying a reflex stimulus, like a beating heart.
   </p>
   <p>
    How very lovable her face was to him. Yet there was nothing ethereal
   </p>
   <p>
    about it; all was real vitality, real warmth, real incarnation. And it
   </p>
   <p>
    was in her mouth that this culminated. Eyes almost as deep and speaking
   </p>
   <p>
    he had seen before, and cheeks perhaps as fair; brows as arched, a chin
   </p>
   <p>
    and throat almost as shapely; her mouth he had seen nothing to equal on
   </p>
   <p>
    the face of the earth. To a young man with the least fire in him that
   </p>
   <p>
    little upward lift in the middle of her red top lip was distracting,
   </p>
   <p>
    infatuating, maddening. He had never before seen a woman’s lips and
   </p>
   <p>
    teeth which forced upon his mind with such persistent iteration the old
   </p>
   <p>
    Elizabethan simile of roses filled with snow. Perfect, he, as a lover,
   </p>
   <p>
    might have called them off-hand. But no—they were not perfect. And it
   </p>
   <p>
    was the touch of the imperfect upon the would-be perfect that gave the
   </p>
   <p>
    sweetness, because it was that which gave the humanity.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare had studied the curves of those lips so many times that he could
   </p>
   <p>
    reproduce them mentally with ease: and now, as they again confronted
   </p>
   <p>
    him, clothed with colour and life, they sent an _aura_ over his flesh,
   </p>
   <p>
    a breeze through his nerves, which well nigh produced a qualm; and
   </p>
   <p>
    actually produced, by some mysterious physiological process, a prosaic
   </p>
   <p>
    sneeze.
   </p>
   <p>
    She then became conscious that he was observing her; but she would not
   </p>
   <p>
    show it by any change of position, though the curious dream-like fixity
   </p>
   <p>
    disappeared, and a close eye might easily have discerned that the
   </p>
   <p>
    rosiness of her face deepened, and then faded till only a tinge of it
   </p>
   <p>
    was left.
   </p>
   <p>
    The influence that had passed into Clare like an excitation from the
   </p>
   <p>
    sky did not die down. Resolutions, reticences, prudences, fears, fell
   </p>
   <p>
    back like a defeated battalion. He jumped up from his seat, and,
   </p>
   <p>
    leaving his pail to be kicked over if the milcher had such a mind, went
   </p>
   <p>
    quickly towards the desire of his eyes, and, kneeling down beside her,
   </p>
   <p>
    clasped her in his arms.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess was taken completely by surprise, and she yielded to his embrace
   </p>
   <p>
    with unreflecting inevitableness. Having seen that it was really her
   </p>
   <p>
    lover who had advanced, and no one else, her lips parted, and she sank
   </p>
   <p>
    upon him in her momentary joy, with something very like an ecstatic
   </p>
   <p>
    cry.
   </p>
   <p>
    He had been on the point of kissing that too tempting mouth, but he
   </p>
   <p>
    checked himself, for tender conscience’ sake.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Forgive me, Tess dear!” he whispered. “I ought to have asked. I—did
   </p>
   <p>
    not know what I was doing. I do not mean it as a liberty. I am devoted
   </p>
   <p>
    to you, Tessy, dearest, in all sincerity!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Old Pretty by this time had looked round, puzzled; and seeing two
   </p>
   <p>
    people crouching under her where, by immemorial custom, there should
   </p>
   <p>
    have been only one, lifted her hind leg crossly.
   </p>
   <p>
    “She is angry—she doesn’t know what we mean—she’ll kick over the milk!”
   </p>
   <p>
    exclaimed Tess, gently striving to free herself, her eyes concerned
   </p>
   <p>
    with the quadruped’s actions, her heart more deeply concerned with
   </p>
   <p>
    herself and Clare.
   </p>
   <p>
    She slipped up from her seat, and they stood together, his arm still
   </p>
   <p>
    encircling her. Tess’s eyes, fixed on distance, began to fill.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why do you cry, my darling?” he said.
   </p>
   <p>
    “O—I don’t know!” she murmured.
   </p>
   <p>
    As she saw and felt more clearly the position she was in she became
   </p>
   <p>
    agitated and tried to withdraw.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, I have betrayed my feeling, Tess, at last,” said he, with a
   </p>
   <p>
    curious sigh of desperation, signifying unconsciously that his heart
   </p>
   <p>
    had outrun his judgement. “That I—love you dearly and truly I need not
   </p>
   <p>
    say. But I—it shall go no further now—it distresses you—I am as
   </p>
   <p>
    surprised as you are. You will not think I have presumed upon your
   </p>
   <p>
    defencelessness—been too quick and unreflecting, will you?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “N’—I can’t tell.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He had allowed her to free herself; and in a minute or two the milking
   </p>
   <p>
    of each was resumed. Nobody had beheld the gravitation of the two into
   </p>
   <p>
    one; and when the dairyman came round by that screened nook a few
   </p>
   <p>
    minutes later, there was not a sign to reveal that the markedly
   </p>
   <p>
    sundered pair were more to each other than mere acquaintance. Yet in
   </p>
   <p>
    the interval since Crick’s last view of them something had occurred
   </p>
   <p>
    which changed the pivot of the universe for their two natures;
   </p>
   <p>
    something which, had he known its quality, the dairyman would have
   </p>
   <p>
    despised, as a practical man; yet which was based upon a more stubborn
   </p>
   <p>
    and resistless tendency than a whole heap of so-called practicalities.
   </p>
   <p>
    A veil had been whisked aside; the tract of each one’s outlook was to
   </p>
   <p>
    have a new horizon thenceforward—for a short time or for a long.
   </p>
   <p>
    End of Phase the Third
   </p>
   <p>
    Phase the Fourth:
   </p>
   <p>
    The Consequence
   </p>
   <p>
    XXV
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare, restless, went out into the dusk when evening drew on, she who
   </p>
   <p>
    had won him having retired to her chamber.
   </p>
   <p>
    The night was as sultry as the day. There was no coolness after dark
   </p>
   <p>
    unless on the grass. Roads, garden-paths, the house-fronts, the
   </p>
   <p>
    barton-walls were warm as hearths, and reflected the noontime
   </p>
   <p>
    temperature into the noctambulist’s face.
   </p>
   <p>
    He sat on the east gate of the dairy-yard, and knew not what to think
   </p>
   <p>
    of himself. Feeling had indeed smothered judgement that day.
   </p>
   <p>
    Since the sudden embrace, three hours before, the twain had kept apart.
   </p>
   <p>
    She seemed stilled, almost alarmed, at what had occurred, while the
   </p>
   <p>
    novelty, unpremeditation, mastery of circumstance disquieted
   </p>
   <p>
    him—palpitating, contemplative being that he was. He could hardly
   </p>
   <p>
    realize their true relations to each other as yet, and what their
   </p>
   <p>
    mutual bearing should be before third parties thenceforward.
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel had come as pupil to this dairy in the idea that his temporary
   </p>
   <p>
    existence here was to be the merest episode in his life, soon passed
   </p>
   <p>
    through and early forgotten; he had come as to a place from which as
   </p>
   <p>
    from a screened alcove he could calmly view the absorbing world
   </p>
   <p>
    without, and, apostrophizing it with Walt Whitman—
   </p>
   <p>
    Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes,
   </p>
   <p>
    How curious you are to me!—
   </p>
   <p>
    resolve upon a plan for plunging into that world anew. But behold, the
   </p>
   <p>
    absorbing scene had been imported hither. What had been the engrossing
   </p>
   <p>
    world had dissolved into an uninteresting outer dumb-show; while here,
   </p>
   <p>
    in this apparently dim and unimpassioned place, novelty had
   </p>
   <p>
    volcanically started up, as it had never, for him, started up
   </p>
   <p>
    elsewhere.
   </p>
   <p>
    Every window of the house being open, Clare could hear across the yard
   </p>
   <p>
    each trivial sound of the retiring household. The dairy-house, so
   </p>
   <p>
    humble, so insignificant, so purely to him a place of constrained
   </p>
   <p>
    sojourn that he had never hitherto deemed it of sufficient importance
   </p>
   <p>
    to be reconnoitred as an object of any quality whatever in the
   </p>
   <p>
    landscape; what was it now? The aged and lichened brick gables breathed
   </p>
   <p>
    forth “Stay!” The windows smiled, the door coaxed and beckoned, the
   </p>
   <p>
    creeper blushed confederacy. A personality within it was so
   </p>
   <p>
    far-reaching in her influence as to spread into and make the bricks,
   </p>
   <p>
    mortar, and whole overhanging sky throb with a burning sensibility.
   </p>
   <p>
    Whose was this mighty personality? A milkmaid’s.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was amazing, indeed, to find how great a matter the life of the
   </p>
   <p>
    obscure dairy had become to him. And though new love was to be held
   </p>
   <p>
    partly responsible for this, it was not solely so. Many besides Angel
   </p>
   <p>
    have learnt that the magnitude of lives is not as to their external
   </p>
   <p>
    displacements, but as to their subjective experiences. The
   </p>
   <p>
    impressionable peasant leads a larger, fuller, more dramatic life than
   </p>
   <p>
    the pachydermatous king. Looking at it thus, he found that life was to
   </p>
   <p>
    be seen of the same magnitude here as elsewhere.
   </p>
   <p>
    Despite his heterodoxy, faults, and weaknesses, Clare was a man with a
   </p>
   <p>
    conscience. Tess was no insignificant creature to toy with and dismiss;
   </p>
   <p>
    but a woman living her precious life—a life which, to herself who
   </p>
   <p>
    endured or enjoyed it, possessed as great a dimension as the life of
   </p>
   <p>
    the mightiest to himself. Upon her sensations the whole world depended
   </p>
   <p>
    to Tess; through her existence all her fellow-creatures existed, to
   </p>
   <p>
    her. The universe itself only came into being for Tess on the
   </p>
   <p>
    particular day in the particular year in which she was born.
   </p>
   <p>
    This consciousness upon which he had intruded was the single
   </p>
   <p>
    opportunity of existence ever vouchsafed to Tess by an unsympathetic
   </p>
   <p>
    First Cause—her all; her every and only chance. How then should he look
   </p>
   <p>
    upon her as of less consequence than himself; as a pretty trifle to
   </p>
   <p>
    caress and grow weary of; and not deal in the greatest seriousness with
   </p>
   <p>
    the affection which he knew that he had awakened in her—so fervid and
   </p>
   <p>
    so impressionable as she was under her reserve—in order that it might
   </p>
   <p>
    not agonize and wreck her?
   </p>
   <p>
    To encounter her daily in the accustomed manner would be to develop
   </p>
   <p>
    what had begun. Living in such close relations, to meet meant to fall
   </p>
   <p>
    into endearment; flesh and blood could not resist it; and, having
   </p>
   <p>
    arrived at no conclusion as to the issue of such a tendency, he decided
   </p>
   <p>
    to hold aloof for the present from occupations in which they would be
   </p>
   <p>
    mutually engaged. As yet the harm done was small.
   </p>
   <p>
    But it was not easy to carry out the resolution never to approach her.
   </p>
   <p>
    He was driven towards her by every heave of his pulse.
   </p>
   <p>
    He thought he would go and see his friends. It might be possible to
   </p>
   <p>
    sound them upon this. In less than five months his term here would have
   </p>
   <p>
    ended, and after a few additional months spent upon other farms he
   </p>
   <p>
    would be fully equipped in agricultural knowledge and in a position to
   </p>
   <p>
    start on his own account. Would not a farmer want a wife, and should a
   </p>
   <p>
    farmer’s wife be a drawing-room wax-figure, or a woman who understood
   </p>
   <p>
    farming? Notwithstanding the pleasing answer returned to him by the
   </p>
   <p>
    silence, he resolved to go his journey.
   </p>
   <p>
    One morning when they sat down to breakfast at Talbothays Dairy some
   </p>
   <p>
    maid observed that she had not seen anything of Mr Clare that day.
   </p>
   <p>
    “O no,” said Dairyman Crick. “Mr Clare has gone hwome to Emminster to
   </p>
   <p>
    spend a few days wi’ his kinsfolk.”
   </p>
   <p>
    For four impassioned ones around that table the sunshine of the morning
   </p>
   <p>
    went out at a stroke, and the birds muffled their song. But neither
   </p>
   <p>
    girl by word or gesture revealed her blankness. “He’s getting on
   </p>
   <p>
    towards the end of his time wi’ me,” added the dairyman, with a phlegm
   </p>
   <p>
    which unconsciously was brutal; “and so I suppose he is beginning to
   </p>
   <p>
    see about his plans elsewhere.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “How much longer is he to bide here?” asked Izz Huett, the only one of
   </p>
   <p>
    the gloom-stricken bevy who could trust her voice with the question.
   </p>
   <p>
    The others waited for the dairyman’s answer as if their lives hung upon
   </p>
   <p>
    it; Retty, with parted lips, gazing on the tablecloth, Marian with heat
   </p>
   <p>
    added to her redness, Tess throbbing and looking out at the meads.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, I can’t mind the exact day without looking at my
   </p>
   <p>
    memorandum-book,” replied Crick, with the same intolerable unconcern.
   </p>
   <p>
    “And even that may be altered a bit. He’ll bide to get a little
   </p>
   <p>
    practice in the calving out at the straw-yard, for certain. He’ll hang
   </p>
   <p>
    on till the end of the year I should say.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Four months or so of torturing ecstasy in his society—of “pleasure
   </p>
   <p>
    girdled about with pain”. After that the blackness of unutterable
   </p>
   <p>
    night.
   </p>
   <p>
    At this moment of the morning Angel Clare was riding along a narrow
   </p>
   <p>
    lane ten miles distant from the breakfasters, in the direction of his
   </p>
   <p>
    father’s Vicarage at Emminster, carrying, as well as he could, a little
   </p>
   <p>
    basket which contained some black-puddings and a bottle of mead, sent
   </p>
   <p>
    by Mrs Crick, with her kind respects, to his parents. The white lane
   </p>
   <p>
    stretched before him, and his eyes were upon it; but they were staring
   </p>
   <p>
    into next year, and not at the lane. He loved her; ought he to marry
   </p>
   <p>
    her? Dared he to marry her? What would his mother and his brothers say?
   </p>
   <p>
    What would he himself say a couple of years after the event? That would
   </p>
   <p>
    depend upon whether the germs of staunch comradeship underlay the
   </p>
   <p>
    temporary emotion, or whether it were a sensuous joy in her form only,
   </p>
   <p>
    with no substratum of everlastingness.
   </p>
   <p>
    His father’s hill-surrounded little town, the Tudor church-tower of red
   </p>
   <p>
    stone, the clump of trees near the Vicarage, came at last into view
   </p>
   <p>
    beneath him, and he rode down towards the well-known gate. Casting a
   </p>
   <p>
    glance in the direction of the church before entering his home, he
   </p>
   <p>
    beheld standing by the vestry-door a group of girls, of ages between
   </p>
   <p>
    twelve and sixteen, apparently awaiting the arrival of some other one,
   </p>
   <p>
    who in a moment became visible; a figure somewhat older than the
   </p>
   <p>
    school-girls, wearing a broad-brimmed hat and highly-starched cambric
   </p>
   <p>
    morning-gown, with a couple of books in her hand.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare knew her well. He could not be sure that she observed him; he
   </p>
   <p>
    hoped she did not, so as to render it unnecessary that he should go and
   </p>
   <p>
    speak to her, blameless creature that she was. An overpowering
   </p>
   <p>
    reluctance to greet her made him decide that she had not seen him. The
   </p>
   <p>
    young lady was Miss Mercy Chant, the only daughter of his father’s
   </p>
   <p>
    neighbour and friend, whom it was his parents’ quiet hope that he might
   </p>
   <p>
    wed some day. She was great at Antinomianism and Bible-classes, and was
   </p>
   <p>
    plainly going to hold a class now. Clare’s mind flew to the
   </p>
   <p>
    impassioned, summer-steeped heathens in the Var Vale, their rosy faces
   </p>
   <p>
    court-patched with cow-droppings; and to one the most impassioned of
   </p>
   <p>
    them all.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was on the impulse of the moment that he had resolved to trot over
   </p>
   <p>
    to Emminster, and hence had not written to apprise his mother and
   </p>
   <p>
    father, aiming, however, to arrive about the breakfast hour, before
   </p>
   <p>
    they should have gone out to their parish duties. He was a little late,
   </p>
   <p>
    and they had already sat down to the morning meal. The group at the
   </p>
   <p>
    table jumped up to welcome him as soon as he entered. They were his
   </p>
   <p>
    father and mother, his brother the Reverend Felix—curate at a town in
   </p>
   <p>
    the adjoining county, home for the inside of a fortnight—and his other
   </p>
   <p>
    brother, the Reverend Cuthbert, the classical scholar, and Fellow and
   </p>
   <p>
    Dean of his College, down from Cambridge for the long vacation. His
   </p>
   <p>
    mother appeared in a cap and silver spectacles, and his father looked
   </p>
   <p>
    what in fact he was—an earnest, God-fearing man, somewhat gaunt, in
   </p>
   <p>
    years about sixty-five, his pale face lined with thought and purpose.
   </p>
   <p>
    Over their heads hung the picture of Angel’s sister, the eldest of the
   </p>
   <p>
    family, sixteen years his senior, who had married a missionary and gone
   </p>
   <p>
    out to Africa.
   </p>
   <p>
    Old Mr Clare was a clergyman of a type which, within the last twenty
   </p>
   <p>
    years, has well nigh dropped out of contemporary life. A spiritual
   </p>
   <p>
    descendant in the direct line from Wycliff, Huss, Luther, Calvin; an
   </p>
   <p>
    Evangelical of the Evangelicals, a Conversionist, a man of Apostolic
   </p>
   <p>
    simplicity in life and thought, he had in his raw youth made up his
   </p>
   <p>
    mind once for all in the deeper questions of existence, and admitted no
   </p>
   <p>
    further reasoning on them thenceforward. He was regarded even by those
   </p>
   <p>
    of his own date and school of thinking as extreme; while, on the other
   </p>
   <p>
    hand, those totally opposed to him were unwillingly won to admiration
   </p>
   <p>
    for his thoroughness, and for the remarkable power he showed in
   </p>
   <p>
    dismissing all question as to principles in his energy for applying
   </p>
   <p>
    them. He loved Paul of Tarsus, liked St John, hated St James as much as
   </p>
   <p>
    he dared, and regarded with mixed feelings Timothy, Titus, and
   </p>
   <p>
    Philemon. The New Testament was less a Christiad then a Pauliad to his
   </p>
   <p>
    intelligence—less an argument than an intoxication. His creed of
   </p>
   <p>
    determinism was such that it almost amounted to a vice, and quite
   </p>
   <p>
    amounted, on its negative side, to a renunciative philosophy which had
   </p>
   <p>
    cousinship with that of Schopenhauer and Leopardi. He despised the
   </p>
   <p>
    Canons and Rubric, swore by the Articles, and deemed himself consistent
   </p>
   <p>
    through the whole category—which in a way he might have been. One thing
   </p>
   <p>
    he certainly was—sincere.
   </p>
   <p>
    To the aesthetic, sensuous, pagan pleasure in natural life and lush
   </p>
   <p>
    womanhood which his son Angel had lately been experiencing in Var Vale,
   </p>
   <p>
    his temper would have been antipathetic in a high degree, had he either
   </p>
   <p>
    by inquiry or imagination been able to apprehend it. Once upon a time
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel had been so unlucky as to say to his father, in a moment of
   </p>
   <p>
    irritation, that it might have resulted far better for mankind if
   </p>
   <p>
    Greece had been the source of the religion of modern civilization, and
   </p>
   <p>
    not Palestine; and his father’s grief was of that blank description
   </p>
   <p>
    which could not realize that there might lurk a thousandth part of a
   </p>
   <p>
    truth, much less a half truth or a whole truth, in such a proposition.
   </p>
   <p>
    He had simply preached austerely at Angel for some time after. But the
   </p>
   <p>
    kindness of his heart was such that he never resented anything for
   </p>
   <p>
    long, and welcomed his son to-day with a smile which was as candidly
   </p>
   <p>
    sweet as a child’s.
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel sat down, and the place felt like home; yet he did not so much as
   </p>
   <p>
    formerly feel himself one of the family gathered there. Every time that
   </p>
   <p>
    he returned hither he was conscious of this divergence, and since he
   </p>
   <p>
    had last shared in the Vicarage life it had grown even more distinctly
   </p>
   <p>
    foreign to his own than usual. Its transcendental aspirations—still
   </p>
   <p>
    unconsciously based on the geocentric view of things, a zenithal
   </p>
   <p>
    paradise, a nadiral hell—were as foreign to his own as if they had been
   </p>
   <p>
    the dreams of people on another planet. Latterly he had seen only Life,
   </p>
   <p>
    felt only the great passionate pulse of existence, unwarped,
   </p>
   <p>
    uncontorted, untrammelled by those creeds which futilely attempt to
   </p>
   <p>
    check what wisdom would be content to regulate.
   </p>
   <p>
    On their part they saw a great difference in him, a growing divergence
   </p>
   <p>
    from the Angel Clare of former times. It was chiefly a difference in
   </p>
   <p>
    his manner that they noticed just now, particularly his brothers. He
   </p>
   <p>
    was getting to behave like a farmer; he flung his legs about; the
   </p>
   <p>
    muscles of his face had grown more expressive; his eyes looked as much
   </p>
   <p>
    information as his tongue spoke, and more. The manner of the scholar
   </p>
   <p>
    had nearly disappeared; still more the manner of the drawing-room young
   </p>
   <p>
    man. A prig would have said that he had lost culture, and a prude that
   </p>
   <p>
    he had become coarse. Such was the contagion of domiciliary fellowship
   </p>
   <p>
    with the Talbothays nymphs and swains.
   </p>
   <p>
    After breakfast he walked with his two brothers, non-evangelical,
   </p>
   <p>
    well-educated, hall-marked young men, correct to their remotest fibre,
   </p>
   <p>
    such unimpeachable models as are turned out yearly by the lathe of a
   </p>
   <p>
    systematic tuition. They were both somewhat short-sighted, and when it
   </p>
   <p>
    was the custom to wear a single eyeglass and string they wore a single
   </p>
   <p>
    eyeglass and string; when it was the custom to wear a double glass they
   </p>
   <p>
    wore a double glass; when it was the custom to wear spectacles they
   </p>
   <p>
    wore spectacles straightway, all without reference to the particular
   </p>
   <p>
    variety of defect in their own vision. When Wordsworth was enthroned
   </p>
   <p>
    they carried pocket copies; and when Shelley was belittled they allowed
   </p>
   <p>
    him to grow dusty on their shelves. When Correggio’s Holy Families were
   </p>
   <p>
    admired, they admired Correggio’s Holy Families; when he was decried in
   </p>
   <p>
    favour of Velasquez, they sedulously followed suit without any personal
   </p>
   <p>
    objection.
   </p>
   <p>
    If these two noticed Angel’s growing social ineptness, he noticed their
   </p>
   <p>
    growing mental limitations. Felix seemed to him all Church; Cuthbert
   </p>
   <p>
    all College. His Diocesan Synod and Visitations were the mainsprings of
   </p>
   <p>
    the world to the one; Cambridge to the other. Each brother candidly
   </p>
   <p>
    recognized that there were a few unimportant score of millions of
   </p>
   <p>
    outsiders in civilized society, persons who were neither University men
   </p>
   <p>
    nor churchmen; but they were to be tolerated rather than reckoned with
   </p>
   <p>
    and respected.
   </p>
   <p>
    They were both dutiful and attentive sons, and were regular in their
   </p>
   <p>
    visits to their parents. Felix, though an offshoot from a far more
   </p>
   <p>
    recent point in the devolution of theology than his father, was less
   </p>
   <p>
    self-sacrificing and disinterested. More tolerant than his father of a
   </p>
   <p>
    contradictory opinion, in its aspect as a danger to its holder, he was
   </p>
   <p>
    less ready than his father to pardon it as a slight to his own
   </p>
   <p>
    teaching. Cuthbert was, upon the whole, the more liberal-minded,
   </p>
   <p>
    though, with greater subtlety, he had not so much heart.
   </p>
   <p>
    As they walked along the hillside Angel’s former feeling revived in
   </p>
   <p>
    him—that whatever their advantages by comparison with himself, neither
   </p>
   <p>
    saw or set forth life as it really was lived. Perhaps, as with many
   </p>
   <p>
    men, their opportunities of observation were not so good as their
   </p>
   <p>
    opportunities of expression. Neither had an adequate conception of the
   </p>
   <p>
    complicated forces at work outside the smooth and gentle current in
   </p>
   <p>
    which they and their associates floated. Neither saw the difference
   </p>
   <p>
    between local truth and universal truth; that what the inner world said
   </p>
   <p>
    in their clerical and academic hearing was quite a different thing from
   </p>
   <p>
    what the outer world was thinking.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I suppose it is farming or nothing for you now, my dear fellow,” Felix
   </p>
   <p>
    was saying, among other things, to his youngest brother, as he looked
   </p>
   <p>
    through his spectacles at the distant fields with sad austerity. “And,
   </p>
   <p>
    therefore, we must make the best of it. But I do entreat you to
   </p>
   <p>
    endeavour to keep as much as possible in touch with moral ideals.
   </p>
   <p>
    Farming, of course, means roughing it externally; but high thinking may
   </p>
   <p>
    go with plain living, nevertheless.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Of course it may,” said Angel. “Was it not proved nineteen hundred
   </p>
   <p>
    years ago—if I may trespass upon your domain a little? Why should you
   </p>
   <p>
    think, Felix, that I am likely to drop my high thinking and my moral
   </p>
   <p>
    ideals?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, I fancied, from the tone of your letters and our conversation—it
   </p>
   <p>
    may be fancy only—that you were somehow losing intellectual grasp.
   </p>
   <p>
    Hasn’t it struck you, Cuthbert?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Now, Felix,” said Angel drily, “we are very good friends, you know;
   </p>
   <p>
    each of us treading our allotted circles; but if it comes to
   </p>
   <p>
    intellectual grasp, I think you, as a contented dogmatist, had better
   </p>
   <p>
    leave mine alone, and inquire what has become of yours.”
   </p>
   <p>
    They returned down the hill to dinner, which was fixed at any time at
   </p>
   <p>
    which their father’s and mother’s morning work in the parish usually
   </p>
   <p>
    concluded. Convenience as regarded afternoon callers was the last thing
   </p>
   <p>
    to enter into the consideration of unselfish Mr and Mrs Clare; though
   </p>
   <p>
    the three sons were sufficiently in unison on this matter to wish that
   </p>
   <p>
    their parents would conform a little to modern notions.
   </p>
   <p>
    The walk had made them hungry, Angel in particular, who was now an
   </p>
   <p>
    outdoor man, accustomed to the profuse _dapes inemptae_ of the
   </p>
   <p>
    dairyman’s somewhat coarsely-laden table. But neither of the old people
   </p>
   <p>
    had arrived, and it was not till the sons were almost tired of waiting
   </p>
   <p>
    that their parents entered. The self-denying pair had been occupied in
   </p>
   <p>
    coaxing the appetites of some of their sick parishioners, whom they,
   </p>
   <p>
    somewhat inconsistently, tried to keep imprisoned in the flesh, their
   </p>
   <p>
    own appetites being quite forgotten.
   </p>
   <p>
    The family sat down to table, and a frugal meal of cold viands was
   </p>
   <p>
    deposited before them. Angel looked round for Mrs Crick’s
   </p>
   <p>
    black-puddings, which he had directed to be nicely grilled as they did
   </p>
   <p>
    them at the dairy, and of which he wished his father and mother to
   </p>
   <p>
    appreciate the marvellous herbal savours as highly as he did himself.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah! you are looking for the black-puddings, my dear boy,” observed
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare’s mother. “But I am sure you will not mind doing without them as
   </p>
   <p>
    I am sure your father and I shall not, when you know the reason. I
   </p>
   <p>
    suggested to him that we should take Mrs Crick’s kind present to the
   </p>
   <p>
    children of the man who can earn nothing just now because of his
   </p>
   <p>
    attacks of delirium tremens; and he agreed that it would be a great
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasure to them; so we did.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Of course,” said Angel cheerfully, looking round for the mead.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I found the mead so extremely alcoholic,” continued his mother, “that
   </p>
   <p>
    it was quite unfit for use as a beverage, but as valuable as rum or
   </p>
   <p>
    brandy in an emergency; so I have put it in my medicine-closet.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “We never drink spirits at this table, on principle,” added his father.
   </p>
   <p>
    “But what shall I tell the dairyman’s wife?” said Angel.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The truth, of course,” said his father.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I rather wanted to say we enjoyed the mead and the black-puddings very
   </p>
   <p>
    much. She is a kind, jolly sort of body, and is sure to ask me directly
   </p>
   <p>
    I return.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You cannot, if we did not,” Mr Clare answered lucidly.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah—no; though that mead was a drop of pretty tipple.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “A what?” said Cuthbert and Felix both.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh—’tis an expression they use down at Talbothays,” replied Angel,
   </p>
   <p>
    blushing. He felt that his parents were right in their practice if
   </p>
   <p>
    wrong in their want of sentiment, and said no more.
   </p>
   <p>
    XXVI
   </p>
   <p>
    It was not till the evening, after family prayers, that Angel found
   </p>
   <p>
    opportunity of broaching to his father one or two subjects near his
   </p>
   <p>
    heart. He had strung himself up to the purpose while kneeling behind
   </p>
   <p>
    his brothers on the carpet, studying the little nails in the heels of
   </p>
   <p>
    their walking boots. When the service was over they went out of the
   </p>
   <p>
    room with their mother, and Mr Clare and himself were left alone.
   </p>
   <p>
    The young man first discussed with the elder his plans for the
   </p>
   <p>
    attainment of his position as a farmer on an extensive scale—either in
   </p>
   <p>
    England or in the Colonies. His father then told him that, as he had
   </p>
   <p>
    not been put to the expense of sending Angel up to Cambridge, he had
   </p>
   <p>
    felt it his duty to set by a sum of money every year towards the
   </p>
   <p>
    purchase or lease of land for him some day, that he might not feel
   </p>
   <p>
    himself unduly slighted.
   </p>
   <p>
    “As far as worldly wealth goes,” continued his father, “you will no
   </p>
   <p>
    doubt stand far superior to your brothers in a few years.”
   </p>
   <p>
    This considerateness on old Mr Clare’s part led Angel onward to the
   </p>
   <p>
    other and dearer subject. He observed to his father that he was then
   </p>
   <p>
    six-and-twenty, and that when he should start in the farming business
   </p>
   <p>
    he would require eyes in the back of his head to see to all
   </p>
   <p>
    matters—some one would be necessary to superintend the domestic labours
   </p>
   <p>
    of his establishment whilst he was afield. Would it not be well,
   </p>
   <p>
    therefore, for him to marry?
   </p>
   <p>
    His father seemed to think this idea not unreasonable; and then Angel
   </p>
   <p>
    put the question—
   </p>
   <p>
    “What kind of wife do you think would be best for me as a thrifty
   </p>
   <p>
    hard-working farmer?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “A truly Christian woman, who will be a help and a comfort to you in
   </p>
   <p>
    your goings-out and your comings-in. Beyond that, it really matters
   </p>
   <p>
    little. Such an one can be found; indeed, my earnest-minded friend and
   </p>
   <p>
    neighbour, Dr Chant—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But ought she not primarily to be able to milk cows, churn good
   </p>
   <p>
    butter, make immense cheeses; know how to sit hens and turkeys and rear
   </p>
   <p>
    chickens, to direct a field of labourers in an emergency, and estimate
   </p>
   <p>
    the value of sheep and calves?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes; a farmer’s wife; yes, certainly. It would be desirable.” Mr
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare, the elder, had plainly never thought of these points before. “I
   </p>
   <p>
    was going to add,” he said, “that for a pure and saintly woman you will
   </p>
   <p>
    not find one more to your true advantage, and certainly not more to
   </p>
   <p>
    your mother’s mind and my own, than your friend Mercy, whom you used to
   </p>
   <p>
    show a certain interest in. It is true that my neighbour Chant’s
   </p>
   <p>
    daughter had lately caught up the fashion of the younger clergy round
   </p>
   <p>
    about us for decorating the Communion-table—alter, as I was shocked to
   </p>
   <p>
    hear her call it one day—with flowers and other stuff on festival
   </p>
   <p>
    occasions. But her father, who is quite as opposed to such flummery as
   </p>
   <p>
    I, says that can be cured. It is a mere girlish outbreak which, I am
   </p>
   <p>
    sure, will not be permanent.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, yes; Mercy is good and devout, I know. But, father, don’t you
   </p>
   <p>
    think that a young woman equally pure and virtuous as Miss Chant, but
   </p>
   <p>
    one who, in place of that lady’s ecclesiastical accomplishments,
   </p>
   <p>
    understands the duties of farm life as well as a farmer himself, would
   </p>
   <p>
    suit me infinitely better?”
   </p>
   <p>
    His father persisted in his conviction that a knowledge of a farmer’s
   </p>
   <p>
    wife’s duties came second to a Pauline view of humanity; and the
   </p>
   <p>
    impulsive Angel, wishing to honour his father’s feelings and to advance
   </p>
   <p>
    the cause of his heart at the same time, grew specious. He said that
   </p>
   <p>
    fate or Providence had thrown in his way a woman who possessed every
   </p>
   <p>
    qualification to be the helpmate of an agriculturist, and was decidedly
   </p>
   <p>
    of a serious turn of mind. He would not say whether or not she had
   </p>
   <p>
    attached herself to the sound Low Church School of his father; but she
   </p>
   <p>
    would probably be open to conviction on that point; she was a regular
   </p>
   <p>
    church-goer of simple faith; honest-hearted, receptive, intelligent,
   </p>
   <p>
    graceful to a degree, chaste as a vestal, and, in personal appearance,
   </p>
   <p>
    exceptionally beautiful.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Is she of a family such as you would care to marry into—a lady, in
   </p>
   <p>
    short?” asked his startled mother, who had come softly into the study
   </p>
   <p>
    during the conversation.
   </p>
   <p>
    “She is not what in common parlance is called a lady,” said Angel,
   </p>
   <p>
    unflinchingly, “for she is a cottager’s daughter, as I am proud to say.
   </p>
   <p>
    But she _is_ a lady, nevertheless—in feeling and nature.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Mercy Chant is of a very good family.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Pooh!—what’s the advantage of that, mother?” said Angel quickly. “How
   </p>
   <p>
    is family to avail the wife of a man who has to rough it as I have, and
   </p>
   <p>
    shall have to do?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Mercy is accomplished. And accomplishments have their charm,” returned
   </p>
   <p>
    his mother, looking at him through her silver spectacles.
   </p>
   <p>
    “As to external accomplishments, what will be the use of them in the
   </p>
   <p>
    life I am going to lead?—while as to her reading, I can take that in
   </p>
   <p>
    hand. She’ll be apt pupil enough, as you would say if you knew her.
   </p>
   <p>
    She’s brim full of poetry—actualized poetry, if I may use the
   </p>
   <p>
    expression. She _lives_ what paper-poets only write... And she is an
   </p>
   <p>
    unimpeachable Christian, I am sure; perhaps of the very tribe, genus,
   </p>
   <p>
    and species you desire to propagate.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O Angel, you are mocking!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Mother, I beg pardon. But as she really does attend Church almost
   </p>
   <p>
    every Sunday morning, and is a good Christian girl, I am sure you will
   </p>
   <p>
    tolerate any social shortcomings for the sake of that quality, and feel
   </p>
   <p>
    that I may do worse than choose her.” Angel waxed quite earnest on that
   </p>
   <p>
    rather automatic orthodoxy in his beloved Tess which (never dreaming
   </p>
   <p>
    that it might stand him in such good stead) he had been prone to slight
   </p>
   <p>
    when observing it practised by her and the other milkmaids, because of
   </p>
   <p>
    its obvious unreality amid beliefs essentially naturalistic.
   </p>
   <p>
    In their sad doubts as to whether their son had himself any right
   </p>
   <p>
    whatever to the title he claimed for the unknown young woman, Mr and
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs Clare began to feel it as an advantage not to be overlooked that
   </p>
   <p>
    she at least was sound in her views; especially as the conjunction of
   </p>
   <p>
    the pair must have arisen by an act of Providence; for Angel never
   </p>
   <p>
    would have made orthodoxy a condition of his choice. They said finally
   </p>
   <p>
    that it was better not to act in a hurry, but that they would not
   </p>
   <p>
    object to see her.
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel therefore refrained from declaring more particulars now. He felt
   </p>
   <p>
    that, single-minded and self-sacrificing as his parents were, there yet
   </p>
   <p>
    existed certain latent prejudices of theirs, as middle-class people,
   </p>
   <p>
    which it would require some tact to overcome. For though legally at
   </p>
   <p>
    liberty to do as he chose, and though their daughter-in-law’s
   </p>
   <p>
    qualifications could make no practical difference to their lives, in
   </p>
   <p>
    the probability of her living far away from them, he wished for
   </p>
   <p>
    affection’s sake not to wound their sentiment in the most important
   </p>
   <p>
    decision of his life.
   </p>
   <p>
    He observed his own inconsistencies in dwelling upon accidents in
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess’s life as if they were vital features. It was for herself that he
   </p>
   <p>
    loved Tess; her soul, her heart, her substance—not for her skill in the
   </p>
   <p>
    dairy, her aptness as his scholar, and certainly not for her simple
   </p>
   <p>
    formal faith-professions. Her unsophisticated open-air existence
   </p>
   <p>
    required no varnish of conventionality to make it palatable to him. He
   </p>
   <p>
    held that education had as yet but little affected the beats of emotion
   </p>
   <p>
    and impulse on which domestic happiness depends. It was probable that,
   </p>
   <p>
    in the lapse of ages, improved systems of moral and intellectual
   </p>
   <p>
    training would appreciably, perhaps considerably, elevate the
   </p>
   <p>
    involuntary and even the unconscious instincts of human nature; but up
   </p>
   <p>
    to the present day, culture, as far as he could see, might be said to
   </p>
   <p>
    have affected only the mental epiderm of those lives which had been
   </p>
   <p>
    brought under its influence. This belief was confirmed by his
   </p>
   <p>
    experience of women, which, having latterly been extended from the
   </p>
   <p>
    cultivated middle-class into the rural community, had taught him how
   </p>
   <p>
    much less was the intrinsic difference between the good and wise woman
   </p>
   <p>
    of one social stratum and the good and wise woman of another social
   </p>
   <p>
    stratum, than between the good and bad, the wise and the foolish, of
   </p>
   <p>
    the same stratum or class.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was the morning of his departure. His brothers had already left the
   </p>
   <p>
    Vicarage to proceed on a walking tour in the north, whence one was to
   </p>
   <p>
    return to his college, and the other to his curacy. Angel might have
   </p>
   <p>
    accompanied them, but preferred to rejoin his sweetheart at Talbothays.
   </p>
   <p>
    He would have been an awkward member of the party; for, though the most
   </p>
   <p>
    appreciative humanist, the most ideal religionist, even the best-versed
   </p>
   <p>
    Christologist of the three, there was alienation in the standing
   </p>
   <p>
    consciousness that his squareness would not fit the round hole that had
   </p>
   <p>
    been prepared for him. To neither Felix nor Cuthbert had he ventured to
   </p>
   <p>
    mention Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    His mother made him sandwiches, and his father accompanied him, on his
   </p>
   <p>
    own mare, a little way along the road. Having fairly well advanced his
   </p>
   <p>
    own affairs, Angel listened in a willing silence, as they jogged on
   </p>
   <p>
    together through the shady lanes, to his father’s account of his parish
   </p>
   <p>
    difficulties, and the coldness of brother clergymen whom he loved,
   </p>
   <p>
    because of his strict interpretations of the New Testament by the light
   </p>
   <p>
    of what they deemed a pernicious Calvinistic doctrine.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Pernicious!” said Mr Clare, with genial scorn; and he proceeded to
   </p>
   <p>
    recount experiences which would show the absurdity of that idea. He
   </p>
   <p>
    told of wondrous conversions of evil livers of which he had been the
   </p>
   <p>
    instrument, not only amongst the poor, but amongst the rich and
   </p>
   <p>
    well-to-do; and he also candidly admitted many failures.
   </p>
   <p>
    As an instance of the latter, he mentioned the case of a young upstart
   </p>
   <p>
    squire named d’Urberville, living some forty miles off, in the
   </p>
   <p>
    neighbourhood of Trantridge.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Not one of the ancient d’Urbervilles of Kingsbere and other places?”
   </p>
   <p>
    asked his son. “That curiously historic worn-out family with its
   </p>
   <p>
    ghostly legend of the coach-and-four?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O no. The original d’Urbervilles decayed and disappeared sixty or
   </p>
   <p>
    eighty years ago—at least, I believe so. This seems to be a new family
   </p>
   <p>
    which had taken the name; for the credit of the former knightly line I
   </p>
   <p>
    hope they are spurious, I’m sure. But it is odd to hear you express
   </p>
   <p>
    interest in old families. I thought you set less store by them even
   </p>
   <p>
    than I.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You misapprehend me, father; you often do,” said Angel with a little
   </p>
   <p>
    impatience. “Politically I am sceptical as to the virtue of their being
   </p>
   <p>
    old. Some of the wise even among themselves ‘exclaim against their own
   </p>
   <p>
    succession,’ as Hamlet puts it; but lyrically, dramatically, and even
   </p>
   <p>
    historically, I am tenderly attached to them.”
   </p>
   <p>
    This distinction, though by no means a subtle one, was yet too subtle
   </p>
   <p>
    for Mr Clare the elder, and he went on with the story he had been about
   </p>
   <p>
    to relate; which was that after the death of the senior so-called
   </p>
   <p>
    d’Urberville, the young man developed the most culpable passions,
   </p>
   <p>
    though he had a blind mother, whose condition should have made him know
   </p>
   <p>
    better. A knowledge of his career having come to the ears of Mr Clare,
   </p>
   <p>
    when he was in that part of the country preaching missionary sermons,
   </p>
   <p>
    he boldly took occasion to speak to the delinquent on his spiritual
   </p>
   <p>
    state. Though he was a stranger, occupying another’s pulpit, he had
   </p>
   <p>
    felt this to be his duty, and took for his text the words from St Luke:
   </p>
   <p>
    “Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee!” The young
   </p>
   <p>
    man much resented this directness of attack, and in the war of words
   </p>
   <p>
    which followed when they met he did not scruple publicly to insult Mr
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare, without respect for his gray hairs.
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel flushed with distress.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Dear father,” he said sadly, “I wish you would not expose yourself to
   </p>
   <p>
    such gratuitous pain from scoundrels!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Pain?” said his father, his rugged face shining in the ardour of
   </p>
   <p>
    self-abnegation. “The only pain to me was pain on his account, poor,
   </p>
   <p>
    foolish young man. Do you suppose his incensed words could give me any
   </p>
   <p>
    pain, or even his blows? ‘Being reviled we bless; being persecuted we
   </p>
   <p>
    suffer it; being defamed we entreat; we are made as the filth of the
   </p>
   <p>
    world, and as the offscouring of all things unto this day.’ Those
   </p>
   <p>
    ancient and noble words to the Corinthians are strictly true at this
   </p>
   <p>
    present hour.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Not blows, father? He did not proceed to blows?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No, he did not. Though I have borne blows from men in a mad state of
   </p>
   <p>
    intoxication.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “A dozen times, my boy. What then? I have saved them from the guilt of
   </p>
   <p>
    murdering their own flesh and blood thereby; and they have lived to
   </p>
   <p>
    thank me, and praise God.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “May this young man do the same!” said Angel fervently. “But I fear
   </p>
   <p>
    otherwise, from what you say.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “We’ll hope, nevertheless,” said Mr Clare. “And I continue to pray for
   </p>
   <p>
    him, though on this side of the grave we shall probably never meet
   </p>
   <p>
    again. But, after all, one of those poor words of mine may spring up in
   </p>
   <p>
    his heart as a good seed some day.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Now, as always, Clare’s father was sanguine as a child; and though the
   </p>
   <p>
    younger could not accept his parent’s narrow dogma, he revered his
   </p>
   <p>
    practice and recognized the hero under the pietist. Perhaps he revered
   </p>
   <p>
    his father’s practice even more now than ever, seeing that, in the
   </p>
   <p>
    question of making Tessy his wife, his father had not once thought of
   </p>
   <p>
    inquiring whether she were well provided or penniless. The same
   </p>
   <p>
    unworldliness was what had necessitated Angel’s getting a living as a
   </p>
   <p>
    farmer, and would probably keep his brothers in the position of poor
   </p>
   <p>
    parsons for the term of their activities; yet Angel admired it none the
   </p>
   <p>
    less. Indeed, despite his own heterodoxy, Angel often felt that he was
   </p>
   <p>
    nearer to his father on the human side than was either of his brethren.
   </p>
   <p>
    XXVII
   </p>
   <p>
    An up-hill and down-hill ride of twenty-odd miles through a garish
   </p>
   <p>
    mid-day atmosphere brought him in the afternoon to a detached knoll a
   </p>
   <p>
    mile or two west of Talbothays, whence he again looked into that green
   </p>
   <p>
    trough of sappiness and humidity, the valley of the Var or Froom.
   </p>
   <p>
    Immediately he began to descend from the upland to the fat alluvial
   </p>
   <p>
    soil below, the atmosphere grew heavier; the languid perfume of the
   </p>
   <p>
    summer fruits, the mists, the hay, the flowers, formed therein a vast
   </p>
   <p>
    pool of odour which at this hour seemed to make the animals, the very
   </p>
   <p>
    bees and butterflies drowsy. Clare was now so familiar with the spot
   </p>
   <p>
    that he knew the individual cows by their names when, a long distance
   </p>
   <p>
    off, he saw them dotted about the meads. It was with a sense of luxury
   </p>
   <p>
    that he recognized his power of viewing life here from its inner side,
   </p>
   <p>
    in a way that had been quite foreign to him in his student-days; and,
   </p>
   <p>
    much as he loved his parents, he could not help being aware that to
   </p>
   <p>
    come here, as now, after an experience of home-life, affected him like
   </p>
   <p>
    throwing off splints and bandages; even the one customary curb on the
   </p>
   <p>
    humours of English rural societies being absent in this place,
   </p>
   <p>
    Talbothays having no resident landlord.
   </p>
   <p>
    Not a human being was out of doors at the dairy. The denizens were all
   </p>
   <p>
    enjoying the usual afternoon nap of an hour or so which the exceedingly
   </p>
   <p>
    early hours kept in summer-time rendered a necessity. At the door the
   </p>
   <p>
    wood-hooped pails, sodden and bleached by infinite scrubbings, hung
   </p>
   <p>
    like hats on a stand upon the forked and peeled limb of an oak fixed
   </p>
   <p>
    there for that purpose; all of them ready and dry for the evening
   </p>
   <p>
    milking. Angel entered, and went through the silent passages of the
   </p>
   <p>
    house to the back quarters, where he listened for a moment. Sustained
   </p>
   <p>
    snores came from the cart-house, where some of the men were lying down;
   </p>
   <p>
    the grunt and squeal of sweltering pigs arose from the still further
   </p>
   <p>
    distance. The large-leaved rhubarb and cabbage plants slept too, their
   </p>
   <p>
    broad limp surfaces hanging in the sun like half-closed umbrellas.
   </p>
   <p>
    He unbridled and fed his horse, and as he re-entered the house the
   </p>
   <p>
    clock struck three. Three was the afternoon skimming-hour; and, with
   </p>
   <p>
    the stroke, Clare heard the creaking of the floor-boards above, and
   </p>
   <p>
    then the touch of a descending foot on the stairs. It was Tess’s, who
   </p>
   <p>
    in another moment came down before his eyes.
   </p>
   <p>
    She had not heard him enter, and hardly realized his presence there.
   </p>
   <p>
    She was yawning, and he saw the red interior of her mouth as if it had
   </p>
   <p>
    been a snake’s. She had stretched one arm so high above her coiled-up
   </p>
   <p>
    cable of hair that he could see its satin delicacy above the sunburn;
   </p>
   <p>
    her face was flushed with sleep, and her eyelids hung heavy over their
   </p>
   <p>
    pupils. The brim-fulness of her nature breathed from her. It was a
   </p>
   <p>
    moment when a woman’s soul is more incarnate than at any other time;
   </p>
   <p>
    when the most spiritual beauty bespeaks itself flesh; and sex takes the
   </p>
   <p>
    outside place in the presentation.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then those eyes flashed brightly through their filmy heaviness, before
   </p>
   <p>
    the remainder of her face was well awake. With an oddly compounded look
   </p>
   <p>
    of gladness, shyness, and surprise, she exclaimed—“O Mr Clare! How you
   </p>
   <p>
    frightened me—I—”
   </p>
   <p>
    There had not at first been time for her to think of the changed
   </p>
   <p>
    relations which his declaration had introduced; but the full sense of
   </p>
   <p>
    the matter rose up in her face when she encountered Clare’s tender look
   </p>
   <p>
    as he stepped forward to the bottom stair.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Dear, darling Tessy!” he whispered, putting his arm round her, and his
   </p>
   <p>
    face to her flushed cheek. “Don’t, for Heaven’s sake, Mister me any
   </p>
   <p>
    more. I have hastened back so soon because of you!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess’s excitable heart beat against his by way of reply; and there they
   </p>
   <p>
    stood upon the red-brick floor of the entry, the sun slanting in by the
   </p>
   <p>
    window upon his back, as he held her tightly to his breast; upon her
   </p>
   <p>
    inclining face, upon the blue veins of her temple, upon her naked arm,
   </p>
   <p>
    and her neck, and into the depths of her hair. Having been lying down
   </p>
   <p>
    in her clothes she was warm as a sunned cat. At first she would not
   </p>
   <p>
    look straight up at him, but her eyes soon lifted, and his plumbed the
   </p>
   <p>
    deepness of the ever-varying pupils, with their radiating fibrils of
   </p>
   <p>
    blue, and black, and gray, and violet, while she regarded him as Eve at
   </p>
   <p>
    her second waking might have regarded Adam.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’ve got to go a-skimming,” she pleaded, “and I have on’y old Deb to
   </p>
   <p>
    help me to-day. Mrs Crick is gone to market with Mr Crick, and Retty is
   </p>
   <p>
    not well, and the others are gone out somewhere, and won’t be home till
   </p>
   <p>
    milking.”
   </p>
   <p>
    As they retreated to the milk-house Deborah Fyander appeared on the
   </p>
   <p>
    stairs.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I have come back, Deborah,” said Mr Clare, upwards. “So I can help
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess with the skimming; and, as you are very tired, I am sure, you
   </p>
   <p>
    needn’t come down till milking-time.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Possibly the Talbothays milk was not very thoroughly skimmed that
   </p>
   <p>
    afternoon. Tess was in a dream wherein familiar objects appeared as
   </p>
   <p>
    having light and shade and position, but no particular outline. Every
   </p>
   <p>
    time she held the skimmer under the pump to cool it for the work her
   </p>
   <p>
    hand trembled, the ardour of his affection being so palpable that she
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed to flinch under it like a plant in too burning a sun.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then he pressed her again to his side, and when she had done running
   </p>
   <p>
    her forefinger round the leads to cut off the cream-edge, he cleaned it
   </p>
   <p>
    in nature’s way; for the unconstrained manners of Talbothays dairy came
   </p>
   <p>
    convenient now.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I may as well say it now as later, dearest,” he resumed gently. “I
   </p>
   <p>
    wish to ask you something of a very practical nature, which I have been
   </p>
   <p>
    thinking of ever since that day last week in the meads. I shall soon
   </p>
   <p>
    want to marry, and, being a farmer, you see I shall require for my wife
   </p>
   <p>
    a woman who knows all about the management of farms. Will you be that
   </p>
   <p>
    woman, Tessy?”
   </p>
   <p>
    He put it that way that she might not think he had yielded to an
   </p>
   <p>
    impulse of which his head would disapprove.
   </p>
   <p>
    She turned quite careworn. She had bowed to the inevitable result of
   </p>
   <p>
    proximity, the necessity of loving him; but she had not calculated upon
   </p>
   <p>
    this sudden corollary, which, indeed, Clare had put before her without
   </p>
   <p>
    quite meaning himself to do it so soon. With pain that was like the
   </p>
   <p>
    bitterness of dissolution she murmured the words of her indispensable
   </p>
   <p>
    and sworn answer as an honourable woman.
   </p>
   <p>
    “O Mr Clare—I cannot be your wife—I cannot be!”
   </p>
   <p>
    The sound of her own decision seemed to break Tess’s very heart, and
   </p>
   <p>
    she bowed her face in her grief.
   </p>
   <p>
    “But, Tess!” he said, amazed at her reply, and holding her still more
   </p>
   <p>
    greedily close. “Do you say no? Surely you love me?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O yes, yes! And I would rather be yours than anybody’s in the world,”
   </p>
   <p>
    returned the sweet and honest voice of the distressed girl. “But I
   </p>
   <p>
    _cannot_ marry you!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tess,” he said, holding her at arm’s length, “you are engaged to marry
   </p>
   <p>
    some one else!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No, no!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Then why do you refuse me?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t want to marry! I have not thought of doing it. I cannot! I
   </p>
   <p>
    only want to love you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But why?”
   </p>
   <p>
    Driven to subterfuge, she stammered—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Your father is a parson, and your mother wouldn’ like you to marry
   </p>
   <p>
    such as me. She will want you to marry a lady.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Nonsense—I have spoken to them both. That was partly why I went home.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I feel I cannot—never, never!” she echoed.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Is it too sudden to be asked thus, my Pretty?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes—I did not expect it.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “If you will let it pass, please, Tessy, I will give you time,” he
   </p>
   <p>
    said. “It was very abrupt to come home and speak to you all at once.
   </p>
   <p>
    I’ll not allude to it again for a while.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She again took up the shining skimmer, held it beneath the pump, and
   </p>
   <p>
    began anew. But she could not, as at other times, hit the exact
   </p>
   <p>
    under-surface of the cream with the delicate dexterity required, try as
   </p>
   <p>
    she might; sometimes she was cutting down into the milk, sometimes in
   </p>
   <p>
    the air. She could hardly see, her eyes having filled with two blurring
   </p>
   <p>
    tears drawn forth by a grief which, to this her best friend and dear
   </p>
   <p>
    advocate, she could never explain.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I can’t skim—I can’t!” she said, turning away from him.
   </p>
   <p>
    Not to agitate and hinder her longer, the considerate Clare began
   </p>
   <p>
    talking in a more general way:
   </p>
   <p>
    “You quite misapprehend my parents. They are the most simple-mannered
   </p>
   <p>
    people alive, and quite unambitious. They are two of the few remaining
   </p>
   <p>
    Evangelical school. Tessy, are you an Evangelical?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t know.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You go to church very regularly, and our parson here is not very High,
   </p>
   <p>
    they tell me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess’s ideas on the views of the parish clergyman, whom she heard every
   </p>
   <p>
    week, seemed to be rather more vague than Clare’s, who had never heard
   </p>
   <p>
    him at all.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I wish I could fix my mind on what I hear there more firmly than I
   </p>
   <p>
    do,” she remarked as a safe generality. “It is often a great sorrow to
   </p>
   <p>
    me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She spoke so unaffectedly that Angel was sure in his heart that his
   </p>
   <p>
    father could not object to her on religious grounds, even though she
   </p>
   <p>
    did not know whether her principles were High, Low or Broad. He himself
   </p>
   <p>
    knew that, in reality, the confused beliefs which she held, apparently
   </p>
   <p>
    imbibed in childhood, were, if anything, Tractarian as to phraseology,
   </p>
   <p>
    and Pantheistic as to essence. Confused or otherwise, to disturb them
   </p>
   <p>
    was his last desire:
   </p>
   <p>
    Leave thou thy sister, when she prays,
   </p>
   <p>
    Her early Heaven, her happy views;
   </p>
   <p>
    Nor thou with shadow’d hint confuse
   </p>
   <p>
    A life that leads melodious days.
   </p>
   <p>
    He had occasionally thought the counsel less honest than musical; but
   </p>
   <p>
    he gladly conformed to it now.
   </p>
   <p>
    He spoke further of the incidents of his visit, of his father’s mode of
   </p>
   <p>
    life, of his zeal for his principles; she grew serener, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    undulations disappeared from her skimming; as she finished one lead
   </p>
   <p>
    after another he followed her, and drew the plugs for letting down the
   </p>
   <p>
    milk.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I fancied you looked a little downcast when you came in,” she ventured
   </p>
   <p>
    to observe, anxious to keep away from the subject of herself.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes—well, my father had been talking a good deal to me of his troubles
   </p>
   <p>
    and difficulties, and the subject always tends to depress me. He is so
   </p>
   <p>
    zealous that he gets many snubs and buffetings from people of a
   </p>
   <p>
    different way of thinking from himself, and I don’t like to hear of
   </p>
   <p>
    such humiliations to a man of his age, the more particularly as I don’t
   </p>
   <p>
    think earnestness does any good when carried so far. He has been
   </p>
   <p>
    telling me of a very unpleasant scene in which he took part quite
   </p>
   <p>
    recently. He went as the deputy of some missionary society to preach in
   </p>
   <p>
    the neighbourhood of Trantridge, a place forty miles from here, and
   </p>
   <p>
    made it his business to expostulate with a lax young cynic he met with
   </p>
   <p>
    somewhere about there—son of some landowner up that way—and who has a
   </p>
   <p>
    mother afflicted with blindness. My father addressed himself to the
   </p>
   <p>
    gentleman point-blank, and there was quite a disturbance. It was very
   </p>
   <p>
    foolish of my father, I must say, to intrude his conversation upon a
   </p>
   <p>
    stranger when the probabilities were so obvious that it would be
   </p>
   <p>
    useless. But whatever he thinks to be his duty, that he’ll do, in
   </p>
   <p>
    season or out of season; and, of course, he makes many enemies, not
   </p>
   <p>
    only among the absolutely vicious, but among the easy-going, who hate
   </p>
   <p>
    being bothered. He says he glories in what happened, and that good may
   </p>
   <p>
    be done indirectly; but I wish he would not wear himself out now he is
   </p>
   <p>
    getting old, and would leave such pigs to their wallowing.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess’s look had grown hard and worn, and her ripe mouth tragical; but
   </p>
   <p>
    she no longer showed any tremulousness. Clare’s revived thoughts of his
   </p>
   <p>
    father prevented his noticing her particularly; and so they went on
   </p>
   <p>
    down the white row of liquid rectangles till they had finished and
   </p>
   <p>
    drained them off, when the other maids returned, and took their pails,
   </p>
   <p>
    and Deb came to scald out the leads for the new milk. As Tess withdrew
   </p>
   <p>
    to go afield to the cows he said to her softly—
   </p>
   <p>
    “And my question, Tessy?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O no—no!” replied she with grave hopelessness, as one who had heard
   </p>
   <p>
    anew the turmoil of her own past in the allusion to Alec d’Urberville.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It _can’t_ be!”
   </p>
   <p>
    She went out towards the mead, joining the other milkmaids with a
   </p>
   <p>
    bound, as if trying to make the open air drive away her sad constraint.
   </p>
   <p>
    All the girls drew onward to the spot where the cows were grazing in
   </p>
   <p>
    the farther mead, the bevy advancing with the bold grace of wild
   </p>
   <p>
    animals—the reckless, unchastened motion of women accustomed to
   </p>
   <p>
    unlimited space—in which they abandoned themselves to the air as a
   </p>
   <p>
    swimmer to the wave. It seemed natural enough to him now that Tess was
   </p>
   <p>
    again in sight to choose a mate from unconstrained Nature, and not from
   </p>
   <p>
    the abodes of Art.
   </p>
   <p>
    XXVIII
   </p>
   <p>
    Her refusal, though unexpected, did not permanently daunt Clare. His
   </p>
   <p>
    experience of women was great enough for him to be aware that the
   </p>
   <p>
    negative often meant nothing more than the preface to the affirmative;
   </p>
   <p>
    and it was little enough for him not to know that in the manner of the
   </p>
   <p>
    present negative there lay a great exception to the dallyings of
   </p>
   <p>
    coyness. That she had already permitted him to make love to her he read
   </p>
   <p>
    as an additional assurance, not fully trowing that in the fields and
   </p>
   <p>
    pastures to “sigh gratis” is by no means deemed waste; love-making
   </p>
   <p>
    being here more often accepted inconsiderately and for its own sweet
   </p>
   <p>
    sake than in the carking, anxious homes of the ambitious, where a
   </p>
   <p>
    girl’s craving for an establishment paralyzes her healthy thought of a
   </p>
   <p>
    passion as an end.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tess, why did you say ‘no’ in such a positive way?” he asked her in
   </p>
   <p>
    the course of a few days.
   </p>
   <p>
    She started.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Don’t ask me. I told you why—partly. I am not good enough—not worthy
   </p>
   <p>
    enough.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “How? Not fine lady enough?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes—something like that,” murmured she. “Your friends would scorn me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Indeed, you mistake them—my father and mother. As for my brothers, I
   </p>
   <p>
    don’t care—” He clasped his fingers behind her back to keep her from
   </p>
   <p>
    slipping away. “Now—you did not mean it, sweet?—I am sure you did not!
   </p>
   <p>
    You have made me so restless that I cannot read, or play, or do
   </p>
   <p>
    anything. I am in no hurry, Tess, but I want to know—to hear from your
   </p>
   <p>
    own warm lips—that you will some day be mine—any time you may choose;
   </p>
   <p>
    but some day?”
   </p>
   <p>
    She could only shake her head and look away from him.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare regarded her attentively, conned the characters of her face as if
   </p>
   <p>
    they had been hieroglyphics. The denial seemed real.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Then I ought not to hold you in this way—ought I? I have no right to
   </p>
   <p>
    you—no right to seek out where you are, or walk with you! Honestly,
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess, do you love any other man?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “How can you ask?” she said, with continued self-suppression.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I almost know that you do not. But then, why do you repulse me?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t repulse you. I like you to—tell me you love me; and you may
   </p>
   <p>
    always tell me so as you go about with me—and never offend me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But you will not accept me as a husband?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah—that’s different—it is for your good, indeed, my dearest! O,
   </p>
   <p>
    believe me, it is only for your sake! I don’t like to give myself the
   </p>
   <p>
    great happiness o’ promising to be yours in that way—because—because I
   </p>
   <p>
    am _sure_ I ought not to do it.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But you will make me happy!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah—you think so, but you don’t know!”
   </p>
   <p>
    At such times as this, apprehending the grounds of her refusal to be
   </p>
   <p>
    her modest sense of incompetence in matters social and polite, he would
   </p>
   <p>
    say that she was wonderfully well-informed and versatile—which was
   </p>
   <p>
    certainly true, her natural quickness and her admiration for him having
   </p>
   <p>
    led her to pick up his vocabulary, his accent, and fragments of his
   </p>
   <p>
    knowledge, to a surprising extent. After these tender contests and her
   </p>
   <p>
    victory she would go away by herself under the remotest cow, if at
   </p>
   <p>
    milking-time, or into the sedge or into her room, if at a leisure
   </p>
   <p>
    interval, and mourn silently, not a minute after an apparently
   </p>
   <p>
    phlegmatic negative.
   </p>
   <p>
    The struggle was so fearful; her own heart was so strongly on the side
   </p>
   <p>
    of his—two ardent hearts against one poor little conscience—that she
   </p>
   <p>
    tried to fortify her resolution by every means in her power. She had
   </p>
   <p>
    come to Talbothays with a made-up mind. On no account could she agree
   </p>
   <p>
    to a step which might afterwards cause bitter rueing to her husband for
   </p>
   <p>
    his blindness in wedding her. And she held that what her conscience had
   </p>
   <p>
    decided for her when her mind was unbiassed ought not to be overruled
   </p>
   <p>
    now.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why don’t somebody tell him all about me?” she said. “It was only
   </p>
   <p>
    forty miles off—why hasn’t it reached here? Somebody must know!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet nobody seemed to know; nobody told him.
   </p>
   <p>
    For two or three days no more was said. She guessed from the sad
   </p>
   <p>
    countenances of her chamber companions that they regarded her not only
   </p>
   <p>
    as the favourite, but as the chosen; but they could see for themselves
   </p>
   <p>
    that she did not put herself in his way.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess had never before known a time in which the thread of her life was
   </p>
   <p>
    so distinctly twisted of two strands, positive pleasure and positive
   </p>
   <p>
    pain. At the next cheese-making the pair were again left alone
   </p>
   <p>
    together. The dairyman himself had been lending a hand; but Mr Crick,
   </p>
   <p>
    as well as his wife, seemed latterly to have acquired a suspicion of
   </p>
   <p>
    mutual interest between these two; though they walked so circumspectly
   </p>
   <p>
    that suspicion was but of the faintest. Anyhow, the dairyman left them
   </p>
   <p>
    to themselves.
   </p>
   <p>
    They were breaking up the masses of curd before putting them into the
   </p>
   <p>
    vats. The operation resembled the act of crumbling bread on a large
   </p>
   <p>
    scale; and amid the immaculate whiteness of the curds Tess
   </p>
   <p>
    Durbeyfield’s hands showed themselves of the pinkness of the rose.
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel, who was filling the vats with his handful, suddenly ceased, and
   </p>
   <p>
    laid his hands flat upon hers. Her sleeves were rolled far above the
   </p>
   <p>
    elbow, and bending lower he kissed the inside vein of her soft arm.
   </p>
   <p>
    Although the early September weather was sultry, her arm, from her
   </p>
   <p>
    dabbling in the curds, was as cold and damp to his mouth as a
   </p>
   <p>
    new-gathered mushroom, and tasted of the whey. But she was such a sheaf
   </p>
   <p>
    of susceptibilities that her pulse was accelerated by the touch, her
   </p>
   <p>
    blood driven to her finger-ends, and the cool arms flushed hot. Then,
   </p>
   <p>
    as though her heart had said, “Is coyness longer necessary? Truth is
   </p>
   <p>
    truth between man and woman, as between man and man,” she lifted her
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes and they beamed devotedly into his, as her lip rose in a tender
   </p>
   <p>
    half-smile.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Do you know why I did that, Tess?” he said.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Because you love me very much!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, and as a preliminary to a new entreaty.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Not _again_!”
   </p>
   <p>
    She looked a sudden fear that her resistance might break down under her
   </p>
   <p>
    own desire.
   </p>
   <p>
    “O, Tessy!” he went on, “I _cannot_ think why you are so tantalizing.
   </p>
   <p>
    Why do you disappoint me so? You seem almost like a coquette, upon my
   </p>
   <p>
    life you do—a coquette of the first urban water! They blow hot and blow
   </p>
   <p>
    cold, just as you do, and it is the very last sort of thing to expect
   </p>
   <p>
    to find in a retreat like Talbothays.... And yet, dearest,” he quickly
   </p>
   <p>
    added, observing how the remark had cut her, “I know you to be the most
   </p>
   <p>
    honest, spotless creature that ever lived. So how can I suppose you a
   </p>
   <p>
    flirt? Tess, why don’t you like the idea of being my wife, if you love
   </p>
   <p>
    me as you seem to do?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I have never said I don’t like the idea, and I never could say it;
   </p>
   <p>
    because—it isn’t true!”
   </p>
   <p>
    The stress now getting beyond endurance, her lip quivered, and she was
   </p>
   <p>
    obliged to go away. Clare was so pained and perplexed that he ran after
   </p>
   <p>
    and caught her in the passage.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tell me, tell me!” he said, passionately clasping her, in
   </p>
   <p>
    forgetfulness of his curdy hands: “do tell me that you won’t belong to
   </p>
   <p>
    anybody but me!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I will, I will tell you!” she exclaimed. “And I will give you a
   </p>
   <p>
    complete answer, if you will let me go now. I will tell you my
   </p>
   <p>
    experiences—all about myself—all!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Your experiences, dear; yes, certainly; any number.” He expressed
   </p>
   <p>
    assent in loving satire, looking into her face. “My Tess, no doubt,
   </p>
   <p>
    almost as many experiences as that wild convolvulus out there on the
   </p>
   <p>
    garden hedge, that opened itself this morning for the first time. Tell
   </p>
   <p>
    me anything, but don’t use that wretched expression any more about not
   </p>
   <p>
    being worthy of me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I will try—not! And I’ll give you my reasons to-morrow—next week.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Say on Sunday?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, on Sunday.”
   </p>
   <p>
    At last she got away, and did not stop in her retreat till she was in
   </p>
   <p>
    the thicket of pollard willows at the lower side of the barton, where
   </p>
   <p>
    she could be quite unseen. Here Tess flung herself down upon the
   </p>
   <p>
    rustling undergrowth of spear-grass, as upon a bed, and remained
   </p>
   <p>
    crouching in palpitating misery broken by momentary shoots of joy,
   </p>
   <p>
    which her fears about the ending could not altogether suppress.
   </p>
   <p>
    In reality, she was drifting into acquiescence. Every see-saw of her
   </p>
   <p>
    breath, every wave of her blood, every pulse singing in her ears, was a
   </p>
   <p>
    voice that joined with nature in revolt against her scrupulousness.
   </p>
   <p>
    Reckless, inconsiderate acceptance of him; to close with him at the
   </p>
   <p>
    altar, revealing nothing, and chancing discovery; to snatch ripe
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasure before the iron teeth of pain could have time to shut upon
   </p>
   <p>
    her: that was what love counselled; and in almost a terror of ecstasy
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess divined that, despite her many months of lonely self-chastisement,
   </p>
   <p>
    wrestlings, communings, schemes to lead a future of austere isolation,
   </p>
   <p>
    love’s counsel would prevail.
   </p>
   <p>
    The afternoon advanced, and still she remained among the willows. She
   </p>
   <p>
    heard the rattle of taking down the pails from the forked stands; the
   </p>
   <p>
    “waow-waow!” which accompanied the getting together of the cows. But
   </p>
   <p>
    she did not go to the milking. They would see her agitation; and the
   </p>
   <p>
    dairyman, thinking the cause to be love alone, would good-naturedly
   </p>
   <p>
    tease her; and that harassment could not be borne.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her lover must have guessed her overwrought state, and invented some
   </p>
   <p>
    excuse for her non-appearance, for no inquiries were made or calls
   </p>
   <p>
    given. At half-past six the sun settled down upon the levels with the
   </p>
   <p>
    aspect of a great forge in the heavens; and presently a monstrous
   </p>
   <p>
    pumpkin-like moon arose on the other hand. The pollard willows,
   </p>
   <p>
    tortured out of their natural shape by incessant choppings, became
   </p>
   <p>
    spiny-haired monsters as they stood up against it. She went in and
   </p>
   <p>
    upstairs without a light.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was now Wednesday. Thursday came, and Angel looked thoughtfully at
   </p>
   <p>
    her from a distance, but intruded in no way upon her. The indoor
   </p>
   <p>
    milkmaids, Marian and the rest, seemed to guess that something definite
   </p>
   <p>
    was afoot, for they did not force any remarks upon her in the
   </p>
   <p>
    bedchamber. Friday passed; Saturday. To-morrow was the day.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I shall give way—I shall say yes—I shall let myself marry him—I cannot
   </p>
   <p>
    help it!” she jealously panted, with her hot face to the pillow that
   </p>
   <p>
    night, on hearing one of the other girls sigh his name in her sleep. “I
   </p>
   <p>
    can’t bear to let anybody have him but me! Yet it is a wrong to him,
   </p>
   <p>
    and may kill him when he knows! O my heart—O—O—O!”
   </p>
   <p>
    XXIX
   </p>
   <p>
    “Now, who mid ye think I’ve heard news o’ this morning?” said Dairyman
   </p>
   <p>
    Crick, as he sat down to breakfast next day, with a riddling gaze round
   </p>
   <p>
    upon the munching men and maids. “Now, just who mid ye think?”
   </p>
   <p>
    One guessed, and another guessed. Mrs Crick did not guess, because she
   </p>
   <p>
    knew already.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well,” said the dairyman, “’tis that slack-twisted ’hore’s-bird of a
   </p>
   <p>
    feller, Jack Dollop. He’s lately got married to a widow-woman.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Not Jack Dollop? A villain—to think o’ that!” said a milker.
   </p>
   <p>
    The name entered quickly into Tess Durbeyfield’s consciousness, for it
   </p>
   <p>
    was the name of the lover who had wronged his sweetheart, and had
   </p>
   <p>
    afterwards been so roughly used by the young woman’s mother in the
   </p>
   <p>
    butter-churn.
   </p>
   <p>
    “And had he married the valiant matron’s daughter, as he promised?”
   </p>
   <p>
    asked Angel Clare absently, as he turned over the newspaper he was
   </p>
   <p>
    reading at the little table to which he was always banished by Mrs
   </p>
   <p>
    Crick, in her sense of his gentility.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Not he, sir. Never meant to,” replied the dairyman. “As I say, ’tis a
   </p>
   <p>
    widow-woman, and she had money, it seems—fifty poun’ a year or so; and
   </p>
   <p>
    that was all he was after. They were married in a great hurry; and then
   </p>
   <p>
    she told him that by marrying she had lost her fifty poun’ a year. Just
   </p>
   <p>
    fancy the state o’ my gentleman’s mind at that news! Never such a
   </p>
   <p>
    cat-and-dog life as they’ve been leading ever since! Serves him well
   </p>
   <p>
    beright. But onluckily the poor woman gets the worst o’t.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, the silly body should have told en sooner that the ghost of her
   </p>
   <p>
    first man would trouble him,” said Mrs Crick.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ay, ay,” responded the dairyman indecisively. “Still, you can see
   </p>
   <p>
    exactly how ’twas. She wanted a home, and didn’t like to run the risk
   </p>
   <p>
    of losing him. Don’t ye think that was something like it, maidens?”
   </p>
   <p>
    He glanced towards the row of girls.
   </p>
   <p>
    “She ought to ha’ told him just before they went to church, when he
   </p>
   <p>
    could hardly have backed out,” exclaimed Marian.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, she ought,” agreed Izz.
   </p>
   <p>
    “She must have seen what he was after, and should ha’ refused him,”
   </p>
   <p>
    cried Retty spasmodically.
   </p>
   <p>
    “And what do you say, my dear?” asked the dairyman of Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I think she ought—to have told him the true state of things—or else
   </p>
   <p>
    refused him—I don’t know,” replied Tess, the bread-and-butter choking
   </p>
   <p>
    her.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Be cust if I’d have done either o’t,” said Beck Knibbs, a married
   </p>
   <p>
    helper from one of the cottages. “All’s fair in love and war. I’d ha’
   </p>
   <p>
    married en just as she did, and if he’d said two words to me about not
   </p>
   <p>
    telling him beforehand anything whatsomdever about my first chap that I
   </p>
   <p>
    hadn’t chose to tell, I’d ha’ knocked him down wi’ the rolling-pin—a
   </p>
   <p>
    scram little feller like he! Any woman could do it.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The laughter which followed this sally was supplemented only by a sorry
   </p>
   <p>
    smile, for form’s sake, from Tess. What was comedy to them was tragedy
   </p>
   <p>
    to her; and she could hardly bear their mirth. She soon rose from
   </p>
   <p>
    table, and, with an impression that Clare would soon follow her, went
   </p>
   <p>
    along a little wriggling path, now stepping to one side of the
   </p>
   <p>
    irrigating channels, and now to the other, till she stood by the main
   </p>
   <p>
    stream of the Var. Men had been cutting the water-weeds higher up the
   </p>
   <p>
    river, and masses of them were floating past her—moving islands of
   </p>
   <p>
    green crow-foot, whereon she might almost have ridden; long locks of
   </p>
   <p>
    which weed had lodged against the piles driven to keep the cows from
   </p>
   <p>
    crossing.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yes, there was the pain of it. This question of a woman telling her
   </p>
   <p>
    story—the heaviest of crosses to herself—seemed but amusement to
   </p>
   <p>
    others. It was as if people should laugh at martyrdom.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tessy!” came from behind her, and Clare sprang across the gully,
   </p>
   <p>
    alighting beside her feet. “My wife—soon!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No, no; I cannot. For your sake, O Mr Clare; for your sake, I say no!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tess!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Still I say no!” she repeated.
   </p>
   <p>
    Not expecting this, he had put his arm lightly round her waist the
   </p>
   <p>
    moment after speaking, beneath her hanging tail of hair. (The younger
   </p>
   <p>
    dairymaids, including Tess, breakfasted with their hair loose on Sunday
   </p>
   <p>
    mornings before building it up extra high for attending church, a style
   </p>
   <p>
    they could not adopt when milking with their heads against the cows.)
   </p>
   <p>
    If she had said “Yes” instead of “No” he would have kissed her; it had
   </p>
   <p>
    evidently been his intention; but her determined negative deterred his
   </p>
   <p>
    scrupulous heart. Their condition of domiciliary comradeship put her,
   </p>
   <p>
    as the woman, to such disadvantage by its enforced intercourse, that he
   </p>
   <p>
    felt it unfair to her to exercise any pressure of blandishment which he
   </p>
   <p>
    might have honestly employed had she been better able to avoid him. He
   </p>
   <p>
    released her momentarily-imprisoned waist, and withheld the kiss.
   </p>
   <p>
    It all turned on that release. What had given her strength to refuse
   </p>
   <p>
    him this time was solely the tale of the widow told by the dairyman;
   </p>
   <p>
    and that would have been overcome in another moment. But Angel said no
   </p>
   <p>
    more; his face was perplexed; he went away.
   </p>
   <p>
    Day after day they met—somewhat less constantly than before; and thus
   </p>
   <p>
    two or three weeks went by. The end of September drew near, and she
   </p>
   <p>
    could see in his eye that he might ask her again.
   </p>
   <p>
    His plan of procedure was different now—as though he had made up his
   </p>
   <p>
    mind that her negatives were, after all, only coyness and youth
   </p>
   <p>
    startled by the novelty of the proposal. The fitful evasiveness of her
   </p>
   <p>
    manner when the subject was under discussion countenanced the idea. So
   </p>
   <p>
    he played a more coaxing game; and while never going beyond words, or
   </p>
   <p>
    attempting the renewal of caresses, he did his utmost orally.
   </p>
   <p>
    In this way Clare persistently wooed her in undertones like that of the
   </p>
   <p>
    purling milk—at the cow’s side, at skimmings, at butter-makings, at
   </p>
   <p>
    cheese-makings, among broody poultry, and among farrowing pigs—as no
   </p>
   <p>
    milkmaid was ever wooed before by such a man.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess knew that she must break down. Neither a religious sense of a
   </p>
   <p>
    certain moral validity in the previous union nor a conscientious wish
   </p>
   <p>
    for candour could hold out against it much longer. She loved him so
   </p>
   <p>
    passionately, and he was so godlike in her eyes; and being, though
   </p>
   <p>
    untrained, instinctively refined, her nature cried for his tutelary
   </p>
   <p>
    guidance. And thus, though Tess kept repeating to herself, “I can never
   </p>
   <p>
    be his wife,” the words were vain. A proof of her weakness lay in the
   </p>
   <p>
    very utterance of what calm strength would not have taken the trouble
   </p>
   <p>
    to formulate. Every sound of his voice beginning on the old subject
   </p>
   <p>
    stirred her with a terrifying bliss, and she coveted the recantation
   </p>
   <p>
    she feared.
   </p>
   <p>
    His manner was—what man’s is not?—so much that of one who would love
   </p>
   <p>
    and cherish and defend her under any conditions, changes, charges, or
   </p>
   <p>
    revelations, that her gloom lessened as she basked in it. The season
   </p>
   <p>
    meanwhile was drawing onward to the equinox, and though it was still
   </p>
   <p>
    fine, the days were much shorter. The dairy had again worked by morning
   </p>
   <p>
    candlelight for a long time; and a fresh renewal of Clare’s pleading
   </p>
   <p>
    occurred one morning between three and four.
   </p>
   <p>
    She had run up in her bedgown to his door to call him as usual; then
   </p>
   <p>
    had gone back to dress and call the others; and in ten minutes was
   </p>
   <p>
    walking to the head of the stairs with the candle in her hand. At the
   </p>
   <p>
    same moment he came down his steps from above in his shirt-sleeves and
   </p>
   <p>
    put his arm across the stairway.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Now, Miss Flirt, before you go down,” he said peremptorily. “It is a
   </p>
   <p>
    fortnight since I spoke, and this won’t do any longer. You _must_ tell
   </p>
   <p>
    me what you mean, or I shall have to leave this house. My door was ajar
   </p>
   <p>
    just now, and I saw you. For your own safety I must go. You don’t know.
   </p>
   <p>
    Well? Is it to be yes at last?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am only just up, Mr Clare, and it is too early to take me to task!”
   </p>
   <p>
    she pouted. “You need not call me Flirt. ’Tis cruel and untrue. Wait
   </p>
   <p>
    till by and by. Please wait till by and by! I will really think
   </p>
   <p>
    seriously about it between now and then. Let me go downstairs!”
   </p>
   <p>
    She looked a little like what he said she was as, holding the candle
   </p>
   <p>
    sideways, she tried to smile away the seriousness of her words.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Call me Angel, then, and not Mr Clare.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Angel.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Angel dearest—why not?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “’Twould mean that I agree, wouldn’t it?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It would only mean that you love me, even if you cannot marry me; and
   </p>
   <p>
    you were so good as to own that long ago.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Very well, then, ‘Angel dearest’, if I _must_,” she murmured, looking
   </p>
   <p>
    at her candle, a roguish curl coming upon her mouth, notwithstanding
   </p>
   <p>
    her suspense.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare had resolved never to kiss her until he had obtained her promise;
   </p>
   <p>
    but somehow, as Tess stood there in her prettily tucked-up milking
   </p>
   <p>
    gown, her hair carelessly heaped upon her head till there should be
   </p>
   <p>
    leisure to arrange it when skimming and milking were done, he broke his
   </p>
   <p>
    resolve, and brought his lips to her cheek for one moment. She passed
   </p>
   <p>
    downstairs very quickly, never looking back at him or saying another
   </p>
   <p>
    word. The other maids were already down, and the subject was not
   </p>
   <p>
    pursued. Except Marian, they all looked wistfully and suspiciously at
   </p>
   <p>
    the pair, in the sad yellow rays which the morning candles emitted in
   </p>
   <p>
    contrast with the first cold signals of the dawn without.
   </p>
   <p>
    When skimming was done—which, as the milk diminished with the approach
   </p>
   <p>
    of autumn, was a lessening process day by day—Retty and the rest went
   </p>
   <p>
    out. The lovers followed them.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Our tremulous lives are so different from theirs, are they not?” he
   </p>
   <p>
    musingly observed to her, as he regarded the three figures tripping
   </p>
   <p>
    before him through the frigid pallor of opening day.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Not so very different, I think,” she said.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why do you think that?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “There are very few women’s lives that are not—tremulous,” Tess
   </p>
   <p>
    replied, pausing over the new word as if it impressed her. “There’s
   </p>
   <p>
    more in those three than you think.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “What is in them?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Almost either of ’em,” she began, “would make—perhaps would make—a
   </p>
   <p>
    properer wife than I. And perhaps they love you as well as I—almost.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O, Tessy!”
   </p>
   <p>
    There were signs that it was an exquisite relief to her to hear the
   </p>
   <p>
    impatient exclamation, though she had resolved so intrepidly to let
   </p>
   <p>
    generosity make one bid against herself. That was now done, and she had
   </p>
   <p>
    not the power to attempt self-immolation a second time then. They were
   </p>
   <p>
    joined by a milker from one of the cottages, and no more was said on
   </p>
   <p>
    that which concerned them so deeply. But Tess knew that this day would
   </p>
   <p>
    decide it.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the afternoon several of the dairyman’s household and assistants
   </p>
   <p>
    went down to the meads as usual, a long way from the dairy, where many
   </p>
   <p>
    of the cows were milked without being driven home. The supply was
   </p>
   <p>
    getting less as the animals advanced in calf, and the supernumerary
   </p>
   <p>
    milkers of the lush green season had been dismissed.
   </p>
   <p>
    The work progressed leisurely. Each pailful was poured into tall cans
   </p>
   <p>
    that stood in a large spring-waggon which had been brought upon the
   </p>
   <p>
    scene; and when they were milked, the cows trailed away. Dairyman
   </p>
   <p>
    Crick, who was there with the rest, his wrapper gleaming miraculously
   </p>
   <p>
    white against a leaden evening sky, suddenly looked at his heavy watch.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why, ’tis later than I thought,” he said. “Begad! We shan’t be soon
   </p>
   <p>
    enough with this milk at the station, if we don’t mind. There’s no time
   </p>
   <p>
    to-day to take it home and mix it with the bulk afore sending off. It
   </p>
   <p>
    must go to station straight from here. Who’ll drive it across?”
   </p>
   <p>
    Mr Clare volunteered to do so, though it was none of his business,
   </p>
   <p>
    asking Tess to accompany him. The evening, though sunless, had been
   </p>
   <p>
    warm and muggy for the season, and Tess had come out with her
   </p>
   <p>
    milking-hood only, naked-armed and jacketless; certainly not dressed
   </p>
   <p>
    for a drive. She therefore replied by glancing over her scant
   </p>
   <p>
    habiliments; but Clare gently urged her. She assented by relinquishing
   </p>
   <p>
    her pail and stool to the dairyman to take home, and mounted the
   </p>
   <p>
    spring-waggon beside Clare.
   </p>
   <p>
    XXX
   </p>
   <p>
    In the diminishing daylight they went along the level roadway through
   </p>
   <p>
    the meads, which stretched away into gray miles, and were backed in the
   </p>
   <p>
    extreme edge of distance by the swarthy and abrupt slopes of Egdon
   </p>
   <p>
    Heath. On its summit stood clumps and stretches of fir-trees, whose
   </p>
   <p>
    notched tips appeared like battlemented towers crowning black-fronted
   </p>
   <p>
    castles of enchantment.
   </p>
   <p>
    They were so absorbed in the sense of being close to each other that
   </p>
   <p>
    they did not begin talking for a long while, the silence being broken
   </p>
   <p>
    only by the clucking of the milk in the tall cans behind them. The lane
   </p>
   <p>
    they followed was so solitary that the hazel nuts had remained on the
   </p>
   <p>
    boughs till they slipped from their shells, and the blackberries hung
   </p>
   <p>
    in heavy clusters. Every now and then Angel would fling the lash of his
   </p>
   <p>
    whip round one of these, pluck it off, and give it to his companion.
   </p>
   <p>
    The dull sky soon began to tell its meaning by sending down
   </p>
   <p>
    herald-drops of rain, and the stagnant air of the day changed into a
   </p>
   <p>
    fitful breeze which played about their faces. The quick-silvery glaze
   </p>
   <p>
    on the rivers and pools vanished; from broad mirrors of light they
   </p>
   <p>
    changed to lustreless sheets of lead, with a surface like a rasp. But
   </p>
   <p>
    that spectacle did not affect her preoccupation. Her countenance, a
   </p>
   <p>
    natural carnation slightly embrowned by the season, had deepened its
   </p>
   <p>
    tinge with the beating of the rain-drops; and her hair, which the
   </p>
   <p>
    pressure of the cows’ flanks had, as usual, caused to tumble down from
   </p>
   <p>
    its fastenings and stray beyond the curtain of her calico bonnet, was
   </p>
   <p>
    made clammy by the moisture till it hardly was better than seaweed.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I ought not to have come, I suppose,” she murmured, looking at the
   </p>
   <p>
    sky.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am sorry for the rain,” said he. “But how glad I am to have you
   </p>
   <p>
    here!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Remote Egdon disappeared by degree behind the liquid gauze. The evening
   </p>
   <p>
    grew darker, and the roads being crossed by gates, it was not safe to
   </p>
   <p>
    drive faster than at a walking pace. The air was rather chill.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am so afraid you will get cold, with nothing upon your arms and
   </p>
   <p>
    shoulders,” he said. “Creep close to me, and perhaps the drizzle won’t
   </p>
   <p>
    hurt you much. I should be sorrier still if I did not think that the
   </p>
   <p>
    rain might be helping me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She imperceptibly crept closer, and he wrapped round them both a large
   </p>
   <p>
    piece of sail-cloth, which was sometimes used to keep the sun off the
   </p>
   <p>
    milk-cans. Tess held it from slipping off him as well as herself,
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare’s hands being occupied.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Now we are all right again. Ah—no we are not! It runs down into my
   </p>
   <p>
    neck a little, and it must still more into yours. That’s better. Your
   </p>
   <p>
    arms are like wet marble, Tess. Wipe them in the cloth. Now, if you
   </p>
   <p>
    stay quiet, you will not get another drop. Well, dear—about that
   </p>
   <p>
    question of mine—that long-standing question?”
   </p>
   <p>
    The only reply that he could hear for a little while was the smack of
   </p>
   <p>
    the horse’s hoofs on the moistening road, and the cluck of the milk in
   </p>
   <p>
    the cans behind them.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Do you remember what you said?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I do,” she replied.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Before we get home, mind.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’ll try.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He said no more then. As they drove on, the fragment of an old manor
   </p>
   <p>
    house of Caroline date rose against the sky, and was in due course
   </p>
   <p>
    passed and left behind.
   </p>
   <p>
    “That,” he observed, to entertain her, “is an interesting old place—one
   </p>
   <p>
    of the several seats which belonged to an ancient Norman family
   </p>
   <p>
    formerly of great influence in this county, the d’Urbervilles. I never
   </p>
   <p>
    pass one of their residences without thinking of them. There is
   </p>
   <p>
    something very sad in the extinction of a family of renown, even if it
   </p>
   <p>
    was fierce, domineering, feudal renown.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes,” said Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    They crept along towards a point in the expanse of shade just at hand
   </p>
   <p>
    at which a feeble light was beginning to assert its presence, a spot
   </p>
   <p>
    where, by day, a fitful white streak of steam at intervals upon the
   </p>
   <p>
    dark green background denoted intermittent moments of contact between
   </p>
   <p>
    their secluded world and modern life. Modern life stretched out its
   </p>
   <p>
    steam feeler to this point three or four times a day, touched the
   </p>
   <p>
    native existences, and quickly withdrew its feeler again, as if what it
   </p>
   <p>
    touched had been uncongenial.
   </p>
   <p>
    They reached the feeble light, which came from the smoky lamp of a
   </p>
   <p>
    little railway station; a poor enough terrestrial star, yet in one
   </p>
   <p>
    sense of more importance to Talbothays Dairy and mankind than the
   </p>
   <p>
    celestial ones to which it stood in such humiliating contrast. The cans
   </p>
   <p>
    of new milk were unladen in the rain, Tess getting a little shelter
   </p>
   <p>
    from a neighbouring holly tree.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then there was the hissing of a train, which drew up almost silently
   </p>
   <p>
    upon the wet rails, and the milk was rapidly swung can by can into the
   </p>
   <p>
    truck. The light of the engine flashed for a second upon Tess
   </p>
   <p>
    Durbeyfield’s figure, motionless under the great holly tree. No object
   </p>
   <p>
    could have looked more foreign to the gleaming cranks and wheels than
   </p>
   <p>
    this unsophisticated girl, with the round bare arms, the rainy face and
   </p>
   <p>
    hair, the suspended attitude of a friendly leopard at pause, the print
   </p>
   <p>
    gown of no date or fashion, and the cotton bonnet drooping on her brow.
   </p>
   <p>
    She mounted again beside her lover, with a mute obedience
   </p>
   <p>
    characteristic of impassioned natures at times, and when they had
   </p>
   <p>
    wrapped themselves up over head and ears in the sailcloth again, they
   </p>
   <p>
    plunged back into the now thick night. Tess was so receptive that the
   </p>
   <p>
    few minutes of contact with the whirl of material progress lingered in
   </p>
   <p>
    her thought.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Londoners will drink it at their breakfasts to-morrow, won’t they?”
   </p>
   <p>
    she asked. “Strange people that we have never seen.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes—I suppose they will. Though not as we send it. When its strength
   </p>
   <p>
    has been lowered, so that it may not get up into their heads.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Noble men and noble women, ambassadors and centurions, ladies and
   </p>
   <p>
    tradeswomen, and babies who have never seen a cow.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, yes; perhaps; particularly centurions.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Who don’t know anything of us, and where it comes from; or think how
   </p>
   <p>
    we two drove miles across the moor to-night in the rain that it might
   </p>
   <p>
    reach ’em in time?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “We did not drive entirely on account of these precious Londoners; we
   </p>
   <p>
    drove a little on our own—on account of that anxious matter which you
   </p>
   <p>
    will, I am sure, set at rest, dear Tess. Now, permit me to put it in
   </p>
   <p>
    this way. You belong to me already, you know; your heart, I mean. Does
   </p>
   <p>
    it not?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You know as well as I. O yes—yes!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Then, if your heart does, why not your hand?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “My only reason was on account of you—on account of a question. I have
   </p>
   <p>
    something to tell you—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But suppose it to be entirely for my happiness, and my worldly
   </p>
   <p>
    convenience also?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O yes; if it is for your happiness and worldly convenience. But my
   </p>
   <p>
    life before I came here—I want—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, it is for my convenience as well as my happiness. If I have a
   </p>
   <p>
    very large farm, either English or colonial, you will be invaluable as
   </p>
   <p>
    a wife to me; better than a woman out of the largest mansion in the
   </p>
   <p>
    country. So please—please, dear Tessy, disabuse your mind of the
   </p>
   <p>
    feeling that you will stand in my way.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But my history. I want you to know it—you must let me tell you—you
   </p>
   <p>
    will not like me so well!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tell it if you wish to, dearest. This precious history then. Yes, I
   </p>
   <p>
    was born at so and so, Anno Domini—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I was born at Marlott,” she said, catching at his words as a help,
   </p>
   <p>
    lightly as they were spoken. “And I grew up there. And I was in the
   </p>
   <p>
    Sixth Standard when I left school, and they said I had great aptness,
   </p>
   <p>
    and should make a good teacher, so it was settled that I should be one.
   </p>
   <p>
    But there was trouble in my family; father was not very industrious,
   </p>
   <p>
    and he drank a little.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, yes. Poor child! Nothing new.” He pressed her more closely to his
   </p>
   <p>
    side.
   </p>
   <p>
    “And then—there is something very unusual about it—about me. I—I was—”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess’s breath quickened.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, dearest. Never mind.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I—I—am not a Durbeyfield, but a d’Urberville—a descendant of the same
   </p>
   <p>
    family as those that owned the old house we passed. And—we are all gone
   </p>
   <p>
    to nothing!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “A d’Urberville!—Indeed! And is that all the trouble, dear Tess?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes,” she answered faintly.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well—why should I love you less after knowing this?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I was told by the dairyman that you hated old families.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He laughed.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, it is true, in one sense. I do hate the aristocratic principle
   </p>
   <p>
    of blood before everything, and do think that as reasoners the only
   </p>
   <p>
    pedigrees we ought to respect are those spiritual ones of the wise and
   </p>
   <p>
    virtuous, without regard to corporal paternity. But I am extremely
   </p>
   <p>
    interested in this news—you can have no idea how interested I am! Are
   </p>
   <p>
    you not interested yourself in being one of that well-known line?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No. I have thought it sad—especially since coming here, and knowing
   </p>
   <p>
    that many of the hills and fields I see once belonged to my father’s
   </p>
   <p>
    people. But other hills and fields belonged to Retty’s people, and
   </p>
   <p>
    perhaps others to Marian’s, so that I don’t value it particularly.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes—it is surprising how many of the present tillers of the soil were
   </p>
   <p>
    once owners of it, and I sometimes wonder that a certain school of
   </p>
   <p>
    politicians don’t make capital of the circumstance; but they don’t seem
   </p>
   <p>
    to know it... I wonder that I did not see the resemblance of your name
   </p>
   <p>
    to d’Urberville, and trace the manifest corruption. And this was the
   </p>
   <p>
    carking secret!”
   </p>
   <p>
    She had not told. At the last moment her courage had failed her; she
   </p>
   <p>
    feared his blame for not telling him sooner; and her instinct of
   </p>
   <p>
    self-preservation was stronger than her candour.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Of course,” continued the unwitting Clare, “I should have been glad to
   </p>
   <p>
    know you to be descended exclusively from the long-suffering, dumb,
   </p>
   <p>
    unrecorded rank and file of the English nation, and not from the
   </p>
   <p>
    self-seeking few who made themselves powerful at the expense of the
   </p>
   <p>
    rest. But I am corrupted away from that by my affection for you, Tess
   </p>
   <p>
    (he laughed as he spoke), and made selfish likewise. For your own sake
   </p>
   <p>
    I rejoice in your descent. Society is hopelessly snobbish, and this
   </p>
   <p>
    fact of your extraction may make an appreciable difference to its
   </p>
   <p>
    acceptance of you as my wife, after I have made you the well-read woman
   </p>
   <p>
    that I mean to make you. My mother too, poor soul, will think so much
   </p>
   <p>
    better of you on account of it. Tess, you must spell your name
   </p>
   <p>
    correctly—d’Urberville—from this very day.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I like the other way rather best.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But you _must_, dearest! Good heavens, why dozens of mushroom
   </p>
   <p>
    millionaires would jump at such a possession! By the bye, there’s one
   </p>
   <p>
    of that kidney who has taken the name—where have I heard of him?—Up in
   </p>
   <p>
    the neighbourhood of The Chase, I think. Why, he is the very man who
   </p>
   <p>
    had that rumpus with my father I told you of. What an odd coincidence!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Angel, I think I would rather not take the name! It is unlucky,
   </p>
   <p>
    perhaps!”
   </p>
   <p>
    She was agitated.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Now then, Mistress Teresa d’Urberville, I have you. Take my name, and
   </p>
   <p>
    so you will escape yours! The secret is out, so why should you any
   </p>
   <p>
    longer refuse me?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “If it is _sure_ to make you happy to have me as your wife, and you
   </p>
   <p>
    feel that you do wish to marry me, _very, very_ much—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I do, dearest, of course!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I mean, that it is only your wanting me very much, and being hardly
   </p>
   <p>
    able to keep alive without me, whatever my offences, that would make me
   </p>
   <p>
    feel I ought to say I will.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You will—you do say it, I know! You will be mine for ever and ever.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He clasped her close and kissed her.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes!”
   </p>
   <p>
    She had no sooner said it than she burst into a dry hard sobbing, so
   </p>
   <p>
    violent that it seemed to rend her. Tess was not a hysterical girl by
   </p>
   <p>
    any means, and he was surprised.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why do you cry, dearest?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I can’t tell—quite!—I am so glad to think—of being yours, and making
   </p>
   <p>
    you happy!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But this does not seem very much like gladness, my Tessy!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I mean—I cry because I have broken down in my vow! I said I would die
   </p>
   <p>
    unmarried!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But, if you love me you would like me to be your husband?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, yes, yes! But O, I sometimes wish I had never been born!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Now, my dear Tess, if I did not know that you are very much excited,
   </p>
   <p>
    and very inexperienced, I should say that remark was not very
   </p>
   <p>
    complimentary. How came you to wish that if you care for me? Do you
   </p>
   <p>
    care for me? I wish you would prove it in some way.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “How can I prove it more than I have done?” she cried, in a distraction
   </p>
   <p>
    of tenderness. “Will this prove it more?”
   </p>
   <p>
    She clasped his neck, and for the first time Clare learnt what an
   </p>
   <p>
    impassioned woman’s kisses were like upon the lips of one whom she
   </p>
   <p>
    loved with all her heart and soul, as Tess loved him.
   </p>
   <p>
    “There—now do you believe?” she asked, flushed, and wiping her eyes.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes. I never really doubted—never, never!”
   </p>
   <p>
    So they drove on through the gloom, forming one bundle inside the
   </p>
   <p>
    sail-cloth, the horse going as he would, and the rain driving against
   </p>
   <p>
    them. She had consented. She might as well have agreed at first. The
   </p>
   <p>
    “appetite for joy” which pervades all creation, that tremendous force
   </p>
   <p>
    which sways humanity to its purpose, as the tide sways the helpless
   </p>
   <p>
    weed, was not to be controlled by vague lucubrations over the social
   </p>
   <p>
    rubric.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I must write to my mother,” she said. “You don’t mind my doing that?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Of course not, dear child. You are a child to me, Tess, not to know
   </p>
   <p>
    how very proper it is to write to your mother at such a time, and how
   </p>
   <p>
    wrong it would be in me to object. Where does she live?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “At the same place—Marlott. On the further side of Blackmoor Vale.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah, then I _have_ seen you before this summer—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes; at that dance on the green; but you would not dance with me. O, I
   </p>
   <p>
    hope that is of no ill-omen for us now!”
   </p>
   <p>
    XXXI
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess wrote a most touching and urgent letter to her mother the very
   </p>
   <p>
    next day, and by the end of the week a response to her communication
   </p>
   <p>
    arrived in Joan Durbeyfield’s wandering last-century hand.
   </p>
   <p>
    Dear Tess,
   </p>
   <p>
    J write these few lines Hoping they will find you well, as they
   </p>
   <p>
    leave me at Present, thank God for it. Dear Tess, we are all glad
   </p>
   <p>
    to Hear that you are going really to be married soon. But with
   </p>
   <p>
    respect to your question, Tess, J say between ourselves, quite
   </p>
   <p>
    private but very strong, that on no account do you say a word of
   </p>
   <p>
    your Bygone Trouble to him. J did not tell everything to your
   </p>
   <p>
    Father, he being so Proud on account of his Respectability, which,
   </p>
   <p>
    perhaps, your Intended is the same. Many a woman—some of the
   </p>
   <p>
    Highest in the Land—have had a Trouble in their time; and why
   </p>
   <p>
    should you Trumpet yours when others don’t Trumpet theirs? No girl
   </p>
   <p>
    would be such a Fool, specially as it is so long ago, and not your
   </p>
   <p>
    Fault at all. J shall answer the same if you ask me fifty times.
   </p>
   <p>
    Besides, you must bear in mind that, knowing it to be your Childish
   </p>
   <p>
    Nature to tell all that’s in your heart—so simple!—J made you
   </p>
   <p>
    promise me never to let it out by Word or Deed, having your Welfare
   </p>
   <p>
    in my Mind; and you most solemnly did promise it going from this
   </p>
   <p>
    Door. J have not named either that Question or your coming marriage
   </p>
   <p>
    to your Father, as he would blab it everywhere, poor Simple Man.
   </p>
   <p>
    Dear Tess, keep up your Spirits, and we mean to send you a Hogshead
   </p>
   <p>
    of Cyder for you Wedding, knowing there is not much in your parts,
   </p>
   <p>
    and thin Sour Stuff what there is. So no more at present, and with
   </p>
   <p>
    kind love to your Young Man.—From your affectte. Mother,
   </p>
   <p>
    J. Durbeyfield
   </p>
   <p>
    “O mother, mother!” murmured Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    She was recognizing how light was the touch of events the most
   </p>
   <p>
    oppressive upon Mrs Durbeyfield’s elastic spirit. Her mother did not
   </p>
   <p>
    see life as Tess saw it. That haunting episode of bygone days was to
   </p>
   <p>
    her mother but a passing accident. But perhaps her mother was right as
   </p>
   <p>
    to the course to be followed, whatever she might be in her reasons.
   </p>
   <p>
    Silence seemed, on the face of it, best for her adored one’s happiness:
   </p>
   <p>
    silence it should be.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus steadied by a command from the only person in the world who had
   </p>
   <p>
    any shadow of right to control her action, Tess grew calmer. The
   </p>
   <p>
    responsibility was shifted, and her heart was lighter than it had been
   </p>
   <p>
    for weeks. The days of declining autumn which followed her assent,
   </p>
   <p>
    beginning with the month of October, formed a season through which she
   </p>
   <p>
    lived in spiritual altitudes more nearly approaching ecstasy than any
   </p>
   <p>
    other period of her life.
   </p>
   <p>
    There was hardly a touch of earth in her love for Clare. To her sublime
   </p>
   <p>
    trustfulness he was all that goodness could be—knew all that a guide,
   </p>
   <p>
    philosopher, and friend should know. She thought every line in the
   </p>
   <p>
    contour of his person the perfection of masculine beauty, his soul the
   </p>
   <p>
    soul of a saint, his intellect that of a seer. The wisdom of her love
   </p>
   <p>
    for him, as love, sustained her dignity; she seemed to be wearing a
   </p>
   <p>
    crown. The compassion of his love for her, as she saw it, made her lift
   </p>
   <p>
    up her heart to him in devotion. He would sometimes catch her large,
   </p>
   <p>
    worshipful eyes, that had no bottom to them looking at him from their
   </p>
   <p>
    depths, as if she saw something immortal before her.
   </p>
   <p>
    She dismissed the past—trod upon it and put it out, as one treads on a
   </p>
   <p>
    coal that is smouldering and dangerous.
   </p>
   <p>
    She had not known that men could be so disinterested, chivalrous,
   </p>
   <p>
    protective, in their love for women as he. Angel Clare was far from all
   </p>
   <p>
    that she thought him in this respect; absurdly far, indeed; but he was,
   </p>
   <p>
    in truth, more spiritual than animal; he had himself well in hand, and
   </p>
   <p>
    was singularly free from grossness. Though not cold-natured, he was
   </p>
   <p>
    rather bright than hot—less Byronic than Shelleyan; could love
   </p>
   <p>
    desperately, but with a love more especially inclined to the
   </p>
   <p>
    imaginative and ethereal; it was a fastidious emotion which could
   </p>
   <p>
    jealously guard the loved one against his very self. This amazed and
   </p>
   <p>
    enraptured Tess, whose slight experiences had been so infelicitous till
   </p>
   <p>
    now; and in her reaction from indignation against the male sex she
   </p>
   <p>
    swerved to excess of honour for Clare.
   </p>
   <p>
    They unaffectedly sought each other’s company; in her honest faith she
   </p>
   <p>
    did not disguise her desire to be with him. The sum of her instincts on
   </p>
   <p>
    this matter, if clearly stated, would have been that the elusive
   </p>
   <p>
    quality of her sex which attracts men in general might be distasteful
   </p>
   <p>
    to so perfect a man after an avowal of love, since it must in its very
   </p>
   <p>
    nature carry with it a suspicion of art.
   </p>
   <p>
    The country custom of unreserved comradeship out of doors during
   </p>
   <p>
    betrothal was the only custom she knew, and to her it had no
   </p>
   <p>
    strangeness; though it seemed oddly anticipative to Clare till he saw
   </p>
   <p>
    how normal a thing she, in common with all the other dairy-folk,
   </p>
   <p>
    regarded it. Thus, during this October month of wonderful afternoons
   </p>
   <p>
    they roved along the meads by creeping paths which followed the brinks
   </p>
   <p>
    of trickling tributary brooks, hopping across by little wooden bridges
   </p>
   <p>
    to the other side, and back again. They were never out of the sound of
   </p>
   <p>
    some purling weir, whose buzz accompanied their own murmuring, while
   </p>
   <p>
    the beams of the sun, almost as horizontal as the mead itself, formed a
   </p>
   <p>
    pollen of radiance over the landscape. They saw tiny blue fogs in the
   </p>
   <p>
    shadows of trees and hedges, all the time that there was bright
   </p>
   <p>
    sunshine elsewhere. The sun was so near the ground, and the sward so
   </p>
   <p>
    flat, that the shadows of Clare and Tess would stretch a quarter of a
   </p>
   <p>
    mile ahead of them, like two long fingers pointing afar to where the
   </p>
   <p>
    green alluvial reaches abutted against the sloping sides of the vale.
   </p>
   <p>
    Men were at work here and there—for it was the season for “taking up”
   </p>
   <p>
    the meadows, or digging the little waterways clear for the winter
   </p>
   <p>
    irrigation, and mending their banks where trodden down by the cows. The
   </p>
   <p>
    shovelfuls of loam, black as jet, brought there by the river when it
   </p>
   <p>
    was as wide as the whole valley, were an essence of soils, pounded
   </p>
   <p>
    champaigns of the past, steeped, refined, and subtilized to
   </p>
   <p>
    extraordinary richness, out of which came all the fertility of the
   </p>
   <p>
    mead, and of the cattle grazing there.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare hardily kept his arm round her waist in sight of these watermen,
   </p>
   <p>
    with the air of a man who was accustomed to public dalliance, though
   </p>
   <p>
    actually as shy as she who, with lips parted and eyes askance on the
   </p>
   <p>
    labourers, wore the look of a wary animal the while.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You are not ashamed of owning me as yours before them!” she said
   </p>
   <p>
    gladly.
   </p>
   <p>
    “O no!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But if it should reach the ears of your friends at Emminster that you
   </p>
   <p>
    are walking about like this with me, a milkmaid—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “The most bewitching milkmaid ever seen.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “They might feel it a hurt to their dignity.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “My dear girl—a d’Urberville hurt the dignity of a Clare! It is a grand
   </p>
   <p>
    card to play—that of your belonging to such a family, and I am
   </p>
   <p>
    reserving it for a grand effect when we are married, and have the
   </p>
   <p>
    proofs of your descent from Parson Tringham. Apart from that, my future
   </p>
   <p>
    is to be totally foreign to my family—it will not affect even the
   </p>
   <p>
    surface of their lives. We shall leave this part of England—perhaps
   </p>
   <p>
    England itself—and what does it matter how people regard us here? You
   </p>
   <p>
    will like going, will you not?”
   </p>
   <p>
    She could answer no more than a bare affirmative, so great was the
   </p>
   <p>
    emotion aroused in her at the thought of going through the world with
   </p>
   <p>
    him as his own familiar friend. Her feelings almost filled her ears
   </p>
   <p>
    like a babble of waves, and surged up to her eyes. She put her hand in
   </p>
   <p>
    his, and thus they went on, to a place where the reflected sun glared
   </p>
   <p>
    up from the river, under a bridge, with a molten-metallic glow that
   </p>
   <p>
    dazzled their eyes, though the sun itself was hidden by the bridge.
   </p>
   <p>
    They stood still, whereupon little furred and feathered heads popped up
   </p>
   <p>
    from the smooth surface of the water; but, finding that the disturbing
   </p>
   <p>
    presences had paused, and not passed by, they disappeared again. Upon
   </p>
   <p>
    this river-brink they lingered till the fog began to close round
   </p>
   <p>
    them—which was very early in the evening at this time of the
   </p>
   <p>
    year—settling on the lashes of her eyes, where it rested like crystals,
   </p>
   <p>
    and on his brows and hair.
   </p>
   <p>
    They walked later on Sundays, when it was quite dark. Some of the
   </p>
   <p>
    dairy-people, who were also out of doors on the first Sunday evening
   </p>
   <p>
    after their engagement, heard her impulsive speeches, ecstasized to
   </p>
   <p>
    fragments, though they were too far off to hear the words discoursed;
   </p>
   <p>
    noted the spasmodic catch in her remarks, broken into syllables by the
   </p>
   <p>
    leapings of her heart, as she walked leaning on his arm; her contented
   </p>
   <p>
    pauses, the occasional little laugh upon which her soul seemed to
   </p>
   <p>
    ride—the laugh of a woman in company with the man she loves and has won
   </p>
   <p>
    from all other women—unlike anything else in nature. They marked the
   </p>
   <p>
    buoyancy of her tread, like the skim of a bird which has not quite
   </p>
   <p>
    alighted.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her affection for him was now the breath and life of Tess’s being; it
   </p>
   <p>
    enveloped her as a photosphere, irradiated her into forgetfulness of
   </p>
   <p>
    her past sorrows, keeping back the gloomy spectres that would persist
   </p>
   <p>
    in their attempts to touch her—doubt, fear, moodiness, care, shame. She
   </p>
   <p>
    knew that they were waiting like wolves just outside the circumscribing
   </p>
   <p>
    light, but she had long spells of power to keep them in hungry
   </p>
   <p>
    subjection there.
   </p>
   <p>
    A spiritual forgetfulness co-existed with an intellectual remembrance.
   </p>
   <p>
    She walked in brightness, but she knew that in the background those
   </p>
   <p>
    shapes of darkness were always spread. They might be receding, or they
   </p>
   <p>
    might be approaching, one or the other, a little every day.
   </p>
   <p>
    One evening Tess and Clare were obliged to sit indoors keeping house,
   </p>
   <p>
    all the other occupants of the domicile being away. As they talked she
   </p>
   <p>
    looked thoughtfully up at him, and met his two appreciative eyes.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am not worthy of you—no, I am not!” she burst out, jumping up from
   </p>
   <p>
    her low stool as though appalled at his homage, and the fulness of her
   </p>
   <p>
    own joy thereat.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare, deeming the whole basis of her excitement to be that which was
   </p>
   <p>
    only the smaller part of it, said—
   </p>
   <p>
    “I won’t have you speak like it, dear Tess! Distinction does not
   </p>
   <p>
    consist in the facile use of a contemptible set of conventions, but in
   </p>
   <p>
    being numbered among those who are true, and honest, and just, and
   </p>
   <p>
    pure, and lovely, and of good report—as you are, my Tess.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She struggled with the sob in her throat. How often had that string of
   </p>
   <p>
    excellences made her young heart ache in church of late years, and how
   </p>
   <p>
    strange that he should have cited them now.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why didn’t you stay and love me when I—was sixteen; living with my
   </p>
   <p>
    little sisters and brothers, and you danced on the green? O, why didn’t
   </p>
   <p>
    you, why didn’t you!” she said, impetuously clasping her hands.
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel began to comfort and reassure her, thinking to himself, truly
   </p>
   <p>
    enough, what a creature of moods she was, and how careful he would have
   </p>
   <p>
    to be of her when she depended for her happiness entirely on him.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah—why didn’t I stay!” he said. “That is just what I feel. If I had
   </p>
   <p>
    only known! But you must not be so bitter in your regret—why should you
   </p>
   <p>
    be?”
   </p>
   <p>
    With the woman’s instinct to hide she diverged hastily—
   </p>
   <p>
    “I should have had four years more of your heart than I can ever have
   </p>
   <p>
    now. Then I should not have wasted my time as I have done—I should have
   </p>
   <p>
    had so much longer happiness!”
   </p>
   <p>
    It was no mature woman with a long dark vista of intrigue behind her
   </p>
   <p>
    who was tormented thus, but a girl of simple life, not yet one-and
   </p>
   <p>
    twenty, who had been caught during her days of immaturity like a bird
   </p>
   <p>
    in a springe. To calm herself the more completely, she rose from her
   </p>
   <p>
    little stool and left the room, overturning the stool with her skirts
   </p>
   <p>
    as she went.
   </p>
   <p>
    He sat on by the cheerful firelight thrown from a bundle of green
   </p>
   <p>
    ash-sticks laid across the dogs; the sticks snapped pleasantly, and
   </p>
   <p>
    hissed out bubbles of sap from their ends. When she came back she was
   </p>
   <p>
    herself again.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Do you not think you are just a wee bit capricious, fitful, Tess?” he
   </p>
   <p>
    said, good-humouredly, as he spread a cushion for her on the stool, and
   </p>
   <p>
    seated himself in the settle beside her. “I wanted to ask you
   </p>
   <p>
    something, and just then you ran away.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, perhaps I am capricious,” she murmured. She suddenly approached
   </p>
   <p>
    him, and put a hand upon each of his arms. “No, Angel, I am not really
   </p>
   <p>
    so—by nature, I mean!” The more particularly to assure him that she was
   </p>
   <p>
    not, she placed herself close to him in the settle, and allowed her
   </p>
   <p>
    head to find a resting-place against Clare’s shoulder. “What did you
   </p>
   <p>
    want to ask me—I am sure I will answer it,” she continued humbly.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, you love me, and have agreed to marry me, and hence there
   </p>
   <p>
    follows a thirdly, ‘When shall the day be?’”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I like living like this.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But I must think of starting in business on my own hook with the new
   </p>
   <p>
    year, or a little later. And before I get involved in the multifarious
   </p>
   <p>
    details of my new position, I should like to have secured my partner.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But,” she timidly answered, “to talk quite practically, wouldn’t it be
   </p>
   <p>
    best not to marry till after all that?—Though I can’t bear the thought
   </p>
   <p>
    o’ your going away and leaving me here!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Of course you cannot—and it is not best in this case. I want you to
   </p>
   <p>
    help me in many ways in making my start. When shall it be? Why not a
   </p>
   <p>
    fortnight from now?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No,” she said, becoming grave: “I have so many things to think of
   </p>
   <p>
    first.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But—”
   </p>
   <p>
    He drew her gently nearer to him.
   </p>
   <p>
    The reality of marriage was startling when it loomed so near. Before
   </p>
   <p>
    discussion of the question had proceeded further there walked round the
   </p>
   <p>
    corner of the settle into the full firelight of the apartment Mr
   </p>
   <p>
    Dairyman Crick, Mrs Crick, and two of the milkmaids.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess sprang like an elastic ball from his side to her feet, while her
   </p>
   <p>
    face flushed and her eyes shone in the firelight.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I knew how it would be if I sat so close to him!” she cried, with
   </p>
   <p>
    vexation. “I said to myself, they are sure to come and catch us! But I
   </p>
   <p>
    wasn’t really sitting on his knee, though it might ha’ seemed as if I
   </p>
   <p>
    was almost!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well—if so be you hadn’t told us, I am sure we shouldn’t ha’ noticed
   </p>
   <p>
    that ye had been sitting anywhere at all in this light,” replied the
   </p>
   <p>
    dairyman. He continued to his wife, with the stolid mien of a man who
   </p>
   <p>
    understood nothing of the emotions relating to matrimony—“Now,
   </p>
   <p>
    Christianer, that shows that folks should never fancy other folks be
   </p>
   <p>
    supposing things when they bain’t. O no, I should never ha’ thought a
   </p>
   <p>
    word of where she was a sitting to, if she hadn’t told me—not I.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “We are going to be married soon,” said Clare, with improvised phlegm.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah—and be ye! Well, I am truly glad to hear it, sir. I’ve thought you
   </p>
   <p>
    mid do such a thing for some time. She’s too good for a dairymaid—I
   </p>
   <p>
    said so the very first day I zid her—and a prize for any man; and
   </p>
   <p>
    what’s more, a wonderful woman for a gentleman-farmer’s wife; he won’t
   </p>
   <p>
    be at the mercy of his baily wi’ her at his side.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Somehow Tess disappeared. She had been even more struck with the look
   </p>
   <p>
    of the girls who followed Crick than abashed by Crick’s blunt praise.
   </p>
   <p>
    After supper, when she reached her bedroom, they were all present. A
   </p>
   <p>
    light was burning, and each damsel was sitting up whitely in her bed,
   </p>
   <p>
    awaiting Tess, the whole like a row of avenging ghosts.
   </p>
   <p>
    But she saw in a few moments that there was no malice in their mood.
   </p>
   <p>
    They could scarcely feel as a loss what they had never expected to
   </p>
   <p>
    have. Their condition was objective, contemplative.
   </p>
   <p>
    “He’s going to marry her!” murmured Retty, never taking eyes off Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    “How her face do show it!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You _be_ going to marry him?” asked Marian.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes,” said Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    “When?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Some day.”
   </p>
   <p>
    They thought that this was evasiveness only.
   </p>
   <p>
    “_Yes_—going to _marry_ him—a gentleman!” repeated Izz Huett.
   </p>
   <p>
    And by a sort of fascination the three girls, one after another, crept
   </p>
   <p>
    out of their beds, and came and stood barefooted round Tess. Retty put
   </p>
   <p>
    her hands upon Tess’s shoulders, as if to realize her friend’s
   </p>
   <p>
    corporeality after such a miracle, and the other two laid their arms
   </p>
   <p>
    round her waist, all looking into her face.
   </p>
   <p>
    “How it do seem! Almost more than I can think of!” said Izz Huett.
   </p>
   <p>
    Marian kissed Tess. “Yes,” she murmured as she withdrew her lips.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Was that because of love for her, or because other lips have touched
   </p>
   <p>
    there by now?” continued Izz drily to Marian.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I wasn’t thinking o’ that,” said Marian simply. “I was on’y feeling
   </p>
   <p>
    all the strangeness o’t—that she is to be his wife, and nobody else. I
   </p>
   <p>
    don’t say nay to it, nor either of us, because we did not think of
   </p>
   <p>
    it—only loved him. Still, nobody else is to marry’n in the world—no
   </p>
   <p>
    fine lady, nobody in silks and satins; but she who do live like we.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Are you sure you don’t dislike me for it?” said Tess in a low voice.
   </p>
   <p>
    They hung about her in their white nightgowns before replying, as if
   </p>
   <p>
    they considered their answer might lie in her look.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t know—I don’t know,” murmured Retty Priddle. “I want to hate
   </p>
   <p>
    ’ee; but I cannot!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “That’s how I feel,” echoed Izz and Marian. “I can’t hate her. Somehow
   </p>
   <p>
    she hinders me!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “He ought to marry one of you,” murmured Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You are all better than I.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “We better than you?” said the girls in a low, slow whisper. “No, no,
   </p>
   <p>
    dear Tess!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You are!” she contradicted impetuously. And suddenly tearing away from
   </p>
   <p>
    their clinging arms she burst into a hysterical fit of tears, bowing
   </p>
   <p>
    herself on the chest of drawers and repeating incessantly, “O yes, yes,
   </p>
   <p>
    yes!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Having once given way she could not stop her weeping.
   </p>
   <p>
    “He ought to have had one of you!” she cried. “I think I ought to make
   </p>
   <p>
    him even now! You would be better for him than—I don’t know what I’m
   </p>
   <p>
    saying! O! O!”
   </p>
   <p>
    They went up to her and clasped her round, but still her sobs tore her.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Get some water,” said Marian, “She’s upset by us, poor thing, poor
   </p>
   <p>
    thing!”
   </p>
   <p>
    They gently led her back to the side of her bed, where they kissed her
   </p>
   <p>
    warmly.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You are best for’n,” said Marian. “More ladylike, and a better scholar
   </p>
   <p>
    than we, especially since he had taught ’ee so much. But even you ought
   </p>
   <p>
    to be proud. You _be_ proud, I’m sure!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, I am,” she said; “and I am ashamed at so breaking down.”
   </p>
   <p>
    When they were all in bed, and the light was out, Marian whispered
   </p>
   <p>
    across to her—
   </p>
   <p>
    “You will think of us when you be his wife, Tess, and of how we told
   </p>
   <p>
    ’ee that we loved him, and how we tried not to hate you, and did not
   </p>
   <p>
    hate you, and could not hate you, because you were his choice, and we
   </p>
   <p>
    never hoped to be chose by him.”
   </p>
   <p>
    They were not aware that, at these words, salt, stinging tears trickled
   </p>
   <p>
    down upon Tess’s pillow anew, and how she resolved, with a bursting
   </p>
   <p>
    heart, to tell all her history to Angel Clare, despite her mother’s
   </p>
   <p>
    command—to let him for whom she lived and breathed despise her if he
   </p>
   <p>
    would, and her mother regard her as a fool, rather then preserve a
   </p>
   <p>
    silence which might be deemed a treachery to him, and which somehow
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed a wrong to these.
   </p>
   <p>
    XXXII
   </p>
   <p>
    This penitential mood kept her from naming the wedding-day. The
   </p>
   <p>
    beginning of November found its date still in abeyance, though he asked
   </p>
   <p>
    her at the most tempting times. But Tess’s desire seemed to be for a
   </p>
   <p>
    perpetual betrothal in which everything should remain as it was then.
   </p>
   <p>
    The meads were changing now; but it was still warm enough in early
   </p>
   <p>
    afternoons before milking to idle there awhile, and the state of
   </p>
   <p>
    dairy-work at this time of year allowed a spare hour for idling.
   </p>
   <p>
    Looking over the damp sod in the direction of the sun, a glistening
   </p>
   <p>
    ripple of gossamer webs was visible to their eyes under the luminary,
   </p>
   <p>
    like the track of moonlight on the sea. Gnats, knowing nothing of their
   </p>
   <p>
    brief glorification, wandered across the shimmer of this pathway,
   </p>
   <p>
    irradiated as if they bore fire within them, then passed out of its
   </p>
   <p>
    line, and were quite extinct. In the presence of these things he would
   </p>
   <p>
    remind her that the date was still the question.
   </p>
   <p>
    Or he would ask her at night, when he accompanied her on some mission
   </p>
   <p>
    invented by Mrs Crick to give him the opportunity. This was mostly a
   </p>
   <p>
    journey to the farmhouse on the slopes above the vale, to inquire how
   </p>
   <p>
    the advanced cows were getting on in the straw-barton to which they
   </p>
   <p>
    were relegated. For it was a time of the year that brought great
   </p>
   <p>
    changes to the world of kine. Batches of the animals were sent away
   </p>
   <p>
    daily to this lying-in hospital, where they lived on straw till their
   </p>
   <p>
    calves were born, after which event, and as soon as the calf could
   </p>
   <p>
    walk, mother and offspring were driven back to the dairy. In the
   </p>
   <p>
    interval which elapsed before the calves were sold there was, of
   </p>
   <p>
    course, little milking to be done, but as soon as the calf had been
   </p>
   <p>
    taken away the milkmaids would have to set to work as usual.
   </p>
   <p>
    Returning from one of these dark walks they reached a great
   </p>
   <p>
    gravel-cliff immediately over the levels, where they stood still and
   </p>
   <p>
    listened. The water was now high in the streams, squirting through the
   </p>
   <p>
    weirs, and tinkling under culverts; the smallest gullies were all full;
   </p>
   <p>
    there was no taking short cuts anywhere, and foot-passengers were
   </p>
   <p>
    compelled to follow the permanent ways. From the whole extent of the
   </p>
   <p>
    invisible vale came a multitudinous intonation; it forced upon their
   </p>
   <p>
    fancy that a great city lay below them, and that the murmur was the
   </p>
   <p>
    vociferation of its populace.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It seems like tens of thousands of them,” said Tess; “holding
   </p>
   <p>
    public-meetings in their market-places, arguing, preaching,
   </p>
   <p>
    quarrelling, sobbing, groaning, praying, and cursing.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare was not particularly heeding.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Did Crick speak to you to-day, dear, about his not wanting much
   </p>
   <p>
    assistance during the winter months?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “The cows are going dry rapidly.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes. Six or seven went to the straw-barton yesterday, and three the
   </p>
   <p>
    day before, making nearly twenty in the straw already. Ah—is it that
   </p>
   <p>
    the farmer don’t want my help for the calving? O, I am not wanted here
   </p>
   <p>
    any more! And I have tried so hard to—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Crick didn’t exactly say that he would no longer require you. But,
   </p>
   <p>
    knowing what our relations were, he said in the most good-natured and
   </p>
   <p>
    respectful manner possible that he supposed on my leaving at Christmas
   </p>
   <p>
    I should take you with me, and on my asking what he would do without
   </p>
   <p>
    you he merely observed that, as a matter of fact, it was a time of year
   </p>
   <p>
    when he could do with a very little female help. I am afraid I was
   </p>
   <p>
    sinner enough to feel rather glad that he was in this way forcing your
   </p>
   <p>
    hand.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t think you ought to have felt glad, Angel. Because ’tis always
   </p>
   <p>
    mournful not to be wanted, even if at the same time ’tis convenient.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, it is convenient—you have admitted that.” He put his finger upon
   </p>
   <p>
    her cheek. “Ah!” he said.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I feel the red rising up at her having been caught! But why should I
   </p>
   <p>
    trifle so! We will not trifle—life is too serious.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It is. Perhaps I saw that before you did.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She was seeing it then. To decline to marry him after all—in obedience
   </p>
   <p>
    to her emotion of last night—and leave the dairy, meant to go to some
   </p>
   <p>
    strange place, not a dairy; for milkmaids were not in request now
   </p>
   <p>
    calving-time was coming on; to go to some arable farm where no divine
   </p>
   <p>
    being like Angel Clare was. She hated the thought, and she hated more
   </p>
   <p>
    the thought of going home.
   </p>
   <p>
    “So that, seriously, dearest Tess,” he continued, “since you will
   </p>
   <p>
    probably have to leave at Christmas, it is in every way desirable and
   </p>
   <p>
    convenient that I should carry you off then as my property. Besides, if
   </p>
   <p>
    you were not the most uncalculating girl in the world you would know
   </p>
   <p>
    that we could not go on like this for ever.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I wish we could. That it would always be summer and autumn, and you
   </p>
   <p>
    always courting me, and always thinking as much of me as you have done
   </p>
   <p>
    through the past summer-time!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I always shall.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O, I know you will!” she cried, with a sudden fervour of faith in him.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Angel, I will fix the day when I will become yours for always!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus at last it was arranged between them, during that dark walk home,
   </p>
   <p>
    amid the myriads of liquid voices on the right and left.
   </p>
   <p>
    When they reached the dairy Mr and Mrs Crick were promptly told—with
   </p>
   <p>
    injunctions of secrecy; for each of the lovers was desirous that the
   </p>
   <p>
    marriage should be kept as private as possible. The dairyman, though he
   </p>
   <p>
    had thought of dismissing her soon, now made a great concern about
   </p>
   <p>
    losing her. What should he do about his skimming? Who would make the
   </p>
   <p>
    ornamental butter-pats for the Anglebury and Sandbourne ladies? Mrs
   </p>
   <p>
    Crick congratulated Tess on the shilly-shallying having at last come to
   </p>
   <p>
    an end, and said that directly she set eyes on Tess she divined that
   </p>
   <p>
    she was to be the chosen one of somebody who was no common outdoor man;
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess had looked so superior as she walked across the barton on that
   </p>
   <p>
    afternoon of her arrival; that she was of a good family she could have
   </p>
   <p>
    sworn. In point of fact Mrs Crick did remember thinking that Tess was
   </p>
   <p>
    graceful and good-looking as she approached; but the superiority might
   </p>
   <p>
    have been a growth of the imagination aided by subsequent knowledge.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess was now carried along upon the wings of the hours, without the
   </p>
   <p>
    sense of a will. The word had been given; the number of the day written
   </p>
   <p>
    down. Her naturally bright intelligence had begun to admit the
   </p>
   <p>
    fatalistic convictions common to field-folk and those who associate
   </p>
   <p>
    more extensively with natural phenomena than with their
   </p>
   <p>
    fellow-creatures; and she accordingly drifted into that passive
   </p>
   <p>
    responsiveness to all things her lover suggested, characteristic of the
   </p>
   <p>
    frame of mind.
   </p>
   <p>
    But she wrote anew to her mother, ostensibly to notify the wedding-day;
   </p>
   <p>
    really to again implore her advice. It was a gentleman who had chosen
   </p>
   <p>
    her, which perhaps her mother had not sufficiently considered. A
   </p>
   <p>
    post-nuptial explanation, which might be accepted with a light heart by
   </p>
   <p>
    a rougher man, might not be received with the same feeling by him. But
   </p>
   <p>
    this communication brought no reply from Mrs Durbeyfield.
   </p>
   <p>
    Despite Angel Clare’s plausible representation to himself and to Tess
   </p>
   <p>
    of the practical need for their immediate marriage, there was in truth
   </p>
   <p>
    an element of precipitancy in the step, as became apparent at a later
   </p>
   <p>
    date. He loved her dearly, though perhaps rather ideally and fancifully
   </p>
   <p>
    than with the impassioned thoroughness of her feeling for him. He had
   </p>
   <p>
    entertained no notion, when doomed as he had thought to an
   </p>
   <p>
    unintellectual bucolic life, that such charms as he beheld in this
   </p>
   <p>
    idyllic creature would be found behind the scenes. Unsophistication was
   </p>
   <p>
    a thing to talk of; but he had not known how it really struck one until
   </p>
   <p>
    he came here. Yet he was very far from seeing his future track clearly,
   </p>
   <p>
    and it might be a year or two before he would be able to consider
   </p>
   <p>
    himself fairly started in life. The secret lay in the tinge of
   </p>
   <p>
    recklessness imparted to his career and character by the sense that he
   </p>
   <p>
    had been made to miss his true destiny through the prejudices of his
   </p>
   <p>
    family.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Don’t you think ’twould have been better for us to wait till you were
   </p>
   <p>
    quite settled in your midland farm?” she once asked timidly. (A midland
   </p>
   <p>
    farm was the idea just then.)
   </p>
   <p>
    “To tell the truth, my Tess, I don’t like you to be left anywhere away
   </p>
   <p>
    from my protection and sympathy.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The reason was a good one, so far as it went. His influence over her
   </p>
   <p>
    had been so marked that she had caught his manner and habits, his
   </p>
   <p>
    speech and phrases, his likings and his aversions. And to leave her in
   </p>
   <p>
    farmland would be to let her slip back again out of accord with him. He
   </p>
   <p>
    wished to have her under his charge for another reason. His parents had
   </p>
   <p>
    naturally desired to see her once at least before he carried her off to
   </p>
   <p>
    a distant settlement, English or colonial; and as no opinion of theirs
   </p>
   <p>
    was to be allowed to change his intention, he judged that a couple of
   </p>
   <p>
    months’ life with him in lodgings whilst seeking for an advantageous
   </p>
   <p>
    opening would be of some social assistance to her at what she might
   </p>
   <p>
    feel to be a trying ordeal—her presentation to his mother at the
   </p>
   <p>
    Vicarage.
   </p>
   <p>
    Next, he wished to see a little of the working of a flour-mill, having
   </p>
   <p>
    an idea that he might combine the use of one with corn-growing. The
   </p>
   <p>
    proprietor of a large old water-mill at Wellbridge—once the mill of an
   </p>
   <p>
    Abbey—had offered him the inspection of his time-honoured mode of
   </p>
   <p>
    procedure, and a hand in the operations for a few days, whenever he
   </p>
   <p>
    should choose to come. Clare paid a visit to the place, some few miles
   </p>
   <p>
    distant, one day at this time, to inquire particulars, and returned to
   </p>
   <p>
    Talbothays in the evening. She found him determined to spend a short
   </p>
   <p>
    time at the Wellbridge flour-mills. And what had determined him? Less
   </p>
   <p>
    the opportunity of an insight into grinding and bolting than the casual
   </p>
   <p>
    fact that lodgings were to be obtained in that very farmhouse which,
   </p>
   <p>
    before its mutilation, had been the mansion of a branch of the
   </p>
   <p>
    d’Urberville family. This was always how Clare settled practical
   </p>
   <p>
    questions; by a sentiment which had nothing to do with them. They
   </p>
   <p>
    decided to go immediately after the wedding, and remain for a
   </p>
   <p>
    fortnight, instead of journeying to towns and inns.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Then we will start off to examine some farms on the other side of
   </p>
   <p>
    London that I have heard of,” he said, “and by March or April we will
   </p>
   <p>
    pay a visit to my father and mother.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Questions of procedure such as these arose and passed, and the day, the
   </p>
   <p>
    incredible day, on which she was to become his, loomed large in the
   </p>
   <p>
    near future. The thirty-first of December, New Year’s Eve, was the
   </p>
   <p>
    date. His wife, she said to herself. Could it ever be? Their two selves
   </p>
   <p>
    together, nothing to divide them, every incident shared by them; why
   </p>
   <p>
    not? And yet why?
   </p>
   <p>
    One Sunday morning Izz Huett returned from church, and spoke privately
   </p>
   <p>
    to Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You was not called home this morning.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “What?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It should ha’ been the first time of asking to-day,” she answered,
   </p>
   <p>
    looking quietly at Tess. “You meant to be married New Year’s Eve,
   </p>
   <p>
    deary?”
   </p>
   <p>
    The other returned a quick affirmative.
   </p>
   <p>
    “And there must be three times of asking. And now there be only two
   </p>
   <p>
    Sundays left between.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess felt her cheek paling; Izz was right; of course there must be
   </p>
   <p>
    three. Perhaps he had forgotten! If so, there must be a week’s
   </p>
   <p>
    postponement, and that was unlucky. How could she remind her lover? She
   </p>
   <p>
    who had been so backward was suddenly fired with impatience and alarm
   </p>
   <p>
    lest she should lose her dear prize.
   </p>
   <p>
    A natural incident relieved her anxiety. Izz mentioned the omission of
   </p>
   <p>
    the banns to Mrs Crick, and Mrs Crick assumed a matron’s privilege of
   </p>
   <p>
    speaking to Angel on the point.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Have ye forgot ’em, Mr Clare? The banns, I mean.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No, I have not forgot ’em,” says Clare.
   </p>
   <p>
    As soon as he caught Tess alone he assured her:
   </p>
   <p>
    “Don’t let them tease you about the banns. A licence will be quieter
   </p>
   <p>
    for us, and I have decided on a licence without consulting you. So if
   </p>
   <p>
    you go to church on Sunday morning you will not hear your own name, if
   </p>
   <p>
    you wished to.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I didn’t wish to hear it, dearest,” she said proudly.
   </p>
   <p>
    But to know that things were in train was an immense relief to Tess
   </p>
   <p>
    notwithstanding, who had well-nigh feared that somebody would stand up
   </p>
   <p>
    and forbid the banns on the ground of her history. How events were
   </p>
   <p>
    favouring her!
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t quite feel easy,” she said to herself. “All this good fortune
   </p>
   <p>
    may be scourged out of me afterwards by a lot of ill. That’s how Heaven
   </p>
   <p>
    mostly does. I wish I could have had common banns!”
   </p>
   <p>
    But everything went smoothly. She wondered whether he would like her to
   </p>
   <p>
    be married in her present best white frock, or if she ought to buy a
   </p>
   <p>
    new one. The question was set at rest by his forethought, disclosed by
   </p>
   <p>
    the arrival of some large packages addressed to her. Inside them she
   </p>
   <p>
    found a whole stock of clothing, from bonnet to shoes, including a
   </p>
   <p>
    perfect morning costume, such as would well suit the simple wedding
   </p>
   <p>
    they planned. He entered the house shortly after the arrival of the
   </p>
   <p>
    packages, and heard her upstairs undoing them.
   </p>
   <p>
    A minute later she came down with a flush on her face and tears in her
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes.
   </p>
   <p>
    “How thoughtful you’ve been!” she murmured, her cheek upon his
   </p>
   <p>
    shoulder. “Even to the gloves and handkerchief! My own love—how good,
   </p>
   <p>
    how kind!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No, no, Tess; just an order to a tradeswoman in London—nothing more.”
   </p>
   <p>
    And to divert her from thinking too highly of him, he told her to go
   </p>
   <p>
    upstairs, and take her time, and see if it all fitted; and, if not, to
   </p>
   <p>
    get the village sempstress to make a few alterations.
   </p>
   <p>
    She did return upstairs, and put on the gown. Alone, she stood for a
   </p>
   <p>
    moment before the glass looking at the effect of her silk attire; and
   </p>
   <p>
    then there came into her head her mother’s ballad of the mystic robe—
   </p>
   <p>
    That never would become that wife
   </p>
   <p>
    That had once done amiss,
   </p>
   <p>
    which Mrs Durbeyfield had used to sing to her as a child, so blithely
   </p>
   <p>
    and so archly, her foot on the cradle, which she rocked to the tune.
   </p>
   <p>
    Suppose this robe should betray her by changing colour, as her robe had
   </p>
   <p>
    betrayed Queen Guinevere. Since she had been at the dairy she had not
   </p>
   <p>
    once thought of the lines till now.
   </p>
   <p>
    XXXIII
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel felt that he would like to spend a day with her before the
   </p>
   <p>
    wedding, somewhere away from the dairy, as a last jaunt in her company
   </p>
   <p>
    while there were yet mere lover and mistress; a romantic day, in
   </p>
   <p>
    circumstances that would never be repeated; with that other and greater
   </p>
   <p>
    day beaming close ahead of them. During the preceding week, therefore,
   </p>
   <p>
    he suggested making a few purchases in the nearest town, and they
   </p>
   <p>
    started together.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare’s life at the dairy had been that of a recluse in respect the
   </p>
   <p>
    world of his own class. For months he had never gone near a town, and,
   </p>
   <p>
    requiring no vehicle, had never kept one, hiring the dairyman’s cob or
   </p>
   <p>
    gig if he rode or drove. They went in the gig that day.
   </p>
   <p>
    And then for the first time in their lives they shopped as partners in
   </p>
   <p>
    one concern. It was Christmas Eve, with its loads a holly and
   </p>
   <p>
    mistletoe, and the town was very full of strangers who had come in from
   </p>
   <p>
    all parts of the country on account of the day. Tess paid the penalty
   </p>
   <p>
    of walking about with happiness superadded to beauty on her countenance
   </p>
   <p>
    by being much stared at as she moved amid them on his arm.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the evening they returned to the inn at which they had put up, and
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess waited in the entry while Angel went to see the horse and gig
   </p>
   <p>
    brought to the door. The general sitting-room was full of guests, who
   </p>
   <p>
    were continually going in and out. As the door opened and shut each
   </p>
   <p>
    time for the passage of these, the light within the parlour fell full
   </p>
   <p>
    upon Tess’s face. Two men came out and passed by her among the rest.
   </p>
   <p>
    One of them had stared her up and down in surprise, and she fancied he
   </p>
   <p>
    was a Trantridge man, though that village lay so many miles off that
   </p>
   <p>
    Trantridge folk were rarities here.
   </p>
   <p>
    “A comely maid that,” said the other.
   </p>
   <p>
    “True, comely enough. But unless I make a great mistake—” And he
   </p>
   <p>
    negatived the remainder of the definition forthwith.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare had just returned from the stable-yard, and, confronting the man
   </p>
   <p>
    on the threshold, heard the words, and saw the shrinking of Tess. The
   </p>
   <p>
    insult to her stung him to the quick, and before he had considered
   </p>
   <p>
    anything at all he struck the man on the chin with the full force of
   </p>
   <p>
    his fist, sending him staggering backwards into the passage.
   </p>
   <p>
    The man recovered himself, and seemed inclined to come on, and Clare,
   </p>
   <p>
    stepping outside the door, put himself in a posture of defence. But his
   </p>
   <p>
    opponent began to think better of the matter. He looked anew at Tess as
   </p>
   <p>
    he passed her, and said to Clare—
   </p>
   <p>
    “I beg pardon, sir; ’twas a complete mistake. I thought she was another
   </p>
   <p>
    woman, forty miles from here.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare, feeling then that he had been too hasty, and that he was,
   </p>
   <p>
    moreover, to blame for leaving her standing in an inn-passage, did what
   </p>
   <p>
    he usually did in such cases, gave the man five shillings to plaster
   </p>
   <p>
    the blow; and thus they parted, bidding each other a pacific good
   </p>
   <p>
    night. As soon as Clare had taken the reins from the ostler, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    young couple had driven off, the two men went in the other direction.
   </p>
   <p>
    “And was it a mistake?” said the second one.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Not a bit of it. But I didn’t want to hurt the gentleman’s
   </p>
   <p>
    feelings—not I.”
   </p>
   <p>
    In the meantime the lovers were driving onward.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Could we put off our wedding till a little later?” Tess asked in a dry
   </p>
   <p>
    dull voice. “I mean if we wished?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No, my love. Calm yourself. Do you mean that the fellow may have time
   </p>
   <p>
    to summon me for assault?” he asked good-humouredly.
   </p>
   <p>
    “No—I only meant—if it should have to be put off.”
   </p>
   <p>
    What she meant was not very clear, and he directed her to dismiss such
   </p>
   <p>
    fancies from her mind, which she obediently did as well as she could.
   </p>
   <p>
    But she was grave, very grave, all the way home; till she thought, “We
   </p>
   <p>
    shall go away, a very long distance, hundreds of miles from these
   </p>
   <p>
    parts, and such as this can never happen again, and no ghost of the
   </p>
   <p>
    past reach there.”
   </p>
   <p>
    They parted tenderly that night on the landing, and Clare ascended to
   </p>
   <p>
    his attic. Tess sat up getting on with some little requisites, lest the
   </p>
   <p>
    few remaining days should not afford sufficient time. While she sat she
   </p>
   <p>
    heard a noise in Angel’s room overhead, a sound of thumping and
   </p>
   <p>
    struggling. Everybody else in the house was asleep, and in her anxiety
   </p>
   <p>
    lest Clare should be ill she ran up and knocked at his door, and asked
   </p>
   <p>
    him what was the matter.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh, nothing, dear,” he said from within. “I am so sorry I disturbed
   </p>
   <p>
    you! But the reason is rather an amusing one: I fell asleep and dreamt
   </p>
   <p>
    that I was fighting that fellow again who insulted you, and the noise
   </p>
   <p>
    you heard was my pummelling away with my fists at my portmanteau, which
   </p>
   <p>
    I pulled out to-day for packing. I am occasionally liable to these
   </p>
   <p>
    freaks in my sleep. Go to bed and think of it no more.”
   </p>
   <p>
    This was the last drachm required to turn the scale of her indecision.
   </p>
   <p>
    Declare the past to him by word of mouth she could not; but there was
   </p>
   <p>
    another way. She sat down and wrote on the four pages of a note-sheet a
   </p>
   <p>
    succinct narrative of those events of three or four years ago, put it
   </p>
   <p>
    into an envelope, and directed it to Clare. Then, lest the flesh should
   </p>
   <p>
    again be weak, she crept upstairs without any shoes and slipped the
   </p>
   <p>
    note under his door.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her night was a broken one, as it well might be, and she listened for
   </p>
   <p>
    the first faint noise overhead. It came, as usual; he descended, as
   </p>
   <p>
    usual. She descended. He met her at the bottom of the stairs and kissed
   </p>
   <p>
    her. Surely it was as warmly as ever!
   </p>
   <p>
    He looked a little disturbed and worn, she thought. But he said not a
   </p>
   <p>
    word to her about her revelation, even when they were alone. Could he
   </p>
   <p>
    have had it? Unless he began the subject she felt that she could say
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing. So the day passed, and it was evident that whatever he thought
   </p>
   <p>
    he meant to keep to himself. Yet he was frank and affectionate as
   </p>
   <p>
    before. Could it be that her doubts were childish? that he forgave her;
   </p>
   <p>
    that he loved her for what she was, just as she was, and smiled at her
   </p>
   <p>
    disquiet as at a foolish nightmare? Had he really received her note?
   </p>
   <p>
    She glanced into his room, and could see nothing of it. It might be
   </p>
   <p>
    that he forgave her. But even if he had not received it she had a
   </p>
   <p>
    sudden enthusiastic trust that he surely would forgive her.
   </p>
   <p>
    Every morning and night he was the same, and thus New Year’s Eve
   </p>
   <p>
    broke—the wedding day.
   </p>
   <p>
    The lovers did not rise at milking-time, having through the whole of
   </p>
   <p>
    this last week of their sojourn at the dairy been accorded something of
   </p>
   <p>
    the position of guests, Tess being honoured with a room of her own.
   </p>
   <p>
    When they arrived downstairs at breakfast-time they were surprised to
   </p>
   <p>
    see what effects had been produced in the large kitchen for their glory
   </p>
   <p>
    since they had last beheld it. At some unnatural hour of the morning
   </p>
   <p>
    the dairyman had caused the yawning chimney-corner to be whitened, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the brick hearth reddened, and a blazing yellow damask blower to be
   </p>
   <p>
    hung across the arch in place of the old grimy blue cotton one with a
   </p>
   <p>
    black sprig pattern which had formerly done duty there. This renovated
   </p>
   <p>
    aspect of what was the focus indeed of the room on a full winter
   </p>
   <p>
    morning threw a smiling demeanour over the whole apartment.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I was determined to do summat in honour o’t”, said the dairyman. “And
   </p>
   <p>
    as you wouldn’t hear of my gieing a rattling good randy wi’ fiddles and
   </p>
   <p>
    bass-viols complete, as we should ha’ done in old times, this was all I
   </p>
   <p>
    could think o’ as a noiseless thing.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess’s friends lived so far off that none could conveniently have been
   </p>
   <p>
    present at the ceremony, even had any been asked; but as a fact nobody
   </p>
   <p>
    was invited from Marlott. As for Angel’s family, he had written and
   </p>
   <p>
    duly informed them of the time, and assured them that he would be glad
   </p>
   <p>
    to see one at least of them there for the day if he would like to come.
   </p>
   <p>
    His brothers had not replied at all, seeming to be indignant with him;
   </p>
   <p>
    while his father and mother had written a rather sad letter, deploring
   </p>
   <p>
    his precipitancy in rushing into marriage, but making the best of the
   </p>
   <p>
    matter by saying that, though a dairywoman was the last daughter-in-law
   </p>
   <p>
    they could have expected, their son had arrived at an age which he
   </p>
   <p>
    might be supposed to be the best judge.
   </p>
   <p>
    This coolness in his relations distressed Clare less than it would have
   </p>
   <p>
    done had he been without the grand card with which he meant to surprise
   </p>
   <p>
    them ere long. To produce Tess, fresh from the dairy, as a d’Urberville
   </p>
   <p>
    and a lady, he had felt to be temerarious and risky; hence he had
   </p>
   <p>
    concealed her lineage till such time as, familiarized with worldly ways
   </p>
   <p>
    by a few months’ travel and reading with him, he could take her on a
   </p>
   <p>
    visit to his parents and impart the knowledge while triumphantly
   </p>
   <p>
    producing her as worthy of such an ancient line. It was a pretty
   </p>
   <p>
    lover’s dream, if no more. Perhaps Tess’s lineage had more value for
   </p>
   <p>
    himself than for anybody in the world beside.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her perception that Angel’s bearing towards her still remained in no
   </p>
   <p>
    whit altered by her own communication rendered Tess guiltily doubtful
   </p>
   <p>
    if he could have received it. She rose from breakfast before he had
   </p>
   <p>
    finished, and hastened upstairs. It had occurred to her to look once
   </p>
   <p>
    more into the queer gaunt room which had been Clare’s den, or rather
   </p>
   <p>
    eyrie, for so long, and climbing the ladder she stood at the open door
   </p>
   <p>
    of the apartment, regarding and pondering. She stooped to the threshold
   </p>
   <p>
    of the doorway, where she had pushed in the note two or three days
   </p>
   <p>
    earlier in such excitement. The carpet reached close to the sill, and
   </p>
   <p>
    under the edge of the carpet she discerned the faint white margin of
   </p>
   <p>
    the envelope containing her letter to him, which he obviously had never
   </p>
   <p>
    seen, owing to her having in her haste thrust it beneath the carpet as
   </p>
   <p>
    well as beneath the door.
   </p>
   <p>
    With a feeling of faintness she withdrew the letter. There it
   </p>
   <p>
    was—sealed up, just as it had left her hands. The mountain had not yet
   </p>
   <p>
    been removed. She could not let him read it now, the house being in
   </p>
   <p>
    full bustle of preparation; and descending to her own room she
   </p>
   <p>
    destroyed the letter there.
   </p>
   <p>
    She was so pale when he saw her again that he felt quite anxious. The
   </p>
   <p>
    incident of the misplaced letter she had jumped at as if it prevented a
   </p>
   <p>
    confession; but she knew in her conscience that it need not; there was
   </p>
   <p>
    still time. Yet everything was in a stir; there was coming and going;
   </p>
   <p>
    all had to dress, the dairyman and Mrs Crick having been asked to
   </p>
   <p>
    accompany them as witnesses; and reflection or deliberate talk was
   </p>
   <p>
    well-nigh impossible. The only minute Tess could get to be alone with
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare was when they met upon the landing.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am so anxious to talk to you—I want to confess all my faults and
   </p>
   <p>
    blunders!” she said with attempted lightness.
   </p>
   <p>
    “No, no—we can’t have faults talked of—you must be deemed perfect
   </p>
   <p>
    to-day at least, my Sweet!” he cried. “We shall have plenty of time,
   </p>
   <p>
    hereafter, I hope, to talk over our failings. I will confess mine at
   </p>
   <p>
    the same time.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But it would be better for me to do it now, I think, so that you could
   </p>
   <p>
    not say—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, my quixotic one, you shall tell me anything—say, as soon as we
   </p>
   <p>
    are settled in our lodging; not now. I, too, will tell you my faults
   </p>
   <p>
    then. But do not let us spoil the day with them; they will be excellent
   </p>
   <p>
    matter for a dull time.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Then you don’t wish me to, dearest?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I do not, Tessy, really.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The hurry of dressing and starting left no time for more than this.
   </p>
   <p>
    Those words of his seemed to reassure her on further reflection. She
   </p>
   <p>
    was whirled onward through the next couple of critical hours by the
   </p>
   <p>
    mastering tide of her devotion to him, which closed up further
   </p>
   <p>
    meditation. Her one desire, so long resisted, to make herself his, to
   </p>
   <p>
    call him her lord, her own—then, if necessary, to die—had at last
   </p>
   <p>
    lifted her up from her plodding reflective pathway. In dressing, she
   </p>
   <p>
    moved about in a mental cloud of many-coloured idealities, which
   </p>
   <p>
    eclipsed all sinister contingencies by its brightness.
   </p>
   <p>
    The church was a long way off, and they were obliged to drive,
   </p>
   <p>
    particularly as it was winter. A closed carriage was ordered from a
   </p>
   <p>
    roadside inn, a vehicle which had been kept there ever since the old
   </p>
   <p>
    days of post-chaise travelling. It had stout wheel-spokes and heavy
   </p>
   <p>
    felloes, a great curved bed, immense straps and springs, and a pole
   </p>
   <p>
    like a battering-ram. The postilion was a venerable “boy” of sixty—a
   </p>
   <p>
    martyr to rheumatic gout, the result of excessive exposure in youth,
   </p>
   <p>
    counter-acted by strong liquors—who had stood at inn-doors doing
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing for the whole five-and-twenty years that had elapsed since he
   </p>
   <p>
    had no longer been required to ride professionally, as if expecting the
   </p>
   <p>
    old times to come back again. He had a permanent running wound on the
   </p>
   <p>
    outside of his right leg, originated by the constant bruisings of
   </p>
   <p>
    aristocratic carriage-poles during the many years that he had been in
   </p>
   <p>
    regular employ at the King’s Arms, Casterbridge.
   </p>
   <p>
    Inside this cumbrous and creaking structure, and behind this decayed
   </p>
   <p>
    conductor, the _partie carrée_ took their seats—the bride and
   </p>
   <p>
    bridegroom and Mr and Mrs Crick. Angel would have liked one at least of
   </p>
   <p>
    his brothers to be present as groomsman, but their silence after his
   </p>
   <p>
    gentle hint to that effect by letter had signified that they did not
   </p>
   <p>
    care to come. They disapproved of the marriage, and could not be
   </p>
   <p>
    expected to countenance it. Perhaps it was as well that they could not
   </p>
   <p>
    be present. They were not worldly young fellows, but fraternizing with
   </p>
   <p>
    dairy-folk would have struck unpleasantly upon their biased niceness,
   </p>
   <p>
    apart from their views of the match.
   </p>
   <p>
    Upheld by the momentum of the time, Tess knew nothing of this, did not
   </p>
   <p>
    see anything, did not know the road they were taking to the church. She
   </p>
   <p>
    knew that Angel was close to her; all the rest was a luminous mist. She
   </p>
   <p>
    was a sort of celestial person, who owed her being to poetry—one of
   </p>
   <p>
    those classical divinities Clare was accustomed to talk to her about
   </p>
   <p>
    when they took their walks together.
   </p>
   <p>
    The marriage being by licence there were only a dozen or so of people
   </p>
   <p>
    in the church; had there been a thousand they would have produced no
   </p>
   <p>
    more effect upon her. They were at stellar distances from her present
   </p>
   <p>
    world. In the ecstatic solemnity with which she swore her faith to him
   </p>
   <p>
    the ordinary sensibilities of sex seemed a flippancy. At a pause in the
   </p>
   <p>
    service, while they were kneeling together, she unconsciously inclined
   </p>
   <p>
    herself towards him, so that her shoulder touched his arm; she had been
   </p>
   <p>
    frightened by a passing thought, and the movement had been automatic,
   </p>
   <p>
    to assure herself that he was really there, and to fortify her belief
   </p>
   <p>
    that his fidelity would be proof against all things.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare knew that she loved him—every curve of her form showed that—but
   </p>
   <p>
    he did not know at that time the full depth of her devotion, its
   </p>
   <p>
    single-mindedness, its meekness; what long-suffering it guaranteed,
   </p>
   <p>
    what honesty, what endurance, what good faith.
   </p>
   <p>
    As they came out of church the ringers swung the bells off their rests,
   </p>
   <p>
    and a modest peal of three notes broke forth—that limited amount of
   </p>
   <p>
    expression having been deemed sufficient by the church builders for the
   </p>
   <p>
    joys of such a small parish. Passing by the tower with her husband on
   </p>
   <p>
    the path to the gate she could feel the vibrant air humming round them
   </p>
   <p>
    from the louvred belfry in the circle of sound, and it matched the
   </p>
   <p>
    highly-charged mental atmosphere in which she was living.
   </p>
   <p>
    This condition of mind, wherein she felt glorified by an irradiation
   </p>
   <p>
    not her own, like the angel whom St John saw in the sun, lasted till
   </p>
   <p>
    the sound of the church bells had died away, and the emotions of the
   </p>
   <p>
    wedding-service had calmed down. Her eyes could dwell upon details more
   </p>
   <p>
    clearly now, and Mr and Mrs Crick having directed their own gig to be
   </p>
   <p>
    sent for them, to leave the carriage to the young couple, she observed
   </p>
   <p>
    the build and character of that conveyance for the first time. Sitting
   </p>
   <p>
    in silence she regarded it long.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I fancy you seem oppressed, Tessy,” said Clare.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes,” she answered, putting her hand to her brow. “I tremble at many
   </p>
   <p>
    things. It is all so serious, Angel. Among other things I seem to have
   </p>
   <p>
    seen this carriage before, to be very well acquainted with it. It is
   </p>
   <p>
    very odd—I must have seen it in a dream.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh—you have heard the legend of the d’Urberville Coach—that well-known
   </p>
   <p>
    superstition of this county about your family when they were very
   </p>
   <p>
    popular here; and this lumbering old thing reminds you of it.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I have never heard of it to my knowledge,” said she. “What is the
   </p>
   <p>
    legend—may I know it?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well—I would rather not tell it in detail just now. A certain
   </p>
   <p>
    d’Urberville of the sixteenth or seventeenth century committed a
   </p>
   <p>
    dreadful crime in his family coach; and since that time members of the
   </p>
   <p>
    family see or hear the old coach whenever—— But I’ll tell you another
   </p>
   <p>
    day—it is rather gloomy. Evidently some dim knowledge of it has been
   </p>
   <p>
    brought back to your mind by the sight of this venerable caravan.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t remember hearing it before,” she murmured. “Is it when we are
   </p>
   <p>
    going to die, Angel, that members of my family see it, or is it when we
   </p>
   <p>
    have committed a crime?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Now, Tess!”
   </p>
   <p>
    He silenced her by a kiss.
   </p>
   <p>
    By the time they reached home she was contrite and spiritless. She was
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs Angel Clare, indeed, but had she any moral right to the name? Was
   </p>
   <p>
    she not more truly Mrs Alexander d’Urberville? Could intensity of love
   </p>
   <p>
    justify what might be considered in upright souls as culpable
   </p>
   <p>
    reticence? She knew not what was expected of women in such cases; and
   </p>
   <p>
    she had no counsellor.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, when she found herself alone in her room for a few minutes—the
   </p>
   <p>
    last day this on which she was ever to enter it—she knelt down and
   </p>
   <p>
    prayed. She tried to pray to God, but it was her husband who really had
   </p>
   <p>
    her supplication. Her idolatry of this man was such that she herself
   </p>
   <p>
    almost feared it to be ill-omened. She was conscious of the notion
   </p>
   <p>
    expressed by Friar Laurence: “These violent delights have violent
   </p>
   <p>
    ends.” It might be too desperate for human conditions—too rank, to
   </p>
   <p>
    wild, too deadly.
   </p>
   <p>
    “O my love, why do I love you so!” she whispered there alone; “for she
   </p>
   <p>
    you love is not my real self, but one in my image; the one I might have
   </p>
   <p>
    been!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Afternoon came, and with it the hour for departure. They had decided to
   </p>
   <p>
    fulfil the plan of going for a few days to the lodgings in the old
   </p>
   <p>
    farmhouse near Wellbridge Mill, at which he meant to reside during his
   </p>
   <p>
    investigation of flour processes. At two o’clock there was nothing left
   </p>
   <p>
    to do but to start. All the servantry of the dairy were standing in the
   </p>
   <p>
    red-brick entry to see them go out, the dairyman and his wife following
   </p>
   <p>
    to the door. Tess saw her three chamber-mates in a row against the
   </p>
   <p>
    wall, pensively inclining their heads. She had much questioned if they
   </p>
   <p>
    would appear at the parting moment; but there they were, stoical and
   </p>
   <p>
    staunch to the last. She knew why the delicate Retty looked so fragile,
   </p>
   <p>
    and Izz so tragically sorrowful, and Marian so blank; and she forgot
   </p>
   <p>
    her own dogging shadow for a moment in contemplating theirs.
   </p>
   <p>
    She impulsively whispered to him—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Will you kiss ’em all, once, poor things, for the first and last
   </p>
   <p>
    time?”
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare had not the least objection to such a farewell formality—which
   </p>
   <p>
    was all that it was to him—and as he passed them he kissed them in
   </p>
   <p>
    succession where they stood, saying “Goodbye” to each as he did so.
   </p>
   <p>
    When they reached the door Tess femininely glanced back to discern the
   </p>
   <p>
    effect of that kiss of charity; there was no triumph in her glance, as
   </p>
   <p>
    there might have been. If there had it would have disappeared when she
   </p>
   <p>
    saw how moved the girls all were. The kiss had obviously done harm by
   </p>
   <p>
    awakening feelings they were trying to subdue.
   </p>
   <p>
    Of all this Clare was unconscious. Passing on to the wicket-gate he
   </p>
   <p>
    shook hands with the dairyman and his wife, and expressed his last
   </p>
   <p>
    thanks to them for their attentions; after which there was a moment of
   </p>
   <p>
    silence before they had moved off. It was interrupted by the crowing of
   </p>
   <p>
    a cock. The white one with the rose comb had come and settled on the
   </p>
   <p>
    palings in front of the house, within a few yards of them, and his
   </p>
   <p>
    notes thrilled their ears through, dwindling away like echoes down a
   </p>
   <p>
    valley of rocks.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh?” said Mrs Crick. “An afternoon crow!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Two men were standing by the yard gate, holding it open.
   </p>
   <p>
    “That’s bad,” one murmured to the other, not thinking that the words
   </p>
   <p>
    could be heard by the group at the door-wicket.
   </p>
   <p>
    The cock crew again—straight towards Clare.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well!” said the dairyman.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t like to hear him!” said Tess to her husband. “Tell the man to
   </p>
   <p>
    drive on. Goodbye, goodbye!”
   </p>
   <p>
    The cock crew again.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Hoosh! Just you be off, sir, or I’ll twist your neck!” said the
   </p>
   <p>
    dairyman with some irritation, turning to the bird and driving him
   </p>
   <p>
    away. And to his wife as they went indoors: “Now, to think o’ that just
   </p>
   <p>
    to-day! I’ve not heard his crow of an afternoon all the year afore.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It only means a change in the weather,” said she; “not what you think:
   </p>
   <p>
    ’tis impossible!”
   </p>
   <p>
    XXXIV
   </p>
   <p>
    They drove by the level road along the valley to a distance of a few
   </p>
   <p>
    miles, and, reaching Wellbridge, turned away from the village to the
   </p>
   <p>
    left, and over the great Elizabethan bridge which gives the place half
   </p>
   <p>
    its name. Immediately behind it stood the house wherein they had
   </p>
   <p>
    engaged lodgings, whose exterior features are so well known to all
   </p>
   <p>
    travellers through the Froom Valley; once portion of a fine manorial
   </p>
   <p>
    residence, and the property and seat of a d’Urberville, but since its
   </p>
   <p>
    partial demolition a farmhouse.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Welcome to one of your ancestral mansions!” said Clare as he handed
   </p>
   <p>
    her down. But he regretted the pleasantry; it was too near a satire.
   </p>
   <p>
    On entering they found that, though they had only engaged a couple of
   </p>
   <p>
    rooms, the farmer had taken advantage of their proposed presence during
   </p>
   <p>
    the coming days to pay a New Year’s visit to some friends, leaving a
   </p>
   <p>
    woman from a neighbouring cottage to minister to their few wants. The
   </p>
   <p>
    absoluteness of possession pleased them, and they realized it as the
   </p>
   <p>
    first moment of their experience under their own exclusive roof-tree.
   </p>
   <p>
    But he found that the mouldy old habitation somewhat depressed his
   </p>
   <p>
    bride. When the carriage was gone they ascended the stairs to wash
   </p>
   <p>
    their hands, the charwoman showing the way. On the landing Tess stopped
   </p>
   <p>
    and started.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What’s the matter?” said he.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Those horrid women!” she answered with a smile. “How they frightened
   </p>
   <p>
    me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He looked up, and perceived two life-size portraits on panels built
   </p>
   <p>
    into the masonry. As all visitors to the mansion are aware, these
   </p>
   <p>
    paintings represent women of middle age, of a date some two hundred
   </p>
   <p>
    years ago, whose lineaments once seen can never be forgotten. The long
   </p>
   <p>
    pointed features, narrow eye, and smirk of the one, so suggestive of
   </p>
   <p>
    merciless treachery; the bill-hook nose, large teeth, and bold eye of
   </p>
   <p>
    the other suggesting arrogance to the point of ferocity, haunt the
   </p>
   <p>
    beholder afterwards in his dreams.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Whose portraits are those?” asked Clare of the charwoman.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I have been told by old folk that they were ladies of the d’Urberville
   </p>
   <p>
    family, the ancient lords of this manor,” she said, “Owing to their
   </p>
   <p>
    being builded into the wall they can’t be moved away.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The unpleasantness of the matter was that, in addition to their effect
   </p>
   <p>
    upon Tess, her fine features were unquestionably traceable in these
   </p>
   <p>
    exaggerated forms. He said nothing of this, however, and, regretting
   </p>
   <p>
    that he had gone out of his way to choose the house for their bridal
   </p>
   <p>
    time, went on into the adjoining room. The place having been rather
   </p>
   <p>
    hastily prepared for them, they washed their hands in one basin. Clare
   </p>
   <p>
    touched hers under the water.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Which are my fingers and which are yours?” he said, looking up. “They
   </p>
   <p>
    are very much mixed.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “They are all yours,” said she, very prettily, and endeavoured to be
   </p>
   <p>
    gayer than she was. He had not been displeased with her thoughtfulness
   </p>
   <p>
    on such an occasion; it was what every sensible woman would show: but
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess knew that she had been thoughtful to excess, and struggled against
   </p>
   <p>
    it.
   </p>
   <p>
    The sun was so low on that short last afternoon of the year that it
   </p>
   <p>
    shone in through a small opening and formed a golden staff which
   </p>
   <p>
    stretched across to her skirt, where it made a spot like a paint-mark
   </p>
   <p>
    set upon her. They went into the ancient parlour to tea, and here they
   </p>
   <p>
    shared their first common meal alone. Such was their childishness, or
   </p>
   <p>
    rather his, that he found it interesting to use the same
   </p>
   <p>
    bread-and-butter plate as herself, and to brush crumbs from her lips
   </p>
   <p>
    with his own. He wondered a little that she did not enter into these
   </p>
   <p>
    frivolities with his own zest.
   </p>
   <p>
    Looking at her silently for a long time; “She is a dear dear Tess,” he
   </p>
   <p>
    thought to himself, as one deciding on the true construction of a
   </p>
   <p>
    difficult passage. “Do I realize solemnly enough how utterly and
   </p>
   <p>
    irretrievably this little womanly thing is the creature of my good or
   </p>
   <p>
    bad faith and fortune? I think not. I think I could not, unless I were
   </p>
   <p>
    a woman myself. What I am in worldly estate, she is. What I become, she
   </p>
   <p>
    must become. What I cannot be, she cannot be. And shall I ever neglect
   </p>
   <p>
    her, or hurt her, or even forget to consider her? God forbid such a
   </p>
   <p>
    crime!”
   </p>
   <p>
    They sat on over the tea-table waiting for their luggage, which the
   </p>
   <p>
    dairyman had promised to send before it grew dark. But evening began to
   </p>
   <p>
    close in, and the luggage did not arrive, and they had brought nothing
   </p>
   <p>
    more than they stood in. With the departure of the sun the calm mood of
   </p>
   <p>
    the winter day changed. Out of doors there began noises as of silk
   </p>
   <p>
    smartly rubbed; the restful dead leaves of the preceding autumn were
   </p>
   <p>
    stirred to irritated resurrection, and whirled about unwillingly, and
   </p>
   <p>
    tapped against the shutters. It soon began to rain.
   </p>
   <p>
    “That cock knew the weather was going to change,” said Clare.
   </p>
   <p>
    The woman who had attended upon them had gone home for the night, but
   </p>
   <p>
    she had placed candles upon the table, and now they lit them. Each
   </p>
   <p>
    candle-flame drew towards the fireplace.
   </p>
   <p>
    “These old houses are so draughty,” continued Angel, looking at the
   </p>
   <p>
    flames, and at the grease guttering down the sides. “I wonder where
   </p>
   <p>
    that luggage is. We haven’t even a brush and comb.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t know,” she answered, absent-minded.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tess, you are not a bit cheerful this evening—not at all as you used
   </p>
   <p>
    to be. Those harridans on the panels upstairs have unsettled you. I am
   </p>
   <p>
    sorry I brought you here. I wonder if you really love me, after all?”
   </p>
   <p>
    He knew that she did, and the words had no serious intent; but she was
   </p>
   <p>
    surcharged with emotion, and winced like a wounded animal. Though she
   </p>
   <p>
    tried not to shed tears, she could not help showing one or two.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I did not mean it!” said he, sorry. “You are worried at not having
   </p>
   <p>
    your things, I know. I cannot think why old Jonathan has not come with
   </p>
   <p>
    them. Why, it is seven o’clock? Ah, there he is!”
   </p>
   <p>
    A knock had come to the door, and, there being nobody else to answer
   </p>
   <p>
    it, Clare went out. He returned to the room with a small package in his
   </p>
   <p>
    hand.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It is not Jonathan, after all,” he said.
   </p>
   <p>
    “How vexing!” said Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    The packet had been brought by a special messenger, who had arrived at
   </p>
   <p>
    Talbothays from Emminster Vicarage immediately after the departure of
   </p>
   <p>
    the married couple, and had followed them hither, being under
   </p>
   <p>
    injunction to deliver it into nobody’s hands but theirs. Clare brought
   </p>
   <p>
    it to the light. It was less than a foot long, sewed up in canvas,
   </p>
   <p>
    sealed in red wax with his father’s seal, and directed in his father’s
   </p>
   <p>
    hand to “Mrs Angel Clare.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It is a little wedding-present for you, Tess,” said he, handing it to
   </p>
   <p>
    her. “How thoughtful they are!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess looked a little flustered as she took it.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I think I would rather have you open it, dearest,” said she, turning
   </p>
   <p>
    over the parcel. “I don’t like to break those great seals; they look so
   </p>
   <p>
    serious. Please open it for me!”
   </p>
   <p>
    He undid the parcel. Inside was a case of morocco leather, on the top
   </p>
   <p>
    of which lay a note and a key.
   </p>
   <p>
    The note was for Clare, in the following words:
   </p>
   <p>
    My dear son,—
   </p>
   <p>
    Possibly you have forgotten that on the death of your godmother,
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs Pitney, when you were a lad, she—vain, kind woman that she
   </p>
   <p>
    was—left to me a portion of the contents of her jewel-case in trust
   </p>
   <p>
    for your wife, if you should ever have one, as a mark of her
   </p>
   <p>
    affection for you and whomsoever you should choose. This trust I
   </p>
   <p>
    have fulfilled, and the diamonds have been locked up at my banker’s
   </p>
   <p>
    ever since. Though I feel it to be a somewhat incongruous act in
   </p>
   <p>
    the circumstances, I am, as you will see, bound to hand over the
   </p>
   <p>
    articles to the woman to whom the use of them for her lifetime will
   </p>
   <p>
    now rightly belong, and they are therefore promptly sent. They
   </p>
   <p>
    become, I believe, heirlooms, strictly speaking, according to the
   </p>
   <p>
    terms of your godmother’s will. The precise words of the clause
   </p>
   <p>
    that refers to this matter are enclosed.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I do remember,” said Clare; “but I had quite forgotten.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Unlocking the case, they found it to contain a necklace, with pendant,
   </p>
   <p>
    bracelets, and ear-rings; and also some other small ornaments.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess seemed afraid to touch them at first, but her eyes sparkled for a
   </p>
   <p>
    moment as much as the stones when Clare spread out the set.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Are they mine?” she asked incredulously.
   </p>
   <p>
    “They are, certainly,” said he.
   </p>
   <p>
    He looked into the fire. He remembered how, when he was a lad of
   </p>
   <p>
    fifteen, his godmother, the Squire’s wife—the only rich person with
   </p>
   <p>
    whom he had ever come in contact—had pinned her faith to his success;
   </p>
   <p>
    had prophesied a wondrous career for him. There had seemed nothing at
   </p>
   <p>
    all out of keeping with such a conjectured career in the storing up of
   </p>
   <p>
    these showy ornaments for his wife and the wives of her descendants.
   </p>
   <p>
    They gleamed somewhat ironically now. “Yet why?” he asked himself. It
   </p>
   <p>
    was but a question of vanity throughout; and if that were admitted into
   </p>
   <p>
    one side of the equation it should be admitted into the other. His wife
   </p>
   <p>
    was a d’Urberville: whom could they become better than her?
   </p>
   <p>
    Suddenly he said with enthusiasm—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tess, put them on—put them on!” And he turned from the fire to help
   </p>
   <p>
    her.
   </p>
   <p>
    But as if by magic she had already donned them—necklace, ear-rings,
   </p>
   <p>
    bracelets, and all.
   </p>
   <p>
    “But the gown isn’t right, Tess,” said Clare. “It ought to be a low one
   </p>
   <p>
    for a set of brilliants like that.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ought it?” said Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes,” said he.
   </p>
   <p>
    He suggested to her how to tuck in the upper edge of her bodice, so as
   </p>
   <p>
    to make it roughly approximate to the cut for evening wear; and when
   </p>
   <p>
    she had done this, and the pendant to the necklace hung isolated amid
   </p>
   <p>
    the whiteness of her throat, as it was designed to do, he stepped back
   </p>
   <p>
    to survey her.
   </p>
   <p>
    “My heavens,” said Clare, “how beautiful you are!”
   </p>
   <p>
    As everybody knows, fine feathers make fine birds; a peasant girl but
   </p>
   <p>
    very moderately prepossessing to the casual observer in her simple
   </p>
   <p>
    condition and attire will bloom as an amazing beauty if clothed as a
   </p>
   <p>
    woman of fashion with the aids that Art can render; while the beauty of
   </p>
   <p>
    the midnight crush would often cut but a sorry figure if placed inside
   </p>
   <p>
    the field-woman’s wrapper upon a monotonous acreage of turnips on a
   </p>
   <p>
    dull day. He had never till now estimated the artistic excellence of
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess’s limbs and features.
   </p>
   <p>
    “If you were only to appear in a ball-room!” he said. “But no—no,
   </p>
   <p>
    dearest; I think I love you best in the wing-bonnet and
   </p>
   <p>
    cotton-frock—yes, better than in this, well as you support these
   </p>
   <p>
    dignities.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess’s sense of her striking appearance had given her a flush of
   </p>
   <p>
    excitement, which was yet not happiness.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’ll take them off,” she said, “in case Jonathan should see me. They
   </p>
   <p>
    are not fit for me, are they? They must be sold, I suppose?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Let them stay a few minutes longer. Sell them? Never. It would be a
   </p>
   <p>
    breach of faith.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Influenced by a second thought she readily obeyed. She had something to
   </p>
   <p>
    tell, and there might be help in these. She sat down with the jewels
   </p>
   <p>
    upon her; and they again indulged in conjectures as to where Jonathan
   </p>
   <p>
    could possibly be with their baggage. The ale they had poured out for
   </p>
   <p>
    his consumption when he came had gone flat with long standing.
   </p>
   <p>
    Shortly after this they began supper, which was already laid on a
   </p>
   <p>
    side-table. Ere they had finished there was a jerk in the fire-smoke,
   </p>
   <p>
    the rising skein of which bulged out into the room, as if some giant
   </p>
   <p>
    had laid his hand on the chimney-top for a moment. It had been caused
   </p>
   <p>
    by the opening of the outer door. A heavy step was now heard in the
   </p>
   <p>
    passage, and Angel went out.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I couldn’ make nobody hear at all by knocking,” apologized Jonathan
   </p>
   <p>
    Kail, for it was he at last; “and as’t was raining out I opened the
   </p>
   <p>
    door. I’ve brought the things, sir.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am very glad to see them. But you are very late.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, yes, sir.”
   </p>
   <p>
    There was something subdued in Jonathan Kail’s tone which had not been
   </p>
   <p>
    there in the day, and lines of concern were ploughed upon his forehead
   </p>
   <p>
    in addition to the lines of years. He continued—
   </p>
   <p>
    “We’ve all been gallied at the dairy at what might ha’ been a most
   </p>
   <p>
    terrible affliction since you and your Mis’ess—so to name her now—left
   </p>
   <p>
    us this a’ternoon. Perhaps you ha’nt forgot the cock’s afternoon crow?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Dear me;—what—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, some says it do mane one thing, and some another; but what’s
   </p>
   <p>
    happened is that poor little Retty Priddle hev tried to drown herself.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No! Really! Why, she bade us goodbye with the rest—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes. Well, sir, when you and your Mis’ess—so to name what she lawful
   </p>
   <p>
    is—when you two drove away, as I say, Retty and Marian put on their
   </p>
   <p>
    bonnets and went out; and as there is not much doing now, being New
   </p>
   <p>
    Year’s Eve, and folks mops and brooms from what’s inside ’em, nobody
   </p>
   <p>
    took much notice. They went on to Lew-Everard, where they had summut to
   </p>
   <p>
    drink, and then on they vamped to Dree-armed Cross, and there they
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed to have parted, Retty striking across the water-meads as if for
   </p>
   <p>
    home, and Marian going on to the next village, where there’s another
   </p>
   <p>
    public-house. Nothing more was zeed or heard o’ Retty till the
   </p>
   <p>
    waterman, on his way home, noticed something by the Great Pool; ’twas
   </p>
   <p>
    her bonnet and shawl packed up. In the water he found her. He and
   </p>
   <p>
    another man brought her home, thinking ’a was dead; but she fetched
   </p>
   <p>
    round by degrees.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel, suddenly recollecting that Tess was overhearing this gloomy
   </p>
   <p>
    tale, went to shut the door between the passage and the ante-room to
   </p>
   <p>
    the inner parlour where she was; but his wife, flinging a shawl round
   </p>
   <p>
    her, had come to the outer room and was listening to the man’s
   </p>
   <p>
    narrative, her eyes resting absently on the luggage and the drops of
   </p>
   <p>
    rain glistening upon it.
   </p>
   <p>
    “And, more than this, there’s Marian; she’s been found dead drunk by
   </p>
   <p>
    the withy-bed—a girl who hev never been known to touch anything before
   </p>
   <p>
    except shilling ale; though, to be sure, ’a was always a good
   </p>
   <p>
    trencher-woman, as her face showed. It seems as if the maids had all
   </p>
   <p>
    gone out o’ their minds!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And Izz?” asked Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Izz is about house as usual; but ’a do say ’a can guess how it
   </p>
   <p>
    happened; and she seems to be very low in mind about it, poor maid, as
   </p>
   <p>
    well she mid be. And so you see, sir, as all this happened just when we
   </p>
   <p>
    was packing your few traps and your Mis’ess’s night-rail and dressing
   </p>
   <p>
    things into the cart, why, it belated me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes. Well, Jonathan, will you get the trunks upstairs, and drink a cup
   </p>
   <p>
    of ale, and hasten back as soon as you can, in case you should be
   </p>
   <p>
    wanted?”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess had gone back to the inner parlour, and sat down by the fire,
   </p>
   <p>
    looking wistfully into it. She heard Jonathan Kail’s heavy footsteps up
   </p>
   <p>
    and down the stairs till he had done placing the luggage, and heard him
   </p>
   <p>
    express his thanks for the ale her husband took out to him, and for the
   </p>
   <p>
    gratuity he received. Jonathan’s footsteps then died from the door, and
   </p>
   <p>
    his cart creaked away.
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel slid forward the massive oak bar which secured the door, and
   </p>
   <p>
    coming in to where she sat over the hearth, pressed her cheeks between
   </p>
   <p>
    his hands from behind. He expected her to jump up gaily and unpack the
   </p>
   <p>
    toilet-gear that she had been so anxious about, but as she did not rise
   </p>
   <p>
    he sat down with her in the firelight, the candles on the supper-table
   </p>
   <p>
    being too thin and glimmering to interfere with its glow.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am so sorry you should have heard this sad story about the girls,”
   </p>
   <p>
    he said. “Still, don’t let it depress you. Retty was naturally morbid,
   </p>
   <p>
    you know.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Without the least cause,” said Tess. “While they who have cause to be,
   </p>
   <p>
    hide it, and pretend they are not.”
   </p>
   <p>
    This incident had turned the scale for her. They were simple and
   </p>
   <p>
    innocent girls on whom the unhappiness of unrequited love had fallen;
   </p>
   <p>
    they had deserved better at the hands of Fate. She had deserved
   </p>
   <p>
    worse—yet she was the chosen one. It was wicked of her to take all
   </p>
   <p>
    without paying. She would pay to the uttermost farthing; she would
   </p>
   <p>
    tell, there and then. This final determination she came to when she
   </p>
   <p>
    looked into the fire, he holding her hand.
   </p>
   <p>
    A steady glare from the now flameless embers painted the sides and back
   </p>
   <p>
    of the fireplace with its colour, and the well-polished andirons, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the old brass tongs that would not meet. The underside of the
   </p>
   <p>
    mantel-shelf was flushed with the high-coloured light, and the legs of
   </p>
   <p>
    the table nearest the fire. Tess’s face and neck reflected the same
   </p>
   <p>
    warmth, which each gem turned into an Aldebaran or a Sirius—a
   </p>
   <p>
    constellation of white, red, and green flashes, that interchanged their
   </p>
   <p>
    hues with her every pulsation.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Do you remember what we said to each other this morning about telling
   </p>
   <p>
    our faults?” he asked abruptly, finding that she still remained
   </p>
   <p>
    immovable. “We spoke lightly perhaps, and you may well have done so.
   </p>
   <p>
    But for me it was no light promise. I want to make a confession to you,
   </p>
   <p>
    Love.”
   </p>
   <p>
    This, from him, so unexpectedly apposite, had the effect upon her of a
   </p>
   <p>
    Providential interposition.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You have to confess something?” she said quickly, and even with
   </p>
   <p>
    gladness and relief.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You did not expect it? Ah—you thought too highly of me. Now listen.
   </p>
   <p>
    Put your head there, because I want you to forgive me, and not to be
   </p>
   <p>
    indignant with me for not telling you before, as perhaps I ought to
   </p>
   <p>
    have done.”
   </p>
   <p>
    How strange it was! He seemed to be her double. She did not speak, and
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare went on—
   </p>
   <p>
    “I did not mention it because I was afraid of endangering my chance of
   </p>
   <p>
    you, darling, the great prize of my life—my Fellowship I call you. My
   </p>
   <p>
    brother’s Fellowship was won at his college, mine at Talbothays Dairy.
   </p>
   <p>
    Well, I would not risk it. I was going to tell you a month ago—at the
   </p>
   <p>
    time you agreed to be mine, but I could not; I thought it might
   </p>
   <p>
    frighten you away from me. I put it off; then I thought I would tell
   </p>
   <p>
    you yesterday, to give you a chance at least of escaping me. But I did
   </p>
   <p>
    not. And I did not this morning, when you proposed our confessing our
   </p>
   <p>
    faults on the landing—the sinner that I was! But I must, now I see you
   </p>
   <p>
    sitting there so solemnly. I wonder if you will forgive me?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O yes! I am sure that—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, I hope so. But wait a minute. You don’t know. To begin at the
   </p>
   <p>
    beginning. Though I imagine my poor father fears that I am one of the
   </p>
   <p>
    eternally lost for my doctrines, I am of course, a believer in good
   </p>
   <p>
    morals, Tess, as much as you. I used to wish to be a teacher of men,
   </p>
   <p>
    and it was a great disappointment to me when I found I could not enter
   </p>
   <p>
    the Church. I admired spotlessness, even though I could lay no claim to
   </p>
   <p>
    it, and hated impurity, as I hope I do now. Whatever one may think of
   </p>
   <p>
    plenary inspiration, one must heartily subscribe to these words of
   </p>
   <p>
    Paul: ‘Be thou an example—in word, in conversation, in charity, in
   </p>
   <p>
    spirit, in faith, in purity.’ It is the only safeguard for us poor
   </p>
   <p>
    human beings. ‘_Integer vitae_,’ says a Roman poet, who is strange
   </p>
   <p>
    company for St Paul—
   </p>
   <p>
    The man of upright life, from frailties free,
   </p>
   <p>
    Stands not in need of Moorish spear or bow.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, a certain place is paved with good intentions, and having felt
   </p>
   <p>
    all that so strongly, you will see what a terrible remorse it bred in
   </p>
   <p>
    me when, in the midst of my fine aims for other people, I myself fell.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He then told her of that time of his life to which allusion has been
   </p>
   <p>
    made when, tossed about by doubts and difficulties in London, like a
   </p>
   <p>
    cork on the waves, he plunged into eight-and-forty hours’ dissipation
   </p>
   <p>
    with a stranger.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Happily I awoke almost immediately to a sense of my folly,” he
   </p>
   <p>
    continued. “I would have no more to say to her, and I came home. I have
   </p>
   <p>
    never repeated the offence. But I felt I should like to treat you with
   </p>
   <p>
    perfect frankness and honour, and I could not do so without telling
   </p>
   <p>
    this. Do you forgive me?”
   </p>
   <p>
    She pressed his hand tightly for an answer.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Then we will dismiss it at once and for ever!—too painful as it is for
   </p>
   <p>
    the occasion—and talk of something lighter.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O, Angel—I am almost glad—because now _you_ can forgive _me_! I have
   </p>
   <p>
    not made my confession. I have a confession, too—remember, I said so.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah, to be sure! Now then for it, wicked little one.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Perhaps, although you smile, it is as serious as yours, or more so.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It can hardly be more serious, dearest.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It cannot—O no, it cannot!” She jumped up joyfully at the hope. “No,
   </p>
   <p>
    it cannot be more serious, certainly,” she cried, “because ’tis just
   </p>
   <p>
    the same! I will tell you now.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She sat down again.
   </p>
   <p>
    Their hands were still joined. The ashes under the grate were lit by
   </p>
   <p>
    the fire vertically, like a torrid waste. Imagination might have beheld
   </p>
   <p>
    a Last Day luridness in this red-coaled glow, which fell on his face
   </p>
   <p>
    and hand, and on hers, peering into the loose hair about her brow, and
   </p>
   <p>
    firing the delicate skin underneath. A large shadow of her shape rose
   </p>
   <p>
    upon the wall and ceiling. She bent forward, at which each diamond on
   </p>
   <p>
    her neck gave a sinister wink like a toad’s; and pressing her forehead
   </p>
   <p>
    against his temple she entered on her story of her acquaintance with
   </p>
   <p>
    Alec d’Urberville and its results, murmuring the words without
   </p>
   <p>
    flinching, and with her eyelids drooping down.
   </p>
   <p>
    End of Phase the Fourth
   </p>
   <p>
    Phase the Fifth:
   </p>
   <p>
    The Woman Pays
   </p>
   <p>
    XXXV
   </p>
   <p>
    Her narrative ended; even its re-assertions and secondary explanations
   </p>
   <p>
    were done. Tess’s voice throughout had hardly risen higher than its
   </p>
   <p>
    opening tone; there had been no exculpatory phrase of any kind, and she
   </p>
   <p>
    had not wept.
   </p>
   <p>
    But the complexion even of external things seemed to suffer
   </p>
   <p>
    transmutation as her announcement progressed. The fire in the grate
   </p>
   <p>
    looked impish—demoniacally funny, as if it did not care in the least
   </p>
   <p>
    about her strait. The fender grinned idly, as if it too did not care.
   </p>
   <p>
    The light from the water-bottle was merely engaged in a chromatic
   </p>
   <p>
    problem. All material objects around announced their irresponsibility
   </p>
   <p>
    with terrible iteration. And yet nothing had changed since the moments
   </p>
   <p>
    when he had been kissing her; or rather, nothing in the substance of
   </p>
   <p>
    things. But the essence of things had changed.
   </p>
   <p>
    When she ceased, the auricular impressions from their previous
   </p>
   <p>
    endearments seemed to hustle away into the corner of their brains,
   </p>
   <p>
    repeating themselves as echoes from a time of supremely purblind
   </p>
   <p>
    foolishness.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare performed the irrelevant act of stirring the fire; the
   </p>
   <p>
    intelligence had not even yet got to the bottom of him. After stirring
   </p>
   <p>
    the embers he rose to his feet; all the force of her disclosure had
   </p>
   <p>
    imparted itself now. His face had withered. In the strenuousness of his
   </p>
   <p>
    concentration he treadled fitfully on the floor. He could not, by any
   </p>
   <p>
    contrivance, think closely enough; that was the meaning of his vague
   </p>
   <p>
    movement. When he spoke it was in the most inadequate, commonplace
   </p>
   <p>
    voice of the many varied tones she had heard from him.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tess!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, dearest.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Am I to believe this? From your manner I am to take it as true. O you
   </p>
   <p>
    cannot be out of your mind! You ought to be! Yet you are not... My
   </p>
   <p>
    wife, my Tess—nothing in you warrants such a supposition as that?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am not out of my mind,” she said.
   </p>
   <p>
    “And yet—” He looked vacantly at her, to resume with dazed senses: “Why
   </p>
   <p>
    didn’t you tell me before? Ah, yes, you would have told me, in a
   </p>
   <p>
    way—but I hindered you, I remember!”
   </p>
   <p>
    These and other of his words were nothing but the perfunctory babble of
   </p>
   <p>
    the surface while the depths remained paralyzed. He turned away, and
   </p>
   <p>
    bent over a chair. Tess followed him to the middle of the room, where
   </p>
   <p>
    he was, and stood there staring at him with eyes that did not weep.
   </p>
   <p>
    Presently she slid down upon her knees beside his foot, and from this
   </p>
   <p>
    position she crouched in a heap.
   </p>
   <p>
    “In the name of our love, forgive me!” she whispered with a dry mouth.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I have forgiven you for the same!”
   </p>
   <p>
    And, as he did not answer, she said again—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Forgive me as you are forgiven! _I_ forgive _you_, Angel.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You—yes, you do.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But you do not forgive me?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O Tess, forgiveness does not apply to the case! You were one person;
   </p>
   <p>
    now you are another. My God—how can forgiveness meet such a
   </p>
   <p>
    grotesque—prestidigitation as that!”
   </p>
   <p>
    He paused, contemplating this definition; then suddenly broke into
   </p>
   <p>
    horrible laughter—as unnatural and ghastly as a laugh in hell.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Don’t—don’t! It kills me quite, that!” she shrieked. “O have mercy
   </p>
   <p>
    upon me—have mercy!”
   </p>
   <p>
    He did not answer; and, sickly white, she jumped up.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Angel, Angel! what do you mean by that laugh?” she cried out. “Do you
   </p>
   <p>
    know what this is to me?”
   </p>
   <p>
    He shook his head.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I have been hoping, longing, praying, to make you happy! I have
   </p>
   <p>
    thought what joy it will be to do it, what an unworthy wife I shall be
   </p>
   <p>
    if I do not! That’s what I have felt, Angel!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I know that.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I thought, Angel, that you loved me—me, my very self! If it is I you
   </p>
   <p>
    do love, O how can it be that you look and speak so? It frightens me!
   </p>
   <p>
    Having begun to love you, I love you for ever—in all changes, in all
   </p>
   <p>
    disgraces, because you are yourself. I ask no more. Then how can you, O
   </p>
   <p>
    my own husband, stop loving me?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I repeat, the woman I have been loving is not you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But who?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Another woman in your shape.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She perceived in his words the realization of her own apprehensive
   </p>
   <p>
    foreboding in former times. He looked upon her as a species of
   </p>
   <p>
    imposter; a guilty woman in the guise of an innocent one. Terror was
   </p>
   <p>
    upon her white face as she saw it; her cheek was flaccid, and her mouth
   </p>
   <p>
    had almost the aspect of a round little hole. The horrible sense of his
   </p>
   <p>
    view of her so deadened her that she staggered, and he stepped forward,
   </p>
   <p>
    thinking she was going to fall.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Sit down, sit down,” he said gently. “You are ill; and it is natural
   </p>
   <p>
    that you should be.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She did sit down, without knowing where she was, that strained look
   </p>
   <p>
    still upon her face, and her eyes such as to make his flesh creep.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t belong to you any more, then; do I, Angel?” she asked
   </p>
   <p>
    helplessly. “It is not me, but another woman like me that he loved, he
   </p>
   <p>
    says.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The image raised caused her to take pity upon herself as one who was
   </p>
   <p>
    ill-used. Her eyes filled as she regarded her position further; she
   </p>
   <p>
    turned round and burst into a flood of self-sympathetic tears.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare was relieved at this change, for the effect on her of what had
   </p>
   <p>
    happened was beginning to be a trouble to him only less than the woe of
   </p>
   <p>
    the disclosure itself. He waited patiently, apathetically, till the
   </p>
   <p>
    violence of her grief had worn itself out, and her rush of weeping had
   </p>
   <p>
    lessened to a catching gasp at intervals.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Angel,” she said suddenly, in her natural tones, the insane, dry voice
   </p>
   <p>
    of terror having left her now. “Angel, am I too wicked for you and me
   </p>
   <p>
    to live together?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I have not been able to think what we can do.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I shan’t ask you to let me live with you, Angel, because I have no
   </p>
   <p>
    right to! I shall not write to mother and sisters to say we be married,
   </p>
   <p>
    as I said I would do; and I shan’t finish the good hussif I cut out and
   </p>
   <p>
    meant to make while we were in lodgings.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Shan’t you?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No, I shan’t do anything, unless you order me to; and if you go away
   </p>
   <p>
    from me I shall not follow ’ee; and if you never speak to me any more I
   </p>
   <p>
    shall not ask why, unless you tell me I may.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And if I order you to do anything?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I will obey you like your wretched slave, even if it is to lie down
   </p>
   <p>
    and die.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You are very good. But it strikes me that there is a want of harmony
   </p>
   <p>
    between your present mood of self-sacrifice and your past mood of
   </p>
   <p>
    self-preservation.”
   </p>
   <p>
    These were the first words of antagonism. To fling elaborate sarcasms
   </p>
   <p>
    at Tess, however, was much like flinging them at a dog or cat. The
   </p>
   <p>
    charms of their subtlety passed by her unappreciated, and she only
   </p>
   <p>
    received them as inimical sounds which meant that anger ruled. She
   </p>
   <p>
    remained mute, not knowing that he was smothering his affection for
   </p>
   <p>
    her. She hardly observed that a tear descended slowly upon his cheek, a
   </p>
   <p>
    tear so large that it magnified the pores of the skin over which it
   </p>
   <p>
    rolled, like the object lens of a microscope. Meanwhile reillumination
   </p>
   <p>
    as to the terrible and total change that her confession had wrought in
   </p>
   <p>
    his life, in his universe, returned to him, and he tried desperately to
   </p>
   <p>
    advance among the new conditions in which he stood. Some consequent
   </p>
   <p>
    action was necessary; yet what?
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tess,” he said, as gently as he could speak, “I cannot stay—in this
   </p>
   <p>
    room—just now. I will walk out a little way.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He quietly left the room, and the two glasses of wine that he had
   </p>
   <p>
    poured out for their supper—one for her, one for him—remained on the
   </p>
   <p>
    table untasted. This was what their _Agape_ had come to. At tea, two or
   </p>
   <p>
    three hours earlier, they had, in the freakishness of affection, drunk
   </p>
   <p>
    from one cup.
   </p>
   <p>
    The closing of the door behind him, gently as it had been pulled to,
   </p>
   <p>
    roused Tess from her stupor. He was gone; she could not stay. Hastily
   </p>
   <p>
    flinging her cloak around her she opened the door and followed, putting
   </p>
   <p>
    out the candles as if she were never coming back. The rain was over and
   </p>
   <p>
    the night was now clear.
   </p>
   <p>
    She was soon close at his heels, for Clare walked slowly and without
   </p>
   <p>
    purpose. His form beside her light gray figure looked black, sinister,
   </p>
   <p>
    and forbidding, and she felt as sarcasm the touch of the jewels of
   </p>
   <p>
    which she had been momentarily so proud. Clare turned at hearing her
   </p>
   <p>
    footsteps, but his recognition of her presence seemed to make no
   </p>
   <p>
    difference to him, and he went on over the five yawning arches of the
   </p>
   <p>
    great bridge in front of the house.
   </p>
   <p>
    The cow and horse tracks in the road were full of water, the rain
   </p>
   <p>
    having been enough to charge them, but not enough to wash them away.
   </p>
   <p>
    Across these minute pools the reflected stars flitted in a quick
   </p>
   <p>
    transit as she passed; she would not have known they were shining
   </p>
   <p>
    overhead if she had not seen them there—the vastest things of the
   </p>
   <p>
    universe imaged in objects so mean.
   </p>
   <p>
    The place to which they had travelled to-day was in the same valley as
   </p>
   <p>
    Talbothays, but some miles lower down the river; and the surroundings
   </p>
   <p>
    being open, she kept easily in sight of him. Away from the house the
   </p>
   <p>
    road wound through the meads, and along these she followed Clare
   </p>
   <p>
    without any attempt to come up with him or to attract him, but with
   </p>
   <p>
    dumb and vacant fidelity.
   </p>
   <p>
    At last, however, her listless walk brought her up alongside him, and
   </p>
   <p>
    still he said nothing. The cruelty of fooled honesty is often great
   </p>
   <p>
    after enlightenment, and it was mighty in Clare now. The outdoor air
   </p>
   <p>
    had apparently taken away from him all tendency to act on impulse; she
   </p>
   <p>
    knew that he saw her without irradiation—in all her bareness; that Time
   </p>
   <p>
    was chanting his satiric psalm at her then—
   </p>
   <p>
    Behold, when thy face is made bare, he that loved thee shall hate;
   </p>
   <p>
    Thy face shall be no more fair at the fall of thy fate. For thy
   </p>
   <p>
    life shall fall as a leaf and be shed as the rain; And the veil of
   </p>
   <p>
    thine head shall be grief, and the crown shall be pain.
   </p>
   <p>
    He was still intently thinking, and her companionship had now
   </p>
   <p>
    insufficient power to break or divert the strain of thought. What a
   </p>
   <p>
    weak thing her presence must have become to him! She could not help
   </p>
   <p>
    addressing Clare.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What have I done—what _have_ I done! I have not told of anything that
   </p>
   <p>
    interferes with or belies my love for you. You don’t think I planned
   </p>
   <p>
    it, do you? It is in your own mind what you are angry at, Angel; it is
   </p>
   <p>
    not in me. O, it is not in me, and I am not that deceitful woman you
   </p>
   <p>
    think me!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “H’m—well. Not deceitful, my wife; but not the same. No, not the same.
   </p>
   <p>
    But do not make me reproach you. I have sworn that I will not; and I
   </p>
   <p>
    will do everything to avoid it.”
   </p>
   <p>
    But she went on pleading in her distraction; and perhaps said things
   </p>
   <p>
    that would have been better left to silence.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Angel!—Angel! I was a child—a child when it happened! I knew nothing
   </p>
   <p>
    of men.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You were more sinned against than sinning, that I admit.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Then will you not forgive me?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I do forgive you, but forgiveness is not all.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And love me?”
   </p>
   <p>
    To this question he did not answer.
   </p>
   <p>
    “O Angel—my mother says that it sometimes happens so!—she knows several
   </p>
   <p>
    cases where they were worse than I, and the husband has not minded it
   </p>
   <p>
    much—has got over it at least. And yet the woman had not loved him as I
   </p>
   <p>
    do you!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Don’t, Tess; don’t argue. Different societies, different manners. You
   </p>
   <p>
    almost make me say you are an unapprehending peasant woman, who have
   </p>
   <p>
    never been initiated into the proportions of social things. You don’t
   </p>
   <p>
    know what you say.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am only a peasant by position, not by nature!”
   </p>
   <p>
    She spoke with an impulse to anger, but it went as it came.
   </p>
   <p>
    “So much the worse for you. I think that parson who unearthed your
   </p>
   <p>
    pedigree would have done better if he had held his tongue. I cannot
   </p>
   <p>
    help associating your decline as a family with this other fact—of your
   </p>
   <p>
    want of firmness. Decrepit families imply decrepit wills, decrepit
   </p>
   <p>
    conduct. Heaven, why did you give me a handle for despising you more by
   </p>
   <p>
    informing me of your descent! Here was I thinking you a new-sprung
   </p>
   <p>
    child of nature; there were you, the belated seedling of an effete
   </p>
   <p>
    aristocracy!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Lots of families are as bad as mine in that! Retty’s family were once
   </p>
   <p>
    large landowners, and so were Dairyman Billett’s. And the Debbyhouses,
   </p>
   <p>
    who now are carters, were once the De Bayeux family. You find such as I
   </p>
   <p>
    everywhere; ’tis a feature of our county, and I can’t help it.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “So much the worse for the county.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She took these reproaches in their bulk simply, not in their
   </p>
   <p>
    particulars; he did not love her as he had loved her hitherto, and to
   </p>
   <p>
    all else she was indifferent.
   </p>
   <p>
    They wandered on again in silence. It was said afterwards that a
   </p>
   <p>
    cottager of Wellbridge, who went out late that night for a doctor, met
   </p>
   <p>
    two lovers in the pastures, walking very slowly, without converse, one
   </p>
   <p>
    behind the other, as in a funeral procession, and the glimpse that he
   </p>
   <p>
    obtained of their faces seemed to denote that they were anxious and
   </p>
   <p>
    sad. Returning later, he passed them again in the same field,
   </p>
   <p>
    progressing just as slowly, and as regardless of the hour and of the
   </p>
   <p>
    cheerless night as before. It was only on account of his preoccupation
   </p>
   <p>
    with his own affairs, and the illness in his house, that he did not
   </p>
   <p>
    bear in mind the curious incident, which, however, he recalled a long
   </p>
   <p>
    while after.
   </p>
   <p>
    During the interval of the cottager’s going and coming, she had said to
   </p>
   <p>
    her husband—
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t see how I can help being the cause of much misery to you all
   </p>
   <p>
    your life. The river is down there. I can put an end to myself in it. I
   </p>
   <p>
    am not afraid.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t wish to add murder to my other follies,” he said.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I will leave something to show that I did it myself—on account of my
   </p>
   <p>
    shame. They will not blame you then.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Don’t speak so absurdly—I wish not to hear it. It is nonsense to have
   </p>
   <p>
    such thoughts in this kind of case, which is rather one for satirical
   </p>
   <p>
    laughter than for tragedy. You don’t in the least understand the
   </p>
   <p>
    quality of the mishap. It would be viewed in the light of a joke by
   </p>
   <p>
    nine-tenths of the world if it were known. Please oblige me by
   </p>
   <p>
    returning to the house, and going to bed.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I will,” said she dutifully.
   </p>
   <p>
    They had rambled round by a road which led to the well-known ruins of
   </p>
   <p>
    the Cistercian abbey behind the mill, the latter having, in centuries
   </p>
   <p>
    past, been attached to the monastic establishment. The mill still
   </p>
   <p>
    worked on, food being a perennial necessity; the abbey had perished,
   </p>
   <p>
    creeds being transient. One continually sees the ministration of the
   </p>
   <p>
    temporary outlasting the ministration of the eternal. Their walk having
   </p>
   <p>
    been circuitous, they were still not far from the house, and in obeying
   </p>
   <p>
    his direction she only had to reach the large stone bridge across the
   </p>
   <p>
    main river and follow the road for a few yards. When she got back,
   </p>
   <p>
    everything remained as she had left it, the fire being still burning.
   </p>
   <p>
    She did not stay downstairs for more than a minute, but proceeded to
   </p>
   <p>
    her chamber, whither the luggage had been taken. Here she sat down on
   </p>
   <p>
    the edge of the bed, looking blankly around, and presently began to
   </p>
   <p>
    undress. In removing the light towards the bedstead its rays fell upon
   </p>
   <p>
    the tester of white dimity; something was hanging beneath it, and she
   </p>
   <p>
    lifted the candle to see what it was. A bough of mistletoe. Angel had
   </p>
   <p>
    put it there; she knew that in an instant. This was the explanation of
   </p>
   <p>
    that mysterious parcel which it had been so difficult to pack and
   </p>
   <p>
    bring; whose contents he would not explain to her, saying that time
   </p>
   <p>
    would soon show her the purpose thereof. In his zest and his gaiety he
   </p>
   <p>
    had hung it there. How foolish and inopportune that mistletoe looked
   </p>
   <p>
    now.
   </p>
   <p>
    Having nothing more to fear, having scarce anything to hope, for that
   </p>
   <p>
    he would relent there seemed no promise whatever, she lay down dully.
   </p>
   <p>
    When sorrow ceases to be speculative, sleep sees her opportunity. Among
   </p>
   <p>
    so many happier moods which forbid repose this was a mood which
   </p>
   <p>
    welcomed it, and in a few minutes the lonely Tess forgot existence,
   </p>
   <p>
    surrounded by the aromatic stillness of the chamber that had once,
   </p>
   <p>
    possibly, been the bride-chamber of her own ancestry.
   </p>
   <p>
    Later on that night Clare also retraced his steps to the house.
   </p>
   <p>
    Entering softly to the sitting-room he obtained a light, and with the
   </p>
   <p>
    manner of one who had considered his course he spread his rugs upon the
   </p>
   <p>
    old horse-hair sofa which stood there, and roughly shaped it to a
   </p>
   <p>
    sleeping-couch. Before lying down he crept shoeless upstairs, and
   </p>
   <p>
    listened at the door of her apartment. Her measured breathing told that
   </p>
   <p>
    she was sleeping profoundly.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Thank God!” murmured Clare; and yet he was conscious of a pang of
   </p>
   <p>
    bitterness at the thought—approximately true, though not wholly so—that
   </p>
   <p>
    having shifted the burden of her life to his shoulders, she was now
   </p>
   <p>
    reposing without care.
   </p>
   <p>
    He turned away to descend; then, irresolute, faced round to her door
   </p>
   <p>
    again. In the act he caught sight of one of the d’Urberville dames,
   </p>
   <p>
    whose portrait was immediately over the entrance to Tess’s bedchamber.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the candlelight the painting was more than unpleasant. Sinister
   </p>
   <p>
    design lurked in the woman’s features, a concentrated purpose of
   </p>
   <p>
    revenge on the other sex—so it seemed to him then. The Caroline bodice
   </p>
   <p>
    of the portrait was low—precisely as Tess’s had been when he tucked it
   </p>
   <p>
    in to show the necklace; and again he experienced the distressing
   </p>
   <p>
    sensation of a resemblance between them.
   </p>
   <p>
    The check was sufficient. He resumed his retreat and descended.
   </p>
   <p>
    His air remained calm and cold, his small compressed mouth indexing his
   </p>
   <p>
    powers of self-control; his face wearing still that terrible sterile
   </p>
   <p>
    expression which had spread thereon since her disclosure. It was the
   </p>
   <p>
    face of a man who was no longer passion’s slave, yet who found no
   </p>
   <p>
    advantage in his enfranchisement. He was simply regarding the harrowing
   </p>
   <p>
    contingencies of human experience, the unexpectedness of things.
   </p>
   <p>
    Nothing so pure, so sweet, so virginal as Tess had seemed possible all
   </p>
   <p>
    the long while that he had adored her, up to an hour ago; but
   </p>
   <p>
    The little less, and what worlds away!
   </p>
   <p>
    He argued erroneously when he said to himself that her heart was not
   </p>
   <p>
    indexed in the honest freshness of her face; but Tess had no advocate
   </p>
   <p>
    to set him right. Could it be possible, he continued, that eyes which
   </p>
   <p>
    as they gazed never expressed any divergence from what the tongue was
   </p>
   <p>
    telling, were yet ever seeing another world behind her ostensible one,
   </p>
   <p>
    discordant and contrasting?
   </p>
   <p>
    He reclined on his couch in the sitting-room, and extinguished the
   </p>
   <p>
    light. The night came in, and took up its place there, unconcerned and
   </p>
   <p>
    indifferent; the night which had already swallowed up his happiness,
   </p>
   <p>
    and was now digesting it listlessly; and was ready to swallow up the
   </p>
   <p>
    happiness of a thousand other people with as little disturbance or
   </p>
   <p>
    change of mien.
   </p>
   <p>
    XXXVI
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare arose in the light of a dawn that was ashy and furtive, as though
   </p>
   <p>
    associated with crime. The fireplace confronted him with its extinct
   </p>
   <p>
    embers; the spread supper-table, whereon stood the two full glasses of
   </p>
   <p>
    untasted wine, now flat and filmy; her vacated seat and his own; the
   </p>
   <p>
    other articles of furniture, with their eternal look of not being able
   </p>
   <p>
    to help it, their intolerable inquiry what was to be done? From above
   </p>
   <p>
    there was no sound; but in a few minutes there came a knock at the
   </p>
   <p>
    door. He remembered that it would be the neighbouring cottager’s wife,
   </p>
   <p>
    who was to minister to their wants while they remained here.
   </p>
   <p>
    The presence of a third person in the house would be extremely awkward
   </p>
   <p>
    just now, and, being already dressed, he opened the window and informed
   </p>
   <p>
    her that they could manage to shift for themselves that morning. She
   </p>
   <p>
    had a milk-can in her hand, which he told her to leave at the door.
   </p>
   <p>
    When the dame had gone away he searched in the back quarters of the
   </p>
   <p>
    house for fuel, and speedily lit a fire. There was plenty of eggs,
   </p>
   <p>
    butter, bread, and so on in the larder, and Clare soon had breakfast
   </p>
   <p>
    laid, his experiences at the dairy having rendered him facile in
   </p>
   <p>
    domestic preparations. The smoke of the kindled wood rose from the
   </p>
   <p>
    chimney without like a lotus-headed column; local people who were
   </p>
   <p>
    passing by saw it, and thought of the newly-married couple, and envied
   </p>
   <p>
    their happiness.
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel cast a final glance round, and then going to the foot of the
   </p>
   <p>
    stairs, called in a conventional voice—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Breakfast is ready!”
   </p>
   <p>
    He opened the front door, and took a few steps in the morning air.
   </p>
   <p>
    When, after a short space, he came back she was already in the
   </p>
   <p>
    sitting-room mechanically readjusting the breakfast things. As she was
   </p>
   <p>
    fully attired, and the interval since his calling her had been but two
   </p>
   <p>
    or three minutes, she must have been dressed or nearly so before he
   </p>
   <p>
    went to summon her. Her hair was twisted up in a large round mass at
   </p>
   <p>
    the back of her head, and she had put on one of the new frocks—a pale
   </p>
   <p>
    blue woollen garment with neck-frillings of white. Her hands and face
   </p>
   <p>
    appeared to be cold, and she had possibly been sitting dressed in the
   </p>
   <p>
    bedroom a long time without any fire. The marked civility of Clare’s
   </p>
   <p>
    tone in calling her seemed to have inspired her, for the moment, with a
   </p>
   <p>
    new glimmer of hope. But it soon died when she looked at him.
   </p>
   <p>
    The pair were, in truth, but the ashes of their former fires. To the
   </p>
   <p>
    hot sorrow of the previous night had succeeded heaviness; it seemed as
   </p>
   <p>
    if nothing could kindle either of them to fervour of sensation any
   </p>
   <p>
    more.
   </p>
   <p>
    He spoke gently to her, and she replied with a like
   </p>
   <p>
    undemonstrativeness. At last she came up to him, looking in his
   </p>
   <p>
    sharply-defined face as one who had no consciousness that her own
   </p>
   <p>
    formed a visible object also.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Angel!” she said, and paused, touching him with her fingers lightly as
   </p>
   <p>
    a breeze, as though she could hardly believe to be there in the flesh
   </p>
   <p>
    the man who was once her lover. Her eyes were bright, her pale cheek
   </p>
   <p>
    still showed its wonted roundness, though half-dried tears had left
   </p>
   <p>
    glistening traces thereon; and the usually ripe red mouth was almost as
   </p>
   <p>
    pale as her cheek. Throbbingly alive as she was still, under the stress
   </p>
   <p>
    of her mental grief the life beat so brokenly that a little further
   </p>
   <p>
    pull upon it would cause real illness, dull her characteristic eyes,
   </p>
   <p>
    and make her mouth thin.
   </p>
   <p>
    She looked absolutely pure. Nature, in her fantastic trickery, had set
   </p>
   <p>
    such a seal of maidenhood upon Tess’s countenance that he gazed at her
   </p>
   <p>
    with a stupefied air.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tess! Say it is not true! No, it is not true!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It is true.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Every word?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Every word.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He looked at her imploringly, as if he would willingly have taken a lie
   </p>
   <p>
    from her lips, knowing it to be one, and have made of it, by some sort
   </p>
   <p>
    of sophistry, a valid denial. However, she only repeated—
   </p>
   <p>
    “It is true.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Is he living?” Angel then asked.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The baby died.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But the man?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “He is alive.”
   </p>
   <p>
    A last despair passed over Clare’s face.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Is he in England?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He took a few vague steps.
   </p>
   <p>
    “My position—is this,” he said abruptly. “I thought—any man would have
   </p>
   <p>
    thought—that by giving up all ambition to win a wife with social
   </p>
   <p>
    standing, with fortune, with knowledge of the world, I should secure
   </p>
   <p>
    rustic innocence as surely as I should secure pink cheeks; but—However,
   </p>
   <p>
    I am no man to reproach you, and I will not.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess felt his position so entirely that the remainder had not been
   </p>
   <p>
    needed. Therein lay just the distress of it; she saw that he had lost
   </p>
   <p>
    all round.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Angel—I should not have let it go on to marriage with you if I had not
   </p>
   <p>
    known that, after all, there was a last way out of it for you; though I
   </p>
   <p>
    hoped you would never—”
   </p>
   <p>
    Her voice grew husky.
   </p>
   <p>
    “A last way?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I mean, to get rid of me. You _can_ get rid of me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “How?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “By divorcing me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Good heavens—how can you be so simple! How can I divorce you?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Can’t you—now I have told you? I thought my confession would give you
   </p>
   <p>
    grounds for that.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O Tess—you are too, too—childish—unformed—crude, I suppose! I don’t
   </p>
   <p>
    know what you are. You don’t understand the law—you don’t understand!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “What—you cannot?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Indeed I cannot.”
   </p>
   <p>
    A quick shame mixed with the misery upon his listener’s face.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I thought—I thought,” she whispered. “O, now I see how wicked I seem
   </p>
   <p>
    to you! Believe me—believe me, on my soul, I never thought but that you
   </p>
   <p>
    could! I hoped you would not; yet I believed, without a doubt, that you
   </p>
   <p>
    could cast me off if you were determined, and didn’t love me
   </p>
   <p>
    at—at—all!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You were mistaken,” he said.
   </p>
   <p>
    “O, then I ought to have done it, to have done it last night! But I
   </p>
   <p>
    hadn’t the courage. That’s just like me!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “The courage to do what?”
   </p>
   <p>
    As she did not answer he took her by the hand.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What were you thinking of doing?” he inquired.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Of putting an end to myself.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “When?”
   </p>
   <p>
    She writhed under this inquisitorial manner of his. “Last night,” she
   </p>
   <p>
    answered.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Where?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Under your mistletoe.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “My good—! How?” he asked sternly.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’ll tell you, if you won’t be angry with me!” she said, shrinking.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It was with the cord of my box. But I could not—do the last thing! I
   </p>
   <p>
    was afraid that it might cause a scandal to your name.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The unexpected quality of this confession, wrung from her, and not
   </p>
   <p>
    volunteered, shook him perceptibly. But he still held her, and, letting
   </p>
   <p>
    his glance fall from her face downwards, he said, “Now, listen to this.
   </p>
   <p>
    You must not dare to think of such a horrible thing! How could you! You
   </p>
   <p>
    will promise me as your husband to attempt that no more.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am ready to promise. I saw how wicked it was.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Wicked! The idea was unworthy of you beyond description.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But, Angel,” she pleaded, enlarging her eyes in calm unconcern upon
   </p>
   <p>
    him, “it was thought of entirely on your account—to set you free
   </p>
   <p>
    without the scandal of the divorce that I thought you would have to
   </p>
   <p>
    get. I should never have dreamt of doing it on mine. However, to do it
   </p>
   <p>
    with my own hand is too good for me, after all. It is you, my ruined
   </p>
   <p>
    husband, who ought to strike the blow. I think I should love you more,
   </p>
   <p>
    if that were possible, if you could bring yourself to do it, since
   </p>
   <p>
    there’s no other way of escape for ’ee. I feel I am so utterly
   </p>
   <p>
    worthless! So very greatly in the way!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ssh!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, since you say no, I won’t. I have no wish opposed to yours.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He knew this to be true enough. Since the desperation of the night her
   </p>
   <p>
    activities had dropped to zero, and there was no further rashness to be
   </p>
   <p>
    feared.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess tried to busy herself again over the breakfast-table with more or
   </p>
   <p>
    less success, and they sat down both on the same side, so that their
   </p>
   <p>
    glances did not meet. There was at first something awkward in hearing
   </p>
   <p>
    each other eat and drink, but this could not be escaped; moreover, the
   </p>
   <p>
    amount of eating done was small on both sides. Breakfast over, he rose,
   </p>
   <p>
    and telling her the hour at which he might be expected to dinner, went
   </p>
   <p>
    off to the miller’s in a mechanical pursuance of the plan of studying
   </p>
   <p>
    that business, which had been his only practical reason for coming
   </p>
   <p>
    here.
   </p>
   <p>
    When he was gone Tess stood at the window, and presently saw his form
   </p>
   <p>
    crossing the great stone bridge which conducted to the mill premises.
   </p>
   <p>
    He sank behind it, crossed the railway beyond, and disappeared. Then,
   </p>
   <p>
    without a sigh, she turned her attention to the room, and began
   </p>
   <p>
    clearing the table and setting it in order.
   </p>
   <p>
    The charwoman soon came. Her presence was at first a strain upon Tess,
   </p>
   <p>
    but afterwards an alleviation. At half-past twelve she left her
   </p>
   <p>
    assistant alone in the kitchen, and, returning to the sitting-room,
   </p>
   <p>
    waited for the reappearance of Angel’s form behind the bridge.
   </p>
   <p>
    About one he showed himself. Her face flushed, although he was a
   </p>
   <p>
    quarter of a mile off. She ran to the kitchen to get the dinner served
   </p>
   <p>
    by the time he should enter. He went first to the room where they had
   </p>
   <p>
    washed their hands together the day before, and as he entered the
   </p>
   <p>
    sitting-room the dish-covers rose from the dishes as if by his own
   </p>
   <p>
    motion.
   </p>
   <p>
    “How punctual!” he said.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes. I saw you coming over the bridge,” said she.
   </p>
   <p>
    The meal was passed in commonplace talk of what he had been doing
   </p>
   <p>
    during the morning at the Abbey Mill, of the methods of bolting and the
   </p>
   <p>
    old-fashioned machinery, which he feared would not enlighten him
   </p>
   <p>
    greatly on modern improved methods, some of it seeming to have been in
   </p>
   <p>
    use ever since the days it ground for the monks in the adjoining
   </p>
   <p>
    conventual buildings—now a heap of ruins. He left the house again in
   </p>
   <p>
    the course of an hour, coming home at dusk, and occupying himself
   </p>
   <p>
    through the evening with his papers. She feared she was in the way and,
   </p>
   <p>
    when the old woman was gone, retired to the kitchen, where she made
   </p>
   <p>
    herself busy as well as she could for more than an hour.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare’s shape appeared at the door. “You must not work like this,” he
   </p>
   <p>
    said. “You are not my servant; you are my wife.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She raised her eyes, and brightened somewhat. “I may think myself
   </p>
   <p>
    that—indeed?” she murmured, in piteous raillery. “You mean in name!
   </p>
   <p>
    Well, I don’t want to be anything more.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You _may_ think so, Tess! You are. What do you mean?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t know,” she said hastily, with tears in her accents. “I thought
   </p>
   <p>
    I—because I am not respectable, I mean. I told you I thought I was not
   </p>
   <p>
    respectable enough long ago—and on that account I didn’t want to marry
   </p>
   <p>
    you, only—only you urged me!”
   </p>
   <p>
    She broke into sobs, and turned her back to him. It would almost have
   </p>
   <p>
    won round any man but Angel Clare. Within the remote depths of his
   </p>
   <p>
    constitution, so gentle and affectionate as he was in general, there
   </p>
   <p>
    lay hidden a hard logical deposit, like a vein of metal in a soft loam,
   </p>
   <p>
    which turned the edge of everything that attempted to traverse it. It
   </p>
   <p>
    had blocked his acceptance of the Church; it blocked his acceptance of
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess. Moreover, his affection itself was less fire than radiance, and,
   </p>
   <p>
    with regard to the other sex, when he ceased to believe he ceased to
   </p>
   <p>
    follow: contrasting in this with many impressionable natures, who
   </p>
   <p>
    remain sensuously infatuated with what they intellectually despise. He
   </p>
   <p>
    waited till her sobbing ceased.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I wish half the women in England were as respectable as you,” he said,
   </p>
   <p>
    in an ebullition of bitterness against womankind in general. “It isn’t
   </p>
   <p>
    a question of respectability, but one of principle!”
   </p>
   <p>
    He spoke such things as these and more of a kindred sort to her, being
   </p>
   <p>
    still swayed by the antipathetic wave which warps direct souls with
   </p>
   <p>
    such persistence when once their vision finds itself mocked by
   </p>
   <p>
    appearances. There was, it is true, underneath, a back current of
   </p>
   <p>
    sympathy through which a woman of the world might have conquered him.
   </p>
   <p>
    But Tess did not think of this; she took everything as her deserts, and
   </p>
   <p>
    hardly opened her mouth. The firmness of her devotion to him was indeed
   </p>
   <p>
    almost pitiful; quick-tempered as she naturally was, nothing that he
   </p>
   <p>
    could say made her unseemly; she sought not her own; was not provoked;
   </p>
   <p>
    thought no evil of his treatment of her. She might just now have been
   </p>
   <p>
    Apostolic Charity herself returned to a self-seeking modern world.
   </p>
   <p>
    This evening, night, and morning were passed precisely as the preceding
   </p>
   <p>
    ones had been passed. On one, and only one, occasion did she—the
   </p>
   <p>
    formerly free and independent Tess—venture to make any advances. It was
   </p>
   <p>
    on the third occasion of his starting after a meal to go out to the
   </p>
   <p>
    flour-mill. As he was leaving the table he said “Goodbye,” and she
   </p>
   <p>
    replied in the same words, at the same time inclining her mouth in the
   </p>
   <p>
    way of his. He did not avail himself of the invitation, saying, as he
   </p>
   <p>
    turned hastily aside—
   </p>
   <p>
    “I shall be home punctually.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess shrank into herself as if she had been struck. Often enough had he
   </p>
   <p>
    tried to reach those lips against her consent—often had he said gaily
   </p>
   <p>
    that her mouth and breath tasted of the butter and eggs and milk and
   </p>
   <p>
    honey on which she mainly lived, that he drew sustenance from them, and
   </p>
   <p>
    other follies of that sort. But he did not care for them now. He
   </p>
   <p>
    observed her sudden shrinking, and said gently—
   </p>
   <p>
    “You know, I have to think of a course. It was imperative that we
   </p>
   <p>
    should stay together a little while, to avoid the scandal to you that
   </p>
   <p>
    would have resulted from our immediate parting. But you must see it is
   </p>
   <p>
    only for form’s sake.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes,” said Tess absently.
   </p>
   <p>
    He went out, and on his way to the mill stood still, and wished for a
   </p>
   <p>
    moment that he had responded yet more kindly, and kissed her once at
   </p>
   <p>
    least.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus they lived through this despairing day or two; in the same house,
   </p>
   <p>
    truly; but more widely apart than before they were lovers. It was
   </p>
   <p>
    evident to her that he was, as he had said, living with paralyzed
   </p>
   <p>
    activities in his endeavour to think of a plan of procedure. She was
   </p>
   <p>
    awe-stricken to discover such determination under such apparent
   </p>
   <p>
    flexibility. His consistency was, indeed, too cruel. She no longer
   </p>
   <p>
    expected forgiveness now. More than once she thought of going away from
   </p>
   <p>
    him during his absence at the mill; but she feared that this, instead
   </p>
   <p>
    of benefiting him, might be the means of hampering and humiliating him
   </p>
   <p>
    yet more if it should become known.
   </p>
   <p>
    Meanwhile Clare was meditating, verily. His thought had been
   </p>
   <p>
    unsuspended; he was becoming ill with thinking; eaten out with
   </p>
   <p>
    thinking, withered by thinking; scourged out of all his former
   </p>
   <p>
    pulsating, flexuous domesticity. He walked about saying to himself,
   </p>
   <p>
    “What’s to be done—what’s to be done?” and by chance she overheard him.
   </p>
   <p>
    It caused her to break the reserve about their future which had
   </p>
   <p>
    hitherto prevailed.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I suppose—you are not going to live with me—long, are you, Angel?” she
   </p>
   <p>
    asked, the sunk corners of her mouth betraying how purely mechanical
   </p>
   <p>
    were the means by which she retained that expression of chastened calm
   </p>
   <p>
    upon her face.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I cannot” he said, “without despising myself, and what is worse,
   </p>
   <p>
    perhaps, despising you. I mean, of course, cannot live with you in the
   </p>
   <p>
    ordinary sense. At present, whatever I feel, I do not despise you. And,
   </p>
   <p>
    let me speak plainly, or you may not see all my difficulties. How can
   </p>
   <p>
    we live together while that man lives?—he being your husband in nature,
   </p>
   <p>
    and not I. If he were dead it might be different... Besides, that’s not
   </p>
   <p>
    all the difficulty; it lies in another consideration—one bearing upon
   </p>
   <p>
    the future of other people than ourselves. Think of years to come, and
   </p>
   <p>
    children being born to us, and this past matter getting known—for it
   </p>
   <p>
    must get known. There is not an uttermost part of the earth but
   </p>
   <p>
    somebody comes from it or goes to it from elsewhere. Well, think of
   </p>
   <p>
    wretches of our flesh and blood growing up under a taunt which they
   </p>
   <p>
    will gradually get to feel the full force of with their expanding
   </p>
   <p>
    years. What an awakening for them! What a prospect! Can you honestly
   </p>
   <p>
    say ‘Remain’ after contemplating this contingency? Don’t you think we
   </p>
   <p>
    had better endure the ills we have than fly to others?”
   </p>
   <p>
    Her eyelids, weighted with trouble, continued drooping as before.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I cannot say ‘Remain,’” she answered, “I cannot; I had not thought so
   </p>
   <p>
    far.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess’s feminine hope—shall we confess it?—had been so obstinately
   </p>
   <p>
    recuperative as to revive in her surreptitious visions of a domiciliary
   </p>
   <p>
    intimacy continued long enough to break down his coldness even against
   </p>
   <p>
    his judgement. Though unsophisticated in the usual sense, she was not
   </p>
   <p>
    incomplete; and it would have denoted deficiency of womanhood if she
   </p>
   <p>
    had not instinctively known what an argument lies in propinquity.
   </p>
   <p>
    Nothing else would serve her, she knew, if this failed. It was wrong to
   </p>
   <p>
    hope in what was of the nature of strategy, she said to herself: yet
   </p>
   <p>
    that sort of hope she could not extinguish. His last representation had
   </p>
   <p>
    now been made, and it was, as she said, a new view. She had truly never
   </p>
   <p>
    thought so far as that, and his lucid picture of possible offspring who
   </p>
   <p>
    would scorn her was one that brought deadly convictions to an honest
   </p>
   <p>
    heart which was humanitarian to its centre. Sheer experience had
   </p>
   <p>
    already taught her that in some circumstances there was one thing
   </p>
   <p>
    better than to lead a good life, and that was to be saved from leading
   </p>
   <p>
    any life whatever. Like all who have been previsioned by suffering, she
   </p>
   <p>
    could, in the words of M. Sully-Prudhomme, hear a penal sentence in the
   </p>
   <p>
    fiat, “You shall be born,” particularly if addressed to potential issue
   </p>
   <p>
    of hers.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet such is the vulpine slyness of Dame Nature, that, till now, Tess
   </p>
   <p>
    had been hoodwinked by her love for Clare into forgetting it might
   </p>
   <p>
    result in vitalizations that would inflict upon others what she had
   </p>
   <p>
    bewailed as misfortune to herself.
   </p>
   <p>
    She therefore could not withstand his argument. But with the
   </p>
   <p>
    self-combating proclivity of the supersensitive, an answer thereto
   </p>
   <p>
    arose in Clare’s own mind, and he almost feared it. It was based on her
   </p>
   <p>
    exceptional physical nature; and she might have used it promisingly.
   </p>
   <p>
    She might have added besides: “On an Australian upland or Texan plain,
   </p>
   <p>
    who is to know or care about my misfortunes, or to reproach me or you?”
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet, like the majority of women, she accepted the momentary presentment
   </p>
   <p>
    as if it were the inevitable. And she may have been right. The
   </p>
   <p>
    intuitive heart of woman knoweth not only its own bitterness, but its
   </p>
   <p>
    husband’s, and even if these assumed reproaches were not likely to be
   </p>
   <p>
    addressed to him or to his by strangers, they might have reached his
   </p>
   <p>
    ears from his own fastidious brain.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was the third day of the estrangement. Some might risk the odd
   </p>
   <p>
    paradox that with more animalism he would have been the nobler man. We
   </p>
   <p>
    do not say it. Yet Clare’s love was doubtless ethereal to a fault,
   </p>
   <p>
    imaginative to impracticability. With these natures, corporal presence
   </p>
   <p>
    is something less appealing than corporal absence; the latter creating
   </p>
   <p>
    an ideal presence that conveniently drops the defects of the real. She
   </p>
   <p>
    found that her personality did not plead her cause so forcibly as she
   </p>
   <p>
    had anticipated. The figurative phrase was true: she was another woman
   </p>
   <p>
    than the one who had excited his desire.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I have thought over what you say,” she remarked to him, moving her
   </p>
   <p>
    forefinger over the tablecloth, her other hand, which bore the ring
   </p>
   <p>
    that mocked them both, supporting her forehead. “It is quite true, all
   </p>
   <p>
    of it; it must be. You must go away from me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But what can you do?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I can go home.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare had not thought of that.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Are you sure?” he inquired.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Quite sure. We ought to part, and we may as well get it past and done.
   </p>
   <p>
    You once said that I was apt to win men against their better judgement;
   </p>
   <p>
    and if I am constantly before your eyes I may cause you to change your
   </p>
   <p>
    plans in opposition to your reason and wish; and afterwards your
   </p>
   <p>
    repentance and my sorrow will be terrible.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And you would like to go home?” he asked.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I want to leave you, and go home.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Then it shall be so.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Though she did not look up at him, she started. There was a difference
   </p>
   <p>
    between the proposition and the covenant, which she had felt only too
   </p>
   <p>
    quickly.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I feared it would come to this,” she murmured, her countenance meekly
   </p>
   <p>
    fixed. “I don’t complain, Angel, I—I think it best. What you said has
   </p>
   <p>
    quite convinced me. Yes, though nobody else should reproach me if we
   </p>
   <p>
    should stay together, yet somewhen, years hence, you might get angry
   </p>
   <p>
    with me for any ordinary matter, and knowing what you do of my bygones,
   </p>
   <p>
    you yourself might be tempted to say words, and they might be
   </p>
   <p>
    overheard, perhaps by my own children. O, what only hurts me now would
   </p>
   <p>
    torture and kill me then! I will go—to-morrow.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And I shall not stay here. Though I didn’t like to initiate it, I have
   </p>
   <p>
    seen that it was advisable we should part—at least for a while, till I
   </p>
   <p>
    can better see the shape that things have taken, and can write to you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess stole a glance at her husband. He was pale, even tremulous; but,
   </p>
   <p>
    as before, she was appalled by the determination revealed in the depths
   </p>
   <p>
    of this gentle being she had married—the will to subdue the grosser to
   </p>
   <p>
    the subtler emotion, the substance to the conception, the flesh to the
   </p>
   <p>
    spirit. Propensities, tendencies, habits, were as dead leaves upon the
   </p>
   <p>
    tyrannous wind of his imaginative ascendency.
   </p>
   <p>
    He may have observed her look, for he explained—
   </p>
   <p>
    “I think of people more kindly when I am away from them”; adding
   </p>
   <p>
    cynically, “God knows; perhaps we will shake down together some day,
   </p>
   <p>
    for weariness; thousands have done it!”
   </p>
   <p>
    That day he began to pack up, and she went upstairs and began to pack
   </p>
   <p>
    also. Both knew that it was in their two minds that they might part the
   </p>
   <p>
    next morning for ever, despite the gloss of assuaging conjectures
   </p>
   <p>
    thrown over their proceeding because they were of the sort to whom any
   </p>
   <p>
    parting which has an air of finality is a torture. He knew, and she
   </p>
   <p>
    knew, that, though the fascination which each had exercised over the
   </p>
   <p>
    other—on her part independently of accomplishments—would probably in
   </p>
   <p>
    the first days of their separation be even more potent than ever, time
   </p>
   <p>
    must attenuate that effect; the practical arguments against accepting
   </p>
   <p>
    her as a housemate might pronounce themselves more strongly in the
   </p>
   <p>
    boreal light of a remoter view. Moreover, when two people are once
   </p>
   <p>
    parted—have abandoned a common domicile and a common environment—new
   </p>
   <p>
    growths insensibly bud upward to fill each vacated place; unforeseen
   </p>
   <p>
    accidents hinder intentions, and old plans are forgotten.
   </p>
   <p>
    XXXVII
   </p>
   <p>
    Midnight came and passed silently, for there was nothing to announce it
   </p>
   <p>
    in the Valley of the Froom.
   </p>
   <p>
    Not long after one o’clock there was a slight creak in the darkened
   </p>
   <p>
    farmhouse once the mansion of the d’Urbervilles. Tess, who used the
   </p>
   <p>
    upper chamber, heard it and awoke. It had come from the corner step of
   </p>
   <p>
    the staircase, which, as usual, was loosely nailed. She saw the door of
   </p>
   <p>
    her bedroom open, and the figure of her husband crossed the stream of
   </p>
   <p>
    moonlight with a curiously careful tread. He was in his shirt and
   </p>
   <p>
    trousers only, and her first flush of joy died when she perceived that
   </p>
   <p>
    his eyes were fixed in an unnatural stare on vacancy. When he reached
   </p>
   <p>
    the middle of the room he stood still and murmured in tones of
   </p>
   <p>
    indescribable sadness—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Dead! dead! dead!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Under the influence of any strongly-disturbing force, Clare would
   </p>
   <p>
    occasionally walk in his sleep, and even perform strange feats, such as
   </p>
   <p>
    he had done on the night of their return from market just before their
   </p>
   <p>
    marriage, when he re-enacted in his bedroom his combat with the man who
   </p>
   <p>
    had insulted her. Tess saw that continued mental distress had wrought
   </p>
   <p>
    him into that somnambulistic state now.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her loyal confidence in him lay so deep down in her heart, that, awake
   </p>
   <p>
    or asleep, he inspired her with no sort of personal fear. If he had
   </p>
   <p>
    entered with a pistol in his hand he would scarcely have disturbed her
   </p>
   <p>
    trust in his protectiveness.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare came close, and bent over her. “Dead, dead, dead!” he murmured.
   </p>
   <p>
    After fixedly regarding her for some moments with the same gaze of
   </p>
   <p>
    unmeasurable woe, he bent lower, enclosed her in his arms, and rolled
   </p>
   <p>
    her in the sheet as in a shroud. Then lifting her from the bed with as
   </p>
   <p>
    much respect as one would show to a dead body, he carried her across
   </p>
   <p>
    the room, murmuring—
   </p>
   <p>
    “My poor, poor Tess—my dearest, darling Tess! So sweet, so good, so
   </p>
   <p>
    true!”
   </p>
   <p>
    The words of endearment, withheld so severely in his waking hours, were
   </p>
   <p>
    inexpressibly sweet to her forlorn and hungry heart. If it had been to
   </p>
   <p>
    save her weary life she would not, by moving or struggling, have put an
   </p>
   <p>
    end to the position she found herself in. Thus she lay in absolute
   </p>
   <p>
    stillness, scarcely venturing to breathe, and, wondering what he was
   </p>
   <p>
    going to do with her, suffered herself to be borne out upon the
   </p>
   <p>
    landing.
   </p>
   <p>
    “My wife—dead, dead!” he said.
   </p>
   <p>
    He paused in his labours for a moment to lean with her against the
   </p>
   <p>
    banister. Was he going to throw her down? Self-solicitude was near
   </p>
   <p>
    extinction in her, and in the knowledge that he had planned to depart
   </p>
   <p>
    on the morrow, possibly for always, she lay in his arms in this
   </p>
   <p>
    precarious position with a sense rather of luxury than of terror. If
   </p>
   <p>
    they could only fall together, and both be dashed to pieces, how fit,
   </p>
   <p>
    how desirable.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, he did not let her fall, but took advantage of the support of
   </p>
   <p>
    the handrail to imprint a kiss upon her lips—lips in the day-time
   </p>
   <p>
    scorned. Then he clasped her with a renewed firmness of hold, and
   </p>
   <p>
    descended the staircase. The creak of the loose stair did not awaken
   </p>
   <p>
    him, and they reached the ground-floor safely. Freeing one of his hands
   </p>
   <p>
    from his grasp of her for a moment, he slid back the door-bar and
   </p>
   <p>
    passed out, slightly striking his stockinged toe against the edge of
   </p>
   <p>
    the door. But this he seemed not to mind, and, having room for
   </p>
   <p>
    extension in the open air, he lifted her against his shoulder, so that
   </p>
   <p>
    he could carry her with ease, the absence of clothes taking much from
   </p>
   <p>
    his burden. Thus he bore her off the premises in the direction of the
   </p>
   <p>
    river a few yards distant.
   </p>
   <p>
    His ultimate intention, if he had any, she had not yet divined; and she
   </p>
   <p>
    found herself conjecturing on the matter as a third person might have
   </p>
   <p>
    done. So easefully had she delivered her whole being up to him that it
   </p>
   <p>
    pleased her to think he was regarding her as his absolute possession,
   </p>
   <p>
    to dispose of as he should choose. It was consoling, under the hovering
   </p>
   <p>
    terror of to-morrow’s separation, to feel that he really recognized her
   </p>
   <p>
    now as his wife Tess, and did not cast her off, even if in that
   </p>
   <p>
    recognition he went so far as to arrogate to himself the right of
   </p>
   <p>
    harming her.
   </p>
   <p>
    Ah! now she knew what he was dreaming of—that Sunday morning when he
   </p>
   <p>
    had borne her along through the water with the other dairymaids, who
   </p>
   <p>
    had loved him nearly as much as she, if that were possible, which Tess
   </p>
   <p>
    could hardly admit. Clare did not cross the bridge with her, but
   </p>
   <p>
    proceeding several paces on the same side towards the adjoining mill,
   </p>
   <p>
    at length stood still on the brink of the river.
   </p>
   <p>
    Its waters, in creeping down these miles of meadowland, frequently
   </p>
   <p>
    divided, serpentining in purposeless curves, looping themselves around
   </p>
   <p>
    little islands that had no name, returning and re-embodying themselves
   </p>
   <p>
    as a broad main stream further on. Opposite the spot to which he had
   </p>
   <p>
    brought her was such a general confluence, and the river was
   </p>
   <p>
    proportionately voluminous and deep. Across it was a narrow
   </p>
   <p>
    foot-bridge; but now the autumn flood had washed the handrail away,
   </p>
   <p>
    leaving the bare plank only, which, lying a few inches above the
   </p>
   <p>
    speeding current, formed a giddy pathway for even steady heads; and
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess had noticed from the window of the house in the day-time young men
   </p>
   <p>
    walking across upon it as a feat in balancing. Her husband had possibly
   </p>
   <p>
    observed the same performance; anyhow, he now mounted the plank, and,
   </p>
   <p>
    sliding one foot forward, advanced along it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Was he going to drown her? Probably he was. The spot was lonely, the
   </p>
   <p>
    river deep and wide enough to make such a purpose easy of
   </p>
   <p>
    accomplishment. He might drown her if he would; it would be better than
   </p>
   <p>
    parting to-morrow to lead severed lives.
   </p>
   <p>
    The swift stream raced and gyrated under them, tossing, distorting, and
   </p>
   <p>
    splitting the moon’s reflected face. Spots of froth travelled past, and
   </p>
   <p>
    intercepted weeds waved behind the piles. If they could both fall
   </p>
   <p>
    together into the current now, their arms would be so tightly clasped
   </p>
   <p>
    together that they could not be saved; they would go out of the world
   </p>
   <p>
    almost painlessly, and there would be no more reproach to her, or to
   </p>
   <p>
    him for marrying her. His last half-hour with her would have been a
   </p>
   <p>
    loving one, while if they lived till he awoke, his day-time aversion
   </p>
   <p>
    would return, and this hour would remain to be contemplated only as a
   </p>
   <p>
    transient dream.
   </p>
   <p>
    The impulse stirred in her, yet she dared not indulge it, to make a
   </p>
   <p>
    movement that would have precipitated them both into the gulf. How she
   </p>
   <p>
    valued her own life had been proved; but his—she had no right to tamper
   </p>
   <p>
    with it. He reached the other side with her in safety.
   </p>
   <p>
    Here they were within a plantation which formed the Abbey grounds, and
   </p>
   <p>
    taking a new hold of her he went onward a few steps till they reached
   </p>
   <p>
    the ruined choir of the Abbey-church. Against the north wall was the
   </p>
   <p>
    empty stone coffin of an abbot, in which every tourist with a turn for
   </p>
   <p>
    grim humour was accustomed to stretch himself. In this Clare carefully
   </p>
   <p>
    laid Tess. Having kissed her lips a second time he breathed deeply, as
   </p>
   <p>
    if a greatly desired end were attained. Clare then lay down on the
   </p>
   <p>
    ground alongside, when he immediately fell into the deep dead slumber
   </p>
   <p>
    of exhaustion, and remained motionless as a log. The spurt of mental
   </p>
   <p>
    excitement which had produced the effort was now over.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess sat up in the coffin. The night, though dry and mild for the
   </p>
   <p>
    season, was more than sufficiently cold to make it dangerous for him to
   </p>
   <p>
    remain here long, in his half-clothed state. If he were left to himself
   </p>
   <p>
    he would in all probability stay there till the morning, and be chilled
   </p>
   <p>
    to certain death. She had heard of such deaths after sleep-walking. But
   </p>
   <p>
    how could she dare to awaken him, and let him know what he had been
   </p>
   <p>
    doing, when it would mortify him to discover his folly in respect of
   </p>
   <p>
    her? Tess, however, stepping out of her stone confine, shook him
   </p>
   <p>
    slightly, but was unable to arouse him without being violent. It was
   </p>
   <p>
    indispensable to do something, for she was beginning to shiver, the
   </p>
   <p>
    sheet being but a poor protection. Her excitement had in a measure kept
   </p>
   <p>
    her warm during the few minutes’ adventure; but that beatific interval
   </p>
   <p>
    was over.
   </p>
   <p>
    It suddenly occurred to her to try persuasion; and accordingly she
   </p>
   <p>
    whispered in his ear, with as much firmness and decision as she could
   </p>
   <p>
    summon—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Let us walk on, darling,” at the same time taking him suggestively by
   </p>
   <p>
    the arm. To her relief, he unresistingly acquiesced; her words had
   </p>
   <p>
    apparently thrown him back into his dream, which thenceforward seemed
   </p>
   <p>
    to enter on a new phase, wherein he fancied she had risen as a spirit,
   </p>
   <p>
    and was leading him to Heaven. Thus she conducted him by the arm to the
   </p>
   <p>
    stone bridge in front of their residence, crossing which they stood at
   </p>
   <p>
    the manor-house door. Tess’s feet were quite bare, and the stones hurt
   </p>
   <p>
    her, and chilled her to the bone; but Clare was in his woollen
   </p>
   <p>
    stockings and appeared to feel no discomfort.
   </p>
   <p>
    There was no further difficulty. She induced him to lie down on his own
   </p>
   <p>
    sofa bed, and covered him up warmly, lighting a temporary fire of wood,
   </p>
   <p>
    to dry any dampness out of him. The noise of these attentions she
   </p>
   <p>
    thought might awaken him, and secretly wished that they might. But the
   </p>
   <p>
    exhaustion of his mind and body was such that he remained undisturbed.
   </p>
   <p>
    As soon as they met the next morning Tess divined that Angel knew
   </p>
   <p>
    little or nothing of how far she had been concerned in the night’s
   </p>
   <p>
    excursion, though, as regarded himself, he may have been aware that he
   </p>
   <p>
    had not lain still. In truth, he had awakened that morning from a sleep
   </p>
   <p>
    deep as annihilation; and during those first few moments in which the
   </p>
   <p>
    brain, like a Samson shaking himself, is trying its strength, he had
   </p>
   <p>
    some dim notion of an unusual nocturnal proceeding. But the realities
   </p>
   <p>
    of his situation soon displaced conjecture on the other subject.
   </p>
   <p>
    He waited in expectancy to discern some mental pointing; he knew that
   </p>
   <p>
    if any intention of his, concluded over-night, did not vanish in the
   </p>
   <p>
    light of morning, it stood on a basis approximating to one of pure
   </p>
   <p>
    reason, even if initiated by impulse of feeling; that it was so far,
   </p>
   <p>
    therefore, to be trusted. He thus beheld in the pale morning light the
   </p>
   <p>
    resolve to separate from her; not as a hot and indignant instinct, but
   </p>
   <p>
    denuded of the passionateness which had made it scorch and burn;
   </p>
   <p>
    standing in its bones; nothing but a skeleton, but none the less there.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare no longer hesitated.
   </p>
   <p>
    At breakfast, and while they were packing the few remaining articles,
   </p>
   <p>
    he showed his weariness from the night’s effort so unmistakeably that
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess was on the point of revealing all that had happened; but the
   </p>
   <p>
    reflection that it would anger him, grieve him, stultify him, to know
   </p>
   <p>
    that he had instinctively manifested a fondness for her of which his
   </p>
   <p>
    common-sense did not approve, that his inclination had compromised his
   </p>
   <p>
    dignity when reason slept, again deterred her. It was too much like
   </p>
   <p>
    laughing at a man when sober for his erratic deeds during intoxication.
   </p>
   <p>
    It just crossed her mind, too, that he might have a faint recollection
   </p>
   <p>
    of his tender vagary, and was disinclined to allude to it from a
   </p>
   <p>
    conviction that she would take amatory advantage of the opportunity it
   </p>
   <p>
    gave her of appealing to him anew not to go.
   </p>
   <p>
    He had ordered by letter a vehicle from the nearest town, and soon
   </p>
   <p>
    after breakfast it arrived. She saw in it the beginning of the end—the
   </p>
   <p>
    temporary end, at least, for the revelation of his tenderness by the
   </p>
   <p>
    incident of the night raised dreams of a possible future with him. The
   </p>
   <p>
    luggage was put on the top, and the man drove them off, the miller and
   </p>
   <p>
    the old waiting-woman expressing some surprise at their precipitate
   </p>
   <p>
    departure, which Clare attributed to his discovery that the mill-work
   </p>
   <p>
    was not of the modern kind which he wished to investigate, a statement
   </p>
   <p>
    that was true so far as it went. Beyond this there was nothing in the
   </p>
   <p>
    manner of their leaving to suggest a _fiasco_, or that they were not
   </p>
   <p>
    going together to visit friends.
   </p>
   <p>
    Their route lay near the dairy from which they had started with such
   </p>
   <p>
    solemn joy in each other a few days back, and as Clare wished to wind
   </p>
   <p>
    up his business with Mr Crick, Tess could hardly avoid paying Mrs Crick
   </p>
   <p>
    a call at the same time, unless she would excite suspicion of their
   </p>
   <p>
    unhappy state.
   </p>
   <p>
    To make the call as unobtrusive as possible, they left the carriage by
   </p>
   <p>
    the wicket leading down from the high road to the dairy-house, and
   </p>
   <p>
    descended the track on foot, side by side. The withy-bed had been cut,
   </p>
   <p>
    and they could see over the stumps the spot to which Clare had followed
   </p>
   <p>
    her when he pressed her to be his wife; to the left the enclosure in
   </p>
   <p>
    which she had been fascinated by his harp; and far away behind the
   </p>
   <p>
    cow-stalls the mead which had been the scene of their first embrace.
   </p>
   <p>
    The gold of the summer picture was now gray, the colours mean, the rich
   </p>
   <p>
    soil mud, and the river cold.
   </p>
   <p>
    Over the barton-gate the dairyman saw them, and came forward, throwing
   </p>
   <p>
    into his face the kind of jocularity deemed appropriate in Talbothays
   </p>
   <p>
    and its vicinity on the re-appearance of the newly-married. Then Mrs
   </p>
   <p>
    Crick emerged from the house, and several others of their old
   </p>
   <p>
    acquaintance, though Marian and Retty did not seem to be there.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess valiantly bore their sly attacks and friendly humours, which
   </p>
   <p>
    affected her far otherwise than they supposed. In the tacit agreement
   </p>
   <p>
    of husband and wife to keep their estrangement a secret they behaved as
   </p>
   <p>
    would have been ordinary. And then, although she would rather there had
   </p>
   <p>
    been no word spoken on the subject, Tess had to hear in detail the
   </p>
   <p>
    story of Marian and Retty. The later had gone home to her father’s, and
   </p>
   <p>
    Marian had left to look for employment elsewhere. They feared she would
   </p>
   <p>
    come to no good.
   </p>
   <p>
    To dissipate the sadness of this recital Tess went and bade all her
   </p>
   <p>
    favourite cows goodbye, touching each of them with her hand, and as she
   </p>
   <p>
    and Clare stood side by side at leaving, as if united body and soul,
   </p>
   <p>
    there would have been something peculiarly sorry in their aspect to one
   </p>
   <p>
    who should have seen it truly; two limbs of one life, as they outwardly
   </p>
   <p>
    were, his arm touching hers, her skirts touching him, facing one way,
   </p>
   <p>
    as against all the dairy facing the other, speaking in their adieux as
   </p>
   <p>
    “we”, and yet sundered like the poles. Perhaps something unusually
   </p>
   <p>
    stiff and embarrassed in their attitude, some awkwardness in acting up
   </p>
   <p>
    to their profession of unity, different from the natural shyness of
   </p>
   <p>
    young couples, may have been apparent, for when they were gone Mrs
   </p>
   <p>
    Crick said to her husband—
   </p>
   <p>
    “How onnatural the brightness of her eyes did seem, and how they stood
   </p>
   <p>
    like waxen images and talked as if they were in a dream! Didn’t it
   </p>
   <p>
    strike ’ee that ’twas so? Tess had always sommat strange in her, and
   </p>
   <p>
    she’s not now quite like the proud young bride of a well-be-doing man.”
   </p>
   <p>
    They re-entered the vehicle, and were driven along the roads towards
   </p>
   <p>
    Weatherbury and Stagfoot Lane, till they reached the Lane inn, where
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare dismissed the fly and man. They rested here a while, and entering
   </p>
   <p>
    the Vale were next driven onward towards her home by a stranger who did
   </p>
   <p>
    not know their relations. At a midway point, when Nuttlebury had been
   </p>
   <p>
    passed, and where there were cross-roads, Clare stopped the conveyance
   </p>
   <p>
    and said to Tess that if she meant to return to her mother’s house it
   </p>
   <p>
    was here that he would leave her. As they could not talk with freedom
   </p>
   <p>
    in the driver’s presence he asked her to accompany him for a few steps
   </p>
   <p>
    on foot along one of the branch roads; she assented, and directing the
   </p>
   <p>
    man to wait a few minutes they strolled away.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Now, let us understand each other,” he said gently. “There is no anger
   </p>
   <p>
    between us, though there is that which I cannot endure at present. I
   </p>
   <p>
    will try to bring myself to endure it. I will let you know where I go
   </p>
   <p>
    to as soon as I know myself. And if I can bring myself to bear it—if it
   </p>
   <p>
    is desirable, possible—I will come to you. But until I come to you it
   </p>
   <p>
    will be better that you should not try to come to me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The severity of the decree seemed deadly to Tess; she saw his view of
   </p>
   <p>
    her clearly enough; he could regard her in no other light than that of
   </p>
   <p>
    one who had practised gross deceit upon him. Yet could a woman who had
   </p>
   <p>
    done even what she had done deserve all this? But she could contest the
   </p>
   <p>
    point with him no further. She simply repeated after him his own words.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Until you come to me I must not try to come to you?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Just so.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “May I write to you?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O yes—if you are ill, or want anything at all. I hope that will not be
   </p>
   <p>
    the case; so that it may happen that I write first to you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I agree to the conditions, Angel; because you know best what my
   </p>
   <p>
    punishment ought to be; only—only—don’t make it more than I can bear!”
   </p>
   <p>
    That was all she said on the matter. If Tess had been artful, had she
   </p>
   <p>
    made a scene, fainted, wept hysterically, in that lonely lane,
   </p>
   <p>
    notwithstanding the fury of fastidiousness with which he was possessed,
   </p>
   <p>
    he would probably not have withstood her. But her mood of
   </p>
   <p>
    long-suffering made his way easy for him, and she herself was his best
   </p>
   <p>
    advocate. Pride, too, entered into her submission—which perhaps was a
   </p>
   <p>
    symptom of that reckless acquiescence in chance too apparent in the
   </p>
   <p>
    whole d’Urberville family—and the many effective chords which she could
   </p>
   <p>
    have stirred by an appeal were left untouched.
   </p>
   <p>
    The remainder of their discourse was on practical matters only. He now
   </p>
   <p>
    handed her a packet containing a fairly good sum of money, which he had
   </p>
   <p>
    obtained from his bankers for the purpose. The brilliants, the interest
   </p>
   <p>
    in which seemed to be Tess’s for her life only (if he understood the
   </p>
   <p>
    wording of the will), he advised her to let him send to a bank for
   </p>
   <p>
    safety; and to this she readily agreed.
   </p>
   <p>
    These things arranged, he walked with Tess back to the carriage, and
   </p>
   <p>
    handed her in. The coachman was paid and told where to drive her.
   </p>
   <p>
    Taking next his own bag and umbrella—the sole articles he had brought
   </p>
   <p>
    with him hitherwards—he bade her goodbye; and they parted there and
   </p>
   <p>
    then.
   </p>
   <p>
    The fly moved creepingly up a hill, and Clare watched it go with an
   </p>
   <p>
    unpremeditated hope that Tess would look out of the window for one
   </p>
   <p>
    moment. But that she never thought of doing, would not have ventured to
   </p>
   <p>
    do, lying in a half-dead faint inside. Thus he beheld her recede, and
   </p>
   <p>
    in the anguish of his heart quoted a line from a poet, with peculiar
   </p>
   <p>
    emendations of his own—
   </p>
   <p>
    God’s _not_ in his heaven: All’s _wrong_ with the world!
   </p>
   <p>
    When Tess had passed over the crest of the hill he turned to go his own
   </p>
   <p>
    way, and hardly knew that he loved her still.
   </p>
   <p>
    XXXVIII
   </p>
   <p>
    As she drove on through Blackmoor Vale, and the landscape of her youth
   </p>
   <p>
    began to open around her, Tess aroused herself from her stupor. Her
   </p>
   <p>
    first thought was how would she be able to face her parents?
   </p>
   <p>
    She reached a turnpike-gate which stood upon the highway to the
   </p>
   <p>
    village. It was thrown open by a stranger, not by the old man who had
   </p>
   <p>
    kept it for many years, and to whom she had been known; he had probably
   </p>
   <p>
    left on New Year’s Day, the date when such changes were made. Having
   </p>
   <p>
    received no intelligence lately from her home, she asked the
   </p>
   <p>
    turnpike-keeper for news.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh—nothing, miss,” he answered. “Marlott is Marlott still. Folks have
   </p>
   <p>
    died and that. John Durbeyfield, too, hev had a daughter married this
   </p>
   <p>
    week to a gentleman-farmer; not from John’s own house, you know; they
   </p>
   <p>
    was married elsewhere; the gentleman being of that high standing that
   </p>
   <p>
    John’s own folk was not considered well-be-doing enough to have any
   </p>
   <p>
    part in it, the bridegroom seeming not to know how’t have been
   </p>
   <p>
    discovered that John is a old and ancient nobleman himself by blood,
   </p>
   <p>
    with family skillentons in their own vaults to this day, but done out
   </p>
   <p>
    of his property in the time o’ the Romans. However, Sir John, as we
   </p>
   <p>
    call ’n now, kept up the wedding-day as well as he could, and stood
   </p>
   <p>
    treat to everybody in the parish; and John’s wife sung songs at The
   </p>
   <p>
    Pure Drop till past eleven o’clock.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Hearing this, Tess felt so sick at heart that she could not decide to
   </p>
   <p>
    go home publicly in the fly with her luggage and belongings. She asked
   </p>
   <p>
    the turnpike-keeper if she might deposit her things at his house for a
   </p>
   <p>
    while, and, on his offering no objection, she dismissed her carriage,
   </p>
   <p>
    and went on to the village alone by a back lane.
   </p>
   <p>
    At sight of her father’s chimney she asked herself how she could
   </p>
   <p>
    possibly enter the house? Inside that cottage her relations were calmly
   </p>
   <p>
    supposing her far away on a wedding-tour with a comparatively rich man,
   </p>
   <p>
    who was to conduct her to bouncing prosperity; while here she was,
   </p>
   <p>
    friendless, creeping up to the old door quite by herself, with no
   </p>
   <p>
    better place to go to in the world.
   </p>
   <p>
    She did not reach the house unobserved. Just by the garden-hedge she
   </p>
   <p>
    was met by a girl who knew her—one of the two or three with whom she
   </p>
   <p>
    had been intimate at school. After making a few inquiries as to how
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess came there, her friend, unheeding her tragic look, interrupted
   </p>
   <p>
    with—
   </p>
   <p>
    “But where’s thy gentleman, Tess?”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess hastily explained that he had been called away on business, and,
   </p>
   <p>
    leaving her interlocutor, clambered over the garden-hedge, and thus
   </p>
   <p>
    made her way to the house.
   </p>
   <p>
    As she went up the garden-path she heard her mother singing by the back
   </p>
   <p>
    door, coming in sight of which she perceived Mrs Durbeyfield on the
   </p>
   <p>
    doorstep in the act of wringing a sheet. Having performed this without
   </p>
   <p>
    observing Tess, she went indoors, and her daughter followed her.
   </p>
   <p>
    The washing-tub stood in the same old place on the same old
   </p>
   <p>
    quarter-hogshead, and her mother, having thrown the sheet aside, was
   </p>
   <p>
    about to plunge her arms in anew.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why—Tess!—my chil’—I thought you was married!—married really and truly
   </p>
   <p>
    this time—we sent the cider—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, mother; so I am.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Going to be?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No—I am married.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Married! Then where’s thy husband?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh, he’s gone away for a time.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Gone away! When was you married, then? The day you said?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, Tuesday, mother.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And now ’tis on’y Saturday, and he gone away?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, he’s gone.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “What’s the meaning o’ that? ’Nation seize such husbands as you seem to
   </p>
   <p>
    get, say I!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Mother!” Tess went across to Joan Durbeyfield, laid her face upon the
   </p>
   <p>
    matron’s bosom, and burst into sobs. “I don’t know how to tell ’ee,
   </p>
   <p>
    mother! You said to me, and wrote to me, that I was not to tell him.
   </p>
   <p>
    But I did tell him—I couldn’t help it—and he went away!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O you little fool—you little fool!” burst out Mrs Durbeyfield,
   </p>
   <p>
    splashing Tess and herself in her agitation. “My good God! that ever I
   </p>
   <p>
    should ha’ lived to say it, but I say it again, you little fool!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess was convulsed with weeping, the tension of so many days having
   </p>
   <p>
    relaxed at last.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I know it—I know—I know!” she gasped through her sobs. “But, O my
   </p>
   <p>
    mother, I could not help it! He was so good—and I felt the wickedness
   </p>
   <p>
    of trying to blind him as to what had happened! If—if—it were to be
   </p>
   <p>
    done again—I should do the same. I could not—I dared not—so sin—against
   </p>
   <p>
    him!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But you sinned enough to marry him first!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, yes; that’s where my misery do lie! But I thought he could get
   </p>
   <p>
    rid o’ me by law if he were determined not to overlook it. And O, if
   </p>
   <p>
    you knew—if you could only half know how I loved him—how anxious I was
   </p>
   <p>
    to have him—and how wrung I was between caring so much for him and my
   </p>
   <p>
    wish to be fair to him!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess was so shaken that she could get no further, and sank, a helpless
   </p>
   <p>
    thing, into a chair.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, well; what’s done can’t be undone! I’m sure I don’t know why
   </p>
   <p>
    children o’ my bringing forth should all be bigger simpletons than
   </p>
   <p>
    other people’s—not to know better than to blab such a thing as that,
   </p>
   <p>
    when he couldn’t ha’ found it out till too late!” Here Mrs Durbeyfield
   </p>
   <p>
    began shedding tears on her own account as a mother to be pitied. “What
   </p>
   <p>
    your father will say I don’t know,” she continued; “for he’s been
   </p>
   <p>
    talking about the wedding up at Rolliver’s and The Pure Drop every day
   </p>
   <p>
    since, and about his family getting back to their rightful position
   </p>
   <p>
    through you—poor silly man!—and now you’ve made this mess of it! The
   </p>
   <p>
    Lord-a-Lord!”
   </p>
   <p>
    As if to bring matters to a focus, Tess’s father was heard approaching
   </p>
   <p>
    at that moment. He did not, however, enter immediately, and Mrs
   </p>
   <p>
    Durbeyfield said that she would break the bad news to him herself, Tess
   </p>
   <p>
    keeping out of sight for the present. After her first burst of
   </p>
   <p>
    disappointment Joan began to take the mishap as she had taken Tess’s
   </p>
   <p>
    original trouble, as she would have taken a wet holiday or failure in
   </p>
   <p>
    the potato-crop; as a thing which had come upon them irrespective of
   </p>
   <p>
    desert or folly; a chance external impingement to be borne with; not a
   </p>
   <p>
    lesson.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess retreated upstairs and beheld casually that the beds had been
   </p>
   <p>
    shifted, and new arrangements made. Her old bed had been adapted for
   </p>
   <p>
    two younger children. There was no place here for her now.
   </p>
   <p>
    The room below being unceiled she could hear most of what went on
   </p>
   <p>
    there. Presently her father entered, apparently carrying in a live hen.
   </p>
   <p>
    He was a foot-haggler now, having been obliged to sell his second
   </p>
   <p>
    horse, and he travelled with his basket on his arm. The hen had been
   </p>
   <p>
    carried about this morning as it was often carried, to show people that
   </p>
   <p>
    he was in his work, though it had lain, with its legs tied, under the
   </p>
   <p>
    table at Rolliver’s for more than an hour.
   </p>
   <p>
    “We’ve just had up a story about—” Durbeyfield began, and thereupon
   </p>
   <p>
    related in detail to his wife a discussion which had arisen at the inn
   </p>
   <p>
    about the clergy, originated by the fact of his daughter having married
   </p>
   <p>
    into a clerical family. “They was formerly styled ‘sir’, like my own
   </p>
   <p>
    ancestry,” he said, “though nowadays their true style, strictly
   </p>
   <p>
    speaking, is ‘clerk’ only.” As Tess had wished that no great publicity
   </p>
   <p>
    should be given to the event, he had mentioned no particulars. He hoped
   </p>
   <p>
    she would remove that prohibition soon. He proposed that the couple
   </p>
   <p>
    should take Tess’s own name, d’Urberville, as uncorrupted. It was
   </p>
   <p>
    better than her husbands’s. He asked if any letter had come from her
   </p>
   <p>
    that day.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then Mrs Durbeyfield informed him that no letter had come, but Tess
   </p>
   <p>
    unfortunately had come herself.
   </p>
   <p>
    When at length the collapse was explained to him, a sullen
   </p>
   <p>
    mortification, not usual with Durbeyfield, overpowered the influence of
   </p>
   <p>
    the cheering glass. Yet the intrinsic quality of the event moved his
   </p>
   <p>
    touchy sensitiveness less than its conjectured effect upon the minds of
   </p>
   <p>
    others.
   </p>
   <p>
    “To think, now, that this was to be the end o’t!” said Sir John. “And I
   </p>
   <p>
    with a family vault under that there church of Kingsbere as big as
   </p>
   <p>
    Squire Jollard’s ale-cellar, and my folk lying there in sixes and
   </p>
   <p>
    sevens, as genuine county bones and marrow as any recorded in history.
   </p>
   <p>
    And now to be sure what they fellers at Rolliver’s and The Pure Drop
   </p>
   <p>
    will say to me! How they’ll squint and glane, and say, ‘This is yer
   </p>
   <p>
    mighty match is it; this is yer getting back to the true level of yer
   </p>
   <p>
    forefathers in King Norman’s time!’ I feel this is too much, Joan; I
   </p>
   <p>
    shall put an end to myself, title and all—I can bear it no longer!...
   </p>
   <p>
    But she can make him keep her if he’s married her?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why, yes. But she won’t think o’ doing that.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “D’ye think he really have married her?—or is it like the first—”
   </p>
   <p>
    Poor Tess, who had heard as far as this, could not bear to hear more.
   </p>
   <p>
    The perception that her word could be doubted even here, in her own
   </p>
   <p>
    parental house, set her mind against the spot as nothing else could
   </p>
   <p>
    have done. How unexpected were the attacks of destiny! And if her
   </p>
   <p>
    father doubted her a little, would not neighbours and acquaintance
   </p>
   <p>
    doubt her much? O, she could not live long at home!
   </p>
   <p>
    A few days, accordingly, were all that she allowed herself here, at the
   </p>
   <p>
    end of which time she received a short note from Clare, informing her
   </p>
   <p>
    that he had gone to the North of England to look at a farm. In her
   </p>
   <p>
    craving for the lustre of her true position as his wife, and to hide
   </p>
   <p>
    from her parents the vast extent of the division between them, she made
   </p>
   <p>
    use of this letter as her reason for again departing, leaving them
   </p>
   <p>
    under the impression that she was setting out to join him. Still
   </p>
   <p>
    further to screen her husband from any imputation of unkindness to her,
   </p>
   <p>
    she took twenty-five of the fifty pounds Clare had given her, and
   </p>
   <p>
    handed the sum over to her mother, as if the wife of a man like Angel
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare could well afford it, saying that it was a slight return for the
   </p>
   <p>
    trouble and humiliation she had brought upon them in years past. With
   </p>
   <p>
    this assertion of her dignity she bade them farewell; and after that
   </p>
   <p>
    there were lively doings in the Durbeyfield household for some time on
   </p>
   <p>
    the strength of Tess’s bounty, her mother saying, and, indeed,
   </p>
   <p>
    believing, that the rupture which had arisen between the young husband
   </p>
   <p>
    and wife had adjusted itself under their strong feeling that they could
   </p>
   <p>
    not live apart from each other.
   </p>
   <p>
    XXXIX
   </p>
   <p>
    It was three weeks after the marriage that Clare found himself
   </p>
   <p>
    descending the hill which led to the well-known parsonage of his
   </p>
   <p>
    father. With his downward course the tower of the church rose into the
   </p>
   <p>
    evening sky in a manner of inquiry as to why he had come; and no living
   </p>
   <p>
    person in the twilighted town seemed to notice him, still less to
   </p>
   <p>
    expect him. He was arriving like a ghost, and the sound of his own
   </p>
   <p>
    footsteps was almost an encumbrance to be got rid of.
   </p>
   <p>
    The picture of life had changed for him. Before this time he had known
   </p>
   <p>
    it but speculatively; now he thought he knew it as a practical man;
   </p>
   <p>
    though perhaps he did not, even yet. Nevertheless humanity stood before
   </p>
   <p>
    him no longer in the pensive sweetness of Italian art, but in the
   </p>
   <p>
    staring and ghastly attitudes of a Wiertz Museum, and with the leer of
   </p>
   <p>
    a study by Van Beers.
   </p>
   <p>
    His conduct during these first weeks had been desultory beyond
   </p>
   <p>
    description. After mechanically attempting to pursue his agricultural
   </p>
   <p>
    plans as though nothing unusual had happened, in the manner recommended
   </p>
   <p>
    by the great and wise men of all ages, he concluded that very few of
   </p>
   <p>
    those great and wise men had ever gone so far outside themselves as to
   </p>
   <p>
    test the feasibility of their counsel. “This is the chief thing: be not
   </p>
   <p>
    perturbed,” said the Pagan moralist. That was just Clare’s own opinion.
   </p>
   <p>
    But he was perturbed. “Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it
   </p>
   <p>
    be afraid,” said the Nazarene. Clare chimed in cordially; but his heart
   </p>
   <p>
    was troubled all the same. How he would have liked to confront those
   </p>
   <p>
    two great thinkers, and earnestly appeal to them as fellow-man to
   </p>
   <p>
    fellow-men, and ask them to tell him their method!
   </p>
   <p>
    His mood transmuted itself into a dogged indifference till at length he
   </p>
   <p>
    fancied he was looking on his own existence with the passive interest
   </p>
   <p>
    of an outsider.
   </p>
   <p>
    He was embittered by the conviction that all this desolation had been
   </p>
   <p>
    brought about by the accident of her being a d’Urberville. When he
   </p>
   <p>
    found that Tess came of that exhausted ancient line, and was not of the
   </p>
   <p>
    new tribes from below, as he had fondly dreamed, why had he not
   </p>
   <p>
    stoically abandoned her in fidelity to his principles? This was what he
   </p>
   <p>
    had got by apostasy, and his punishment was deserved.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then he became weary and anxious, and his anxiety increased. He
   </p>
   <p>
    wondered if he had treated her unfairly. He ate without knowing that he
   </p>
   <p>
    ate, and drank without tasting. As the hours dropped past, as the
   </p>
   <p>
    motive of each act in the long series of bygone days presented itself
   </p>
   <p>
    to his view, he perceived how intimately the notion of having Tess as a
   </p>
   <p>
    dear possession was mixed up with all his schemes and words and ways.
   </p>
   <p>
    In going hither and thither he observed in the outskirts of a small
   </p>
   <p>
    town a red-and-blue placard setting forth the great advantages of the
   </p>
   <p>
    Empire of Brazil as a field for the emigrating agriculturist. Land was
   </p>
   <p>
    offered there on exceptionally advantageous terms. Brazil somewhat
   </p>
   <p>
    attracted him as a new idea. Tess could eventually join him there, and
   </p>
   <p>
    perhaps in that country of contrasting scenes and notions and habits
   </p>
   <p>
    the conventions would not be so operative which made life with her seem
   </p>
   <p>
    impracticable to him here. In brief he was strongly inclined to try
   </p>
   <p>
    Brazil, especially as the season for going thither was just at hand.
   </p>
   <p>
    With this view he was returning to Emminster to disclose his plan to
   </p>
   <p>
    his parents, and to make the best explanation he could make of arriving
   </p>
   <p>
    without Tess, short of revealing what had actually separated them. As
   </p>
   <p>
    he reached the door the new moon shone upon his face, just as the old
   </p>
   <p>
    one had done in the small hours of that morning when he had carried his
   </p>
   <p>
    wife in his arms across the river to the graveyard of the monks; but
   </p>
   <p>
    his face was thinner now.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare had given his parents no warning of his visit, and his arrival
   </p>
   <p>
    stirred the atmosphere of the Vicarage as the dive of the kingfisher
   </p>
   <p>
    stirs a quiet pool. His father and mother were both in the
   </p>
   <p>
    drawing-room, but neither of his brothers was now at home. Angel
   </p>
   <p>
    entered, and closed the door quietly behind him.
   </p>
   <p>
    “But—where’s your wife, dear Angel?” cried his mother. “How you
   </p>
   <p>
    surprise us!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “She is at her mother’s—temporarily. I have come home rather in a hurry
   </p>
   <p>
    because I’ve decided to go to Brazil.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Brazil! Why they are all Roman Catholics there surely!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Are they? I hadn’t thought of that.”
   </p>
   <p>
    But even the novelty and painfulness of his going to a Papistical land
   </p>
   <p>
    could not displace for long Mr and Mrs Clare’s natural interest in
   </p>
   <p>
    their son’s marriage.
   </p>
   <p>
    “We had your brief note three weeks ago announcing that it had taken
   </p>
   <p>
    place,” said Mrs Clare, “and your father sent your godmother’s gift to
   </p>
   <p>
    her, as you know. Of course it was best that none of us should be
   </p>
   <p>
    present, especially as you preferred to marry her from the dairy, and
   </p>
   <p>
    not at her home, wherever that may be. It would have embarrassed you,
   </p>
   <p>
    and given us no pleasure. Your bothers felt that very strongly. Now it
   </p>
   <p>
    is done we do not complain, particularly if she suits you for the
   </p>
   <p>
    business you have chosen to follow instead of the ministry of the
   </p>
   <p>
    Gospel.... Yet I wish I could have seen her first, Angel, or have known
   </p>
   <p>
    a little more about her. We sent her no present of our own, not knowing
   </p>
   <p>
    what would best give her pleasure, but you must suppose it only
   </p>
   <p>
    delayed. Angel, there is no irritation in my mind or your father’s
   </p>
   <p>
    against you for this marriage; but we have thought it much better to
   </p>
   <p>
    reserve our liking for your wife till we could see her. And now you
   </p>
   <p>
    have not brought her. It seems strange. What has happened?”
   </p>
   <p>
    He replied that it had been thought best by them that she should go to
   </p>
   <p>
    her parents’ home for the present, whilst he came there.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t mind telling you, dear mother,” he said, “that I always meant
   </p>
   <p>
    to keep her away from this house till I should feel she could come with
   </p>
   <p>
    credit to you. But this idea of Brazil is quite a recent one. If I do
   </p>
   <p>
    go it will be unadvisable for me to take her on this my first journey.
   </p>
   <p>
    She will remain at her mother’s till I come back.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And I shall not see her before you start?”
   </p>
   <p>
    He was afraid they would not. His original plan had been, as he had
   </p>
   <p>
    said, to refrain from bringing her there for some little while—not to
   </p>
   <p>
    wound their prejudices—feelings—in any way; and for other reasons he
   </p>
   <p>
    had adhered to it. He would have to visit home in the course of a year,
   </p>
   <p>
    if he went out at once; and it would be possible for them to see her
   </p>
   <p>
    before he started a second time—with her.
   </p>
   <p>
    A hastily prepared supper was brought in, and Clare made further
   </p>
   <p>
    exposition of his plans. His mother’s disappointment at not seeing the
   </p>
   <p>
    bride still remained with her. Clare’s late enthusiasm for Tess had
   </p>
   <p>
    infected her through her maternal sympathies, till she had almost
   </p>
   <p>
    fancied that a good thing could come out of Nazareth—a charming woman
   </p>
   <p>
    out of Talbothays Dairy. She watched her son as he ate.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Cannot you describe her? I am sure she is very pretty, Angel.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Of that there can be no question!” he said, with a zest which covered
   </p>
   <p>
    its bitterness.
   </p>
   <p>
    “And that she is pure and virtuous goes without question?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Pure and virtuous, of course, she is.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I can see her quite distinctly. You said the other day that she was
   </p>
   <p>
    fine in figure; roundly built; had deep red lips like Cupid’s bow; dark
   </p>
   <p>
    eyelashes and brows, an immense rope of hair like a ship’s cable; and
   </p>
   <p>
    large eyes violety-bluey-blackish.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I did, mother.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I quite see her. And living in such seclusion she naturally had scarce
   </p>
   <p>
    ever seen any young man from the world without till she saw you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Scarcely.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You were her first love?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Of course.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “There are worse wives than these simple, rosy-mouthed, robust girls of
   </p>
   <p>
    the farm. Certainly I could have wished—well, since my son is to be an
   </p>
   <p>
    agriculturist, it is perhaps but proper that his wife should have been
   </p>
   <p>
    accustomed to an outdoor life.”
   </p>
   <p>
    His father was less inquisitive; but when the time came for the chapter
   </p>
   <p>
    from the Bible which was always read before evening prayers, the Vicar
   </p>
   <p>
    observed to Mrs Clare—
   </p>
   <p>
    “I think, since Angel has come, that it will be more appropriate to
   </p>
   <p>
    read the thirty-first of Proverbs than the chapter which we should have
   </p>
   <p>
    had in the usual course of our reading?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, certainly,” said Mrs Clare. “The words of King Lemuel” (she could
   </p>
   <p>
    cite chapter and verse as well as her husband). “My dear son, your
   </p>
   <p>
    father has decided to read us the chapter in Proverbs in praise of a
   </p>
   <p>
    virtuous wife. We shall not need to be reminded to apply the words to
   </p>
   <p>
    the absent one. May Heaven shield her in all her ways!”
   </p>
   <p>
    A lump rose in Clare’s throat. The portable lectern was taken out from
   </p>
   <p>
    the corner and set in the middle of the fireplace, the two old servants
   </p>
   <p>
    came in, and Angel’s father began to read at the tenth verse of the
   </p>
   <p>
    aforesaid chapter—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies. She
   </p>
   <p>
    riseth while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household. She
   </p>
   <p>
    girdeth her loins with strength and strengtheneth her arms. She
   </p>
   <p>
    perceiveth that her merchandise is good; her candle goeth not out by
   </p>
   <p>
    night. She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not
   </p>
   <p>
    the bread of idleness. Her children arise up and call her blessed; her
   </p>
   <p>
    husband also, and he praiseth her. Many daughters have done virtuously,
   </p>
   <p>
    but thou excellest them all.”
   </p>
   <p>
    When prayers were over, his mother said—
   </p>
   <p>
    “I could not help thinking how very aptly that chapter your dear father
   </p>
   <p>
    read applied, in some of its particulars, to the woman you have chosen.
   </p>
   <p>
    The perfect woman, you see, was a working woman; not an idler; not a
   </p>
   <p>
    fine lady; but one who used her hands and her head and her heart for
   </p>
   <p>
    the good of others. ‘Her children arise up and call her blessed; her
   </p>
   <p>
    husband also, and he praiseth her. Many daughters have done virtuously,
   </p>
   <p>
    but she excelleth them all.’ Well, I wish I could have seen her, Angel.
   </p>
   <p>
    Since she is pure and chaste, she would have been refined enough for
   </p>
   <p>
    me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare could bear this no longer. His eyes were full of tears, which
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed like drops of molten lead. He bade a quick good night to these
   </p>
   <p>
    sincere and simple souls whom he loved so well; who knew neither the
   </p>
   <p>
    world, the flesh, nor the devil in their own hearts, only as something
   </p>
   <p>
    vague and external to themselves. He went to his own chamber.
   </p>
   <p>
    His mother followed him, and tapped at his door. Clare opened it to
   </p>
   <p>
    discover her standing without, with anxious eyes.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Angel,” she asked, “is there something wrong that you go away so soon?
   </p>
   <p>
    I am quite sure you are not yourself.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am not, quite, mother,” said he.
   </p>
   <p>
    “About her? Now, my son, I know it is that—I know it is about her! Have
   </p>
   <p>
    you quarrelled in these three weeks?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “We have not exactly quarrelled,” he said. “But we have had a
   </p>
   <p>
    difference—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Angel—is she a young woman whose history will bear investigation?”
   </p>
   <p>
    With a mother’s instinct Mrs Clare had put her finger on the kind of
   </p>
   <p>
    trouble that would cause such a disquiet as seemed to agitate her son.
   </p>
   <p>
    “She is spotless!” he replied; and felt that if it had sent him to
   </p>
   <p>
    eternal hell there and then he would have told that lie.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Then never mind the rest. After all, there are few purer things in
   </p>
   <p>
    nature then an unsullied country maid. Any crudeness of manner which
   </p>
   <p>
    may offend your more educated sense at first, will, I am sure,
   </p>
   <p>
    disappear under the influence or your companionship and tuition.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Such terrible sarcasm of blind magnanimity brought home to Clare the
   </p>
   <p>
    secondary perception that he had utterly wrecked his career by this
   </p>
   <p>
    marriage, which had not been among his early thoughts after the
   </p>
   <p>
    disclosure. True, on his own account he cared very little about his
   </p>
   <p>
    career; but he had wished to make it at least a respectable one on
   </p>
   <p>
    account of his parents and brothers. And now as he looked into the
   </p>
   <p>
    candle its flame dumbly expressed to him that it was made to shine on
   </p>
   <p>
    sensible people, and that it abhorred lighting the face of a dupe and a
   </p>
   <p>
    failure.
   </p>
   <p>
    When his agitation had cooled he would be at moments incensed with his
   </p>
   <p>
    poor wife for causing a situation in which he was obliged to practise
   </p>
   <p>
    deception on his parents. He almost talked to her in his anger, as if
   </p>
   <p>
    she had been in the room. And then her cooing voice, plaintive in
   </p>
   <p>
    expostulation, disturbed the darkness, the velvet touch of her lips
   </p>
   <p>
    passed over his brow, and he could distinguish in the air the warmth of
   </p>
   <p>
    her breath.
   </p>
   <p>
    This night the woman of his belittling deprecations was thinking how
   </p>
   <p>
    great and good her husband was. But over them both there hung a deeper
   </p>
   <p>
    shade than the shade which Angel Clare perceived, namely, the shade of
   </p>
   <p>
    his own limitations. With all his attempted independence of judgement
   </p>
   <p>
    this advanced and well-meaning young man, a sample product of the last
   </p>
   <p>
    five-and-twenty years, was yet the slave to custom and conventionality
   </p>
   <p>
    when surprised back into his early teachings. No prophet had told him,
   </p>
   <p>
    and he was not prophet enough to tell himself, that essentially this
   </p>
   <p>
    young wife of his was as deserving of the praise of King Lemuel as any
   </p>
   <p>
    other woman endowed with the same dislike of evil, her moral value
   </p>
   <p>
    having to be reckoned not by achievement but by tendency. Moreover, the
   </p>
   <p>
    figure near at hand suffers on such occasion, because it shows up its
   </p>
   <p>
    sorriness without shade; while vague figures afar off are honoured, in
   </p>
   <p>
    that their distance makes artistic virtues of their stains. In
   </p>
   <p>
    considering what Tess was not, he overlooked what she was, and forgot
   </p>
   <p>
    that the defective can be more than the entire.
   </p>
   <p>
    XL
   </p>
   <p>
    At breakfast Brazil was the topic, and all endeavoured to take a
   </p>
   <p>
    hopeful view of Clare’s proposed experiment with that country’s soil,
   </p>
   <p>
    notwithstanding the discouraging reports of some farm-labourers who had
   </p>
   <p>
    emigrated thither and returned home within the twelve months. After
   </p>
   <p>
    breakfast Clare went into the little town to wind up such trifling
   </p>
   <p>
    matters as he was concerned with there, and to get from the local bank
   </p>
   <p>
    all the money he possessed. On his way back he encountered Miss Mercy
   </p>
   <p>
    Chant by the church, from whose walls she seemed to be a sort of
   </p>
   <p>
    emanation. She was carrying an armful of Bibles for her class, and such
   </p>
   <p>
    was her view of life that events which produced heartache in others
   </p>
   <p>
    wrought beatific smiles upon her—an enviable result, although, in the
   </p>
   <p>
    opinion of Angel, it was obtained by a curiously unnatural sacrifice of
   </p>
   <p>
    humanity to mysticism.
   </p>
   <p>
    She had learnt that he was about to leave England, and observed what an
   </p>
   <p>
    excellent and promising scheme it seemed to be.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes; it is a likely scheme enough in a commercial sense, no doubt,” he
   </p>
   <p>
    replied. “But, my dear Mercy, it snaps the continuity of existence.
   </p>
   <p>
    Perhaps a cloister would be preferable.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “A cloister! O, Angel Clare!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why, you wicked man, a cloister implies a monk, and a monk Roman
   </p>
   <p>
    Catholicism.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And Roman Catholicism sin, and sin damnation. Thou art in a parlous
   </p>
   <p>
    state, Angel Clare.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “_I_ glory in my Protestantism!” she said severely.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then Clare, thrown by sheer misery into one of the demoniacal moods in
   </p>
   <p>
    which a man does despite to his true principles, called her close to
   </p>
   <p>
    him, and fiendishly whispered in her ear the most heterodox ideas he
   </p>
   <p>
    could think of. His momentary laughter at the horror which appeared on
   </p>
   <p>
    her fair face ceased when it merged in pain and anxiety for his
   </p>
   <p>
    welfare.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Dear Mercy,” he said, “you must forgive me. I think I am going crazy!”
   </p>
   <p>
    She thought that he was; and thus the interview ended, and Clare
   </p>
   <p>
    re-entered the Vicarage. With the local banker he deposited the jewels
   </p>
   <p>
    till happier days should arise. He also paid into the bank thirty
   </p>
   <p>
    pounds—to be sent to Tess in a few months, as she might require; and
   </p>
   <p>
    wrote to her at her parents’ home in Blackmoor Vale to inform her of
   </p>
   <p>
    what he had done. This amount, with the sum he had already placed in
   </p>
   <p>
    her hands—about fifty pounds—he hoped would be amply sufficient for her
   </p>
   <p>
    wants just at present, particularly as in an emergency she had been
   </p>
   <p>
    directed to apply to his father.
   </p>
   <p>
    He deemed it best not to put his parents into communication with her by
   </p>
   <p>
    informing them of her address; and, being unaware of what had really
   </p>
   <p>
    happened to estrange the two, neither his father nor his mother
   </p>
   <p>
    suggested that he should do so. During the day he left the parsonage,
   </p>
   <p>
    for what he had to complete he wished to get done quickly.
   </p>
   <p>
    As the last duty before leaving this part of England it was necessary
   </p>
   <p>
    for him to call at the Wellbridge farmhouse, in which he had spent with
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess the first three days of their marriage, the trifle of rent having
   </p>
   <p>
    to be paid, the key given up of the rooms they had occupied, and two or
   </p>
   <p>
    three small articles fetched away that they had left behind. It was
   </p>
   <p>
    under this roof that the deepest shadow ever thrown upon his life had
   </p>
   <p>
    stretched its gloom over him. Yet when he had unlocked the door of the
   </p>
   <p>
    sitting-room and looked into it, the memory which returned first upon
   </p>
   <p>
    him was that of their happy arrival on a similar afternoon, the first
   </p>
   <p>
    fresh sense of sharing a habitation conjointly, the first meal
   </p>
   <p>
    together, the chatting by the fire with joined hands.
   </p>
   <p>
    The farmer and his wife were in the field at the moment of his visit,
   </p>
   <p>
    and Clare was in the rooms alone for some time. Inwardly swollen with a
   </p>
   <p>
    renewal of sentiment that he had not quite reckoned with, he went
   </p>
   <p>
    upstairs to her chamber, which had never been his. The bed was smooth
   </p>
   <p>
    as she had made it with her own hands on the morning of leaving. The
   </p>
   <p>
    mistletoe hung under the tester just as he had placed it. Having been
   </p>
   <p>
    there three or four weeks it was turning colour, and the leaves and
   </p>
   <p>
    berries were wrinkled. Angel took it down and crushed it into the
   </p>
   <p>
    grate. Standing there, he for the first time doubted whether his course
   </p>
   <p>
    in this conjecture had been a wise, much less a generous, one. But had
   </p>
   <p>
    he not been cruelly blinded? In the incoherent multitude of his
   </p>
   <p>
    emotions he knelt down at the bedside wet-eyed. “O Tess! If you had
   </p>
   <p>
    only told me sooner, I would have forgiven you!” he mourned.
   </p>
   <p>
    Hearing a footstep below, he rose and went to the top of the stairs. At
   </p>
   <p>
    the bottom of the flight he saw a woman standing, and on her turning up
   </p>
   <p>
    her face recognized the pale, dark-eyed Izz Huett.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Mr Clare,” she said, “I’ve called to see you and Mrs Clare, and to
   </p>
   <p>
    inquire if ye be well. I thought you might be back here again.”
   </p>
   <p>
    This was a girl whose secret he had guessed, but who had not yet
   </p>
   <p>
    guessed his; an honest girl who loved him—one who would have made as
   </p>
   <p>
    good, or nearly as good, a practical farmer’s wife as Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am here alone,” he said; “we are not living here now.” Explaining
   </p>
   <p>
    why he had come, he asked, “Which way are you going home, Izz?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I have no home at Talbothays Dairy now, sir,” she said.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why is that?”
   </p>
   <p>
    Izz looked down.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It was so dismal there that I left! I am staying out this way.” She
   </p>
   <p>
    pointed in a contrary direction, the direction in which he was
   </p>
   <p>
    journeying.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well—are you going there now? I can take you if you wish for a lift.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Her olive complexion grew richer in hue.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Thank ’ee, Mr Clare,” she said.
   </p>
   <p>
    He soon found the farmer, and settled the account for his rent and the
   </p>
   <p>
    few other items which had to be considered by reason of the sudden
   </p>
   <p>
    abandonment of the lodgings. On Clare’s return to his horse and gig,
   </p>
   <p>
    Izz jumped up beside him.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am going to leave England, Izz,” he said, as they drove on. “Going
   </p>
   <p>
    to Brazil.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And do Mrs Clare like the notion of such a journey?” she asked.
   </p>
   <p>
    “She is not going at present—say for a year or so. I am going out to
   </p>
   <p>
    reconnoitre—to see what life there is like.”
   </p>
   <p>
    They sped along eastward for some considerable distance, Izz making no
   </p>
   <p>
    observation.
   </p>
   <p>
    “How are the others?” he inquired. “How is Retty?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “She was in a sort of nervous state when I zid her last; and so thin
   </p>
   <p>
    and hollow-cheeked that ’a do seem in a decline. Nobody will ever fall
   </p>
   <p>
    in love wi’ her any more,” said Izz absently.
   </p>
   <p>
    “And Marian?”
   </p>
   <p>
    Izz lowered her voice.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Marian drinks.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Indeed!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes. The dairyman has got rid of her.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And you!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t drink, and I bain’t in a decline. But—I am no great things at
   </p>
   <p>
    singing afore breakfast now!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “How is that? Do you remember how neatly you used to turn ‘’Twas down
   </p>
   <p>
    in Cupid’s Gardens’ and ‘The Tailor’s Breeches’ at morning milking?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah, yes! When you first came, sir, that was. Not when you had been
   </p>
   <p>
    there a bit.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why was that falling-off?”
   </p>
   <p>
    Her black eyes flashed up to his face for one moment by way of answer.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Izz!—how weak of you—for such as I!” he said, and fell into reverie.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Then—suppose I had asked _you_ to marry me?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “If you had I should have said ‘Yes’, and you would have married a
   </p>
   <p>
    woman who loved ’ee!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Really!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Down to the ground!” she whispered vehemently. “O my God! did you
   </p>
   <p>
    never guess it till now!”
   </p>
   <p>
    By-and-by they reached a branch road to a village.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I must get down. I live out there,” said Izz abruptly, never having
   </p>
   <p>
    spoken since her avowal.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare slowed the horse. He was incensed against his fate, bitterly
   </p>
   <p>
    disposed towards social ordinances; for they had cooped him up in a
   </p>
   <p>
    corner, out of which there was no legitimate pathway. Why not be
   </p>
   <p>
    revenged on society by shaping his future domesticities loosely,
   </p>
   <p>
    instead of kissing the pedagogic rod of convention in this ensnaring
   </p>
   <p>
    manner?
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am going to Brazil alone, Izz,” said he. “I have separated from my
   </p>
   <p>
    wife for personal, not voyaging, reasons. I may never live with her
   </p>
   <p>
    again. I may not be able to love you; but—will you go with me instead
   </p>
   <p>
    of her?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You truly wish me to go?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I do. I have been badly used enough to wish for relief. And you at
   </p>
   <p>
    least love me disinterestedly.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes—I will go,” said Izz, after a pause.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You will? You know what it means, Izz?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It means that I shall live with you for the time you are over
   </p>
   <p>
    there—that’s good enough for me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Remember, you are not to trust me in morals now. But I ought to remind
   </p>
   <p>
    you that it will be wrong-doing in the eyes of civilization—Western
   </p>
   <p>
    civilization, that is to say.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t mind that; no woman do when it comes to agony-point, and
   </p>
   <p>
    there’s no other way!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Then don’t get down, but sit where you are.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He drove past the cross-roads, one mile, two miles, without showing any
   </p>
   <p>
    signs of affection.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You love me very, very much, Izz?” he suddenly asked.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I do—I have said I do! I loved you all the time we was at the dairy
   </p>
   <p>
    together!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “More than Tess?”
   </p>
   <p>
    She shook her head.
   </p>
   <p>
    “No,” she murmured, “not more than she.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “How’s that?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Because nobody could love ’ee more than Tess did!... She would have
   </p>
   <p>
    laid down her life for ’ee. I could do no more.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Like the prophet on the top of Peor, Izz Huett would fain have spoken
   </p>
   <p>
    perversely at such a moment, but the fascination exercised over her
   </p>
   <p>
    rougher nature by Tess’s character compelled her to grace.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare was silent; his heart had risen at these straightforward words
   </p>
   <p>
    from such an unexpected unimpeachable quarter. In his throat was
   </p>
   <p>
    something as if a sob had solidified there. His ears repeated, “_She
   </p>
   <p>
    would have laid down her life for ’ee. I could do no more!_”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Forget our idle talk, Izz,” he said, turning the horse’s head
   </p>
   <p>
    suddenly. “I don’t know what I’ve been saying! I will now drive you
   </p>
   <p>
    back to where your lane branches off.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “So much for honesty towards ’ee! O—how can I bear it—how can I—how can
   </p>
   <p>
    I!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Izz Huett burst into wild tears, and beat her forehead as she saw what
   </p>
   <p>
    she had done.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Do you regret that poor little act of justice to an absent one? O,
   </p>
   <p>
    Izz, don’t spoil it by regret!”
   </p>
   <p>
    She stilled herself by degrees.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Very well, sir. Perhaps I didn’t know what I was saying, either,
   </p>
   <p>
    wh—when I agreed to go! I wish—what cannot be!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Because I have a loving wife already.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, yes! You have!”
   </p>
   <p>
    They reached the corner of the lane which they had passed half an hour
   </p>
   <p>
    earlier, and she hopped down.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Izz—please, please forget my momentary levity!” he cried. “It was so
   </p>
   <p>
    ill-considered, so ill-advised!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Forget it? Never, never! O, it was no levity to me!”
   </p>
   <p>
    He felt how richly he deserved the reproach that the wounded cry
   </p>
   <p>
    conveyed, and, in a sorrow that was inexpressible, leapt down and took
   </p>
   <p>
    her hand.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, but, Izz, we’ll part friends, anyhow? You don’t know what I’ve
   </p>
   <p>
    had to bear!”
   </p>
   <p>
    She was a really generous girl, and allowed no further bitterness to
   </p>
   <p>
    mar their adieux.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I forgive ’ee, sir!” she said.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Now, Izz,” he said, while she stood beside him there, forcing himself
   </p>
   <p>
    to the mentor’s part he was far from feeling; “I want you to tell
   </p>
   <p>
    Marian when you see her that she is to be a good woman, and not to give
   </p>
   <p>
    way to folly. Promise that, and tell Retty that there are more worthy
   </p>
   <p>
    men than I in the world, that for my sake she is to act wisely and
   </p>
   <p>
    well—remember the words—wisely and well—for my sake. I send this
   </p>
   <p>
    message to them as a dying man to the dying; for I shall never see them
   </p>
   <p>
    again. And you, Izzy, you have saved me by your honest words about my
   </p>
   <p>
    wife from an incredible impulse towards folly and treachery. Women may
   </p>
   <p>
    be bad, but they are not so bad as men in these things! On that one
   </p>
   <p>
    account I can never forget you. Be always the good and sincere girl you
   </p>
   <p>
    have hitherto been; and think of me as a worthless lover, but a
   </p>
   <p>
    faithful friend. Promise.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She gave the promise.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Heaven bless and keep you, sir. Goodbye!”
   </p>
   <p>
    He drove on; but no sooner had Izz turned into the lane, and Clare was
   </p>
   <p>
    out of sight, than she flung herself down on the bank in a fit of
   </p>
   <p>
    racking anguish; and it was with a strained unnatural face that she
   </p>
   <p>
    entered her mother’s cottage late that night. Nobody ever was told how
   </p>
   <p>
    Izz spent the dark hours that intervened between Angel Clare’s parting
   </p>
   <p>
    from her and her arrival home.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare, too, after bidding the girl farewell, was wrought to aching
   </p>
   <p>
    thoughts and quivering lips. But his sorrow was not for Izz. That
   </p>
   <p>
    evening he was within a feather-weight’s turn of abandoning his road to
   </p>
   <p>
    the nearest station, and driving across that elevated dorsal line of
   </p>
   <p>
    South Wessex which divided him from his Tess’s home. It was neither a
   </p>
   <p>
    contempt for her nature, nor the probable state of her heart, which
   </p>
   <p>
    deterred him.
   </p>
   <p>
    No; it was a sense that, despite her love, as corroborated by Izz’s
   </p>
   <p>
    admission, the facts had not changed. If he was right at first, he was
   </p>
   <p>
    right now. And the momentum of the course on which he had embarked
   </p>
   <p>
    tended to keep him going in it, unless diverted by a stronger, more
   </p>
   <p>
    sustained force than had played upon him this afternoon. He could soon
   </p>
   <p>
    come back to her. He took the train that night for London, and five
   </p>
   <p>
    days after shook hands in farewell of his brothers at the port of
   </p>
   <p>
    embarkation.
   </p>
   <p>
    XLI
   </p>
   <p>
    From the foregoing events of the winter-time let us press on to an
   </p>
   <p>
    October day, more than eight months subsequent to the parting of Clare
   </p>
   <p>
    and Tess. We discover the latter in changed conditions; instead of a
   </p>
   <p>
    bride with boxes and trunks which others bore, we see her a lonely
   </p>
   <p>
    woman with a basket and a bundle in her own porterage, as at an earlier
   </p>
   <p>
    time when she was no bride; instead of the ample means that were
   </p>
   <p>
    projected by her husband for her comfort through this probationary
   </p>
   <p>
    period, she can produce only a flattened purse.
   </p>
   <p>
    After again leaving Marlott, her home, she had got through the spring
   </p>
   <p>
    and summer without any great stress upon her physical powers, the time
   </p>
   <p>
    being mainly spent in rendering light irregular service at dairy-work
   </p>
   <p>
    near Port-Bredy to the west of the Blackmoor Valley, equally remote
   </p>
   <p>
    from her native place and from Talbothays. She preferred this to living
   </p>
   <p>
    on his allowance. Mentally she remained in utter stagnation, a
   </p>
   <p>
    condition which the mechanical occupation rather fostered than checked.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her consciousness was at that other dairy, at that other season, in the
   </p>
   <p>
    presence of the tender lover who had confronted her there—he who, the
   </p>
   <p>
    moment she had grasped him to keep for her own, had disappeared like a
   </p>
   <p>
    shape in a vision.
   </p>
   <p>
    The dairy-work lasted only till the milk began to lessen, for she had
   </p>
   <p>
    not met with a second regular engagement as at Talbothays, but had done
   </p>
   <p>
    duty as a supernumerary only. However, as harvest was now beginning,
   </p>
   <p>
    she had simply to remove from the pasture to the stubble to find plenty
   </p>
   <p>
    of further occupation, and this continued till harvest was done.
   </p>
   <p>
    Of the five-and-twenty pounds which had remained to her of Clare’s
   </p>
   <p>
    allowance, after deducting the other half of the fifty as a
   </p>
   <p>
    contribution to her parents for the trouble and expense to which she
   </p>
   <p>
    had put them, she had as yet spent but little. But there now followed
   </p>
   <p>
    an unfortunate interval of wet weather, during which she was obliged to
   </p>
   <p>
    fall back upon her sovereigns.
   </p>
   <p>
    She could not bear to let them go. Angel had put them into her hand,
   </p>
   <p>
    had obtained them bright and new from his bank for her; his touch had
   </p>
   <p>
    consecrated them to souvenirs of himself—they appeared to have had as
   </p>
   <p>
    yet no other history than such as was created by his and her own
   </p>
   <p>
    experiences—and to disperse them was like giving away relics. But she
   </p>
   <p>
    had to do it, and one by one they left her hands.
   </p>
   <p>
    She had been compelled to send her mother her address from time to
   </p>
   <p>
    time, but she concealed her circumstances. When her money had almost
   </p>
   <p>
    gone a letter from her mother reached her. Joan stated that they were
   </p>
   <p>
    in dreadful difficulty; the autumn rains had gone through the thatch of
   </p>
   <p>
    the house, which required entire renewal; but this could not be done
   </p>
   <p>
    because the previous thatching had never been paid for. New rafters and
   </p>
   <p>
    a new ceiling upstairs also were required, which, with the previous
   </p>
   <p>
    bill, would amount to a sum of twenty pounds. As her husband was a man
   </p>
   <p>
    of means, and had doubtless returned by this time, could she not send
   </p>
   <p>
    them the money?
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess had thirty pounds coming to her almost immediately from Angel’s
   </p>
   <p>
    bankers, and, the case being so deplorable, as soon as the sum was
   </p>
   <p>
    received she sent the twenty as requested. Part of the remainder she
   </p>
   <p>
    was obliged to expend in winter clothing, leaving only a nominal sum
   </p>
   <p>
    for the whole inclement season at hand. When the last pound had gone, a
   </p>
   <p>
    remark of Angel’s that whenever she required further resources she was
   </p>
   <p>
    to apply to his father, remained to be considered.
   </p>
   <p>
    But the more Tess thought of the step, the more reluctant was she to
   </p>
   <p>
    take it. The same delicacy, pride, false shame, whatever it may be
   </p>
   <p>
    called, on Clare’s account, which had led her to hide from her own
   </p>
   <p>
    parents the prolongation of the estrangement, hindered her owning to
   </p>
   <p>
    his that she was in want after the fair allowance he had left her. They
   </p>
   <p>
    probably despised her already; how much more they would despise her in
   </p>
   <p>
    the character of a mendicant! The consequence was that by no effort
   </p>
   <p>
    could the parson’s daughter-in-law bring herself to let him know her
   </p>
   <p>
    state.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her reluctance to communicate with her husband’s parents might, she
   </p>
   <p>
    thought, lessen with the lapse of time; but with her own the reverse
   </p>
   <p>
    obtained. On her leaving their house after the short visit subsequent
   </p>
   <p>
    to her marriage they were under the impression that she was ultimately
   </p>
   <p>
    going to join her husband; and from that time to the present she had
   </p>
   <p>
    done nothing to disturb their belief that she was awaiting his return
   </p>
   <p>
    in comfort, hoping against hope that his journey to Brazil would result
   </p>
   <p>
    in a short stay only, after which he would come to fetch her, or that
   </p>
   <p>
    he would write for her to join him; in any case that they would soon
   </p>
   <p>
    present a united front to their families and the world. This hope she
   </p>
   <p>
    still fostered. To let her parents know that she was a deserted wife,
   </p>
   <p>
    dependent, now that she had relieved their necessities, on her own
   </p>
   <p>
    hands for a living, after the _éclat_ of a marriage which was to
   </p>
   <p>
    nullify the collapse of the first attempt, would be too much indeed.
   </p>
   <p>
    The set of brilliants returned to her mind. Where Clare had deposited
   </p>
   <p>
    them she did not know, and it mattered little, if it were true that she
   </p>
   <p>
    could only use and not sell them. Even were they absolutely hers it
   </p>
   <p>
    would be passing mean to enrich herself by a legal title to them which
   </p>
   <p>
    was not essentially hers at all.
   </p>
   <p>
    Meanwhile her husband’s days had been by no means free from trial. At
   </p>
   <p>
    this moment he was lying ill of fever in the clay lands near Curitiba
   </p>
   <p>
    in Brazil, having been drenched with thunder-storms and persecuted by
   </p>
   <p>
    other hardships, in common with all the English farmers and
   </p>
   <p>
    farm-labourers who, just at this time, were deluded into going thither
   </p>
   <p>
    by the promises of the Brazilian Government, and by the baseless
   </p>
   <p>
    assumption that those frames which, ploughing and sowing on English
   </p>
   <p>
    uplands, had resisted all the weathers to whose moods they had been
   </p>
   <p>
    born, could resist equally well all the weathers by which they were
   </p>
   <p>
    surprised on Brazilian plains.
   </p>
   <p>
    To return. Thus it happened that when the last of Tess’s sovereigns had
   </p>
   <p>
    been spent she was unprovided with others to take their place, while on
   </p>
   <p>
    account of the season she found it increasingly difficult to get
   </p>
   <p>
    employment. Not being aware of the rarity of intelligence, energy,
   </p>
   <p>
    health, and willingness in any sphere of life, she refrained from
   </p>
   <p>
    seeking an indoor occupation; fearing towns, large houses, people of
   </p>
   <p>
    means and social sophistication, and of manners other than rural. From
   </p>
   <p>
    that direction of gentility Black Care had come. Society might be
   </p>
   <p>
    better than she supposed from her slight experience of it. But she had
   </p>
   <p>
    no proof of this, and her instinct in the circumstances was to avoid
   </p>
   <p>
    its purlieus.
   </p>
   <p>
    The small dairies to the west, beyond Port-Bredy, in which she had
   </p>
   <p>
    served as supernumerary milkmaid during the spring and summer required
   </p>
   <p>
    no further aid. Room would probably have been made for her at
   </p>
   <p>
    Talbothays, if only out of sheer compassion; but comfortable as her
   </p>
   <p>
    life had been there, she could not go back. The anti-climax would be
   </p>
   <p>
    too intolerable; and her return might bring reproach upon her idolized
   </p>
   <p>
    husband. She could not have borne their pity, and their whispered
   </p>
   <p>
    remarks to one another upon her strange situation; though she would
   </p>
   <p>
    almost have faced a knowledge of her circumstances by every individual
   </p>
   <p>
    there, so long as her story had remained isolated in the mind of each.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was the interchange of ideas about her that made her sensitiveness
   </p>
   <p>
    wince. Tess could not account for this distinction; she simply knew
   </p>
   <p>
    that she felt it.
   </p>
   <p>
    She was now on her way to an upland farm in the centre of the county,
   </p>
   <p>
    to which she had been recommended by a wandering letter which had
   </p>
   <p>
    reached her from Marian. Marian had somehow heard that Tess was
   </p>
   <p>
    separated from her husband—probably through Izz Huett—and the
   </p>
   <p>
    good-natured and now tippling girl, deeming Tess in trouble, had
   </p>
   <p>
    hastened to notify to her former friend that she herself had gone to
   </p>
   <p>
    this upland spot after leaving the dairy, and would like to see her
   </p>
   <p>
    there, where there was room for other hands, if it was really true that
   </p>
   <p>
    she worked again as of old.
   </p>
   <p>
    With the shortening of the days all hope of obtaining her husband’s
   </p>
   <p>
    forgiveness began to leave her; and there was something of the habitude
   </p>
   <p>
    of the wild animal in the unreflecting instinct with which she rambled
   </p>
   <p>
    on—disconnecting herself by littles from her eventful past at every
   </p>
   <p>
    step, obliterating her identity, giving no thought to accidents or
   </p>
   <p>
    contingencies which might make a quick discovery of her whereabouts by
   </p>
   <p>
    others of importance to her own happiness, if not to theirs.
   </p>
   <p>
    Among the difficulties of her lonely position not the least was the
   </p>
   <p>
    attention she excited by her appearance, a certain bearing of
   </p>
   <p>
    distinction, which she had caught from Clare, being superadded to her
   </p>
   <p>
    natural attractiveness. Whilst the clothes lasted which had been
   </p>
   <p>
    prepared for her marriage, these casual glances of interest caused her
   </p>
   <p>
    no inconvenience, but as soon as she was compelled to don the wrapper
   </p>
   <p>
    of a fieldwoman, rude words were addressed to her more than once; but
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing occurred to cause her bodily fear till a particular November
   </p>
   <p>
    afternoon.
   </p>
   <p>
    She had preferred the country west of the River Brit to the upland farm
   </p>
   <p>
    for which she was now bound, because, for one thing, it was nearer to
   </p>
   <p>
    the home of her husband’s father; and to hover about that region
   </p>
   <p>
    unrecognized, with the notion that she might decide to call at the
   </p>
   <p>
    Vicarage some day, gave her pleasure. But having once decided to try
   </p>
   <p>
    the higher and drier levels, she pressed back eastward, marching afoot
   </p>
   <p>
    towards the village of Chalk-Newton, where she meant to pass the night.
   </p>
   <p>
    The lane was long and unvaried, and, owing to the rapid shortening of
   </p>
   <p>
    the days, dusk came upon her before she was aware. She had reached the
   </p>
   <p>
    top of a hill down which the lane stretched its serpentine length in
   </p>
   <p>
    glimpses, when she heard footsteps behind her back, and in a few
   </p>
   <p>
    moments she was overtaken by a man. He stepped up alongside Tess and
   </p>
   <p>
    said—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Good night, my pretty maid”: to which she civilly replied.
   </p>
   <p>
    The light still remaining in the sky lit up her face, though the
   </p>
   <p>
    landscape was nearly dark. The man turned and stared hard at her.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why, surely, it is the young wench who was at Trantridge awhile—young
   </p>
   <p>
    Squire d’Urberville’s friend? I was there at that time, though I don’t
   </p>
   <p>
    live there now.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She recognized in him the well-to-do boor whom Angel had knocked down
   </p>
   <p>
    at the inn for addressing her coarsely. A spasm of anguish shot through
   </p>
   <p>
    her, and she returned him no answer.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Be honest enough to own it, and that what I said in the town was true,
   </p>
   <p>
    though your fancy-man was so up about it—hey, my sly one? You ought to
   </p>
   <p>
    beg my pardon for that blow of his, considering.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Still no answer came from Tess. There seemed only one escape for her
   </p>
   <p>
    hunted soul. She suddenly took to her heels with the speed of the wind,
   </p>
   <p>
    and, without looking behind her, ran along the road till she came to a
   </p>
   <p>
    gate which opened directly into a plantation. Into this she plunged,
   </p>
   <p>
    and did not pause till she was deep enough in its shade to be safe
   </p>
   <p>
    against any possibility of discovery.
   </p>
   <p>
    Under foot the leaves were dry, and the foliage of some holly bushes
   </p>
   <p>
    which grew among the deciduous trees was dense enough to keep off
   </p>
   <p>
    draughts. She scraped together the dead leaves till she had formed them
   </p>
   <p>
    into a large heap, making a sort of nest in the middle. Into this Tess
   </p>
   <p>
    crept.
   </p>
   <p>
    Such sleep as she got was naturally fitful; she fancied she heard
   </p>
   <p>
    strange noises, but persuaded herself that they were caused by the
   </p>
   <p>
    breeze. She thought of her husband in some vague warm clime on the
   </p>
   <p>
    other side of the globe, while she was here in the cold. Was there
   </p>
   <p>
    another such a wretched being as she in the world? Tess asked herself;
   </p>
   <p>
    and, thinking of her wasted life, said, “All is vanity.” She repeated
   </p>
   <p>
    the words mechanically, till she reflected that this was a most
   </p>
   <p>
    inadequate thought for modern days. Solomon had thought as far as that
   </p>
   <p>
    more than two thousand years ago; she herself, though not in the van of
   </p>
   <p>
    thinkers, had got much further. If all were only vanity, who would mind
   </p>
   <p>
    it? All was, alas, worse than vanity—injustice, punishment, exaction,
   </p>
   <p>
    death. The wife of Angel Clare put her hand to her brow, and felt its
   </p>
   <p>
    curve, and the edges of her eye-sockets perceptible under the soft
   </p>
   <p>
    skin, and thought as she did so that a time would come when that bone
   </p>
   <p>
    would be bare. “I wish it were now,” she said.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the midst of these whimsical fancies she heard a new strange sound
   </p>
   <p>
    among the leaves. It might be the wind; yet there was scarcely any
   </p>
   <p>
    wind. Sometimes it was a palpitation, sometimes a flutter; sometimes it
   </p>
   <p>
    was a sort of gasp or gurgle. Soon she was certain that the noises came
   </p>
   <p>
    from wild creatures of some kind, the more so when, originating in the
   </p>
   <p>
    boughs overhead, they were followed by the fall of a heavy body upon
   </p>
   <p>
    the ground. Had she been ensconced here under other and more pleasant
   </p>
   <p>
    conditions she would have become alarmed; but, outside humanity, she
   </p>
   <p>
    had at present no fear.
   </p>
   <p>
    Day at length broke in the sky. When it had been day aloft for some
   </p>
   <p>
    little while it became day in the wood.
   </p>
   <p>
    Directly the assuring and prosaic light of the world’s active hours had
   </p>
   <p>
    grown strong, she crept from under her hillock of leaves, and looked
   </p>
   <p>
    around boldly. Then she perceived what had been going on to disturb
   </p>
   <p>
    her. The plantation wherein she had taken shelter ran down at this spot
   </p>
   <p>
    into a peak, which ended it hitherward, outside the hedge being arable
   </p>
   <p>
    ground. Under the trees several pheasants lay about, their rich plumage
   </p>
   <p>
    dabbled with blood; some were dead, some feebly twitching a wing, some
   </p>
   <p>
    staring up at the sky, some pulsating quickly, some contorted, some
   </p>
   <p>
    stretched out—all of them writhing in agony, except the fortunate ones
   </p>
   <p>
    whose tortures had ended during the night by the inability of nature to
   </p>
   <p>
    bear more.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess guessed at once the meaning of this. The birds had been driven
   </p>
   <p>
    down into this corner the day before by some shooting-party; and while
   </p>
   <p>
    those that had dropped dead under the shot, or had died before
   </p>
   <p>
    nightfall, had been searched for and carried off, many badly wounded
   </p>
   <p>
    birds had escaped and hidden themselves away, or risen among the thick
   </p>
   <p>
    boughs, where they had maintained their position till they grew weaker
   </p>
   <p>
    with loss of blood in the night-time, when they had fallen one by one
   </p>
   <p>
    as she had heard them.
   </p>
   <p>
    She had occasionally caught glimpses of these men in girlhood, looking
   </p>
   <p>
    over hedges, or peeping through bushes, and pointing their guns,
   </p>
   <p>
    strangely accoutred, a bloodthirsty light in their eyes. She had been
   </p>
   <p>
    told that, rough and brutal as they seemed just then, they were not
   </p>
   <p>
    like this all the year round, but were, in fact, quite civil persons
   </p>
   <p>
    save during certain weeks of autumn and winter, when, like the
   </p>
   <p>
    inhabitants of the Malay Peninsula, they ran amuck, and made it their
   </p>
   <p>
    purpose to destroy life—in this case harmless feathered creatures,
   </p>
   <p>
    brought into being by artificial means solely to gratify these
   </p>
   <p>
    propensities—at once so unmannerly and so unchivalrous towards their
   </p>
   <p>
    weaker fellows in Nature’s teeming family.
   </p>
   <p>
    With the impulse of a soul who could feel for kindred sufferers as much
   </p>
   <p>
    as for herself, Tess’s first thought was to put the still living birds
   </p>
   <p>
    out of their torture, and to this end with her own hands she broke the
   </p>
   <p>
    necks of as many as she could find, leaving them to lie where she had
   </p>
   <p>
    found them till the game-keepers should come—as they probably would
   </p>
   <p>
    come—to look for them a second time.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Poor darlings—to suppose myself the most miserable being on earth in
   </p>
   <p>
    the sight o’ such misery as yours!” she exclaimed, her tears running
   </p>
   <p>
    down as she killed the birds tenderly. “And not a twinge of bodily pain
   </p>
   <p>
    about me! I be not mangled, and I be not bleeding, and I have two hands
   </p>
   <p>
    to feed and clothe me.” She was ashamed of herself for her gloom of the
   </p>
   <p>
    night, based on nothing more tangible than a sense of condemnation
   </p>
   <p>
    under an arbitrary law of society which had no foundation in Nature.
   </p>
   <p>
    XLII
   </p>
   <p>
    It was now broad day, and she started again, emerging cautiously upon
   </p>
   <p>
    the highway. But there was no need for caution; not a soul was at hand,
   </p>
   <p>
    and Tess went onward with fortitude, her recollection of the birds’
   </p>
   <p>
    silent endurance of their night of agony impressing upon her the
   </p>
   <p>
    relativity of sorrows and the tolerable nature of her own, if she could
   </p>
   <p>
    once rise high enough to despise opinion. But that she could not do so
   </p>
   <p>
    long as it was held by Clare.
   </p>
   <p>
    She reached Chalk-Newton, and breakfasted at an inn, where several
   </p>
   <p>
    young men were troublesomely complimentary to her good looks. Somehow
   </p>
   <p>
    she felt hopeful, for was it not possible that her husband also might
   </p>
   <p>
    say these same things to her even yet? She was bound to take care of
   </p>
   <p>
    herself on the chance of it, and keep off these casual lovers. To this
   </p>
   <p>
    end Tess resolved to run no further risks from her appearance. As soon
   </p>
   <p>
    as she got out of the village she entered a thicket and took from her
   </p>
   <p>
    basket one of the oldest field-gowns, which she had never put on even
   </p>
   <p>
    at the dairy—never since she had worked among the stubble at Marlott.
   </p>
   <p>
    She also, by a felicitous thought, took a handkerchief from her bundle
   </p>
   <p>
    and tied it round her face under her bonnet, covering her chin and half
   </p>
   <p>
    her cheeks and temples, as if she were suffering from toothache. Then
   </p>
   <p>
    with her little scissors, by the aid of a pocket looking-glass, she
   </p>
   <p>
    mercilessly nipped her eyebrows off, and thus insured against
   </p>
   <p>
    aggressive admiration, she went on her uneven way.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What a mommet of a maid!” said the next man who met her to a
   </p>
   <p>
    companion.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tears came into her eyes for very pity of herself as she heard him.
   </p>
   <p>
    “But I don’t care!” she said. “O no—I don’t care! I’ll always be ugly
   </p>
   <p>
    now, because Angel is not here, and I have nobody to take care of me.
   </p>
   <p>
    My husband that was is gone away, and never will love me any more; but
   </p>
   <p>
    I love him just the same, and hate all other men, and like to make ’em
   </p>
   <p>
    think scornfully of me!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus Tess walks on; a figure which is part of the landscape; a
   </p>
   <p>
    fieldwoman pure and simple, in winter guise; a gray serge cape, a red
   </p>
   <p>
    woollen cravat, a stuff skirt covered by a whitey-brown rough wrapper,
   </p>
   <p>
    and buff-leather gloves. Every thread of that old attire has become
   </p>
   <p>
    faded and thin under the stroke of raindrops, the burn of sunbeams, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the stress of winds. There is no sign of young passion in her now—
   </p>
   <p>
    The maiden’s mouth is cold
   </p>
   <p>
    . . . . .
   </p>
   <p>
    Fold over simple fold
   </p>
   <p>
    Binding her head.
   </p>
   <p>
    Inside this exterior, over which the eye might have roved as over a
   </p>
   <p>
    thing scarcely percipient, almost inorganic, there was the record of a
   </p>
   <p>
    pulsing life which had learnt too well, for its years, of the dust and
   </p>
   <p>
    ashes of things, of the cruelty of lust and the fragility of love.
   </p>
   <p>
    Next day the weather was bad, but she trudged on, the honesty,
   </p>
   <p>
    directness, and impartiality of elemental enmity disconcerting her but
   </p>
   <p>
    little. Her object being a winter’s occupation and a winter’s home,
   </p>
   <p>
    there was no time to lose. Her experience of short hirings had been
   </p>
   <p>
    such that she was determined to accept no more.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus she went forward from farm to farm in the direction of the place
   </p>
   <p>
    whence Marian had written to her, which she determined to make use of
   </p>
   <p>
    as a last shift only, its rumoured stringencies being the reverse of
   </p>
   <p>
    tempting. First she inquired for the lighter kinds of employment, and,
   </p>
   <p>
    as acceptance in any variety of these grew hopeless, applied next for
   </p>
   <p>
    the less light, till, beginning with the dairy and poultry tendance
   </p>
   <p>
    that she liked best, she ended with the heavy and course pursuits which
   </p>
   <p>
    she liked least—work on arable land: work of such roughness, indeed, as
   </p>
   <p>
    she would never have deliberately voluteered for.
   </p>
   <p>
    Towards the second evening she reached the irregular chalk table-land
   </p>
   <p>
    or plateau, bosomed with semi-globular tumuli—as if Cybele the
   </p>
   <p>
    Many-breasted were supinely extended there—which stretched between the
   </p>
   <p>
    valley of her birth and the valley of her love.
   </p>
   <p>
    Here the air was dry and cold, and the long cart-roads were blown white
   </p>
   <p>
    and dusty within a few hours after rain. There were few trees, or none,
   </p>
   <p>
    those that would have grown in the hedges being mercilessly plashed
   </p>
   <p>
    down with the quickset by the tenant-farmers, the natural enemies of
   </p>
   <p>
    tree, bush, and brake. In the middle distance ahead of her she could
   </p>
   <p>
    see the summits of Bulbarrow and of Nettlecombe Tout, and they seemed
   </p>
   <p>
    friendly. They had a low and unassuming aspect from this upland, though
   </p>
   <p>
    as approached on the other side from Blackmoor in her childhood they
   </p>
   <p>
    were as lofty bastions against the sky. Southerly, at many miles’
   </p>
   <p>
    distance, and over the hills and ridges coastward, she could discern a
   </p>
   <p>
    surface like polished steel: it was the English Channel at a point far
   </p>
   <p>
    out towards France.
   </p>
   <p>
    Before her, in a slight depression, were the remains of a village. She
   </p>
   <p>
    had, in fact, reached Flintcomb-Ash, the place of Marian’s sojourn.
   </p>
   <p>
    There seemed to be no help for it; hither she was doomed to come. The
   </p>
   <p>
    stubborn soil around her showed plainly enough that the kind of labour
   </p>
   <p>
    in demand here was of the roughest kind; but it was time to rest from
   </p>
   <p>
    searching, and she resolved to stay, particularly as it began to rain.
   </p>
   <p>
    At the entrance to the village was a cottage whose gable jutted into
   </p>
   <p>
    the road, and before applying for a lodging she stood under its
   </p>
   <p>
    shelter, and watched the evening close in.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Who would think I was Mrs Angel Clare!” she said.
   </p>
   <p>
    The wall felt warm to her back and shoulders, and she found that
   </p>
   <p>
    immediately within the gable was the cottage fireplace, the heat of
   </p>
   <p>
    which came through the bricks. She warmed her hands upon them, and also
   </p>
   <p>
    put her cheek—red and moist with the drizzle—against their comforting
   </p>
   <p>
    surface. The wall seemed to be the only friend she had. She had so
   </p>
   <p>
    little wish to leave it that she could have stayed there all night.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess could hear the occupants of the cottage—gathered together after
   </p>
   <p>
    their day’s labour—talking to each other within, and the rattle of
   </p>
   <p>
    their supper-plates was also audible. But in the village-street she had
   </p>
   <p>
    seen no soul as yet. The solitude was at last broken by the approach of
   </p>
   <p>
    one feminine figure, who, though the evening was cold, wore the print
   </p>
   <p>
    gown and the tilt-bonnet of summer time. Tess instinctively thought it
   </p>
   <p>
    might be Marian, and when she came near enough to be distinguishable in
   </p>
   <p>
    the gloom, surely enough it was she. Marian was even stouter and redder
   </p>
   <p>
    in the face than formerly, and decidedly shabbier in attire. At any
   </p>
   <p>
    previous period of her existence Tess would hardly have cared to renew
   </p>
   <p>
    the acquaintance in such conditions; but her loneliness was excessive,
   </p>
   <p>
    and she responded readily to Marian’s greeting.
   </p>
   <p>
    Marian was quite respectful in her inquiries, but seemed much moved by
   </p>
   <p>
    the fact that Tess should still continue in no better condition than at
   </p>
   <p>
    first; though she had dimly heard of the separation.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tess—Mrs Clare—the dear wife of dear he! And is it really so bad as
   </p>
   <p>
    this, my child? Why is your cwomely face tied up in such a way? Anybody
   </p>
   <p>
    been beating ’ee? Not _he_?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No, no, no! I merely did it not to be clipsed or colled, Marian.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She pulled off in disgust a bandage which could suggest such wild
   </p>
   <p>
    thoughts.
   </p>
   <p>
    “And you’ve got no collar on” (Tess had been accustomed to wear a
   </p>
   <p>
    little white collar at the dairy).
   </p>
   <p>
    “I know it, Marian.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You’ve lost it travelling.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’ve not lost it. The truth is, I don’t care anything about my looks;
   </p>
   <p>
    and so I didn’t put it on.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And you don’t wear your wedding-ring?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, I do; but not in public. I wear it round my neck on a ribbon. I
   </p>
   <p>
    don’t wish people to think who I am by marriage, or that I am married
   </p>
   <p>
    at all; it would be so awkward while I lead my present life.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Marian paused.
   </p>
   <p>
    “But you _be_ a gentleman’s wife; and it seems hardly fair that you
   </p>
   <p>
    should live like this!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O yes it is, quite fair; though I am very unhappy.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, well. _He_ married you—and you can be unhappy!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Wives are unhappy sometimes; from no fault of their husbands—from
   </p>
   <p>
    their own.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You’ve no faults, deary; that I’m sure of. And he’s none. So it must
   </p>
   <p>
    be something outside ye both.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Marian, dear Marian, will you do me a good turn without asking
   </p>
   <p>
    questions? My husband has gone abroad, and somehow I have overrun my
   </p>
   <p>
    allowance, so that I have to fall back upon my old work for a time. Do
   </p>
   <p>
    not call me Mrs Clare, but Tess, as before. Do they want a hand here?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O yes; they’ll take one always, because few care to come. ’Tis a
   </p>
   <p>
    starve-acre place. Corn and swedes are all they grow. Though I be here
   </p>
   <p>
    myself, I feel ’tis a pity for such as you to come.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But you used to be as good a dairywoman as I.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes; but I’ve got out o’ that since I took to drink. Lord, that’s the
   </p>
   <p>
    only comfort I’ve got now! If you engage, you’ll be set swede-hacking.
   </p>
   <p>
    That’s what I be doing; but you won’t like it.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O—anything! Will you speak for me?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You will do better by speaking for yourself.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Very well. Now, Marian, remember—nothing about _him_ if I get the
   </p>
   <p>
    place. I don’t wish to bring his name down to the dirt.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Marian, who was really a trustworthy girl though of coarser grain than
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess, promised anything she asked.
   </p>
   <p>
    “This is pay-night,” she said, “and if you were to come with me you
   </p>
   <p>
    would know at once. I be real sorry that you are not happy; but ’tis
   </p>
   <p>
    because he’s away, I know. You couldn’t be unhappy if he were here,
   </p>
   <p>
    even if he gie’d ye no money—even if he used you like a drudge.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “That’s true; I could not!”
   </p>
   <p>
    They walked on together and soon reached the farmhouse, which was
   </p>
   <p>
    almost sublime in its dreariness. There was not a tree within sight;
   </p>
   <p>
    there was not, at this season, a green pasture—nothing but fallow and
   </p>
   <p>
    turnips everywhere, in large fields divided by hedges plashed to
   </p>
   <p>
    unrelieved levels.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess waited outside the door of the farmhouse till the group of
   </p>
   <p>
    workfolk had received their wages, and then Marian introduced her. The
   </p>
   <p>
    farmer himself, it appeared, was not at home, but his wife, who
   </p>
   <p>
    represented him this evening, made no objection to hiring Tess, on her
   </p>
   <p>
    agreeing to remain till Old Lady-Day. Female field-labour was seldom
   </p>
   <p>
    offered now, and its cheapness made it profitable for tasks which women
   </p>
   <p>
    could perform as readily as men.
   </p>
   <p>
    Having signed the agreement, there was nothing more for Tess to do at
   </p>
   <p>
    present than to get a lodging, and she found one in the house at whose
   </p>
   <p>
    gable-wall she had warmed herself. It was a poor subsistence that she
   </p>
   <p>
    had ensured, but it would afford a shelter for the winter at any rate.
   </p>
   <p>
    That night she wrote to inform her parents of her new address, in case
   </p>
   <p>
    a letter should arrive at Marlott from her husband. But she did not
   </p>
   <p>
    tell them of the sorriness of her situation: it might have brought
   </p>
   <p>
    reproach upon him.
   </p>
   <p>
    XLIII
   </p>
   <p>
    There was no exaggeration in Marian’s definition of Flintcomb-Ash farm
   </p>
   <p>
    as a starve-acre place. The single fat thing on the soil was Marian
   </p>
   <p>
    herself; and she was an importation. Of the three classes of village,
   </p>
   <p>
    the village cared for by its lord, the village cared for by itself, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the village uncared for either by itself or by its lord (in other
   </p>
   <p>
    words, the village of a resident squire’s tenantry, the village of free
   </p>
   <p>
    or copy-holders, and the absentee-owner’s village, farmed with the
   </p>
   <p>
    land) this place, Flintcomb-Ash, was the third.
   </p>
   <p>
    But Tess set to work. Patience, that blending of moral courage with
   </p>
   <p>
    physical timidity, was now no longer a minor feature in Mrs Angel
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare; and it sustained her.
   </p>
   <p>
    The swede-field in which she and her companion were set hacking was a
   </p>
   <p>
    stretch of a hundred odd acres in one patch, on the highest ground of
   </p>
   <p>
    the farm, rising above stony lanchets or lynchets—the outcrop of
   </p>
   <p>
    siliceous veins in the chalk formation, composed of myriads of loose
   </p>
   <p>
    white flints in bulbous, cusped, and phallic shapes. The upper half of
   </p>
   <p>
    each turnip had been eaten off by the live-stock, and it was the
   </p>
   <p>
    business of the two women to grub up the lower or earthy half of the
   </p>
   <p>
    root with a hooked fork called a hacker, that it might be eaten also.
   </p>
   <p>
    Every leaf of the vegetable having already been consumed, the whole
   </p>
   <p>
    field was in colour a desolate drab; it was a complexion without
   </p>
   <p>
    features, as if a face, from chin to brow, should be only an expanse of
   </p>
   <p>
    skin. The sky wore, in another colour, the same likeness; a white
   </p>
   <p>
    vacuity of countenance with the lineaments gone. So these two upper and
   </p>
   <p>
    nether visages confronted each other all day long, the white face
   </p>
   <p>
    looking down on the brown face, and the brown face looking up at the
   </p>
   <p>
    white face, without anything standing between them but the two girls
   </p>
   <p>
    crawling over the surface of the former like flies.
   </p>
   <p>
    Nobody came near them, and their movements showed a mechanical
   </p>
   <p>
    regularity; their forms standing enshrouded in Hessian
   </p>
   <p>
    “wroppers”—sleeved brown pinafores, tied behind to the bottom, to keep
   </p>
   <p>
    their gowns from blowing about—scant skirts revealing boots that
   </p>
   <p>
    reached high up the ankles, and yellow sheepskin gloves with gauntlets.
   </p>
   <p>
    The pensive character which the curtained hood lent to their bent heads
   </p>
   <p>
    would have reminded the observer of some early Italian conception of
   </p>
   <p>
    the two Marys.
   </p>
   <p>
    They worked on hour after hour, unconscious of the forlorn aspect they
   </p>
   <p>
    bore in the landscape, not thinking of the justice or injustice of
   </p>
   <p>
    their lot. Even in such a position as theirs it was possible to exist
   </p>
   <p>
    in a dream. In the afternoon the rain came on again, and Marian said
   </p>
   <p>
    that they need not work any more. But if they did not work they would
   </p>
   <p>
    not be paid; so they worked on. It was so high a situation, this field,
   </p>
   <p>
    that the rain had no occasion to fall, but raced along horizontally
   </p>
   <p>
    upon the yelling wind, sticking into them like glass splinters till
   </p>
   <p>
    they were wet through. Tess had not known till now what was really
   </p>
   <p>
    meant by that. There are degrees of dampness, and a very little is
   </p>
   <p>
    called being wet through in common talk. But to stand working slowly in
   </p>
   <p>
    a field, and feel the creep of rain-water, first in legs and shoulders,
   </p>
   <p>
    then on hips and head, then at back, front, and sides, and yet to work
   </p>
   <p>
    on till the leaden light diminishes and marks that the sun is down,
   </p>
   <p>
    demands a distinct modicum of stoicism, even of valour.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet they did not feel the wetness so much as might be supposed. They
   </p>
   <p>
    were both young, and they were talking of the time when they lived and
   </p>
   <p>
    loved together at Talbothays Dairy, that happy green tract of land
   </p>
   <p>
    where summer had been liberal in her gifts; in substance to all,
   </p>
   <p>
    emotionally to these. Tess would fain not have conversed with Marian of
   </p>
   <p>
    the man who was legally, if not actually, her husband; but the
   </p>
   <p>
    irresistible fascination of the subject betrayed her into reciprocating
   </p>
   <p>
    Marian’s remarks. And thus, as has been said, though the damp curtains
   </p>
   <p>
    of their bonnets flapped smartly into their faces, and their wrappers
   </p>
   <p>
    clung about them to wearisomeness, they lived all this afternoon in
   </p>
   <p>
    memories of green, sunny, romantic Talbothays.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You can see a gleam of a hill within a few miles o’ Froom Valley from
   </p>
   <p>
    here when ’tis fine,” said Marian.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah! Can you?” said Tess, awake to the new value of this locality.
   </p>
   <p>
    So the two forces were at work here as everywhere, the inherent will to
   </p>
   <p>
    enjoy, and the circumstantial will against enjoyment. Marian’s will had
   </p>
   <p>
    a method of assisting itself by taking from her pocket as the afternoon
   </p>
   <p>
    wore on a pint bottle corked with white rag, from which she invited
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess to drink. Tess’s unassisted power of dreaming, however, being
   </p>
   <p>
    enough for her sublimation at present, she declined except the merest
   </p>
   <p>
    sip, and then Marian took a pull from the spirits.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’ve got used to it,” she said, “and can’t leave it off now. ’Tis my
   </p>
   <p>
    only comfort—You see I lost him: you didn’t; and you can do without it
   </p>
   <p>
    perhaps.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess thought her loss as great as Marian’s, but upheld by the dignity
   </p>
   <p>
    of being Angel’s wife, in the letter at least, she accepted Marian’s
   </p>
   <p>
    differentiation.
   </p>
   <p>
    Amid this scene Tess slaved in the morning frosts and in the afternoon
   </p>
   <p>
    rains. When it was not swede-grubbing it was swede-trimming, in which
   </p>
   <p>
    process they sliced off the earth and the fibres with a bill-hook
   </p>
   <p>
    before storing the roots for future use. At this occupation they could
   </p>
   <p>
    shelter themselves by a thatched hurdle if it rained; but if it was
   </p>
   <p>
    frosty even their thick leather gloves could not prevent the frozen
   </p>
   <p>
    masses they handled from biting their fingers. Still Tess hoped. She
   </p>
   <p>
    had a conviction that sooner or later the magnanimity which she
   </p>
   <p>
    persisted in reckoning as a chief ingredient of Clare’s character would
   </p>
   <p>
    lead him to rejoin her.
   </p>
   <p>
    Marian, primed to a humorous mood, would discover the queer-shaped
   </p>
   <p>
    flints aforesaid, and shriek with laughter, Tess remaining severely
   </p>
   <p>
    obtuse. They often looked across the country to where the Var or Froom
   </p>
   <p>
    was known to stretch, even though they might not be able to see it;
   </p>
   <p>
    and, fixing their eyes on the cloaking gray mist, imagined the old
   </p>
   <p>
    times they had spent out there.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah,” said Marian, “how I should like another or two of our old set to
   </p>
   <p>
    come here! Then we could bring up Talbothays every day here afield, and
   </p>
   <p>
    talk of he, and of what nice times we had there, and o’ the old things
   </p>
   <p>
    we used to know, and make it all come back a’most, in seeming!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Marian’s eyes softened, and her voice grew vague as the visions
   </p>
   <p>
    returned. “I’ll write to Izz Huett,” she said. “She’s biding at home
   </p>
   <p>
    doing nothing now, I know, and I’ll tell her we be here, and ask her to
   </p>
   <p>
    come; and perhaps Retty is well enough now.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess had nothing to say against the proposal, and the next she heard of
   </p>
   <p>
    this plan for importing old Talbothays’ joys was two or three days
   </p>
   <p>
    later, when Marian informed her that Izz had replied to her inquiry,
   </p>
   <p>
    and had promised to come if she could.
   </p>
   <p>
    There had not been such a winter for years. It came on in stealthy and
   </p>
   <p>
    measured glides, like the moves of a chess-player. One morning the few
   </p>
   <p>
    lonely trees and the thorns of the hedgerows appeared as if they had
   </p>
   <p>
    put off a vegetable for an animal integument. Every twig was covered
   </p>
   <p>
    with a white nap as of fur grown from the rind during the night, giving
   </p>
   <p>
    it four times its usual stoutness; the whole bush or tree forming a
   </p>
   <p>
    staring sketch in white lines on the mournful gray of the sky and
   </p>
   <p>
    horizon. Cobwebs revealed their presence on sheds and walls where none
   </p>
   <p>
    had ever been observed till brought out into visibility by the
   </p>
   <p>
    crystallizing atmosphere, hanging like loops of white worsted from
   </p>
   <p>
    salient points of the out-houses, posts, and gates.
   </p>
   <p>
    After this season of congealed dampness came a spell of dry frost, when
   </p>
   <p>
    strange birds from behind the North Pole began to arrive silently on
   </p>
   <p>
    the upland of Flintcomb-Ash; gaunt spectral creatures with tragical
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes—eyes which had witnessed scenes of cataclysmal horror in
   </p>
   <p>
    inaccessible polar regions of a magnitude such as no human being had
   </p>
   <p>
    ever conceived, in curdling temperatures that no man could endure;
   </p>
   <p>
    which had beheld the crash of icebergs and the slide of snow-hills by
   </p>
   <p>
    the shooting light of the Aurora; been half blinded by the whirl of
   </p>
   <p>
    colossal storms and terraqueous distortions; and retained the
   </p>
   <p>
    expression of feature that such scenes had engendered. These nameless
   </p>
   <p>
    birds came quite near to Tess and Marian, but of all they had seen
   </p>
   <p>
    which humanity would never see, they brought no account. The
   </p>
   <p>
    traveller’s ambition to tell was not theirs, and, with dumb
   </p>
   <p>
    impassivity, they dismissed experiences which they did not value for
   </p>
   <p>
    the immediate incidents of this homely upland—the trivial movements of
   </p>
   <p>
    the two girls in disturbing the clods with their hackers so as to
   </p>
   <p>
    uncover something or other that these visitants relished as food.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then one day a peculiar quality invaded the air of this open country.
   </p>
   <p>
    There came a moisture which was not of rain, and a cold which was not
   </p>
   <p>
    of frost. It chilled the eyeballs of the twain, made their brows ache,
   </p>
   <p>
    penetrated to their skeletons, affecting the surface of the body less
   </p>
   <p>
    than its core. They knew that it meant snow, and in the night the snow
   </p>
   <p>
    came. Tess, who continued to live at the cottage with the warm gable
   </p>
   <p>
    that cheered any lonely pedestrian who paused beside it, awoke in the
   </p>
   <p>
    night, and heard above the thatch noises which seemed to signify that
   </p>
   <p>
    the roof had turned itself into a gymnasium of all the winds. When she
   </p>
   <p>
    lit her lamp to get up in the morning she found that the snow had blown
   </p>
   <p>
    through a chink in the casement, forming a white cone of the finest
   </p>
   <p>
    powder against the inside, and had also come down the chimney, so that
   </p>
   <p>
    it lay sole-deep upon the floor, on which her shoes left tracks when
   </p>
   <p>
    she moved about. Without, the storm drove so fast as to create a
   </p>
   <p>
    snow-mist in the kitchen; but as yet it was too dark out-of-doors to
   </p>
   <p>
    see anything.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess knew that it was impossible to go on with the swedes; and by the
   </p>
   <p>
    time she had finished breakfast beside the solitary little lamp, Marian
   </p>
   <p>
    arrived to tell her that they were to join the rest of the women at
   </p>
   <p>
    reed-drawing in the barn till the weather changed. As soon, therefore,
   </p>
   <p>
    as the uniform cloak of darkness without began to turn to a disordered
   </p>
   <p>
    medley of grays, they blew out the lamp, wrapped themselves up in their
   </p>
   <p>
    thickest pinners, tied their woollen cravats round their necks and
   </p>
   <p>
    across their chests, and started for the barn. The snow had followed
   </p>
   <p>
    the birds from the polar basin as a white pillar of a cloud, and
   </p>
   <p>
    individual flakes could not be seen. The blast smelt of icebergs,
   </p>
   <p>
    arctic seas, whales, and white bears, carrying the snow so that it
   </p>
   <p>
    licked the land but did not deepen on it. They trudged onwards with
   </p>
   <p>
    slanted bodies through the flossy fields, keeping as well as they could
   </p>
   <p>
    in the shelter of hedges, which, however, acted as strainers rather
   </p>
   <p>
    than screens. The air, afflicted to pallor with the hoary multitudes
   </p>
   <p>
    that infested it, twisted and spun them eccentrically, suggesting an
   </p>
   <p>
    achromatic chaos of things. But both the young women were fairly
   </p>
   <p>
    cheerful; such weather on a dry upland is not in itself dispiriting.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ha-ha! the cunning northern birds knew this was coming,” said Marian.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Depend upon’t, they keep just in front o’t all the way from the North
   </p>
   <p>
    Star. Your husband, my dear, is, I make no doubt, having scorching
   </p>
   <p>
    weather all this time. Lord, if he could only see his pretty wife now!
   </p>
   <p>
    Not that this weather hurts your beauty at all—in fact, it rather does
   </p>
   <p>
    it good.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You mustn’t talk about him to me, Marian,” said Tess severely.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, but—surely you care for ’n! Do you?”
   </p>
   <p>
    Instead of answering, Tess, with tears in her eyes, impulsively faced
   </p>
   <p>
    in the direction in which she imagined South America to lie, and,
   </p>
   <p>
    putting up her lips, blew out a passionate kiss upon the snowy wind.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, well, I know you do. But ’pon my body, it is a rum life for a
   </p>
   <p>
    married couple! There—I won’t say another word! Well, as for the
   </p>
   <p>
    weather, it won’t hurt us in the wheat-barn; but reed-drawing is
   </p>
   <p>
    fearful hard work—worse than swede-hacking. I can stand it because I’m
   </p>
   <p>
    stout; but you be slimmer than I. I can’t think why maister should have
   </p>
   <p>
    set ’ee at it.”
   </p>
   <p>
    They reached the wheat-barn and entered it. One end of the long
   </p>
   <p>
    structure was full of corn; the middle was where the reed-drawing was
   </p>
   <p>
    carried on, and there had already been placed in the reed-press the
   </p>
   <p>
    evening before as many sheaves of wheat as would be sufficient for the
   </p>
   <p>
    women to draw from during the day.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why, here’s Izz!” said Marian.
   </p>
   <p>
    Izz it was, and she came forward. She had walked all the way from her
   </p>
   <p>
    mother’s home on the previous afternoon, and, not deeming the distance
   </p>
   <p>
    so great, had been belated, arriving, however, just before the snow
   </p>
   <p>
    began, and sleeping at the alehouse. The farmer had agreed with her
   </p>
   <p>
    mother at market to take her on if she came to-day, and she had been
   </p>
   <p>
    afraid to disappoint him by delay.
   </p>
   <p>
    In addition to Tess, Marian, and Izz, there were two women from a
   </p>
   <p>
    neighbouring village; two Amazonian sisters, whom Tess with a start
   </p>
   <p>
    remembered as Dark Car, the Queen of Spades, and her junior, the Queen
   </p>
   <p>
    of Diamonds—those who had tried to fight with her in the midnight
   </p>
   <p>
    quarrel at Trantridge. They showed no recognition of her, and possibly
   </p>
   <p>
    had none, for they had been under the influence of liquor on that
   </p>
   <p>
    occasion, and were only temporary sojourners there as here. They did
   </p>
   <p>
    all kinds of men’s work by preference, including well-sinking, hedging,
   </p>
   <p>
    ditching, and excavating, without any sense of fatigue. Noted
   </p>
   <p>
    reed-drawers were they too, and looked round upon the other three with
   </p>
   <p>
    some superciliousness.
   </p>
   <p>
    Putting on their gloves, all set to work in a row in front of the
   </p>
   <p>
    press, an erection formed of two posts connected by a cross-beam, under
   </p>
   <p>
    which the sheaves to be drawn from were laid ears outward, the beam
   </p>
   <p>
    being pegged down by pins in the uprights, and lowered as the sheaves
   </p>
   <p>
    diminished.
   </p>
   <p>
    The day hardened in colour, the light coming in at the barndoors
   </p>
   <p>
    upwards from the snow instead of downwards from the sky. The girls
   </p>
   <p>
    pulled handful after handful from the press; but by reason of the
   </p>
   <p>
    presence of the strange women, who were recounting scandals, Marian and
   </p>
   <p>
    Izz could not at first talk of old times as they wished to do.
   </p>
   <p>
    Presently they heard the muffled tread of a horse, and the farmer rode
   </p>
   <p>
    up to the barndoor. When he had dismounted he came close to Tess, and
   </p>
   <p>
    remained looking musingly at the side of her face. She had not turned
   </p>
   <p>
    at first, but his fixed attitude led her to look round, when she
   </p>
   <p>
    perceived that her employer was the native of Trantridge from whom she
   </p>
   <p>
    had taken flight on the high-road because of his allusion to her
   </p>
   <p>
    history.
   </p>
   <p>
    He waited till she had carried the drawn bundles to the pile outside,
   </p>
   <p>
    when he said, “So you be the young woman who took my civility in such
   </p>
   <p>
    ill part? Be drowned if I didn’t think you might be as soon as I heard
   </p>
   <p>
    of your being hired! Well, you thought you had got the better of me the
   </p>
   <p>
    first time at the inn with your fancy-man, and the second time on the
   </p>
   <p>
    road, when you bolted; but now I think I’ve got the better of you.” He
   </p>
   <p>
    concluded with a hard laugh.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess, between the Amazons and the farmer, like a bird caught in a
   </p>
   <p>
    clap-net, returned no answer, continuing to pull the straw. She could
   </p>
   <p>
    read character sufficiently well to know by this time that she had
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing to fear from her employer’s gallantry; it was rather the
   </p>
   <p>
    tyranny induced by his mortification at Clare’s treatment of him. Upon
   </p>
   <p>
    the whole she preferred that sentiment in man and felt brave enough to
   </p>
   <p>
    endure it.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You thought I was in love with ’ee I suppose? Some women are such
   </p>
   <p>
    fools, to take every look as serious earnest. But there’s nothing like
   </p>
   <p>
    a winter afield for taking that nonsense out o’ young wenches’ heads;
   </p>
   <p>
    and you’ve signed and agreed till Lady-Day. Now, are you going to beg
   </p>
   <p>
    my pardon?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I think you ought to beg mine.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Very well—as you like. But we’ll see which is master here. Be they all
   </p>
   <p>
    the sheaves you’ve done to-day?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, sir.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “’Tis a very poor show. Just see what they’ve done over there”
   </p>
   <p>
    (pointing to the two stalwart women). “The rest, too, have done better
   </p>
   <p>
    than you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “They’ve all practised it before, and I have not. And I thought it made
   </p>
   <p>
    no difference to you as it is task work, and we are only paid for what
   </p>
   <p>
    we do.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh, but it does. I want the barn cleared.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am going to work all the afternoon instead of leaving at two as the
   </p>
   <p>
    others will do.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He looked sullenly at her and went away. Tess felt that she could not
   </p>
   <p>
    have come to a much worse place; but anything was better than
   </p>
   <p>
    gallantry. When two o’clock arrived the professional reed-drawers
   </p>
   <p>
    tossed off the last half-pint in their flagon, put down their hooks,
   </p>
   <p>
    tied their last sheaves, and went away. Marian and Izz would have done
   </p>
   <p>
    likewise, but on hearing that Tess meant to stay, to make up by longer
   </p>
   <p>
    hours for her lack of skill, they would not leave her. Looking out at
   </p>
   <p>
    the snow, which still fell, Marian exclaimed, “Now, we’ve got it all to
   </p>
   <p>
    ourselves.” And so at last the conversation turned to their old
   </p>
   <p>
    experiences at the dairy; and, of course, the incidents of their
   </p>
   <p>
    affection for Angel Clare.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Izz and Marian,” said Mrs Angel Clare, with a dignity which was
   </p>
   <p>
    extremely touching, seeing how very little of a wife she was: “I can’t
   </p>
   <p>
    join in talk with you now, as I used to do, about Mr Clare; you will
   </p>
   <p>
    see that I cannot; because, although he is gone away from me for the
   </p>
   <p>
    present, he is my husband.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Izz was by nature the sauciest and most caustic of all the four girls
   </p>
   <p>
    who had loved Clare. “He was a very splendid lover, no doubt,” she
   </p>
   <p>
    said; “but I don’t think he is a too fond husband to go away from you
   </p>
   <p>
    so soon.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “He had to go—he was obliged to go, to see about the land over there!”
   </p>
   <p>
    pleaded Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    “He might have tided ’ee over the winter.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah—that’s owing to an accident—a misunderstanding; and we won’t argue
   </p>
   <p>
    it,” Tess answered, with tearfulness in her words. “Perhaps there’s a
   </p>
   <p>
    good deal to be said for him! He did not go away, like some husbands,
   </p>
   <p>
    without telling me; and I can always find out where he is.”
   </p>
   <p>
    After this they continued for some long time in a reverie, as they went
   </p>
   <p>
    on seizing the ears of corn, drawing out the straw, gathering it under
   </p>
   <p>
    their arms, and cutting off the ears with their bill-hooks, nothing
   </p>
   <p>
    sounding in the barn but the swish of the straw and the crunch of the
   </p>
   <p>
    hook. Then Tess suddenly flagged, and sank down upon the heap of
   </p>
   <p>
    wheat-ears at her feet.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I knew you wouldn’t be able to stand it!” cried Marian. “It wants
   </p>
   <p>
    harder flesh than yours for this work.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Just then the farmer entered. “Oh, that’s how you get on when I am
   </p>
   <p>
    away,” he said to her.
   </p>
   <p>
    “But it is my own loss,” she pleaded. “Not yours.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I want it finished,” he said doggedly, as he crossed the barn and went
   </p>
   <p>
    out at the other door.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Don’t ’ee mind him, there’s a dear,” said Marian. “I’ve worked here
   </p>
   <p>
    before. Now you go and lie down there, and Izz and I will make up your
   </p>
   <p>
    number.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t like to let you do that. I’m taller than you, too.”
   </p>
   <p>
    However, she was so overcome that she consented to lie down awhile, and
   </p>
   <p>
    reclined on a heap of pull-tails—the refuse after the straight straw
   </p>
   <p>
    had been drawn—thrown up at the further side of the barn. Her
   </p>
   <p>
    succumbing had been as largely owning to agitation at the re-opening
   </p>
   <p>
    the subject of her separation from her husband as to the hard work. She
   </p>
   <p>
    lay in a state of percipience without volition, and the rustle of the
   </p>
   <p>
    straw and the cutting of the ears by the others had the weight of
   </p>
   <p>
    bodily touches.
   </p>
   <p>
    She could hear from her corner, in addition to these noises, the murmur
   </p>
   <p>
    of their voices. She felt certain that they were continuing the subject
   </p>
   <p>
    already broached, but their voices were so low that she could not catch
   </p>
   <p>
    the words. At last Tess grew more and more anxious to know what they
   </p>
   <p>
    were saying, and, persuading herself that she felt better, she got up
   </p>
   <p>
    and resumed work.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then Izz Huett broke down. She had walked more than a dozen miles the
   </p>
   <p>
    previous evening, had gone to bed at midnight, and had risen again at
   </p>
   <p>
    five o’clock. Marian alone, thanks to her bottle of liquor and her
   </p>
   <p>
    stoutness of build, stood the strain upon back and arms without
   </p>
   <p>
    suffering. Tess urged Izz to leave off, agreeing, as she felt better,
   </p>
   <p>
    to finish the day without her, and make equal division of the number of
   </p>
   <p>
    sheaves.
   </p>
   <p>
    Izz accepted the offer gratefully, and disappeared through the great
   </p>
   <p>
    door into the snowy track to her lodging. Marian, as was the case every
   </p>
   <p>
    afternoon at this time on account of the bottle, began to feel in a
   </p>
   <p>
    romantic vein.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I should not have thought it of him—never!” she said in a dreamy tone.
   </p>
   <p>
    “And I loved him so! I didn’t mind his having _you_. But this about Izz
   </p>
   <p>
    is too bad!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess, in her start at the words, narrowly missed cutting off a finger
   </p>
   <p>
    with the bill-hook.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Is it about my husband?” she stammered.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, yes. Izz said, ‘Don’t ’ee tell her’; but I am sure I can’t help
   </p>
   <p>
    it! It was what he wanted Izz to do. He wanted her to go off to Brazil
   </p>
   <p>
    with him.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess’s face faded as white as the scene without, and its curves
   </p>
   <p>
    straightened. “And did Izz refuse to go?” she asked.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t know. Anyhow he changed his mind.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Pooh—then he didn’t mean it! ’Twas just a man’s jest!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes he did; for he drove her a good-ways towards the station.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “He didn’t take her!”
   </p>
   <p>
    They pulled on in silence till Tess, without any premonitory symptoms,
   </p>
   <p>
    burst out crying.
   </p>
   <p>
    “There!” said Marian. “Now I wish I hadn’t told ’ee!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No. It is a very good thing that you have done! I have been living on
   </p>
   <p>
    in a thirtover, lackaday way, and have not seen what it may lead to! I
   </p>
   <p>
    ought to have sent him a letter oftener. He said I could not go to him,
   </p>
   <p>
    but he didn’t say I was not to write as often as I liked. I won’t dally
   </p>
   <p>
    like this any longer! I have been very wrong and neglectful in leaving
   </p>
   <p>
    everything to be done by him!”
   </p>
   <p>
    The dim light in the barn grew dimmer, and they could see to work no
   </p>
   <p>
    longer. When Tess had reached home that evening, and had entered into
   </p>
   <p>
    the privacy of her little white-washed chamber, she began impetuously
   </p>
   <p>
    writing a letter to Clare. But falling into doubt, she could not finish
   </p>
   <p>
    it. Afterwards she took the ring from the ribbon on which she wore it
   </p>
   <p>
    next her heart, and retained it on her finger all night, as if to
   </p>
   <p>
    fortify herself in the sensation that she was really the wife of this
   </p>
   <p>
    elusive lover of hers, who could propose that Izz should go with him
   </p>
   <p>
    abroad, so shortly after he had left her. Knowing that, how could she
   </p>
   <p>
    write entreaties to him, or show that she cared for him any more?
   </p>
   <p>
    XLIV
   </p>
   <p>
    By the disclosure in the barn her thoughts were led anew in the
   </p>
   <p>
    direction which they had taken more than once of late—to the distant
   </p>
   <p>
    Emminster Vicarage. It was through her husband’s parents that she had
   </p>
   <p>
    been charged to send a letter to Clare if she desired; and to write to
   </p>
   <p>
    them direct if in difficulty. But that sense of her having morally no
   </p>
   <p>
    claim upon him had always led Tess to suspend her impulse to send these
   </p>
   <p>
    notes; and to the family at the Vicarage, therefore, as to her own
   </p>
   <p>
    parents since her marriage, she was virtually non-existent. This
   </p>
   <p>
    self-effacement in both directions had been quite in consonance with
   </p>
   <p>
    her independent character of desiring nothing by way of favour or pity
   </p>
   <p>
    to which she was not entitled on a fair consideration of her deserts.
   </p>
   <p>
    She had set herself to stand or fall by her qualities, and to waive
   </p>
   <p>
    such merely technical claims upon a strange family as had been
   </p>
   <p>
    established for her by the flimsy fact of a member of that family, in a
   </p>
   <p>
    season of impulse, writing his name in a church-book beside hers.
   </p>
   <p>
    But now that she was stung to a fever by Izz’s tale, there was a limit
   </p>
   <p>
    to her powers of renunciation. Why had her husband not written to her?
   </p>
   <p>
    He had distinctly implied that he would at least let her know of the
   </p>
   <p>
    locality to which he had journeyed; but he had not sent a line to
   </p>
   <p>
    notify his address. Was he really indifferent? But was he ill? Was it
   </p>
   <p>
    for her to make some advance? Surely she might summon the courage of
   </p>
   <p>
    solicitude, call at the Vicarage for intelligence, and express her
   </p>
   <p>
    grief at his silence. If Angel’s father were the good man she had heard
   </p>
   <p>
    him represented to be, he would be able to enter into her heart-starved
   </p>
   <p>
    situation. Her social hardships she could conceal.
   </p>
   <p>
    To leave the farm on a week-day was not in her power; Sunday was the
   </p>
   <p>
    only possible opportunity. Flintcomb-Ash being in the middle of the
   </p>
   <p>
    cretaceous tableland over which no railway had climbed as yet, it would
   </p>
   <p>
    be necessary to walk. And the distance being fifteen miles each way she
   </p>
   <p>
    would have to allow herself a long day for the undertaking by rising
   </p>
   <p>
    early.
   </p>
   <p>
    A fortnight later, when the snow had gone, and had been followed by a
   </p>
   <p>
    hard black frost, she took advantage of the state of the roads to try
   </p>
   <p>
    the experiment. At four o’clock that Sunday morning she came downstairs
   </p>
   <p>
    and stepped out into the starlight. The weather was still favourable,
   </p>
   <p>
    the ground ringing under her feet like an anvil.
   </p>
   <p>
    Marian and Izz were much interested in her excursion, knowing that the
   </p>
   <p>
    journey concerned her husband. Their lodgings were in a cottage a
   </p>
   <p>
    little further along the lane, but they came and assisted Tess in her
   </p>
   <p>
    departure, and argued that she should dress up in her very prettiest
   </p>
   <p>
    guise to captivate the hearts of her parents-in-law; though she,
   </p>
   <p>
    knowing of the austere and Calvinistic tenets of old Mr Clare, was
   </p>
   <p>
    indifferent, and even doubtful. A year had now elapsed since her sad
   </p>
   <p>
    marriage, but she had preserved sufficient draperies from the wreck of
   </p>
   <p>
    her then full wardrobe to clothe her very charmingly as a simple
   </p>
   <p>
    country girl with no pretensions to recent fashion; a soft gray woollen
   </p>
   <p>
    gown, with white crape quilling against the pink skin of her face and
   </p>
   <p>
    neck, and a black velvet jacket and hat.
   </p>
   <p>
    “’Tis a thousand pities your husband can’t see ’ee now—you do look a
   </p>
   <p>
    real beauty!” said Izz Huett, regarding Tess as she stood on the
   </p>
   <p>
    threshold between the steely starlight without and the yellow
   </p>
   <p>
    candlelight within. Izz spoke with a magnanimous abandonment of herself
   </p>
   <p>
    to the situation; she could not be—no woman with a heart bigger than a
   </p>
   <p>
    hazel-nut could be—antagonistic to Tess in her presence, the influence
   </p>
   <p>
    which she exercised over those of her own sex being of a warmth and
   </p>
   <p>
    strength quite unusual, curiously overpowering the less worthy feminine
   </p>
   <p>
    feelings of spite and rivalry.
   </p>
   <p>
    With a final tug and touch here, and a slight brush there, they let her
   </p>
   <p>
    go; and she was absorbed into the pearly air of the fore-dawn. They
   </p>
   <p>
    heard her footsteps tap along the hard road as she stepped out to her
   </p>
   <p>
    full pace. Even Izz hoped she would win, and, though without any
   </p>
   <p>
    particular respect for her own virtue, felt glad that she had been
   </p>
   <p>
    prevented wronging her friend when momentarily tempted by Clare.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was a year ago, all but a day, that Clare had married Tess, and only
   </p>
   <p>
    a few days less than a year that he had been absent from her. Still, to
   </p>
   <p>
    start on a brisk walk, and on such an errand as hers, on a dry clear
   </p>
   <p>
    wintry morning, through the rarefied air of these chalky hogs’-backs,
   </p>
   <p>
    was not depressing; and there is no doubt that her dream at starting
   </p>
   <p>
    was to win the heart of her mother-in-law, tell her whole history to
   </p>
   <p>
    that lady, enlist her on her side, and so gain back the truant.
   </p>
   <p>
    In time she reached the edge of the vast escarpment below which
   </p>
   <p>
    stretched the loamy Vale of Blackmoor, now lying misty and still in the
   </p>
   <p>
    dawn. Instead of the colourless air of the uplands, the atmosphere down
   </p>
   <p>
    there was a deep blue. Instead of the great enclosures of a hundred
   </p>
   <p>
    acres in which she was now accustomed to toil, there were little fields
   </p>
   <p>
    below her of less than half-a-dozen acres, so numerous that they looked
   </p>
   <p>
    from this height like the meshes of a net. Here the landscape was
   </p>
   <p>
    whitey-brown; down there, as in Froom Valley, it was always green. Yet
   </p>
   <p>
    it was in that vale that her sorrow had taken shape, and she did not
   </p>
   <p>
    love it as formerly. Beauty to her, as to all who have felt, lay not in
   </p>
   <p>
    the thing, but in what the thing symbolized.
   </p>
   <p>
    Keeping the Vale on her right, she steered steadily westward; passing
   </p>
   <p>
    above the Hintocks, crossing at right-angles the high-road from
   </p>
   <p>
    Sherton-Abbas to Casterbridge, and skirting Dogbury Hill and High-Stoy,
   </p>
   <p>
    with the dell between them called “The Devil’s Kitchen”. Still
   </p>
   <p>
    following the elevated way she reached Cross-in-Hand, where the stone
   </p>
   <p>
    pillar stands desolate and silent, to mark the site of a miracle, or
   </p>
   <p>
    murder, or both. Three miles further she cut across the straight and
   </p>
   <p>
    deserted Roman road called Long-Ash Lane; leaving which as soon as she
   </p>
   <p>
    reached it she dipped down a hill by a transverse lane into the small
   </p>
   <p>
    town or village of Evershead, being now about halfway over the
   </p>
   <p>
    distance. She made a halt here, and breakfasted a second time, heartily
   </p>
   <p>
    enough—not at the Sow-and-Acorn, for she avoided inns, but at a cottage
   </p>
   <p>
    by the church.
   </p>
   <p>
    The second half of her journey was through a more gentle country, by
   </p>
   <p>
    way of Benvill Lane. But as the mileage lessened between her and the
   </p>
   <p>
    spot of her pilgrimage, so did Tess’s confidence decrease, and her
   </p>
   <p>
    enterprise loom out more formidably. She saw her purpose in such
   </p>
   <p>
    staring lines, and the landscape so faintly, that she was sometimes in
   </p>
   <p>
    danger of losing her way. However, about noon she paused by a gate on
   </p>
   <p>
    the edge of the basin in which Emminster and its Vicarage lay.
   </p>
   <p>
    The square tower, beneath which she knew that at that moment the Vicar
   </p>
   <p>
    and his congregation were gathered, had a severe look in her eyes. She
   </p>
   <p>
    wished that she had somehow contrived to come on a week-day. Such a
   </p>
   <p>
    good man might be prejudiced against a woman who had chosen Sunday,
   </p>
   <p>
    never realizing the necessities of her case. But it was incumbent upon
   </p>
   <p>
    her to go on now. She took off the thick boots in which she had walked
   </p>
   <p>
    thus far, put on her pretty thin ones of patent leather, and, stuffing
   </p>
   <p>
    the former into the hedge by the gatepost where she might readily find
   </p>
   <p>
    them again, descended the hill; the freshness of colour she had derived
   </p>
   <p>
    from the keen air thinning away in spite of her as she drew near the
   </p>
   <p>
    parsonage.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess hoped for some accident that might favour her, but nothing
   </p>
   <p>
    favoured her. The shrubs on the Vicarage lawn rustled uncomfortably in
   </p>
   <p>
    the frosty breeze; she could not feel by any stretch of imagination,
   </p>
   <p>
    dressed to her highest as she was, that the house was the residence of
   </p>
   <p>
    near relations; and yet nothing essential, in nature or emotion,
   </p>
   <p>
    divided her from them: in pains, pleasures, thoughts, birth, death, and
   </p>
   <p>
    after-death, they were the same.
   </p>
   <p>
    She nerved herself by an effort, entered the swing-gate, and rang the
   </p>
   <p>
    door-bell. The thing was done; there could be no retreat. No; the thing
   </p>
   <p>
    was not done. Nobody answered to her ringing. The effort had to be
   </p>
   <p>
    risen to and made again. She rang a second time, and the agitation of
   </p>
   <p>
    the act, coupled with her weariness after the fifteen miles’ walk, led
   </p>
   <p>
    her to support herself while she waited by resting her hand on her hip
   </p>
   <p>
    and her elbow against the wall of the porch. The wind was so nipping
   </p>
   <p>
    that the ivy-leaves had become wizened and gray, each tapping
   </p>
   <p>
    incessantly upon its neighbour with a disquieting stir of her nerves. A
   </p>
   <p>
    piece of blood-stained paper, caught up from some meat-buyer’s
   </p>
   <p>
    dust-heap, beat up and down the road without the gate; too flimsy to
   </p>
   <p>
    rest, too heavy to fly away; and a few straws kept it company.
   </p>
   <p>
    The second peal had been louder, and still nobody came. Then she walked
   </p>
   <p>
    out of the porch, opened the gate, and passed through. And though she
   </p>
   <p>
    looked dubiously at the house-front as if inclined to return, it was
   </p>
   <p>
    with a breath of relief that she closed the gate. A feeling haunted her
   </p>
   <p>
    that she might have been recognized (though how she could not tell),
   </p>
   <p>
    and orders been given not to admit her.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess went as far as the corner. She had done all she could do; but
   </p>
   <p>
    determined not to escape present trepidation at the expense of future
   </p>
   <p>
    distress, she walked back again quite past the house, looking up at all
   </p>
   <p>
    the windows.
   </p>
   <p>
    Ah—the explanation was that they were all at church, every one. She
   </p>
   <p>
    remembered her husband saying that his father always insisted upon the
   </p>
   <p>
    household, servants included, going to morning-service, and, as a
   </p>
   <p>
    consequence, eating cold food when they came home. It was, therefore,
   </p>
   <p>
    only necessary to wait till the service was over. She would not make
   </p>
   <p>
    herself conspicuous by waiting on the spot, and she started to get past
   </p>
   <p>
    the church into the lane. But as she reached the churchyard-gate the
   </p>
   <p>
    people began pouring out, and Tess found herself in the midst of them.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Emminster congregation looked at her as only a congregation of
   </p>
   <p>
    small country-townsfolk walking home at its leisure can look at a woman
   </p>
   <p>
    out of the common whom it perceives to be a stranger. She quickened her
   </p>
   <p>
    pace, and ascended the road by which she had come, to find a retreat
   </p>
   <p>
    between its hedges till the Vicar’s family should have lunched, and it
   </p>
   <p>
    might be convenient for them to receive her. She soon distanced the
   </p>
   <p>
    churchgoers, except two youngish men, who, linked arm-in-arm, were
   </p>
   <p>
    beating up behind her at a quick step.
   </p>
   <p>
    As they drew nearer she could hear their voices engaged in earnest
   </p>
   <p>
    discourse, and, with the natural quickness of a woman in her situation,
   </p>
   <p>
    did not fail to recognize in those noises the quality of her husband’s
   </p>
   <p>
    tones. The pedestrians were his two brothers. Forgetting all her plans,
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess’s one dread was lest they should overtake her now, in her
   </p>
   <p>
    disorganized condition, before she was prepared to confront them; for
   </p>
   <p>
    though she felt that they could not identify her, she instinctively
   </p>
   <p>
    dreaded their scrutiny. The more briskly they walked, the more briskly
   </p>
   <p>
    walked she. They were plainly bent upon taking a short quick stroll
   </p>
   <p>
    before going indoors to lunch or dinner, to restore warmth to limbs
   </p>
   <p>
    chilled with sitting through a long service.
   </p>
   <p>
    Only one person had preceded Tess up the hill—a ladylike young woman,
   </p>
   <p>
    somewhat interesting, though, perhaps, a trifle _guindée_ and prudish.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess had nearly overtaken her when the speed of her brothers-in-law
   </p>
   <p>
    brought them so nearly behind her back that she could hear every word
   </p>
   <p>
    of their conversation. They said nothing, however, which particularly
   </p>
   <p>
    interested her till, observing the young lady still further in front,
   </p>
   <p>
    one of them remarked, “There is Mercy Chant. Let us overtake her.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess knew the name. It was the woman who had been destined for Angel’s
   </p>
   <p>
    life-companion by his and her parents, and whom he probably would have
   </p>
   <p>
    married but for her intrusive self. She would have known as much
   </p>
   <p>
    without previous information if she had waited a moment, for one of the
   </p>
   <p>
    brothers proceeded to say: “Ah! poor Angel, poor Angel! I never see
   </p>
   <p>
    that nice girl without more and more regretting his precipitancy in
   </p>
   <p>
    throwing himself away upon a dairymaid, or whatever she may be. It is a
   </p>
   <p>
    queer business, apparently. Whether she has joined him yet or not I
   </p>
   <p>
    don’t know; but she had not done so some months ago when I heard from
   </p>
   <p>
    him.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I can’t say. He never tells me anything nowadays. His ill-considered
   </p>
   <p>
    marriage seems to have completed that estrangement from me which was
   </p>
   <p>
    begun by his extraordinary opinions.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess beat up the long hill still faster; but she could not outwalk them
   </p>
   <p>
    without exciting notice. At last they outsped her altogether, and
   </p>
   <p>
    passed her by. The young lady still further ahead heard their footsteps
   </p>
   <p>
    and turned. Then there was a greeting and a shaking of hands, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    three went on together.
   </p>
   <p>
    They soon reached the summit of the hill, and, evidently intending this
   </p>
   <p>
    point to be the limit of their promenade, slackened pace and turned all
   </p>
   <p>
    three aside to the gate whereat Tess had paused an hour before that
   </p>
   <p>
    time to reconnoitre the town before descending into it. During their
   </p>
   <p>
    discourse one of the clerical brothers probed the hedge carefully with
   </p>
   <p>
    his umbrella, and dragged something to light.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Here’s a pair of old boots,” he said. “Thrown away, I suppose, by some
   </p>
   <p>
    tramp or other.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Some imposter who wished to come into the town barefoot, perhaps, and
   </p>
   <p>
    so excite our sympathies,” said Miss Chant. “Yes, it must have been,
   </p>
   <p>
    for they are excellent walking-boots—by no means worn out. What a
   </p>
   <p>
    wicked thing to do! I’ll carry them home for some poor person.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Cuthbert Clare, who had been the one to find them, picked them up for
   </p>
   <p>
    her with the crook of his stick; and Tess’s boots were appropriated.
   </p>
   <p>
    She, who had heard this, walked past under the screen of her woollen
   </p>
   <p>
    veil till, presently looking back, she perceived that the church party
   </p>
   <p>
    had left the gate with her boots and retreated down the hill.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thereupon our heroine resumed her walk. Tears, blinding tears, were
   </p>
   <p>
    running down her face. She knew that it was all sentiment, all baseless
   </p>
   <p>
    impressibility, which had caused her to read the scene as her own
   </p>
   <p>
    condemnation; nevertheless she could not get over it; she could not
   </p>
   <p>
    contravene in her own defenceless person all those untoward omens. It
   </p>
   <p>
    was impossible to think of returning to the Vicarage. Angel’s wife felt
   </p>
   <p>
    almost as if she had been hounded up that hill like a scorned thing by
   </p>
   <p>
    those—to her—superfine clerics. Innocently as the slight had been
   </p>
   <p>
    inflicted, it was somewhat unfortunate that she had encountered the
   </p>
   <p>
    sons and not the father, who, despite his narrowness, was far less
   </p>
   <p>
    starched and ironed than they, and had to the full the gift of charity.
   </p>
   <p>
    As she again thought of her dusty boots she almost pitied those
   </p>
   <p>
    habiliments for the quizzing to which they had been subjected, and felt
   </p>
   <p>
    how hopeless life was for their owner.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah!” she said, still sighing in pity of herself, “_they_ didn’t know
   </p>
   <p>
    that I wore those over the roughest part of the road to save these
   </p>
   <p>
    pretty ones _he_ bought for me—no—they did not know it! And they didn’t
   </p>
   <p>
    think that _he_ chose the colour o’ my pretty frock—no—how could they?
   </p>
   <p>
    If they had known perhaps they would not have cared, for they don’t
   </p>
   <p>
    care much for him, poor thing!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Then she grieved for the beloved man whose conventional standard of
   </p>
   <p>
    judgement had caused her all these latter sorrows; and she went her way
   </p>
   <p>
    without knowing that the greatest misfortune of her life was this
   </p>
   <p>
    feminine loss of courage at the last and critical moment through her
   </p>
   <p>
    estimating her father-in-law by his sons. Her present condition was
   </p>
   <p>
    precisely one which would have enlisted the sympathies of old Mr and
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs Clare. Their hearts went out of them at a bound towards extreme
   </p>
   <p>
    cases, when the subtle mental troubles of the less desperate among
   </p>
   <p>
    mankind failed to win their interest or regard. In jumping at Publicans
   </p>
   <p>
    and Sinners they would forget that a word might be said for the worries
   </p>
   <p>
    of Scribes and Pharisees; and this defect or limitation might have
   </p>
   <p>
    recommended their own daughter-in-law to them at this moment as a
   </p>
   <p>
    fairly choice sort of lost person for their love.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thereupon she began to plod back along the road by which she had come
   </p>
   <p>
    not altogether full of hope, but full of a conviction that a crisis in
   </p>
   <p>
    her life was approaching. No crisis, apparently, had supervened; and
   </p>
   <p>
    there was nothing left for her to do but to continue upon that
   </p>
   <p>
    starve-acre farm till she could again summon courage to face the
   </p>
   <p>
    Vicarage. She did, indeed, take sufficient interest in herself to throw
   </p>
   <p>
    up her veil on this return journey, as if to let the world see that she
   </p>
   <p>
    could at least exhibit a face such as Mercy Chant could not show. But
   </p>
   <p>
    it was done with a sorry shake of the head. “It is nothing—it is
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing!” she said. “Nobody loves it; nobody sees it. Who cares about
   </p>
   <p>
    the looks of a castaway like me!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Her journey back was rather a meander than a march. It had no
   </p>
   <p>
    sprightliness, no purpose; only a tendency. Along the tedious length of
   </p>
   <p>
    Benvill Lane she began to grow tired, and she leant upon gates and
   </p>
   <p>
    paused by milestones.
   </p>
   <p>
    She did not enter any house till, at the seventh or eighth mile, she
   </p>
   <p>
    descended the steep long hill below which lay the village or townlet of
   </p>
   <p>
    Evershead, where in the morning she had breakfasted with such
   </p>
   <p>
    contrasting expectations. The cottage by the church, in which she again
   </p>
   <p>
    sat down, was almost the first at that end of the village, and while
   </p>
   <p>
    the woman fetched her some milk from the pantry, Tess, looking down the
   </p>
   <p>
    street, perceived that the place seemed quite deserted.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The people are gone to afternoon service, I suppose?” she said.
   </p>
   <p>
    “No, my dear,” said the old woman. “’Tis too soon for that; the bells
   </p>
   <p>
    hain’t strook out yet. They be all gone to hear the preaching in yonder
   </p>
   <p>
    barn. A ranter preaches there between the services—an excellent, fiery,
   </p>
   <p>
    Christian man, they say. But, Lord, I don’t go to hear’n! What comes in
   </p>
   <p>
    the regular way over the pulpit is hot enough for I.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess soon went onward into the village, her footsteps echoing against
   </p>
   <p>
    the houses as though it were a place of the dead. Nearing the central
   </p>
   <p>
    part, her echoes were intruded on by other sounds; and seeing the barn
   </p>
   <p>
    not far off the road, she guessed these to be the utterances of the
   </p>
   <p>
    preacher.
   </p>
   <p>
    His voice became so distinct in the still clear air that she could soon
   </p>
   <p>
    catch his sentences, though she was on the closed side of the barn. The
   </p>
   <p>
    sermon, as might be expected, was of the extremest antinomian type; on
   </p>
   <p>
    justification by faith, as expounded in the theology of St Paul. This
   </p>
   <p>
    fixed idea of the rhapsodist was delivered with animated enthusiasm, in
   </p>
   <p>
    a manner entirely declamatory, for he had plainly no skill as a
   </p>
   <p>
    dialectician. Although Tess had not heard the beginning of the address,
   </p>
   <p>
    she learnt what the text had been from its constant iteration—
   </p>
   <p>
    “O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not
   </p>
   <p>
    obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently
   </p>
   <p>
    set forth, crucified among you?”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess was all the more interested, as she stood listening behind, in
   </p>
   <p>
    finding that the preacher’s doctrine was a vehement form of the view of
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel’s father, and her interest intensified when the speaker began to
   </p>
   <p>
    detail his own spiritual experiences of how he had come by those views.
   </p>
   <p>
    He had, he said, been the greatest of sinners. He had scoffed; he had
   </p>
   <p>
    wantonly associated with the reckless and the lewd. But a day of
   </p>
   <p>
    awakening had come, and, in a human sense, it had been brought about
   </p>
   <p>
    mainly by the influence of a certain clergyman, whom he had at first
   </p>
   <p>
    grossly insulted; but whose parting words had sunk into his heart, and
   </p>
   <p>
    had remained there, till by the grace of Heaven they had worked this
   </p>
   <p>
    change in him, and made him what they saw him.
   </p>
   <p>
    But more startling to Tess than the doctrine had been the voice, which,
   </p>
   <p>
    impossible as it seemed, was precisely that of Alec d’Urberville. Her
   </p>
   <p>
    face fixed in painful suspense, she came round to the front of the
   </p>
   <p>
    barn, and passed before it. The low winter sun beamed directly upon the
   </p>
   <p>
    great double-doored entrance on this side; one of the doors being open,
   </p>
   <p>
    so that the rays stretched far in over the threshing-floor to the
   </p>
   <p>
    preacher and his audience, all snugly sheltered from the northern
   </p>
   <p>
    breeze. The listeners were entirely villagers, among them being the man
   </p>
   <p>
    whom she had seen carrying the red paint-pot on a former memorable
   </p>
   <p>
    occasion. But her attention was given to the central figure, who stood
   </p>
   <p>
    upon some sacks of corn, facing the people and the door. The three
   </p>
   <p>
    o’clock sun shone full upon him, and the strange enervating conviction
   </p>
   <p>
    that her seducer confronted her, which had been gaining ground in Tess
   </p>
   <p>
    ever since she had heard his words distinctly, was at last established
   </p>
   <p>
    as a fact indeed.
   </p>
   <p>
    End of Phase the Fifth
   </p>
   <p>
    Phase the Sixth:
   </p>
   <p>
    The Convert
   </p>
   <p>
    XLV
   </p>
   <p>
    Till this moment she had never seen or heard from d’Urberville since
   </p>
   <p>
    her departure from Trantridge.
   </p>
   <p>
    The rencounter came at a heavy moment, one of all moments calculated to
   </p>
   <p>
    permit its impact with the least emotional shock. But such was
   </p>
   <p>
    unreasoning memory that, though he stood there openly and palpably a
   </p>
   <p>
    converted man, who was sorrowing for his past irregularities, a fear
   </p>
   <p>
    overcame her, paralyzing her movement so that she neither retreated nor
   </p>
   <p>
    advanced.
   </p>
   <p>
    To think of what emanated from that countenance when she saw it last,
   </p>
   <p>
    and to behold it now!... There was the same handsome unpleasantness of
   </p>
   <p>
    mien, but now he wore neatly trimmed, old-fashioned whiskers, the sable
   </p>
   <p>
    moustache having disappeared; and his dress was half-clerical, a
   </p>
   <p>
    modification which had changed his expression sufficiently to abstract
   </p>
   <p>
    the dandyism from his features, and to hinder for a second her belief
   </p>
   <p>
    in his identity.
   </p>
   <p>
    To Tess’s sense there was, just at first, a ghastly _bizarrerie_, a
   </p>
   <p>
    grim incongruity, in the march of these solemn words of Scripture out
   </p>
   <p>
    of such a mouth. This too familiar intonation, less than four years
   </p>
   <p>
    earlier, had brought to her ears expressions of such divergent purpose
   </p>
   <p>
    that her heart became quite sick at the irony of the contrast.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was less a reform than a transfiguration. The former curves of
   </p>
   <p>
    sensuousness were now modulated to lines of devotional passion. The
   </p>
   <p>
    lip-shapes that had meant seductiveness were now made to express
   </p>
   <p>
    supplication; the glow on the cheek that yesterday could be translated
   </p>
   <p>
    as riotousness was evangelized to-day into the splendour of pious
   </p>
   <p>
    rhetoric; animalism had become fanaticism; Paganism, Paulinism; the
   </p>
   <p>
    bold rolling eye that had flashed upon her form in the old time with
   </p>
   <p>
    such mastery now beamed with the rude energy of a theolatry that was
   </p>
   <p>
    almost ferocious. Those black angularities which his face had used to
   </p>
   <p>
    put on when his wishes were thwarted now did duty in picturing the
   </p>
   <p>
    incorrigible backslider who would insist upon turning again to his
   </p>
   <p>
    wallowing in the mire.
   </p>
   <p>
    The lineaments, as such, seemed to complain. They had been diverted
   </p>
   <p>
    from their hereditary connotation to signify impressions for which
   </p>
   <p>
    Nature did not intend them. Strange that their very elevation was a
   </p>
   <p>
    misapplication, that to raise seemed to falsify.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet could it be so? She would admit the ungenerous sentiment no longer.
   </p>
   <p>
    D’Urberville was not the first wicked man who had turned away from his
   </p>
   <p>
    wickedness to save his soul alive, and why should she deem it unnatural
   </p>
   <p>
    in him? It was but the usage of thought which had been jarred in her at
   </p>
   <p>
    hearing good new words in bad old notes. The greater the sinner, the
   </p>
   <p>
    greater the saint; it was not necessary to dive far into Christian
   </p>
   <p>
    history to discover that.
   </p>
   <p>
    Such impressions as these moved her vaguely, and without strict
   </p>
   <p>
    definiteness. As soon as the nerveless pause of her surprise would
   </p>
   <p>
    allow her to stir, her impulse was to pass on out of his sight. He had
   </p>
   <p>
    obviously not discerned her yet in her position against the sun.
   </p>
   <p>
    But the moment that she moved again he recognized her. The effect upon
   </p>
   <p>
    her old lover was electric, far stronger than the effect of his
   </p>
   <p>
    presence upon her. His fire, the tumultuous ring of his eloquence,
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed to go out of him. His lip struggled and trembled under the words
   </p>
   <p>
    that lay upon it; but deliver them it could not as long as she faced
   </p>
   <p>
    him. His eyes, after their first glance upon her face, hung confusedly
   </p>
   <p>
    in every other direction but hers, but came back in a desperate leap
   </p>
   <p>
    every few seconds. This paralysis lasted, however, but a short time;
   </p>
   <p>
    for Tess’s energies returned with the atrophy of his, and she walked as
   </p>
   <p>
    fast as she was able past the barn and onward.
   </p>
   <p>
    As soon as she could reflect, it appalled her, this change in their
   </p>
   <p>
    relative platforms. He who had wrought her undoing was now on the side
   </p>
   <p>
    of the Spirit, while she remained unregenerate. And, as in the legend,
   </p>
   <p>
    it had resulted that her Cyprian image had suddenly appeared upon his
   </p>
   <p>
    altar, whereby the fire of the priest had been well nigh extinguished.
   </p>
   <p>
    She went on without turning her head. Her back seemed to be endowed
   </p>
   <p>
    with a sensitiveness to ocular beams—even her clothing—so alive was she
   </p>
   <p>
    to a fancied gaze which might be resting upon her from the outside of
   </p>
   <p>
    that barn. All the way along to this point her heart had been heavy
   </p>
   <p>
    with an inactive sorrow; now there was a change in the quality of its
   </p>
   <p>
    trouble. That hunger for affection too long withheld was for the time
   </p>
   <p>
    displaced by an almost physical sense of an implacable past which still
   </p>
   <p>
    engirdled her. It intensified her consciousness of error to a practical
   </p>
   <p>
    despair; the break of continuity between her earlier and present
   </p>
   <p>
    existence, which she had hoped for, had not, after all, taken place.
   </p>
   <p>
    Bygones would never be complete bygones till she was a bygone herself.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus absorbed, she recrossed the northern part of Long-Ash Lane at
   </p>
   <p>
    right angles, and presently saw before her the road ascending whitely
   </p>
   <p>
    to the upland along whose margin the remainder of her journey lay. Its
   </p>
   <p>
    dry pale surface stretched severely onward, unbroken by a single
   </p>
   <p>
    figure, vehicle, or mark, save some occasional brown horse-droppings
   </p>
   <p>
    which dotted its cold aridity here and there. While slowly breasting
   </p>
   <p>
    this ascent Tess became conscious of footsteps behind her, and turning
   </p>
   <p>
    she saw approaching that well-known form—so strangely accoutred as the
   </p>
   <p>
    Methodist—the one personage in all the world she wished not to
   </p>
   <p>
    encounter alone on this side of the grave.
   </p>
   <p>
    There was not much time, however, for thought or elusion, and she
   </p>
   <p>
    yielded as calmly as she could to the necessity of letting him overtake
   </p>
   <p>
    her. She saw that he was excited, less by the speed of his walk than by
   </p>
   <p>
    the feelings within him.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tess!” he said.
   </p>
   <p>
    She slackened speed without looking round.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tess!” he repeated. “It is I—Alec d’Urberville.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She then looked back at him, and he came up.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I see it is,” she answered coldly.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well—is that all? Yet I deserve no more! Of course,” he added, with a
   </p>
   <p>
    slight laugh, “there is something of the ridiculous to your eyes in
   </p>
   <p>
    seeing me like this. But—I must put up with that.... I heard you had
   </p>
   <p>
    gone away; nobody knew where. Tess, you wonder why I have followed
   </p>
   <p>
    you?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I do, rather; and I would that you had not, with all my heart!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes—you may well say it,” he returned grimly, as they moved onward
   </p>
   <p>
    together, she with unwilling tread. “But don’t mistake me; I beg this
   </p>
   <p>
    because you may have been led to do so in noticing—if you did notice
   </p>
   <p>
    it—how your sudden appearance unnerved me down there. It was but a
   </p>
   <p>
    momentary faltering; and considering what you have been to me, it was
   </p>
   <p>
    natural enough. But will helped me through it—though perhaps you think
   </p>
   <p>
    me a humbug for saying it—and immediately afterwards I felt that of all
   </p>
   <p>
    persons in the world whom it was my duty and desire to save from the
   </p>
   <p>
    wrath to come—sneer if you like—the woman whom I had so grievously
   </p>
   <p>
    wronged was that person. I have come with that sole purpose in
   </p>
   <p>
    view—nothing more.”
   </p>
   <p>
    There was the smallest vein of scorn in her words of rejoinder: “Have
   </p>
   <p>
    you saved yourself? Charity begins at home, they say.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “_I_ have done nothing!” said he indifferently. “Heaven, as I have been
   </p>
   <p>
    telling my hearers, has done all. No amount of contempt that you can
   </p>
   <p>
    pour upon me, Tess, will equal what I have poured upon myself—the old
   </p>
   <p>
    Adam of my former years! Well, it is a strange story; believe it or
   </p>
   <p>
    not; but I can tell you the means by which my conversion was brought
   </p>
   <p>
    about, and I hope you will be interested enough at least to listen.
   </p>
   <p>
    Have you ever heard the name of the parson of Emminster—you must have
   </p>
   <p>
    done do?—old Mr Clare; one of the most earnest of his school; one of
   </p>
   <p>
    the few intense men left in the Church; not so intense as the extreme
   </p>
   <p>
    wing of Christian believers with which I have thrown in my lot, but
   </p>
   <p>
    quite an exception among the Established clergy, the younger of whom
   </p>
   <p>
    are gradually attenuating the true doctrines by their sophistries, till
   </p>
   <p>
    they are but the shadow of what they were. I only differ from him on
   </p>
   <p>
    the question of Church and State—the interpretation of the text, ‘Come
   </p>
   <p>
    out from among them and be ye separate, saith the Lord’—that’s all. He
   </p>
   <p>
    is one who, I firmly believe, has been the humble means of saving more
   </p>
   <p>
    souls in this country than any other man you can name. You have heard
   </p>
   <p>
    of him?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I have,” she said.
   </p>
   <p>
    “He came to Trantridge two or three years ago to preach on behalf of
   </p>
   <p>
    some missionary society; and I, wretched fellow that I was, insulted
   </p>
   <p>
    him when, in his disinterestedness, he tried to reason with me and show
   </p>
   <p>
    me the way. He did not resent my conduct, he simply said that some day
   </p>
   <p>
    I should receive the first-fruits of the Spirit—that those who came to
   </p>
   <p>
    scoff sometimes remained to pray. There was a strange magic in his
   </p>
   <p>
    words. They sank into my mind. But the loss of my mother hit me most;
   </p>
   <p>
    and by degrees I was brought to see daylight. Since then my one desire
   </p>
   <p>
    has been to hand on the true view to others, and that is what I was
   </p>
   <p>
    trying to do to-day; though it is only lately that I have preached
   </p>
   <p>
    hereabout. The first months of my ministry have been spent in the North
   </p>
   <p>
    of England among strangers, where I preferred to make my earliest
   </p>
   <p>
    clumsy attempts, so as to acquire courage before undergoing that
   </p>
   <p>
    severest of all tests of one’s sincerity, addressing those who have
   </p>
   <p>
    known one, and have been one’s companions in the days of darkness. If
   </p>
   <p>
    you could only know, Tess, the pleasure of having a good slap at
   </p>
   <p>
    yourself, I am sure—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Don’t go on with it!” she cried passionately, as she turned away from
   </p>
   <p>
    him to a stile by the wayside, on which she bent herself. “I can’t
   </p>
   <p>
    believe in such sudden things! I feel indignant with you for talking to
   </p>
   <p>
    me like this, when you know—when you know what harm you’ve done me!
   </p>
   <p>
    You, and those like you, take your fill of pleasure on earth by making
   </p>
   <p>
    the life of such as me bitter and black with sorrow; and then it is a
   </p>
   <p>
    fine thing, when you have had enough of that, to think of securing your
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasure in heaven by becoming converted! Out upon such—I don’t believe
   </p>
   <p>
    in you—I hate it!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tess,” he insisted; “don’t speak so! It came to me like a jolly new
   </p>
   <p>
    idea! And you don’t believe me? What don’t you believe?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Your conversion. Your scheme of religion.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why?”
   </p>
   <p>
    She dropped her voice. “Because a better man than you does not believe
   </p>
   <p>
    in such.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “What a woman’s reason! Who is this better man?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I cannot tell you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well,” he declared, a resentment beneath his words seeming ready to
   </p>
   <p>
    spring out at a moment’s notice, “God forbid that I should say I am a
   </p>
   <p>
    good man—and you know I don’t say any such thing. I am new to goodness,
   </p>
   <p>
    truly; but newcomers see furthest sometimes.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes,” she replied sadly. “But I cannot believe in your conversion to a
   </p>
   <p>
    new spirit. Such flashes as you feel, Alec, I fear don’t last!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus speaking she turned from the stile over which she had been
   </p>
   <p>
    leaning, and faced him; whereupon his eyes, falling casually upon the
   </p>
   <p>
    familiar countenance and form, remained contemplating her. The inferior
   </p>
   <p>
    man was quiet in him now; but it was surely not extracted, nor even
   </p>
   <p>
    entirely subdued.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Don’t look at me like that!” he said abruptly.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess, who had been quite unconscious of her action and mien, instantly
   </p>
   <p>
    withdrew the large dark gaze of her eyes, stammering with a flush, “I
   </p>
   <p>
    beg your pardon!” And there was revived in her the wretched sentiment
   </p>
   <p>
    which had often come to her before, that in inhabiting the fleshly
   </p>
   <p>
    tabernacle with which Nature had endowed her she was somehow doing
   </p>
   <p>
    wrong.
   </p>
   <p>
    “No, no! Don’t beg my pardon. But since you wear a veil to hide your
   </p>
   <p>
    good looks, why don’t you keep it down?”
   </p>
   <p>
    She pulled down the veil, saying hastily, “It was mostly to keep off
   </p>
   <p>
    the wind.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It may seem harsh of me to dictate like this,” he went on; “but it is
   </p>
   <p>
    better that I should not look too often on you. It might be dangerous.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ssh!” said Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, women’s faces have had too much power over me already for me not
   </p>
   <p>
    to fear them! An evangelist has nothing to do with such as they; and it
   </p>
   <p>
    reminds me of the old times that I would forget!”
   </p>
   <p>
    After this their conversation dwindled to a casual remark now and then
   </p>
   <p>
    as they rambled onward, Tess inwardly wondering how far he was going
   </p>
   <p>
    with her, and not liking to send him back by positive mandate.
   </p>
   <p>
    Frequently when they came to a gate or stile they found painted thereon
   </p>
   <p>
    in red or blue letters some text of Scripture, and she asked him if he
   </p>
   <p>
    knew who had been at the pains to blazon these announcements. He told
   </p>
   <p>
    her that the man was employed by himself and others who were working
   </p>
   <p>
    with him in that district, to paint these reminders that no means might
   </p>
   <p>
    be left untried which might move the hearts of a wicked generation.
   </p>
   <p>
    At length the road touched the spot called “Cross-in-Hand.” Of all
   </p>
   <p>
    spots on the bleached and desolate upland this was the most forlorn. It
   </p>
   <p>
    was so far removed from the charm which is sought in landscape by
   </p>
   <p>
    artists and view-lovers as to reach a new kind of beauty, a negative
   </p>
   <p>
    beauty of tragic tone. The place took its name from a stone pillar
   </p>
   <p>
    which stood there, a strange rude monolith, from a stratum unknown in
   </p>
   <p>
    any local quarry, on which was roughly carved a human hand. Differing
   </p>
   <p>
    accounts were given of its history and purport. Some authorities stated
   </p>
   <p>
    that a devotional cross had once formed the complete erection thereon,
   </p>
   <p>
    of which the present relic was but the stump; others that the stone as
   </p>
   <p>
    it stood was entire, and that it had been fixed there to mark a
   </p>
   <p>
    boundary or place of meeting. Anyhow, whatever the origin of the relic,
   </p>
   <p>
    there was and is something sinister, or solemn, according to mood, in
   </p>
   <p>
    the scene amid which it stands; something tending to impress the most
   </p>
   <p>
    phlegmatic passer-by.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I think I must leave you now,” he remarked, as they drew near to this
   </p>
   <p>
    spot. “I have to preach at Abbot’s-Cernel at six this evening, and my
   </p>
   <p>
    way lies across to the right from here. And you upset me somewhat too,
   </p>
   <p>
    Tessy—I cannot, will not, say why. I must go away and get strength....
   </p>
   <p>
    How is it that you speak so fluently now? Who has taught you such good
   </p>
   <p>
    English?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I have learnt things in my troubles,” she said evasively.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What troubles have you had?”
   </p>
   <p>
    She told him of the first one—the only one that related to him.
   </p>
   <p>
    D’Urberville was struck mute. “I knew nothing of this till now!” he
   </p>
   <p>
    next murmured. “Why didn’t you write to me when you felt your trouble
   </p>
   <p>
    coming on?”
   </p>
   <p>
    She did not reply; and he broke the silence by adding: “Well—you will
   </p>
   <p>
    see me again.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No,” she answered. “Do not again come near me!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I will think. But before we part come here.” He stepped up to the
   </p>
   <p>
    pillar. “This was once a Holy Cross. Relics are not in my creed; but I
   </p>
   <p>
    fear you at moments—far more than you need fear me at present; and to
   </p>
   <p>
    lessen my fear, put your hand upon that stone hand, and swear that you
   </p>
   <p>
    will never tempt me—by your charms or ways.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Good God—how can you ask what is so unnecessary! All that is furthest
   </p>
   <p>
    from my thought!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes—but swear it.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess, half frightened, gave way to his importunity; placed her hand
   </p>
   <p>
    upon the stone and swore.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am sorry you are not a believer,” he continued; “that some
   </p>
   <p>
    unbeliever should have got hold of you and unsettled your mind. But no
   </p>
   <p>
    more now. At home at least I can pray for you; and I will; and who
   </p>
   <p>
    knows what may not happen? I’m off. Goodbye!”
   </p>
   <p>
    He turned to a hunting-gate in the hedge and, without letting his eyes
   </p>
   <p>
    again rest upon her, leapt over and struck out across the down in the
   </p>
   <p>
    direction of Abbot’s-Cernel. As he walked his pace showed perturbation,
   </p>
   <p>
    and by-and-by, as if instigated by a former thought, he drew from his
   </p>
   <p>
    pocket a small book, between the leaves of which was folded a letter,
   </p>
   <p>
    worn and soiled, as from much re-reading. D’Urberville opened the
   </p>
   <p>
    letter. It was dated several months before this time, and was signed by
   </p>
   <p>
    Parson Clare.
   </p>
   <p>
    The letter began by expressing the writer’s unfeigned joy at
   </p>
   <p>
    d’Urberville’s conversion, and thanked him for his kindness in
   </p>
   <p>
    communicating with the parson on the subject. It expressed Mr Clare’s
   </p>
   <p>
    warm assurance of forgiveness for d’Urberville’s former conduct and his
   </p>
   <p>
    interest in the young man’s plans for the future. He, Mr Clare, would
   </p>
   <p>
    much have liked to see d’Urberville in the Church to whose ministry he
   </p>
   <p>
    had devoted so many years of his own life, and would have helped him to
   </p>
   <p>
    enter a theological college to that end; but since his correspondent
   </p>
   <p>
    had possibly not cared to do this on account of the delay it would have
   </p>
   <p>
    entailed, he was not the man to insist upon its paramount importance.
   </p>
   <p>
    Every man must work as he could best work, and in the method towards
   </p>
   <p>
    which he felt impelled by the Spirit.
   </p>
   <p>
    D’Urberville read and re-read this letter, and seemed to quiz himself
   </p>
   <p>
    cynically. He also read some passages from memoranda as he walked till
   </p>
   <p>
    his face assumed a calm, and apparently the image of Tess no longer
   </p>
   <p>
    troubled his mind.
   </p>
   <p>
    She meanwhile had kept along the edge of the hill by which lay her
   </p>
   <p>
    nearest way home. Within the distance of a mile she met a solitary
   </p>
   <p>
    shepherd.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What is the meaning of that old stone I have passed?” she asked of
   </p>
   <p>
    him. “Was it ever a Holy Cross?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Cross—no; ’twer not a cross! ’Tis a thing of ill-omen, Miss. It was
   </p>
   <p>
    put up in wuld times by the relations of a malefactor who was tortured
   </p>
   <p>
    there by nailing his hand to a post and afterwards hung. The bones lie
   </p>
   <p>
    underneath. They say he sold his soul to the devil, and that he walks
   </p>
   <p>
    at times.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She felt the _petite mort_ at this unexpectedly gruesome information,
   </p>
   <p>
    and left the solitary man behind her. It was dusk when she drew near to
   </p>
   <p>
    Flintcomb-Ash, and in the lane at the entrance to the hamlet she
   </p>
   <p>
    approached a girl and her lover without their observing her. They were
   </p>
   <p>
    talking no secrets, and the clear unconcerned voice of the young woman,
   </p>
   <p>
    in response to the warmer accents of the man, spread into the chilly
   </p>
   <p>
    air as the one soothing thing within the dusky horizon, full of a
   </p>
   <p>
    stagnant obscurity upon which nothing else intruded. For a moment the
   </p>
   <p>
    voices cheered the heart of Tess, till she reasoned that this interview
   </p>
   <p>
    had its origin, on one side or the other, in the same attraction which
   </p>
   <p>
    had been the prelude to her own tribulation. When she came close, the
   </p>
   <p>
    girl turned serenely and recognized her, the young man walking off in
   </p>
   <p>
    embarrassment. The woman was Izz Huett, whose interest in Tess’s
   </p>
   <p>
    excursion immediately superseded her own proceedings. Tess did not
   </p>
   <p>
    explain very clearly its results, and Izz, who was a girl of tact,
   </p>
   <p>
    began to speak of her own little affair, a phase of which Tess had just
   </p>
   <p>
    witnessed.
   </p>
   <p>
    “He is Amby Seedling, the chap who used to sometimes come and help at
   </p>
   <p>
    Talbothays,” she explained indifferently. “He actually inquired and
   </p>
   <p>
    found out that I had come here, and has followed me. He says he’s been
   </p>
   <p>
    in love wi’ me these two years. But I’ve hardly answered him.”
   </p>
   <p>
    XLVI
   </p>
   <p>
    Several days had passed since her futile journey, and Tess was afield.
   </p>
   <p>
    The dry winter wind still blew, but a screen of thatched hurdles
   </p>
   <p>
    erected in the eye of the blast kept its force away from her. On the
   </p>
   <p>
    sheltered side was a turnip-slicing machine, whose bright blue hue of
   </p>
   <p>
    new paint seemed almost vocal in the otherwise subdued scene. Opposite
   </p>
   <p>
    its front was a long mound or “grave”, in which the roots had been
   </p>
   <p>
    preserved since early winter. Tess was standing at the uncovered end,
   </p>
   <p>
    chopping off with a bill-hook the fibres and earth from each root, and
   </p>
   <p>
    throwing it after the operation into the slicer. A man was turning the
   </p>
   <p>
    handle of the machine, and from its trough came the newly-cut swedes,
   </p>
   <p>
    the fresh smell of whose yellow chips was accompanied by the sounds of
   </p>
   <p>
    the snuffling wind, the smart swish of the slicing-blades, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    choppings of the hook in Tess’s leather-gloved hand.
   </p>
   <p>
    The wide acreage of blank agricultural brownness, apparent where the
   </p>
   <p>
    swedes had been pulled, was beginning to be striped in wales of darker
   </p>
   <p>
    brown, gradually broadening to ribands. Along the edge of each of these
   </p>
   <p>
    something crept upon ten legs, moving without haste and without rest up
   </p>
   <p>
    and down the whole length of the field; it was two horses and a man,
   </p>
   <p>
    the plough going between them, turning up the cleared ground for a
   </p>
   <p>
    spring sowing.
   </p>
   <p>
    For hours nothing relieved the joyless monotony of things. Then, far
   </p>
   <p>
    beyond the ploughing-teams, a black speck was seen. It had come from
   </p>
   <p>
    the corner of a fence, where there was a gap, and its tendency was up
   </p>
   <p>
    the incline, towards the swede-cutters. From the proportions of a mere
   </p>
   <p>
    point it advanced to the shape of a ninepin, and was soon perceived to
   </p>
   <p>
    be a man in black, arriving from the direction of Flintcomb-Ash. The
   </p>
   <p>
    man at the slicer, having nothing else to do with his eyes, continually
   </p>
   <p>
    observed the comer, but Tess, who was occupied, did not perceive him
   </p>
   <p>
    till her companion directed her attention to his approach.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was not her hard taskmaster, Farmer Groby; it was one in a
   </p>
   <p>
    semi-clerical costume, who now represented what had once been the
   </p>
   <p>
    free-and-easy Alec d’Urberville. Not being hot at his preaching there
   </p>
   <p>
    was less enthusiasm about him now, and the presence of the grinder
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed to embarrass him. A pale distress was already on Tess’s face,
   </p>
   <p>
    and she pulled her curtained hood further over it.
   </p>
   <p>
    D’Urberville came up and said quietly—
   </p>
   <p>
    “I want to speak to you, Tess.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You have refused my last request, not to come near me!” said she.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, but I have a good reason.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, tell it.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It is more serious than you may think.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He glanced round to see if he were overheard. They were at some
   </p>
   <p>
    distance from the man who turned the slicer, and the movement of the
   </p>
   <p>
    machine, too, sufficiently prevented Alec’s words reaching other ears.
   </p>
   <p>
    D’Urberville placed himself so as to screen Tess from the labourer,
   </p>
   <p>
    turning his back to the latter.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It is this,” he continued, with capricious compunction. “In thinking
   </p>
   <p>
    of your soul and mine when we last met, I neglected to inquire as to
   </p>
   <p>
    your worldly condition. You were well dressed, and I did not think of
   </p>
   <p>
    it. But I see now that it is hard—harder than it used to be when I—knew
   </p>
   <p>
    you—harder than you deserve. Perhaps a good deal of it is owning to
   </p>
   <p>
    me!”
   </p>
   <p>
    She did not answer, and he watched her inquiringly, as, with bent head,
   </p>
   <p>
    her face completely screened by the hood, she resumed her trimming of
   </p>
   <p>
    the swedes. By going on with her work she felt better able to keep him
   </p>
   <p>
    outside her emotions.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tess,” he added, with a sigh of discontent,—“yours was the very worst
   </p>
   <p>
    case I ever was concerned in! I had no idea of what had resulted till
   </p>
   <p>
    you told me. Scamp that I was to foul that innocent life! The whole
   </p>
   <p>
    blame was mine—the whole unconventional business of our time at
   </p>
   <p>
    Trantridge. You, too, the real blood of which I am but the base
   </p>
   <p>
    imitation, what a blind young thing you were as to possibilities! I say
   </p>
   <p>
    in all earnestness that it is a shame for parents to bring up their
   </p>
   <p>
    girls in such dangerous ignorance of the gins and nets that the wicked
   </p>
   <p>
    may set for them, whether their motive be a good one or the result of
   </p>
   <p>
    simple indifference.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess still did no more than listen, throwing down one globular root and
   </p>
   <p>
    taking up another with automatic regularity, the pensive contour of the
   </p>
   <p>
    mere fieldwoman alone marking her.
   </p>
   <p>
    “But it is not that I came to say,” d’Urberville went on. “My
   </p>
   <p>
    circumstances are these. I have lost my mother since you were at
   </p>
   <p>
    Trantridge, and the place is my own. But I intend to sell it, and
   </p>
   <p>
    devote myself to missionary work in Africa. A devil of a poor hand I
   </p>
   <p>
    shall make at the trade, no doubt. However, what I want to ask you is,
   </p>
   <p>
    will you put it in my power to do my duty—to make the only reparation I
   </p>
   <p>
    can make for the trick played you: that is, will you be my wife, and go
   </p>
   <p>
    with me?... I have already obtained this precious document. It was my
   </p>
   <p>
    old mother’s dying wish.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He drew a piece of parchment from his pocket, with a slight fumbling of
   </p>
   <p>
    embarrassment.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What is it?” said she.
   </p>
   <p>
    “A marriage licence.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O no, sir—no!” she said quickly, starting back.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You will not? Why is that?”
   </p>
   <p>
    And as he asked the question a disappointment which was not entirely
   </p>
   <p>
    the disappointment of thwarted duty crossed d’Urberville’s face. It was
   </p>
   <p>
    unmistakably a symptom that something of his old passion for her had
   </p>
   <p>
    been revived; duty and desire ran hand-in-hand.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Surely,” he began again, in more impetuous tones, and then looked
   </p>
   <p>
    round at the labourer who turned the slicer.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess, too, felt that the argument could not be ended there. Informing
   </p>
   <p>
    the man that a gentleman had come to see her, with whom she wished to
   </p>
   <p>
    walk a little way, she moved off with d’Urberville across the
   </p>
   <p>
    zebra-striped field. When they reached the first newly-ploughed section
   </p>
   <p>
    he held out his hand to help her over it; but she stepped forward on
   </p>
   <p>
    the summits of the earth-rolls as if she did not see him.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You will not marry me, Tess, and make me a self-respecting man?” he
   </p>
   <p>
    repeated, as soon as they were over the furrows.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I cannot.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But why?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You know I have no affection for you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But you would get to feel that in time, perhaps—as soon as you really
   </p>
   <p>
    could forgive me?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Never!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why so positive?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I love somebody else.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The words seemed to astonish him.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You do?” he cried. “Somebody else? But has not a sense of what is
   </p>
   <p>
    morally right and proper any weight with you?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No, no, no—don’t say that!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Anyhow, then, your love for this other man may be only a passing
   </p>
   <p>
    feeling which you will overcome—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No—no.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, yes! Why not?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I cannot tell you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You must in honour!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well then.... I have married him.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah!” he exclaimed; and he stopped dead and gazed at her.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I did not wish to tell—I did not mean to!” she pleaded. “It is a
   </p>
   <p>
    secret here, or at any rate but dimly known. So will you, _please_ will
   </p>
   <p>
    you, keep from questioning me? You must remember that we are now
   </p>
   <p>
    strangers.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Strangers—are we? Strangers!”
   </p>
   <p>
    For a moment a flash of his old irony marked his face; but he
   </p>
   <p>
    determinedly chastened it down.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Is that man your husband?” he asked mechanically, denoting by a sign
   </p>
   <p>
    the labourer who turned the machine.
   </p>
   <p>
    “That man!” she said proudly. “I should think not!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Who, then?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Do not ask what I do not wish to tell!” she begged, and flashed her
   </p>
   <p>
    appeal to him from her upturned face and lash-shadowed eyes.
   </p>
   <p>
    D’Urberville was disturbed.
   </p>
   <p>
    “But I only asked for your sake!” he retorted hotly. “Angels of
   </p>
   <p>
    heaven!—God forgive me for such an expression—I came here, I swear, as
   </p>
   <p>
    I thought for your good. Tess—don’t look at me so—I cannot stand your
   </p>
   <p>
    looks! There never were such eyes, surely, before Christianity or
   </p>
   <p>
    since! There—I won’t lose my head; I dare not. I own that the sight of
   </p>
   <p>
    you had waked up my love for you, which, I believed, was extinguished
   </p>
   <p>
    with all such feelings. But I thought that our marriage might be a
   </p>
   <p>
    sanctification for us both. ‘The unbelieving husband is sanctified by
   </p>
   <p>
    the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband,’ I
   </p>
   <p>
    said to myself. But my plan is dashed from me; and I must bear the
   </p>
   <p>
    disappointment!”
   </p>
   <p>
    He moodily reflected with his eyes on the ground.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Married. Married!... Well, that being so,” he added, quite calmly,
   </p>
   <p>
    tearing the licence slowly into halves and putting them in his pocket;
   </p>
   <p>
    “that being prevented, I should like to do some good to you and your
   </p>
   <p>
    husband, whoever he may be. There are many questions that I am tempted
   </p>
   <p>
    to ask, but I will not do so, of course, in opposition to your wishes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Though, if I could know your husband, I might more easily benefit him
   </p>
   <p>
    and you. Is he on this farm?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No,” she murmured. “He is far away.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Far away? From _you_? What sort of husband can he be?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O, do not speak against him! It was through you! He found out—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah, is it so!... That’s sad, Tess!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But to stay away from you—to leave you to work like this!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “He does not leave me to work!” she cried, springing to the defence of
   </p>
   <p>
    the absent one with all her fervour. “He don’t know it! It is by my own
   </p>
   <p>
    arrangement.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Then, does he write?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I—I cannot tell you. There are things which are private to ourselves.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Of course that means that he does not. You are a deserted wife, my
   </p>
   <p>
    fair Tess—”
   </p>
   <p>
    In an impulse he turned suddenly to take her hand; the buff-glove was
   </p>
   <p>
    on it, and he seized only the rough leather fingers which did not
   </p>
   <p>
    express the life or shape of those within.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You must not—you must not!” she cried fearfully, slipping her hand
   </p>
   <p>
    from the glove as from a pocket, and leaving it in his grasp. “O, will
   </p>
   <p>
    you go away—for the sake of me and my husband—go, in the name of your
   </p>
   <p>
    own Christianity!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, yes; I will,” he said abruptly, and thrusting the glove back to
   </p>
   <p>
    her he turned to leave. Facing round, however, he said, “Tess, as God
   </p>
   <p>
    is my judge, I meant no humbug in taking your hand!”
   </p>
   <p>
    A pattering of hoofs on the soil of the field, which they had not
   </p>
   <p>
    noticed in their preoccupation, ceased close behind them; and a voice
   </p>
   <p>
    reached her ear:
   </p>
   <p>
    “What the devil are you doing away from your work at this time o’ day?”
   </p>
   <p>
    Farmer Groby had espied the two figures from the distance, and had
   </p>
   <p>
    inquisitively ridden across, to learn what was their business in his
   </p>
   <p>
    field.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Don’t speak like that to her!” said d’Urberville, his face blackening
   </p>
   <p>
    with something that was not Christianity.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Indeed, Mister! And what mid Methodist pa’sons have to do with she?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Who is the fellow?” asked d’Urberville, turning to Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    She went close up to him.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Go—I do beg you!” she said.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What! And leave you to that tyrant? I can see in his face what a churl
   </p>
   <p>
    he is.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “He won’t hurt me. _He’s_ not in love with me. I can leave at
   </p>
   <p>
    Lady-Day.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, I have no right but to obey, I suppose. But—well, goodbye!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Her defender, whom she dreaded more than her assailant, having
   </p>
   <p>
    reluctantly disappeared, the farmer continued his reprimand, which Tess
   </p>
   <p>
    took with the greatest coolness, that sort of attack being independent
   </p>
   <p>
    of sex. To have as a master this man of stone, who would have cuffed
   </p>
   <p>
    her if he had dared, was almost a relief after her former experiences.
   </p>
   <p>
    She silently walked back towards the summit of the field that was the
   </p>
   <p>
    scene of her labour, so absorbed in the interview which had just taken
   </p>
   <p>
    place that she was hardly aware that the nose of Groby’s horse almost
   </p>
   <p>
    touched her shoulders.
   </p>
   <p>
    “If so be you make an agreement to work for me till Lady-Day, I’ll see
   </p>
   <p>
    that you carry it out,” he growled. “’Od rot the women—now ’tis one
   </p>
   <p>
    thing, and then ’tis another. But I’ll put up with it no longer!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Knowing very well that he did not harass the other women of the farm as
   </p>
   <p>
    he harassed her out of spite for the flooring he had once received, she
   </p>
   <p>
    did for one moment picture what might have been the result if she had
   </p>
   <p>
    been free to accept the offer just made her of being the monied Alec’s
   </p>
   <p>
    wife. It would have lifted her completely out of subjection, not only
   </p>
   <p>
    to her present oppressive employer, but to a whole world who seemed to
   </p>
   <p>
    despise her. “But no, no!” she said breathlessly; “I could not have
   </p>
   <p>
    married him now! He is so unpleasant to me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    That very night she began an appealing letter to Clare, concealing from
   </p>
   <p>
    him her hardships, and assuring him of her undying affection. Any one
   </p>
   <p>
    who had been in a position to read between the lines would have seen
   </p>
   <p>
    that at the back of her great love was some monstrous fear—almost a
   </p>
   <p>
    desperation—as to some secret contingencies which were not disclosed.
   </p>
   <p>
    But again she did not finish her effusion; he had asked Izz to go with
   </p>
   <p>
    him, and perhaps he did not care for her at all. She put the letter in
   </p>
   <p>
    her box, and wondered if it would ever reach Angel’s hands.
   </p>
   <p>
    After this her daily tasks were gone through heavily enough, and
   </p>
   <p>
    brought on the day which was of great import to agriculturists—the day
   </p>
   <p>
    of the Candlemas Fair. It was at this fair that new engagements were
   </p>
   <p>
    entered into for the twelve months following the ensuing Lady-Day, and
   </p>
   <p>
    those of the farming population who thought of changing their places
   </p>
   <p>
    duly attended at the county-town where the fair was held. Nearly all
   </p>
   <p>
    the labourers on Flintcomb-Ash farm intended flight, and early in the
   </p>
   <p>
    morning there was a general exodus in the direction of the town, which
   </p>
   <p>
    lay at a distance of from ten to a dozen miles over hilly country.
   </p>
   <p>
    Though Tess also meant to leave at the quarter-day, she was one of the
   </p>
   <p>
    few who did not go to the fair, having a vaguely-shaped hope that
   </p>
   <p>
    something would happen to render another outdoor engagement
   </p>
   <p>
    unnecessary.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was a peaceful February day, of wonderful softness for the time, and
   </p>
   <p>
    one would almost have thought that winter was over. She had hardly
   </p>
   <p>
    finished her dinner when d’Urberville’s figure darkened the window of
   </p>
   <p>
    the cottage wherein she was a lodger, which she had all to herself
   </p>
   <p>
    to-day.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess jumped up, but her visitor had knocked at the door, and she could
   </p>
   <p>
    hardly in reason run away. D’Urberville’s knock, his walk up to the
   </p>
   <p>
    door, had some indescribable quality of difference from his air when
   </p>
   <p>
    she last saw him. They seemed to be acts of which the doer was ashamed.
   </p>
   <p>
    She thought that she would not open the door; but, as there was no
   </p>
   <p>
    sense in that either, she arose, and having lifted the latch stepped
   </p>
   <p>
    back quickly. He came in, saw her, and flung himself down into a chair
   </p>
   <p>
    before speaking.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tess—I couldn’t help it!” he began desperately, as he wiped his heated
   </p>
   <p>
    face, which had also a superimposed flush of excitement. “I felt that I
   </p>
   <p>
    must call at least to ask how you are. I assure you I had not been
   </p>
   <p>
    thinking of you at all till I saw you that Sunday; now I cannot get rid
   </p>
   <p>
    of your image, try how I may! It is hard that a good woman should do
   </p>
   <p>
    harm to a bad man; yet so it is. If you would only pray for me, Tess!”
   </p>
   <p>
    The suppressed discontent of his manner was almost pitiable, and yet
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess did not pity him.
   </p>
   <p>
    “How can I pray for you,” she said, “when I am forbidden to believe
   </p>
   <p>
    that the great Power who moves the world would alter His plans on my
   </p>
   <p>
    account?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You really think that?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes. I have been cured of the presumption of thinking otherwise.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Cured? By whom?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “By my husband, if I must tell.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah—your husband—your husband! How strange it seems! I remember you
   </p>
   <p>
    hinted something of the sort the other day. What do you really believe
   </p>
   <p>
    in these matters, Tess?” he asked. “You seem to have no
   </p>
   <p>
    religion—perhaps owing to me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But I have. Though I don’t believe in anything supernatural.”
   </p>
   <p>
    D’Urberville looked at her with misgiving.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Then do you think that the line I take is all wrong?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “A good deal of it.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “H’m—and yet I’ve felt so sure about it,” he said uneasily.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I believe in the _spirit_ of the Sermon on the Mount, and so did my
   </p>
   <p>
    dear husband.... But I don’t believe—”
   </p>
   <p>
    Here she gave her negations.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The fact is,” said d’Urberville drily, “whatever your dear husband
   </p>
   <p>
    believed you accept, and whatever he rejected you reject, without the
   </p>
   <p>
    least inquiry or reasoning on your own part. That’s just like you
   </p>
   <p>
    women. Your mind is enslaved to his.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah, because he knew everything!” said she, with a triumphant
   </p>
   <p>
    simplicity of faith in Angel Clare that the most perfect man could
   </p>
   <p>
    hardly have deserved, much less her husband.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, but you should not take negative opinions wholesale from another
   </p>
   <p>
    person like that. A pretty fellow he must be to teach you such
   </p>
   <p>
    scepticism!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “He never forced my judgement! He would never argue on the subject with
   </p>
   <p>
    me! But I looked at it in this way; what he believed, after inquiring
   </p>
   <p>
    deep into doctrines, was much more likely to be right than what I might
   </p>
   <p>
    believe, who hadn’t looked into doctrines at all.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “What used he to say? He must have said something?”
   </p>
   <p>
    She reflected; and with her acute memory for the letter of Angel
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare’s remarks, even when she did not comprehend their spirit, she
   </p>
   <p>
    recalled a merciless polemical syllogism that she had heard him use
   </p>
   <p>
    when, as it occasionally happened, he indulged in a species of thinking
   </p>
   <p>
    aloud with her at his side. In delivering it she gave also Clare’s
   </p>
   <p>
    accent and manner with reverential faithfulness.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Say that again,” asked d’Urberville, who had listened with the
   </p>
   <p>
    greatest attention.
   </p>
   <p>
    She repeated the argument, and d’Urberville thoughtfully murmured the
   </p>
   <p>
    words after her.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Anything else?” he presently asked.
   </p>
   <p>
    “He said at another time something like this”; and she gave another,
   </p>
   <p>
    which might possibly have been paralleled in many a work of the
   </p>
   <p>
    pedigree ranging from the _Dictionnaire Philosophique_ to Huxley’s
   </p>
   <p>
    _Essays_.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah—ha! How do you remember them?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I wanted to believe what he believed, though he didn’t wish me to; and
   </p>
   <p>
    I managed to coax him to tell me a few of his thoughts. I can’t say I
   </p>
   <p>
    quite understand that one; but I know it is right.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “H’m. Fancy your being able to teach me what you don’t know yourself!”
   </p>
   <p>
    He fell into thought.
   </p>
   <p>
    “And so I threw in my spiritual lot with his,” she resumed. “I didn’t
   </p>
   <p>
    wish it to be different. What’s good enough for him is good enough for
   </p>
   <p>
    me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Does he know that you are as big an infidel as he?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No—I never told him—if I am an infidel.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well—you are better off to-day that I am, Tess, after all! You don’t
   </p>
   <p>
    believe that you ought to preach my doctrine, and, therefore, do no
   </p>
   <p>
    despite to your conscience in abstaining. I do believe I ought to
   </p>
   <p>
    preach it, but, like the devils, I believe and tremble, for I suddenly
   </p>
   <p>
    leave off preaching it, and give way to my passion for you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “How?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why,” he said aridly; “I have come all the way here to see you to-day!
   </p>
   <p>
    But I started from home to go to Casterbridge Fair, where I have
   </p>
   <p>
    undertaken to preach the Word from a waggon at half-past two this
   </p>
   <p>
    afternoon, and where all the brethren are expecting me this minute.
   </p>
   <p>
    Here’s the announcement.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He drew from his breast-pocket a poster whereon was printed the day,
   </p>
   <p>
    hour, and place of meeting, at which he, d’Urberville, would preach the
   </p>
   <p>
    Gospel as aforesaid.
   </p>
   <p>
    “But how can you get there?” said Tess, looking at the clock.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I cannot get there! I have come here.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “What, you have really arranged to preach, and—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I have arranged to preach, and I shall not be there—by reason of my
   </p>
   <p>
    burning desire to see a woman whom I once despised!—No, by my word and
   </p>
   <p>
    truth, I never despised you; if I had I should not love you now! Why I
   </p>
   <p>
    did not despise you was on account of your being unsmirched in spite of
   </p>
   <p>
    all; you withdrew yourself from me so quickly and resolutely when you
   </p>
   <p>
    saw the situation; you did not remain at my pleasure; so there was one
   </p>
   <p>
    petticoat in the world for whom I had no contempt, and you are she. But
   </p>
   <p>
    you may well despise me now! I thought I worshipped on the mountains,
   </p>
   <p>
    but I find I still serve in the groves! Ha! ha!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O Alec d’Urberville! what does this mean? What have I done!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Done?” he said, with a soulless sneer in the word. “Nothing
   </p>
   <p>
    intentionally. But you have been the means—the innocent means—of my
   </p>
   <p>
    backsliding, as they call it. I ask myself, am I, indeed, one of those
   </p>
   <p>
    ‘servants of corruption’ who, ‘after they have escaped the pollutions
   </p>
   <p>
    of the world, are again entangled therein and overcome’—whose latter
   </p>
   <p>
    end is worse than their beginning?” He laid his hand on her shoulder.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tess, my girl, I was on the way to, at least, social salvation till I
   </p>
   <p>
    saw you again!” he said freakishly shaking her, as if she were a child.
   </p>
   <p>
    “And why then have you tempted me? I was firm as a man could be till I
   </p>
   <p>
    saw those eyes and that mouth again—surely there never was such a
   </p>
   <p>
    maddening mouth since Eve’s!” His voice sank, and a hot archness shot
   </p>
   <p>
    from his own black eyes. “You temptress, Tess; you dear damned witch of
   </p>
   <p>
    Babylon—I could not resist you as soon as I met you again!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I couldn’t help your seeing me again!” said Tess, recoiling.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I know it—I repeat that I do not blame you. But the fact remains. When
   </p>
   <p>
    I saw you ill-used on the farm that day I was nearly mad to think that
   </p>
   <p>
    I had no legal right to protect you—that I could not have it; whilst he
   </p>
   <p>
    who has it seems to neglect you utterly!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Don’t speak against him—he is absent!” she cried in much excitement.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Treat him honourably—he has never wronged you! O leave his wife before
   </p>
   <p>
    any scandal spreads that may do harm to his honest name!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I will—I will,” he said, like a man awakening from a luring dream. “I
   </p>
   <p>
    have broken my engagement to preach to those poor drunken boobies at
   </p>
   <p>
    the fair—it is the first time I have played such a practical joke. A
   </p>
   <p>
    month ago I should have been horrified at such a possibility. I’ll go
   </p>
   <p>
    away—to swear—and—ah, can I! to keep away.” Then, suddenly: “One clasp,
   </p>
   <p>
    Tessy—one! Only for old friendship—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am without defence. Alec! A good man’s honour is in my
   </p>
   <p>
    keeping—think—be ashamed!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Pooh! Well, yes—yes!”
   </p>
   <p>
    He clenched his lips, mortified with himself for his weakness. His eyes
   </p>
   <p>
    were equally barren of worldly and religious faith. The corpses of
   </p>
   <p>
    those old fitful passions which had lain inanimate amid the lines of
   </p>
   <p>
    his face ever since his reformation seemed to wake and come together as
   </p>
   <p>
    in a resurrection. He went out indeterminately.
   </p>
   <p>
    Though d’Urberville had declared that this breach of his engagement
   </p>
   <p>
    to-day was the simple backsliding of a believer, Tess’s words, as
   </p>
   <p>
    echoed from Angel Clare, had made a deep impression upon him, and
   </p>
   <p>
    continued to do so after he had left her. He moved on in silence, as if
   </p>
   <p>
    his energies were benumbed by the hitherto undreamt-of possibility that
   </p>
   <p>
    his position was untenable. Reason had had nothing to do with his
   </p>
   <p>
    whimsical conversion, which was perhaps the mere freak of a careless
   </p>
   <p>
    man in search of a new sensation, and temporarily impressed by his
   </p>
   <p>
    mother’s death.
   </p>
   <p>
    The drops of logic Tess had let fall into the sea of his enthusiasm
   </p>
   <p>
    served to chill its effervescence to stagnation. He said to himself, as
   </p>
   <p>
    he pondered again and again over the crystallized phrases that she had
   </p>
   <p>
    handed on to him, “That clever fellow little thought that, by telling
   </p>
   <p>
    her those things, he might be paving my way back to her!”
   </p>
   <p>
    XLVII
   </p>
   <p>
    It is the threshing of the last wheat-rick at Flintcomb-Ash farm. The
   </p>
   <p>
    dawn of the March morning is singularly inexpressive, and there is
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing to show where the eastern horizon lies. Against the twilight
   </p>
   <p>
    rises the trapezoidal top of the stack, which has stood forlornly here
   </p>
   <p>
    through the washing and bleaching of the wintry weather.
   </p>
   <p>
    When Izz Huett and Tess arrived at the scene of operations only a
   </p>
   <p>
    rustling denoted that others had preceded them; to which, as the light
   </p>
   <p>
    increased, there were presently added the silhouettes of two men on the
   </p>
   <p>
    summit. They were busily “unhaling” the rick, that is, stripping off
   </p>
   <p>
    the thatch before beginning to throw down the sheaves; and while this
   </p>
   <p>
    was in progress Izz and Tess, with the other women-workers, in their
   </p>
   <p>
    whitey-brown pinners, stood waiting and shivering, Farmer Groby having
   </p>
   <p>
    insisted upon their being on the spot thus early to get the job over if
   </p>
   <p>
    possible by the end of the day. Close under the eaves of the stack, and
   </p>
   <p>
    as yet barely visible, was the red tyrant that the women had come to
   </p>
   <p>
    serve—a timber-framed construction, with straps and wheels
   </p>
   <p>
    appertaining—the threshing-machine which, whilst it was going, kept up
   </p>
   <p>
    a despotic demand upon the endurance of their muscles and nerves.
   </p>
   <p>
    A little way off there was another indistinct figure; this one black,
   </p>
   <p>
    with a sustained hiss that spoke of strength very much in reserve. The
   </p>
   <p>
    long chimney running up beside an ash-tree, and the warmth which
   </p>
   <p>
    radiated from the spot, explained without the necessity of much
   </p>
   <p>
    daylight that here was the engine which was to act as the _primum
   </p>
   <p>
    mobile_ of this little world. By the engine stood a dark, motionless
   </p>
   <p>
    being, a sooty and grimy embodiment of tallness, in a sort of trance,
   </p>
   <p>
    with a heap of coals by his side: it was the engine-man. The isolation
   </p>
   <p>
    of his manner and colour lent him the appearance of a creature from
   </p>
   <p>
    Tophet, who had strayed into the pellucid smokelessness of this region
   </p>
   <p>
    of yellow grain and pale soil, with which he had nothing in common, to
   </p>
   <p>
    amaze and to discompose its aborigines.
   </p>
   <p>
    What he looked he felt. He was in the agricultural world, but not of
   </p>
   <p>
    it. He served fire and smoke; these denizens of the fields served
   </p>
   <p>
    vegetation, weather, frost, and sun. He travelled with his engine from
   </p>
   <p>
    farm to farm, from county to county, for as yet the steam
   </p>
   <p>
    threshing-machine was itinerant in this part of Wessex. He spoke in a
   </p>
   <p>
    strange northern accent; his thoughts being turned inwards upon
   </p>
   <p>
    himself, his eye on his iron charge, hardly perceiving the scenes
   </p>
   <p>
    around him, and caring for them not at all: holding only strictly
   </p>
   <p>
    necessary intercourse with the natives, as if some ancient doom
   </p>
   <p>
    compelled him to wander here against his will in the service of his
   </p>
   <p>
    Plutonic master. The long strap which ran from the driving-wheel of his
   </p>
   <p>
    engine to the red thresher under the rick was the sole tie-line between
   </p>
   <p>
    agriculture and him.
   </p>
   <p>
    While they uncovered the sheaves he stood apathetic beside his portable
   </p>
   <p>
    repository of force, round whose hot blackness the morning air
   </p>
   <p>
    quivered. He had nothing to do with preparatory labour. His fire was
   </p>
   <p>
    waiting incandescent, his steam was at high pressure, in a few seconds
   </p>
   <p>
    he could make the long strap move at an invisible velocity. Beyond its
   </p>
   <p>
    extent the environment might be corn, straw, or chaos; it was all the
   </p>
   <p>
    same to him. If any of the autochthonous idlers asked him what he
   </p>
   <p>
    called himself, he replied shortly, “an engineer.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The rick was unhaled by full daylight; the men then took their places,
   </p>
   <p>
    the women mounted, and the work began. Farmer Groby—or, as they called
   </p>
   <p>
    him, “he”—had arrived ere this, and by his orders Tess was placed on
   </p>
   <p>
    the platform of the machine, close to the man who fed it, her business
   </p>
   <p>
    being to untie every sheaf of corn handed on to her by Izz Huett, who
   </p>
   <p>
    stood next, but on the rick; so that the feeder could seize it and
   </p>
   <p>
    spread it over the revolving drum, which whisked out every grain in one
   </p>
   <p>
    moment.
   </p>
   <p>
    They were soon in full progress, after a preparatory hitch or two,
   </p>
   <p>
    which rejoiced the hearts of those who hated machinery. The work sped
   </p>
   <p>
    on till breakfast time, when the thresher was stopped for half an hour;
   </p>
   <p>
    and on starting again after the meal the whole supplementary strength
   </p>
   <p>
    of the farm was thrown into the labour of constructing the straw-rick,
   </p>
   <p>
    which began to grow beside the stack of corn. A hasty lunch was eaten
   </p>
   <p>
    as they stood, without leaving their positions, and then another couple
   </p>
   <p>
    of hours brought them near to dinner-time; the inexorable wheel
   </p>
   <p>
    continuing to spin, and the penetrating hum of the thresher to thrill
   </p>
   <p>
    to the very marrow all who were near the revolving wire-cage.
   </p>
   <p>
    The old men on the rising straw-rick talked of the past days when they
   </p>
   <p>
    had been accustomed to thresh with flails on the oaken barn-floor; when
   </p>
   <p>
    everything, even to winnowing, was effected by hand-labour, which, to
   </p>
   <p>
    their thinking, though slow, produced better results. Those, too, on
   </p>
   <p>
    the corn-rick talked a little; but the perspiring ones at the machine,
   </p>
   <p>
    including Tess, could not lighten their duties by the exchange of many
   </p>
   <p>
    words. It was the ceaselessness of the work which tried her so
   </p>
   <p>
    severely, and began to make her wish that she had never some to
   </p>
   <p>
    Flintcomb-Ash. The women on the corn-rick—Marian, who was one of them,
   </p>
   <p>
    in particular—could stop to drink ale or cold tea from the flagon now
   </p>
   <p>
    and then, or to exchange a few gossiping remarks while they wiped their
   </p>
   <p>
    faces or cleared the fragments of straw and husk from their clothing;
   </p>
   <p>
    but for Tess there was no respite; for, as the drum never stopped, the
   </p>
   <p>
    man who fed it could not stop, and she, who had to supply the man with
   </p>
   <p>
    untied sheaves, could not stop either, unless Marian changed places
   </p>
   <p>
    with her, which she sometimes did for half an hour in spite of Groby’s
   </p>
   <p>
    objections that she was too slow-handed for a feeder.
   </p>
   <p>
    For some probably economical reason it was usually a woman who was
   </p>
   <p>
    chosen for this particular duty, and Groby gave as his motive in
   </p>
   <p>
    selecting Tess that she was one of those who best combined strength
   </p>
   <p>
    with quickness in untying, and both with staying power, and this may
   </p>
   <p>
    have been true. The hum of the thresher, which prevented speech,
   </p>
   <p>
    increased to a raving whenever the supply of corn fell short of the
   </p>
   <p>
    regular quantity. As Tess and the man who fed could never turn their
   </p>
   <p>
    heads she did not know that just before the dinner-hour a person had
   </p>
   <p>
    come silently into the field by the gate, and had been standing under a
   </p>
   <p>
    second rick watching the scene and Tess in particular. He was dressed
   </p>
   <p>
    in a tweed suit of fashionable pattern, and he twirled a gay
   </p>
   <p>
    walking-cane.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Who is that?” said Izz Huett to Marian. She had at first addressed the
   </p>
   <p>
    inquiry to Tess, but the latter could not hear it.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Somebody’s fancy-man, I s’pose,” said Marian laconically.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’ll lay a guinea he’s after Tess.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O no. ’Tis a ranter pa’son who’s been sniffing after her lately; not a
   </p>
   <p>
    dandy like this.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well—this is the same man.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “The same man as the preacher? But he’s quite different!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “He hev left off his black coat and white neckercher, and hev cut off
   </p>
   <p>
    his whiskers; but he’s the same man for all that.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “D’ye really think so? Then I’ll tell her,” said Marian.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Don’t. She’ll see him soon enough, good-now.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, I don’t think it at all right for him to join his preaching to
   </p>
   <p>
    courting a married woman, even though her husband mid be abroad, and
   </p>
   <p>
    she, in a sense, a widow.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh—he can do her no harm,” said Izz drily. “Her mind can no more be
   </p>
   <p>
    heaved from that one place where it do bide than a stooded waggon from
   </p>
   <p>
    the hole he’s in. Lord love ’ee, neither court-paying, nor preaching,
   </p>
   <p>
    nor the seven thunders themselves, can wean a woman when ’twould be
   </p>
   <p>
    better for her that she should be weaned.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Dinner-time came, and the whirling ceased; whereupon Tess left her
   </p>
   <p>
    post, her knees trembling so wretchedly with the shaking of the machine
   </p>
   <p>
    that she could scarcely walk.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You ought to het a quart o’ drink into ’ee, as I’ve done,” said
   </p>
   <p>
    Marian. “You wouldn’t look so white then. Why, souls above us, your
   </p>
   <p>
    face is as if you’d been hagrode!”
   </p>
   <p>
    It occurred to the good-natured Marian that, as Tess was so tired, her
   </p>
   <p>
    discovery of her visitor’s presence might have the bad effect of taking
   </p>
   <p>
    away her appetite; and Marian was thinking of inducing Tess to descend
   </p>
   <p>
    by a ladder on the further side of the stack when the gentleman came
   </p>
   <p>
    forward and looked up.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess uttered a short little “Oh!” And a moment after she said, quickly,
   </p>
   <p>
    “I shall eat my dinner here—right on the rick.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Sometimes, when they were so far from their cottages, they all did
   </p>
   <p>
    this; but as there was rather a keen wind going to-day, Marian and the
   </p>
   <p>
    rest descended, and sat under the straw-stack.
   </p>
   <p>
    The newcomer was, indeed, Alec d’Urberville, the late Evangelist,
   </p>
   <p>
    despite his changed attire and aspect. It was obvious at a glance that
   </p>
   <p>
    the original _Weltlust_ had come back; that he had restored himself, as
   </p>
   <p>
    nearly as a man could do who had grown three or four years older, to
   </p>
   <p>
    the old jaunty, slapdash guise under which Tess had first known her
   </p>
   <p>
    admirer, and cousin so-called. Having decided to remain where she was,
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess sat down among the bundles, out of sight of the ground, and began
   </p>
   <p>
    her meal; till, by-and-by, she heard footsteps on the ladder, and
   </p>
   <p>
    immediately after Alec appeared upon the stack—now an oblong and level
   </p>
   <p>
    platform of sheaves. He strode across them, and sat down opposite of
   </p>
   <p>
    her without a word.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess continued to eat her modest dinner, a slice of thick pancake which
   </p>
   <p>
    she had brought with her. The other workfolk were by this time all
   </p>
   <p>
    gathered under the rick, where the loose straw formed a comfortable
   </p>
   <p>
    retreat.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am here again, as you see,” said d’Urberville.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why do you trouble me so!” she cried, reproach flashing from her very
   </p>
   <p>
    finger-ends.
   </p>
   <p>
    “_I_ trouble _you_? I think I may ask, why do you trouble me?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Sure, I don’t trouble you any-when!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You say you don’t? But you do! You haunt me. Those very eyes that you
   </p>
   <p>
    turned upon me with such a bitter flash a moment ago, they come to me
   </p>
   <p>
    just as you showed them then, in the night and in the day! Tess, ever
   </p>
   <p>
    since you told me of that child of ours, it is just as if my feelings,
   </p>
   <p>
    which have been flowing in a strong puritanical stream, had suddenly
   </p>
   <p>
    found a way open in the direction of you, and had all at once gushed
   </p>
   <p>
    through. The religious channel is left dry forthwith; and it is you who
   </p>
   <p>
    have done it!”
   </p>
   <p>
    She gazed in silence.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What—you have given up your preaching entirely?” she asked. She had
   </p>
   <p>
    gathered from Angel sufficient of the incredulity of modern thought to
   </p>
   <p>
    despise flash enthusiasm; but, as a woman, she was somewhat appalled.
   </p>
   <p>
    In affected severity d’Urberville continued—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Entirely. I have broken every engagement since that afternoon I was to
   </p>
   <p>
    address the drunkards at Casterbridge Fair. The deuce only knows what I
   </p>
   <p>
    am thought of by the brethren. Ah-ha! The brethren! No doubt they pray
   </p>
   <p>
    for me—weep for me; for they are kind people in their way. But what do
   </p>
   <p>
    I care? How could I go on with the thing when I had lost my faith in
   </p>
   <p>
    it?—it would have been hypocrisy of the basest kind! Among them I
   </p>
   <p>
    should have stood like Hymenaeus and Alexander, who were delivered over
   </p>
   <p>
    to Satan that they might learn not to blaspheme. What a grand revenge
   </p>
   <p>
    you have taken! I saw you innocent, and I deceived you. Four years
   </p>
   <p>
    after, you find me a Christian enthusiast; you then work upon me,
   </p>
   <p>
    perhaps to my complete perdition! But Tess, my coz, as I used to call
   </p>
   <p>
    you, this is only my way of talking, and you must not look so horribly
   </p>
   <p>
    concerned. Of course you have done nothing except retain your pretty
   </p>
   <p>
    face and shapely figure. I saw it on the rick before you saw me—that
   </p>
   <p>
    tight pinafore-thing sets it off, and that wing-bonnet—you field-girls
   </p>
   <p>
    should never wear those bonnets if you wish to keep out of danger.” He
   </p>
   <p>
    regarded her silently for a few moments, and with a short cynical laugh
   </p>
   <p>
    resumed: “I believe that if the bachelor-apostle, whose deputy I
   </p>
   <p>
    thought I was, had been tempted by such a pretty face, he would have
   </p>
   <p>
    let go the plough for her sake as I do!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess attempted to expostulate, but at this juncture all her fluency
   </p>
   <p>
    failed her, and without heeding he added:
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, this paradise that you supply is perhaps as good as any other,
   </p>
   <p>
    after all. But to speak seriously, Tess.” D’Urberville rose and came
   </p>
   <p>
    nearer, reclining sideways amid the sheaves, and resting upon his
   </p>
   <p>
    elbow. “Since I last saw you, I have been thinking of what you said
   </p>
   <p>
    that _he_ said. I have come to the conclusion that there does seem
   </p>
   <p>
    rather a want of common-sense in these threadbare old propositions; how
   </p>
   <p>
    I could have been so fired by poor Parson Clare’s enthusiasm, and have
   </p>
   <p>
    gone so madly to work, transcending even him, I cannot make out! As for
   </p>
   <p>
    what you said last time, on the strength of your wonderful husband’s
   </p>
   <p>
    intelligence—whose name you have never told me—about having what they
   </p>
   <p>
    call an ethical system without any dogma, I don’t see my way to that at
   </p>
   <p>
    all.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why, you can have the religion of loving-kindness and purity at least,
   </p>
   <p>
    if you can’t have—what do you call it—dogma.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O no! I’m a different sort of fellow from that! If there’s nobody to
   </p>
   <p>
    say, ‘Do this, and it will be a good thing for you after you are dead;
   </p>
   <p>
    do that, and if will be a bad thing for you,’ I can’t warm up. Hang it,
   </p>
   <p>
    I am not going to feel responsible for my deeds and passions if there’s
   </p>
   <p>
    nobody to be responsible to; and if I were you, my dear, I wouldn’t
   </p>
   <p>
    either!”
   </p>
   <p>
    She tried to argue, and tell him that he had mixed in his dull brain
   </p>
   <p>
    two matters, theology and morals, which in the primitive days of
   </p>
   <p>
    mankind had been quite distinct. But owing to Angel Clare’s reticence,
   </p>
   <p>
    to her absolute want of training, and to her being a vessel of emotions
   </p>
   <p>
    rather than reasons, she could not get on.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, never mind,” he resumed. “Here I am, my love, as in the old
   </p>
   <p>
    times!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Not as then—never as then—’tis different!” she entreated. “And there
   </p>
   <p>
    was never warmth with me! O why didn’t you keep your faith, if the loss
   </p>
   <p>
    of it has brought you to speak to me like this!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Because you’ve knocked it out of me; so the evil be upon your sweet
   </p>
   <p>
    head! Your husband little thought how his teaching would recoil upon
   </p>
   <p>
    him! Ha-ha—I’m awfully glad you have made an apostate of me all the
   </p>
   <p>
    same! Tess, I am more taken with you than ever, and I pity you too. For
   </p>
   <p>
    all your closeness, I see you are in a bad way—neglected by one who
   </p>
   <p>
    ought to cherish you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She could not get her morsels of food down her throat; her lips were
   </p>
   <p>
    dry, and she was ready to choke. The voices and laughs of the workfolk
   </p>
   <p>
    eating and drinking under the rick came to her as if they were a
   </p>
   <p>
    quarter of a mile off.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It is cruelty to me!” she said. “How—how can you treat me to this
   </p>
   <p>
    talk, if you care ever so little for me?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “True, true,” he said, wincing a little. “I did not come to reproach
   </p>
   <p>
    you for my deeds. I came Tess, to say that I don’t like you to be
   </p>
   <p>
    working like this, and I have come on purpose for you. You say you have
   </p>
   <p>
    a husband who is not I. Well, perhaps you have; but I’ve never seen
   </p>
   <p>
    him, and you’ve not told me his name; and altogether he seems rather a
   </p>
   <p>
    mythological personage. However, even if you have one, I think I am
   </p>
   <p>
    nearer to you than he is. I, at any rate, try to help you out of
   </p>
   <p>
    trouble, but he does not, bless his invisible face! The words of the
   </p>
   <p>
    stern prophet Hosea that I used to read come back to me. Don’t you know
   </p>
   <p>
    them, Tess?—‘And she shall follow after her lover, but she shall not
   </p>
   <p>
    overtake him; and she shall seek him, but shall not find him; then
   </p>
   <p>
    shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was
   </p>
   <p>
    it better with me than now!’ ... Tess, my trap is waiting just under
   </p>
   <p>
    the hill, and—darling mine, not his!—you know the rest.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Her face had been rising to a dull crimson fire while he spoke; but she
   </p>
   <p>
    did not answer.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You have been the cause of my backsliding,” he continued, stretching
   </p>
   <p>
    his arm towards her waist; “you should be willing to share it, and
   </p>
   <p>
    leave that mule you call husband for ever.”
   </p>
   <p>
    One of her leather gloves, which she had taken off to eat her
   </p>
   <p>
    skimmer-cake, lay in her lap, and without the slightest warning she
   </p>
   <p>
    passionately swung the glove by the gauntlet directly in his face. It
   </p>
   <p>
    was heavy and thick as a warrior’s, and it struck him flat on the
   </p>
   <p>
    mouth. Fancy might have regarded the act as the recrudescence of a
   </p>
   <p>
    trick in which her armed progenitors were not unpractised. Alec
   </p>
   <p>
    fiercely started up from his reclining position. A scarlet oozing
   </p>
   <p>
    appeared where her blow had alighted, and in a moment the blood began
   </p>
   <p>
    dropping from his mouth upon the straw. But he soon controlled himself,
   </p>
   <p>
    calmly drew his handkerchief from his pocket, and mopped his bleeding
   </p>
   <p>
    lips.
   </p>
   <p>
    She too had sprung up, but she sank down again. “Now, punish me!” she
   </p>
   <p>
    said, turning up her eyes to him with the hopeless defiance of the
   </p>
   <p>
    sparrow’s gaze before its captor twists its neck. “Whip me, crush me;
   </p>
   <p>
    you need not mind those people under the rick! I shall not cry out.
   </p>
   <p>
    Once victim, always victim—that’s the law!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O no, no, Tess,” he said blandly. “I can make full allowance for this.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet you most unjustly forget one thing, that I would have married you
   </p>
   <p>
    if you had not put it out of my power to do so. Did I not ask you
   </p>
   <p>
    flatly to be my wife—hey? Answer me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You did.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And you cannot be. But remember one thing!” His voice hardened as his
   </p>
   <p>
    temper got the better of him with the recollection of his sincerity in
   </p>
   <p>
    asking her and her present ingratitude, and he stepped across to her
   </p>
   <p>
    side and held her by the shoulders, so that she shook under his grasp.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Remember, my lady, I was your master once! I will be your master
   </p>
   <p>
    again. If you are any man’s wife you are mine!”
   </p>
   <p>
    The threshers now began to stir below.
   </p>
   <p>
    “So much for our quarrel,” he said, letting her go. “Now I shall leave
   </p>
   <p>
    you, and shall come again for your answer during the afternoon. You
   </p>
   <p>
    don’t know me yet! But I know you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She had not spoken again, remaining as if stunned. D’Urberville
   </p>
   <p>
    retreated over the sheaves, and descended the ladder, while the workers
   </p>
   <p>
    below rose and stretched their arms, and shook down the beer they had
   </p>
   <p>
    drunk. Then the threshing-machine started afresh; and amid the renewed
   </p>
   <p>
    rustle of the straw Tess resumed her position by the buzzing drum as
   </p>
   <p>
    one in a dream, untying sheaf after sheaf in endless succession.
   </p>
   <p>
    XLVIII
   </p>
   <p>
    In the afternoon the farmer made it known that the rick was to be
   </p>
   <p>
    finished that night, since there was a moon by which they could see to
   </p>
   <p>
    work, and the man with the engine was engaged for another farm on the
   </p>
   <p>
    morrow. Hence the twanging and humming and rustling proceeded with even
   </p>
   <p>
    less intermission than usual.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was not till “nammet”-time, about three o’clock, that Tess raised
   </p>
   <p>
    her eyes and gave a momentary glance round. She felt but little
   </p>
   <p>
    surprise at seeing that Alec d’Urberville had come back, and was
   </p>
   <p>
    standing under the hedge by the gate. He had seen her lift her eyes,
   </p>
   <p>
    and waved his hand urbanely to her, while he blew her a kiss. It meant
   </p>
   <p>
    that their quarrel was over. Tess looked down again, and carefully
   </p>
   <p>
    abstained from gazing in that direction.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus the afternoon dragged on. The wheat-rick shrank lower, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    straw-rick grew higher, and the corn-sacks were carted away. At six
   </p>
   <p>
    o’clock the wheat-rick was about shoulder-high from the ground. But the
   </p>
   <p>
    unthreshed sheaves remaining untouched seemed countless still,
   </p>
   <p>
    notwithstanding the enormous numbers that had been gulped down by the
   </p>
   <p>
    insatiable swallower, fed by the man and Tess, through whose two young
   </p>
   <p>
    hands the greater part of them had passed. And the immense stack of
   </p>
   <p>
    straw where in the morning there had been nothing, appeared as the
   </p>
   <p>
    _faeces_ of the same buzzing red glutton. From the west sky a wrathful
   </p>
   <p>
    shine—all that wild March could afford in the way of sunset—had burst
   </p>
   <p>
    forth after the cloudy day, flooding the tired and sticky faces of the
   </p>
   <p>
    threshers, and dyeing them with a coppery light, as also the flapping
   </p>
   <p>
    garments of the women, which clung to them like dull flames.
   </p>
   <p>
    A panting ache ran through the rick. The man who fed was weary, and
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess could see that the red nape of his neck was encrusted with dirt
   </p>
   <p>
    and husks. She still stood at her post, her flushed and perspiring face
   </p>
   <p>
    coated with the corndust, and her white bonnet embrowned by it. She was
   </p>
   <p>
    the only woman whose place was upon the machine so as to be shaken
   </p>
   <p>
    bodily by its spinning, and the decrease of the stack now separated her
   </p>
   <p>
    from Marian and Izz, and prevented their changing duties with her as
   </p>
   <p>
    they had done. The incessant quivering, in which every fibre of her
   </p>
   <p>
    frame participated, had thrown her into a stupefied reverie in which
   </p>
   <p>
    her arms worked on independently of her consciousness. She hardly knew
   </p>
   <p>
    where she was, and did not hear Izz Huett tell her from below that her
   </p>
   <p>
    hair was tumbling down.
   </p>
   <p>
    By degrees the freshest among them began to grow cadaverous and
   </p>
   <p>
    saucer-eyed. Whenever Tess lifted her head she beheld always the great
   </p>
   <p>
    upgrown straw-stack, with the men in shirt-sleeves upon it, against the
   </p>
   <p>
    gray north sky; in front of it the long red elevator like a Jacob’s
   </p>
   <p>
    ladder, on which a perpetual stream of threshed straw ascended, a
   </p>
   <p>
    yellow river running uphill, and spouting out on the top of the rick.
   </p>
   <p>
    She knew that Alec d’Urberville was still on the scene, observing her
   </p>
   <p>
    from some point or other, though she could not say where. There was an
   </p>
   <p>
    excuse for his remaining, for when the threshed rick drew near its
   </p>
   <p>
    final sheaves a little ratting was always done, and men unconnected
   </p>
   <p>
    with the threshing sometimes dropped in for that performance—sporting
   </p>
   <p>
    characters of all descriptions, gents with terriers and facetious
   </p>
   <p>
    pipes, roughs with sticks and stones.
   </p>
   <p>
    But there was another hour’s work before the layer of live rats at the
   </p>
   <p>
    base of the stack would be reached; and as the evening light in the
   </p>
   <p>
    direction of the Giant’s Hill by Abbot’s-Cernel dissolved away, the
   </p>
   <p>
    white-faced moon of the season arose from the horizon that lay towards
   </p>
   <p>
    Middleton Abbey and Shottsford on the other side. For the last hour or
   </p>
   <p>
    two Marian had felt uneasy about Tess, whom she could not get near
   </p>
   <p>
    enough to speak to, the other women having kept up their strength by
   </p>
   <p>
    drinking ale, and Tess having done without it through traditionary
   </p>
   <p>
    dread, owing to its results at her home in childhood. But Tess still
   </p>
   <p>
    kept going: if she could not fill her part she would have to leave; and
   </p>
   <p>
    this contingency, which she would have regarded with equanimity and
   </p>
   <p>
    even with relief a month or two earlier, had become a terror since
   </p>
   <p>
    d’Urberville had begun to hover round her.
   </p>
   <p>
    The sheaf-pitchers and feeders had now worked the rick so low that
   </p>
   <p>
    people on the ground could talk to them. To Tess’s surprise Farmer
   </p>
   <p>
    Groby came up on the machine to her, and said that if she desired to
   </p>
   <p>
    join her friend he did not wish her to keep on any longer, and would
   </p>
   <p>
    send somebody else to take her place. The “friend” was d’Urberville,
   </p>
   <p>
    she knew, and also that this concession had been granted in obedience
   </p>
   <p>
    to the request of that friend, or enemy. She shook her head and toiled
   </p>
   <p>
    on.
   </p>
   <p>
    The time for the rat-catching arrived at last, and the hunt began. The
   </p>
   <p>
    creatures had crept downwards with the subsidence of the rick till they
   </p>
   <p>
    were all together at the bottom, and being now uncovered from their
   </p>
   <p>
    last refuge, they ran across the open ground in all directions, a loud
   </p>
   <p>
    shriek from the by-this-time half-tipsy Marian informing her companions
   </p>
   <p>
    that one of the rats had invaded her person—a terror which the rest of
   </p>
   <p>
    the women had guarded against by various schemes of skirt-tucking and
   </p>
   <p>
    self-elevation. The rat was at last dislodged, and, amid the barking of
   </p>
   <p>
    dogs, masculine shouts, feminine screams, oaths, stampings, and
   </p>
   <p>
    confusion as of Pandemonium, Tess untied her last sheaf; the drum
   </p>
   <p>
    slowed, the whizzing ceased, and she stepped from the machine to the
   </p>
   <p>
    ground.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her lover, who had only looked on at the rat-catching, was promptly at
   </p>
   <p>
    her side.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What—after all—my insulting slap, too!” said she in an underbreath.
   </p>
   <p>
    She was so utterly exhausted that she had not strength to speak louder.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I should indeed be foolish to feel offended at anything you say or
   </p>
   <p>
    do,” he answered, in the seductive voice of the Trantridge time. “How
   </p>
   <p>
    the little limbs tremble! You are as weak as a bled calf, you know you
   </p>
   <p>
    are; and yet you need have done nothing since I arrived. How could you
   </p>
   <p>
    be so obstinate? However, I have told the farmer that he has no right
   </p>
   <p>
    to employ women at steam-threshing. It is not proper work for them; and
   </p>
   <p>
    on all the better class of farms it has been given up, as he knows very
   </p>
   <p>
    well. I will walk with you as far as your home.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O yes,” she answered with a jaded gait. “Walk wi’ me if you will! I do
   </p>
   <p>
    bear in mind that you came to marry me before you knew o’ my state.
   </p>
   <p>
    Perhaps—perhaps you are a little better and kinder than I have been
   </p>
   <p>
    thinking you were. Whatever is meant as kindness I am grateful for;
   </p>
   <p>
    whatever is meant in any other way I am angered at. I cannot sense your
   </p>
   <p>
    meaning sometimes.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “If I cannot legitimize our former relations at least I can assist you.
   </p>
   <p>
    And I will do it with much more regard for your feelings than I
   </p>
   <p>
    formerly showed. My religious mania, or whatever it was, is over. But I
   </p>
   <p>
    retain a little good nature; I hope I do. Now, Tess, by all that’s
   </p>
   <p>
    tender and strong between man and woman, trust me! I have enough and
   </p>
   <p>
    more than enough to put you out of anxiety, both for yourself and your
   </p>
   <p>
    parents and sisters. I can make them all comfortable if you will only
   </p>
   <p>
    show confidence in me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Have you seen ’em lately?” she quickly inquired.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes. They didn’t know where you were. It was only by chance that I
   </p>
   <p>
    found you here.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The cold moon looked aslant upon Tess’s fagged face between the twigs
   </p>
   <p>
    of the garden-hedge as she paused outside the cottage which was her
   </p>
   <p>
    temporary home, d’Urberville pausing beside her.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Don’t mention my little brothers and sisters—don’t make me break down
   </p>
   <p>
    quite!” she said. “If you want to help them—God knows they need it—do
   </p>
   <p>
    it without telling me. But no, no!” she cried. “I will take nothing
   </p>
   <p>
    from you, either for them or for me!”
   </p>
   <p>
    He did not accompany her further, since, as she lived with the
   </p>
   <p>
    household, all was public indoors. No sooner had she herself entered,
   </p>
   <p>
    laved herself in a washing-tub, and shared supper with the family than
   </p>
   <p>
    she fell into thought, and withdrawing to the table under the wall, by
   </p>
   <p>
    the light of her own little lamp wrote in a passionate mood—
   </p>
   <p>
    My own Husband,
   </p>
   <p>
    Let me call you so—I must—even if it makes you angry to think of
   </p>
   <p>
    such an unworthy wife as I. I must cry to you in my trouble—I have
   </p>
   <p>
    no one else! I am so exposed to temptation, Angel. I fear to say
   </p>
   <p>
    who it is, and I do not like to write about it at all. But I cling
   </p>
   <p>
    to you in a way you cannot think! Can you not come to me now, at
   </p>
   <p>
    once, before anything terrible happens? O, I know you cannot,
   </p>
   <p>
    because you are so far away! I think I must die if you do not come
   </p>
   <p>
    soon, or tell me to come to you. The punishment you have measured
   </p>
   <p>
    out to me is deserved—I do know that—well deserved—and you are
   </p>
   <p>
    right and just to be angry with me. But, Angel, please, please, not
   </p>
   <p>
    to be just—only a little kind to me, even if I do not deserve it,
   </p>
   <p>
    and come to me! If you would come, I could die in your arms! I
   </p>
   <p>
    would be well content to do that if so be you had forgiven me!
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel, I live entirely for you. I love you too much to blame you
   </p>
   <p>
    for going away, and I know it was necessary you should find a farm.
   </p>
   <p>
    Do not think I shall say a word of sting or bitterness. Only come
   </p>
   <p>
    back to me. I am desolate without you, my darling, O, so desolate!
   </p>
   <p>
    I do not mind having to work: but if you will send me one little
   </p>
   <p>
    line, and say, “_I am coming soon_”, I will bide on, Angel—O, so
   </p>
   <p>
    cheerfully!
   </p>
   <p>
    It has been so much my religion ever since we were married to be
   </p>
   <p>
    faithful to you in every thought and look, that even when a man
   </p>
   <p>
    speaks a compliment to me before I am aware, it seems wronging you.
   </p>
   <p>
    Have you never felt one little bit of what you used to feel when we
   </p>
   <p>
    were at the dairy? If you have, how can you keep away from me? I am
   </p>
   <p>
    the same woman, Angel, as you fell in love with; yes, the very
   </p>
   <p>
    same!—not the one you disliked but never saw. What was the past to
   </p>
   <p>
    me as soon as I met you? It was a dead thing altogether. I became
   </p>
   <p>
    another woman, filled full of new life from you. How could I be the
   </p>
   <p>
    early one? Why do you not see this? Dear, if you would only be a
   </p>
   <p>
    little more conceited, and believe in yourself so far as to see
   </p>
   <p>
    that you were strong enough to work this change in me, you would
   </p>
   <p>
    perhaps be in a mind to come to me, your poor wife.
   </p>
   <p>
    How silly I was in my happiness when I thought I could trust you
   </p>
   <p>
    always to love me! I ought to have known that such as that was not
   </p>
   <p>
    for poor me. But I am sick at heart, not only for old times, but
   </p>
   <p>
    for the present. Think—think how it do hurt my heart not to see you
   </p>
   <p>
    ever—ever! Ah, if I could only make your dear heart ache one little
   </p>
   <p>
    minute of each day as mine does every day and all day long, it
   </p>
   <p>
    might lead you to show pity to your poor lonely one.
   </p>
   <p>
    People still say that I am rather pretty, Angel (handsome is the
   </p>
   <p>
    word they use, since I wish to be truthful). Perhaps I am what they
   </p>
   <p>
    say. But I do not value my good looks; I only like to have them
   </p>
   <p>
    because they belong to you, my dear, and that there may be at least
   </p>
   <p>
    one thing about me worth your having. So much have I felt this,
   </p>
   <p>
    that when I met with annoyance on account of the same, I tied up my
   </p>
   <p>
    face in a bandage as long as people would believe in it. O Angel, I
   </p>
   <p>
    tell you all this not from vanity—you will certainly know I do
   </p>
   <p>
    not—but only that you may come to me!
   </p>
   <p>
    If you really cannot come to me, will you let me come to you? I am,
   </p>
   <p>
    as I say, worried, pressed to do what I will not do. It cannot be
   </p>
   <p>
    that I shall yield one inch, yet I am in terror as to what an
   </p>
   <p>
    accident might lead to, and I so defenceless on account of my first
   </p>
   <p>
    error. I cannot say more about this—it makes me too miserable. But
   </p>
   <p>
    if I break down by falling into some fearful snare, my last state
   </p>
   <p>
    will be worse than my first. O God, I cannot think of it! Let me
   </p>
   <p>
    come at once, or at once come to me!
   </p>
   <p>
    I would be content, ay, glad, to live with you as your servant, if
   </p>
   <p>
    I may not as your wife; so that I could only be near you, and get
   </p>
   <p>
    glimpses of you, and think of you as mine.
   </p>
   <p>
    The daylight has nothing to show me, since you are not here, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    don’t like to see the rooks and starlings in the field, because I
   </p>
   <p>
    grieve and grieve to miss you who used to see them with me. I long
   </p>
   <p>
    for only one thing in heaven or earth or under the earth, to meet
   </p>
   <p>
    you, my own dear! Come to me—come to me, and save me from what
   </p>
   <p>
    threatens me!—
   </p>
   <p>
    Your faithful heartbroken
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess
   </p>
   <p>
    XLIX
   </p>
   <p>
    The appeal duly found its way to the breakfast-table of the quiet
   </p>
   <p>
    Vicarage to the westward, in that valley where the air is so soft and
   </p>
   <p>
    the soil so rich that the effort of growth requires but superficial aid
   </p>
   <p>
    by comparison with the tillage at Flintcomb-Ash, and where to Tess the
   </p>
   <p>
    human world seemed so different (though it was much the same). It was
   </p>
   <p>
    purely for security that she had been requested by Angel to send her
   </p>
   <p>
    communications through his father, whom he kept pretty well informed of
   </p>
   <p>
    his changing addresses in the country he had gone to exploit for
   </p>
   <p>
    himself with a heavy heart.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Now,” said old Mr Clare to his wife, when he had read the envelope,
   </p>
   <p>
    “if Angel proposes leaving Rio for a visit home at the end of next
   </p>
   <p>
    month, as he told us that he hoped to do, I think this may hasten his
   </p>
   <p>
    plans; for I believe it to be from his wife.” He breathed deeply at the
   </p>
   <p>
    thought of her; and the letter was redirected to be promptly sent on to
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Dear fellow, I hope he will get home safely,” murmured Mrs Clare. “To
   </p>
   <p>
    my dying day I shall feel that he has been ill-used. You should have
   </p>
   <p>
    sent him to Cambridge in spite of his want of faith and given him the
   </p>
   <p>
    same chance as the other boys had. He would have grown out of it under
   </p>
   <p>
    proper influence, and perhaps would have taken Orders after all. Church
   </p>
   <p>
    or no Church, it would have been fairer to him.”
   </p>
   <p>
    This was the only wail with which Mrs Clare ever disturbed her
   </p>
   <p>
    husband’s peace in respect to their sons. And she did not vent this
   </p>
   <p>
    often; for she was as considerate as she was devout, and knew that his
   </p>
   <p>
    mind too was troubled by doubts as to his justice in this matter. Only
   </p>
   <p>
    too often had she heard him lying awake at night, stifling sighs for
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel with prayers. But the uncompromising Evangelical did not even now
   </p>
   <p>
    hold that he would have been justified in giving his son, an
   </p>
   <p>
    unbeliever, the same academic advantages that he had given to the two
   </p>
   <p>
    others, when it was possible, if not probable, that those very
   </p>
   <p>
    advantages might have been used to decry the doctrines which he had
   </p>
   <p>
    made it his life’s mission and desire to propagate, and the mission of
   </p>
   <p>
    his ordained sons likewise. To put with one hand a pedestal under the
   </p>
   <p>
    feet of the two faithful ones, and with the other to exalt the
   </p>
   <p>
    unfaithful by the same artificial means, he deemed to be alike
   </p>
   <p>
    inconsistent with his convictions, his position, and his hopes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Nevertheless, he loved his misnamed Angel, and in secret mourned over
   </p>
   <p>
    this treatment of him as Abraham might have mourned over the doomed
   </p>
   <p>
    Isaac while they went up the hill together. His silent self-generated
   </p>
   <p>
    regrets were far bitterer than the reproaches which his wife rendered
   </p>
   <p>
    audible.
   </p>
   <p>
    They blamed themselves for this unlucky marriage. If Angel had never
   </p>
   <p>
    been destined for a farmer he would never have been thrown with
   </p>
   <p>
    agricultural girls. They did not distinctly know what had separated him
   </p>
   <p>
    and his wife, nor the date on which the separation had taken place. At
   </p>
   <p>
    first they had supposed it must be something of the nature of a serious
   </p>
   <p>
    aversion. But in his later letters he occasionally alluded to the
   </p>
   <p>
    intention of coming home to fetch her; from which expressions they
   </p>
   <p>
    hoped the division might not owe its origin to anything so hopelessly
   </p>
   <p>
    permanent as that. He had told them that she was with her relatives,
   </p>
   <p>
    and in their doubts they had decided not to intrude into a situation
   </p>
   <p>
    which they knew no way of bettering.
   </p>
   <p>
    The eyes for which Tess’s letter was intended were gazing at this time
   </p>
   <p>
    on a limitless expanse of country from the back of a mule which was
   </p>
   <p>
    bearing him from the interior of the South-American Continent towards
   </p>
   <p>
    the coast. His experiences of this strange land had been sad. The
   </p>
   <p>
    severe illness from which he had suffered shortly after his arrival had
   </p>
   <p>
    never wholly left him, and he had by degrees almost decided to
   </p>
   <p>
    relinquish his hope of farming here, though, as long as the bare
   </p>
   <p>
    possibility existed of his remaining, he kept this change of view a
   </p>
   <p>
    secret from his parents.
   </p>
   <p>
    The crowds of agricultural labourers who had come out to the country in
   </p>
   <p>
    his wake, dazzled by representations of easy independence, had
   </p>
   <p>
    suffered, died, and wasted away. He would see mothers from English
   </p>
   <p>
    farms trudging along with their infants in their arms, when the child
   </p>
   <p>
    would be stricken with fever and would die; the mother would pause to
   </p>
   <p>
    dig a hole in the loose earth with her bare hands, would bury the babe
   </p>
   <p>
    therein with the same natural grave-tools, shed one tear, and again
   </p>
   <p>
    trudge on.
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel’s original intention had not been emigration to Brazil but a
   </p>
   <p>
    northern or eastern farm in his own country. He had come to this place
   </p>
   <p>
    in a fit of desperation, the Brazil movement among the English
   </p>
   <p>
    agriculturists having by chance coincided with his desire to escape
   </p>
   <p>
    from his past existence.
   </p>
   <p>
    During this time of absence he had mentally aged a dozen years. What
   </p>
   <p>
    arrested him now as of value in life was less its beauty than its
   </p>
   <p>
    pathos. Having long discredited the old systems of mysticism, he now
   </p>
   <p>
    began to discredit the old appraisements of morality. He thought they
   </p>
   <p>
    wanted readjusting. Who was the moral man? Still more pertinently, who
   </p>
   <p>
    was the moral woman? The beauty or ugliness of a character lay not only
   </p>
   <p>
    in its achievements, but in its aims and impulses; its true history
   </p>
   <p>
    lay, not among things done, but among things willed.
   </p>
   <p>
    How, then, about Tess?
   </p>
   <p>
    Viewing her in these lights, a regret for his hasty judgement began to
   </p>
   <p>
    oppress him. Did he reject her eternally, or did he not? He could no
   </p>
   <p>
    longer say that he would always reject her, and not to say that was in
   </p>
   <p>
    spirit to accept her now.
   </p>
   <p>
    This growing fondness for her memory coincided in point of time with
   </p>
   <p>
    her residence at Flintcomb-Ash, but it was before she had felt herself
   </p>
   <p>
    at liberty to trouble him with a word about her circumstances or her
   </p>
   <p>
    feelings. He was greatly perplexed; and in his perplexity as to her
   </p>
   <p>
    motives in withholding intelligence, he did not inquire. Thus her
   </p>
   <p>
    silence of docility was misinterpreted. How much it really said if he
   </p>
   <p>
    had understood!—that she adhered with literal exactness to orders which
   </p>
   <p>
    he had given and forgotten; that despite her natural fearlessness she
   </p>
   <p>
    asserted no rights, admitted his judgement to be in every respect the
   </p>
   <p>
    true one, and bent her head dumbly thereto.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the before-mentioned journey by mules through the interior of the
   </p>
   <p>
    country, another man rode beside him. Angel’s companion was also an
   </p>
   <p>
    Englishman, bent on the same errand, though he came from another part
   </p>
   <p>
    of the island. They were both in a state of mental depression, and they
   </p>
   <p>
    spoke of home affairs. Confidence begat confidence. With that curious
   </p>
   <p>
    tendency evinced by men, more especially when in distant lands, to
   </p>
   <p>
    entrust to strangers details of their lives which they would on no
   </p>
   <p>
    account mention to friends, Angel admitted to this man as they rode
   </p>
   <p>
    along the sorrowful facts of his marriage.
   </p>
   <p>
    The stranger had sojourned in many more lands and among many more
   </p>
   <p>
    peoples than Angel; to his cosmopolitan mind such deviations from the
   </p>
   <p>
    social norm, so immense to domesticity, were no more than are the
   </p>
   <p>
    irregularities of vale and mountain-chain to the whole terrestrial
   </p>
   <p>
    curve. He viewed the matter in quite a different light from Angel;
   </p>
   <p>
    thought that what Tess had been was of no importance beside what she
   </p>
   <p>
    would be, and plainly told Clare that he was wrong in coming away from
   </p>
   <p>
    her.
   </p>
   <p>
    The next day they were drenched in a thunder-storm. Angel’s companion
   </p>
   <p>
    was struck down with fever, and died by the week’s end. Clare waited a
   </p>
   <p>
    few hours to bury him, and then went on his way.
   </p>
   <p>
    The cursory remarks of the large-minded stranger, of whom he knew
   </p>
   <p>
    absolutely nothing beyond a commonplace name, were sublimed by his
   </p>
   <p>
    death, and influenced Clare more than all the reasoned ethics of the
   </p>
   <p>
    philosophers. His own parochialism made him ashamed by its contrast.
   </p>
   <p>
    His inconsistencies rushed upon him in a flood. He had persistently
   </p>
   <p>
    elevated Hellenic Paganism at the expense of Christianity; yet in that
   </p>
   <p>
    civilization an illegal surrender was not certain disesteem. Surely
   </p>
   <p>
    then he might have regarded that abhorrence of the un-intact state,
   </p>
   <p>
    which he had inherited with the creed of mysticism, as at least open to
   </p>
   <p>
    correction when the result was due to treachery. A remorse struck into
   </p>
   <p>
    him. The words of Izz Huett, never quite stilled in his memory, came
   </p>
   <p>
    back to him. He had asked Izz if she loved him, and she had replied in
   </p>
   <p>
    the affirmative. Did she love him more than Tess did? No, she had
   </p>
   <p>
    replied; Tess would lay down her life for him, and she herself could do
   </p>
   <p>
    no more.
   </p>
   <p>
    He thought of Tess as she had appeared on the day of the wedding. How
   </p>
   <p>
    her eyes had lingered upon him; how she had hung upon his words as if
   </p>
   <p>
    they were a god’s! And during the terrible evening over the hearth,
   </p>
   <p>
    when her simple soul uncovered itself to his, how pitiful her face had
   </p>
   <p>
    looked by the rays of the fire, in her inability to realize that his
   </p>
   <p>
    love and protection could possibly be withdrawn.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus from being her critic he grew to be her advocate. Cynical things
   </p>
   <p>
    he had uttered to himself about her; but no man can be always a cynic
   </p>
   <p>
    and live; and he withdrew them. The mistake of expressing them had
   </p>
   <p>
    arisen from his allowing himself to be influenced by general principles
   </p>
   <p>
    to the disregard of the particular instance.
   </p>
   <p>
    But the reasoning is somewhat musty; lovers and husbands have gone over
   </p>
   <p>
    the ground before to-day. Clare had been harsh towards her; there is no
   </p>
   <p>
    doubt of it. Men are too often harsh with women they love or have
   </p>
   <p>
    loved; women with men. And yet these harshnesses are tenderness itself
   </p>
   <p>
    when compared with the universal harshness out of which they grow; the
   </p>
   <p>
    harshness of the position towards the temperament, of the means towards
   </p>
   <p>
    the aims, of to-day towards yesterday, of hereafter towards to-day.
   </p>
   <p>
    The historic interest of her family—that masterful line of
   </p>
   <p>
    d’Urbervilles—whom he had despised as a spent force, touched his
   </p>
   <p>
    sentiments now. Why had he not known the difference between the
   </p>
   <p>
    political value and the imaginative value of these things? In the
   </p>
   <p>
    latter aspect her d’Urberville descent was a fact of great dimensions;
   </p>
   <p>
    worthless to economics, it was a most useful ingredient to the dreamer,
   </p>
   <p>
    to the moralizer on declines and falls. It was a fact that would soon
   </p>
   <p>
    be forgotten—that bit of distinction in poor Tess’s blood and name, and
   </p>
   <p>
    oblivion would fall upon her hereditary link with the marble monuments
   </p>
   <p>
    and leaded skeletons at Kingsbere. So does Time ruthlessly destroy his
   </p>
   <p>
    own romances. In recalling her face again and again, he thought now
   </p>
   <p>
    that he could see therein a flash of the dignity which must have graced
   </p>
   <p>
    her grand-dames; and the vision sent that _aura_ through his veins
   </p>
   <p>
    which he had formerly felt, and which left behind it a sense of
   </p>
   <p>
    sickness.
   </p>
   <p>
    Despite her not inviolate past, what still abode in such a woman as
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess outvalued the freshness of her fellows. Was not the gleaning of
   </p>
   <p>
    the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abi-ezer?
   </p>
   <p>
    So spoke love renascent, preparing the way for Tess’s devoted
   </p>
   <p>
    outpouring, which was then just being forwarded to him by his father;
   </p>
   <p>
    though owing to his distance inland it was to be a long time in
   </p>
   <p>
    reaching him.
   </p>
   <p>
    Meanwhile the writer’s expectation that Angel would come in response to
   </p>
   <p>
    the entreaty was alternately great and small. What lessened it was that
   </p>
   <p>
    the facts of her life which had led to the parting had not
   </p>
   <p>
    changed—could never change; and that, if her presence had not
   </p>
   <p>
    attenuated them, her absence could not. Nevertheless she addressed her
   </p>
   <p>
    mind to the tender question of what she could do to please him best if
   </p>
   <p>
    he should arrive. Sighs were expended on the wish that she had taken
   </p>
   <p>
    more notice of the tunes he played on his harp, that she had inquired
   </p>
   <p>
    more curiously of him which were his favourite ballads among those the
   </p>
   <p>
    country-girls sang. She indirectly inquired of Amby Seedling, who had
   </p>
   <p>
    followed Izz from Talbothays, and by chance Amby remembered that,
   </p>
   <p>
    amongst the snatches of melody in which they had indulged at the
   </p>
   <p>
    dairyman’s, to induce the cows to let down their milk, Clare had seemed
   </p>
   <p>
    to like “Cupid’s Gardens”, “I have parks, I have hounds”, and “The
   </p>
   <p>
    break o’ the day”; and had seemed not to care for “The Tailor’s
   </p>
   <p>
    Breeches” and “Such a beauty I did grow”, excellent ditties as they
   </p>
   <p>
    were.
   </p>
   <p>
    To perfect the ballads was now her whimsical desire. She practised them
   </p>
   <p>
    privately at odd moments, especially “The break o’ the day”:
   </p>
   <p>
    Arise, arise, arise!
   </p>
   <p>
    And pick your love a posy,
   </p>
   <p>
    All o’ the sweetest flowers
   </p>
   <p>
    That in the garden grow.
   </p>
   <p>
    The turtle doves and sma’ birds
   </p>
   <p>
    In every bough a-building,
   </p>
   <p>
    So early in the May-time
   </p>
   <p>
    At the break o’ the day!
   </p>
   <p>
    It would have melted the heart of a stone to hear her singing these
   </p>
   <p>
    ditties whenever she worked apart from the rest of the girls in this
   </p>
   <p>
    cold dry time; the tears running down her cheeks all the while at the
   </p>
   <p>
    thought that perhaps he would not, after all, come to hear her, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    simple silly words of the songs resounding in painful mockery of the
   </p>
   <p>
    aching heart of the singer.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess was so wrapt up in this fanciful dream that she seemed not to know
   </p>
   <p>
    how the season was advancing; that the days had lengthened, that
   </p>
   <p>
    Lady-Day was at hand, and would soon be followed by Old Lady-Day, the
   </p>
   <p>
    end of her term here.
   </p>
   <p>
    But before the quarter-day had quite come, something happened which
   </p>
   <p>
    made Tess think of far different matters. She was at her lodging as
   </p>
   <p>
    usual one evening, sitting in the downstairs room with the rest of the
   </p>
   <p>
    family, when somebody knocked at the door and inquired for Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    Through the doorway she saw against the declining light a figure with
   </p>
   <p>
    the height of a woman and the breadth of a child, a tall, thin, girlish
   </p>
   <p>
    creature whom she did not recognize in the twilight till the girl said
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tess!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “What—is it ’Liza-Lu?” asked Tess, in startled accents. Her sister,
   </p>
   <p>
    whom a little over a year ago she had left at home as a child, had
   </p>
   <p>
    sprung up by a sudden shoot to a form of this presentation, of which as
   </p>
   <p>
    yet Lu seemed herself scarce able to understand the meaning. Her thin
   </p>
   <p>
    legs, visible below her once-long frock, now short by her growing, and
   </p>
   <p>
    her uncomfortable hands and arms revealed her youth and inexperience.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, I have been traipsing about all day, Tess,” said Lu, with
   </p>
   <p>
    unemotional gravity, “a-trying to find ’ee; and I’m very tired.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “What is the matter at home?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Mother is took very bad, and the doctor says she’s dying, and as
   </p>
   <p>
    father is not very well neither, and says ’tis wrong for a man of such
   </p>
   <p>
    a high family as his to slave and drave at common labouring work, we
   </p>
   <p>
    don’t know what to do.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess stood in reverie a long time before she thought of asking ’Liza-Lu
   </p>
   <p>
    to come in and sit down. When she had done so, and ’Liza-Lu was having
   </p>
   <p>
    some tea, she came to a decision. It was imperative that she should go
   </p>
   <p>
    home. Her agreement did not end till Old Lady-Day, the sixth of April,
   </p>
   <p>
    but as the interval thereto was not a long one she resolved to run the
   </p>
   <p>
    risk of starting at once.
   </p>
   <p>
    To go that night would be a gain of twelve-hours; but her sister was
   </p>
   <p>
    too tired to undertake such a distance till the morrow. Tess ran down
   </p>
   <p>
    to where Marian and Izz lived, informed them of what had happened, and
   </p>
   <p>
    begged them to make the best of her case to the farmer. Returning, she
   </p>
   <p>
    got Lu a supper, and after that, having tucked the younger into her own
   </p>
   <p>
    bed, packed up as many of her belongings as would go into a withy
   </p>
   <p>
    basket, and started, directing Lu to follow her next morning.
   </p>
   <p>
    L
   </p>
   <p>
    She plunged into the chilly equinoctial darkness as the clock struck
   </p>
   <p>
    ten, for her fifteen miles’ walk under the steely stars. In lonely
   </p>
   <p>
    districts night is a protection rather than a danger to a noiseless
   </p>
   <p>
    pedestrian, and knowing this, Tess pursued the nearest course along
   </p>
   <p>
    by-lanes that she would almost have feared in the day-time; but
   </p>
   <p>
    marauders were wanting now, and spectral fears were driven out of her
   </p>
   <p>
    mind by thoughts of her mother. Thus she proceeded mile after mile,
   </p>
   <p>
    ascending and descending till she came to Bulbarrow, and about midnight
   </p>
   <p>
    looked from that height into the abyss of chaotic shade which was all
   </p>
   <p>
    that revealed itself of the vale on whose further side she was born.
   </p>
   <p>
    Having already traversed about five miles on the upland, she had now
   </p>
   <p>
    some ten or eleven in the lowland before her journey would be finished.
   </p>
   <p>
    The winding road downwards became just visible to her under the wan
   </p>
   <p>
    starlight as she followed it, and soon she paced a soil so contrasting
   </p>
   <p>
    with that above it that the difference was perceptible to the tread and
   </p>
   <p>
    to the smell. It was the heavy clay land of Blackmoor Vale, and a part
   </p>
   <p>
    of the Vale to which turnpike-roads had never penetrated. Superstitions
   </p>
   <p>
    linger longest on these heavy soils. Having once been forest, at this
   </p>
   <p>
    shadowy time it seemed to assert something of its old character, the
   </p>
   <p>
    far and the near being blended, and every tree and tall hedge making
   </p>
   <p>
    the most of its presence. The harts that had been hunted here, the
   </p>
   <p>
    witches that had been pricked and ducked, the green-spangled fairies
   </p>
   <p>
    that “whickered” at you as you passed;—the place teemed with beliefs in
   </p>
   <p>
    them still, and they formed an impish multitude now.
   </p>
   <p>
    At Nuttlebury she passed the village inn, whose sign creaked in
   </p>
   <p>
    response to the greeting of her footsteps, which not a human soul heard
   </p>
   <p>
    but herself. Under the thatched roofs her mind’s eye beheld relaxed
   </p>
   <p>
    tendons and flaccid muscles, spread out in the darkness beneath
   </p>
   <p>
    coverlets made of little purple patchwork squares, and undergoing a
   </p>
   <p>
    bracing process at the hands of sleep for renewed labour on the morrow,
   </p>
   <p>
    as soon as a hint of pink nebulosity appeared on Hambledon Hill.
   </p>
   <p>
    At three she turned the last corner of the maze of lanes she had
   </p>
   <p>
    threaded, and entered Marlott, passing the field in which as a
   </p>
   <p>
    club-girl she had first seen Angel Clare, when he had not danced with
   </p>
   <p>
    her; the sense of disappointment remained with her yet. In the
   </p>
   <p>
    direction of her mother’s house she saw a light. It came from the
   </p>
   <p>
    bedroom window, and a branch waved in front of it and made it wink at
   </p>
   <p>
    her. As soon as she could discern the outline of the house—newly
   </p>
   <p>
    thatched with her money—it had all its old effect upon Tess’s
   </p>
   <p>
    imagination. Part of her body and life it ever seemed to be; the slope
   </p>
   <p>
    of its dormers, the finish of its gables, the broken courses of brick
   </p>
   <p>
    which topped the chimney, all had something in common with her personal
   </p>
   <p>
    character. A stupefaction had come into these features, to her regard;
   </p>
   <p>
    it meant the illness of her mother.
   </p>
   <p>
    She opened the door so softly as to disturb nobody; the lower room was
   </p>
   <p>
    vacant, but the neighbour who was sitting up with her mother came to
   </p>
   <p>
    the top of the stairs, and whispered that Mrs Durbeyfield was no
   </p>
   <p>
    better, though she was sleeping just then. Tess prepared herself a
   </p>
   <p>
    breakfast, and then took her place as nurse in her mother’s chamber.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the morning, when she contemplated the children, they had all a
   </p>
   <p>
    curiously elongated look; although she had been away little more than a
   </p>
   <p>
    year, their growth was astounding; and the necessity of applying
   </p>
   <p>
    herself heart and soul to their needs took her out of her own cares.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her father’s ill-health was the same indefinite kind, and he sat in his
   </p>
   <p>
    chair as usual. But the day after her arrival he was unusually bright.
   </p>
   <p>
    He had a rational scheme for living, and Tess asked him what it was.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’m thinking of sending round to all the old antiqueerians in this
   </p>
   <p>
    part of England,” he said, “asking them to subscribe to a fund to
   </p>
   <p>
    maintain me. I’m sure they’d see it as a romantical, artistical, and
   </p>
   <p>
    proper thing to do. They spend lots o’ money in keeping up old ruins,
   </p>
   <p>
    and finding the bones o’ things, and such like; and living remains must
   </p>
   <p>
    be more interesting to ’em still, if they only knowed of me. Would that
   </p>
   <p>
    somebody would go round and tell ’em what there is living among ’em,
   </p>
   <p>
    and they thinking nothing of him! If Pa’son Tringham, who discovered
   </p>
   <p>
    me, had lived, he’d ha’ done it, I’m sure.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess postponed her arguments on this high project till she had grappled
   </p>
   <p>
    with pressing matters in hand, which seemed little improved by her
   </p>
   <p>
    remittances. When indoor necessities had been eased, she turned her
   </p>
   <p>
    attention to external things. It was now the season for planting and
   </p>
   <p>
    sowing; many gardens and allotments of the villagers had already
   </p>
   <p>
    received their spring tillage; but the garden and the allotment of the
   </p>
   <p>
    Durbeyfields were behindhand. She found, to her dismay, that this was
   </p>
   <p>
    owing to their having eaten all the seed potatoes,—that last lapse of
   </p>
   <p>
    the improvident. At the earliest moment she obtained what others she
   </p>
   <p>
    could procure, and in a few days her father was well enough to see to
   </p>
   <p>
    the garden, under Tess’s persuasive efforts: while she herself
   </p>
   <p>
    undertook the allotment-plot which they rented in a field a couple of
   </p>
   <p>
    hundred yards out of the village.
   </p>
   <p>
    She liked doing it after the confinement of the sick chamber, where she
   </p>
   <p>
    was not now required by reason of her mother’s improvement. Violent
   </p>
   <p>
    motion relieved thought. The plot of ground was in a high, dry, open
   </p>
   <p>
    enclosure, where there were forty or fifty such pieces, and where
   </p>
   <p>
    labour was at its briskest when the hired labour of the day had ended.
   </p>
   <p>
    Digging began usually at six o’clock and extended indefinitely into the
   </p>
   <p>
    dusk or moonlight. Just now heaps of dead weeds and refuse were burning
   </p>
   <p>
    on many of the plots, the dry weather favouring their combustion.
   </p>
   <p>
    One fine day Tess and ’Liza-Lu worked on here with their neighbours
   </p>
   <p>
    till the last rays of the sun smote flat upon the white pegs that
   </p>
   <p>
    divided the plots. As soon as twilight succeeded to sunset the flare of
   </p>
   <p>
    the couch-grass and cabbage-stalk fires began to light up the
   </p>
   <p>
    allotments fitfully, their outlines appearing and disappearing under
   </p>
   <p>
    the dense smoke as wafted by the wind. When a fire glowed, banks of
   </p>
   <p>
    smoke, blown level along the ground, would themselves become
   </p>
   <p>
    illuminated to an opaque lustre, screening the workpeople from one
   </p>
   <p>
    another; and the meaning of the “pillar of a cloud”, which was a wall
   </p>
   <p>
    by day and a light by night, could be understood.
   </p>
   <p>
    As evening thickened, some of the gardening men and women gave over for
   </p>
   <p>
    the night, but the greater number remained to get their planting done,
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess being among them, though she sent her sister home. It was on one
   </p>
   <p>
    of the couch-burning plots that she laboured with her fork, its four
   </p>
   <p>
    shining prongs resounding against the stones and dry clods in little
   </p>
   <p>
    clicks. Sometimes she was completely involved in the smoke of her fire;
   </p>
   <p>
    then it would leave her figure free, irradiated by the brassy glare
   </p>
   <p>
    from the heap. She was oddly dressed to-night, and presented a somewhat
   </p>
   <p>
    staring aspect, her attire being a gown bleached by many washings, with
   </p>
   <p>
    a short black jacket over it, the effect of the whole being that of a
   </p>
   <p>
    wedding and funeral guest in one. The women further back wore white
   </p>
   <p>
    aprons, which, with their pale faces, were all that could be seen of
   </p>
   <p>
    them in the gloom, except when at moments they caught a flash from the
   </p>
   <p>
    flames.
   </p>
   <p>
    Westward, the wiry boughs of the bare thorn hedge which formed the
   </p>
   <p>
    boundary of the field rose against the pale opalescence of the lower
   </p>
   <p>
    sky. Above, Jupiter hung like a full-blown jonquil, so bright as almost
   </p>
   <p>
    to throw a shade. A few small nondescript stars were appearing
   </p>
   <p>
    elsewhere. In the distance a dog barked, and wheels occasionally
   </p>
   <p>
    rattled along the dry road.
   </p>
   <p>
    Still the prongs continued to click assiduously, for it was not late;
   </p>
   <p>
    and though the air was fresh and keen there was a whisper of spring in
   </p>
   <p>
    it that cheered the workers on. Something in the place, the hours, the
   </p>
   <p>
    crackling fires, the fantastic mysteries of light and shade, made
   </p>
   <p>
    others as well as Tess enjoy being there. Nightfall, which in the frost
   </p>
   <p>
    of winter comes as a fiend and in the warmth of summer as a lover, came
   </p>
   <p>
    as a tranquillizer on this March day.
   </p>
   <p>
    Nobody looked at his or her companions. The eyes of all were on the
   </p>
   <p>
    soil as its turned surface was revealed by the fires. Hence as Tess
   </p>
   <p>
    stirred the clods and sang her foolish little songs with scarce now a
   </p>
   <p>
    hope that Clare would ever hear them, she did not for a long time
   </p>
   <p>
    notice the person who worked nearest to her—a man in a long smockfrock
   </p>
   <p>
    who, she found, was forking the same plot as herself, and whom she
   </p>
   <p>
    supposed her father had sent there to advance the work. She became more
   </p>
   <p>
    conscious of him when the direction of his digging brought him closer.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sometimes the smoke divided them; then it swerved, and the two were
   </p>
   <p>
    visible to each other but divided from all the rest.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess did not speak to her fellow-worker, nor did he speak to her. Nor
   </p>
   <p>
    did she think of him further than to recollect that he had not been
   </p>
   <p>
    there when it was broad daylight, and that she did not know him as any
   </p>
   <p>
    one of the Marlott labourers, which was no wonder, her absences having
   </p>
   <p>
    been so long and frequent of late years. By-and-by he dug so close to
   </p>
   <p>
    her that the fire-beams were reflected as distinctly from the steel
   </p>
   <p>
    prongs of his fork as from her own. On going up to the fire to throw a
   </p>
   <p>
    pitch of dead weeds upon it, she found that he did the same on the
   </p>
   <p>
    other side. The fire flared up, and she beheld the face of
   </p>
   <p>
    d’Urberville.
   </p>
   <p>
    The unexpectedness of his presence, the grotesqueness of his appearance
   </p>
   <p>
    in a gathered smockfrock, such as was now worn only by the most
   </p>
   <p>
    old-fashioned of the labourers, had a ghastly comicality that chilled
   </p>
   <p>
    her as to its bearing. D’Urberville emitted a low, long laugh.
   </p>
   <p>
    “If I were inclined to joke, I should say, How much this seems like
   </p>
   <p>
    Paradise!” he remarked whimsically, looking at her with an inclined
   </p>
   <p>
    head.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What do you say?” she weakly asked.
   </p>
   <p>
    “A jester might say this is just like Paradise. You are Eve, and I am
   </p>
   <p>
    the old Other One come to tempt you in the disguise of an inferior
   </p>
   <p>
    animal. I used to be quite up in that scene of Milton’s when I was
   </p>
   <p>
    theological. Some of it goes—
   </p>
   <p>
    ‘Empress, the way is ready, and not long,
   </p>
   <p>
    Beyond a row of myrtles....
   </p>
   <p>
    ... If thou accept
   </p>
   <p>
    My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon.’
   </p>
   <p>
    ‘Lead then,’ said Eve.
   </p>
   <p>
    “And so on. My dear Tess, I am only putting this to you as a thing that
   </p>
   <p>
    you might have supposed or said quite untruly, because you think so
   </p>
   <p>
    badly of me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I never said you were Satan, or thought it. I don’t think of you in
   </p>
   <p>
    that way at all. My thoughts of you are quite cold, except when you
   </p>
   <p>
    affront me. What, did you come digging here entirely because of me?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Entirely. To see you; nothing more. The smockfrock, which I saw
   </p>
   <p>
    hanging for sale as I came along, was an afterthought, that I mightn’t
   </p>
   <p>
    be noticed. I come to protest against your working like this.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But I like doing it—it is for my father.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Your engagement at the other place is ended?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Where are you going to next? To join your dear husband?”
   </p>
   <p>
    She could not bear the humiliating reminder.
   </p>
   <p>
    “O—I don’t know!” she said bitterly. “I have no husband!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It is quite true—in the sense you mean. But you have a friend, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    have determined that you shall be comfortable in spite of yourself.
   </p>
   <p>
    When you get down to your house you will see what I have sent there for
   </p>
   <p>
    you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O, Alec, I wish you wouldn’t give me anything at all! I cannot take it
   </p>
   <p>
    from you! I don’t like—it is not right!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It _is_ right!” he cried lightly. “I am not going to see a woman whom
   </p>
   <p>
    I feel so tenderly for as I do for you in trouble without trying to
   </p>
   <p>
    help her.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But I am very well off! I am only in trouble about—about—not about
   </p>
   <p>
    living at all!”
   </p>
   <p>
    She turned, and desperately resumed her digging, tears dripping upon
   </p>
   <p>
    the fork-handle and upon the clods.
   </p>
   <p>
    “About the children—your brothers and sisters,” he resumed. “I’ve been
   </p>
   <p>
    thinking of them.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess’s heart quivered—he was touching her in a weak place. He had
   </p>
   <p>
    divined her chief anxiety. Since returning home her soul had gone out
   </p>
   <p>
    to those children with an affection that was passionate.
   </p>
   <p>
    “If your mother does not recover, somebody ought to do something for
   </p>
   <p>
    them; since your father will not be able to do much, I suppose?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “He can with my assistance. He must!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And with mine.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No, sir!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “How damned foolish this is!” burst out d’Urberville. “Why, he thinks
   </p>
   <p>
    we are the same family; and will be quite satisfied!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “He don’t. I’ve undeceived him.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “The more fool you!”
   </p>
   <p>
    D’Urberville in anger retreated from her to the hedge, where he pulled
   </p>
   <p>
    off the long smockfrock which had disguised him; and rolling it up and
   </p>
   <p>
    pushing it into the couch-fire, went away.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess could not get on with her digging after this; she felt restless;
   </p>
   <p>
    she wondered if he had gone back to her father’s house; and taking the
   </p>
   <p>
    fork in her hand proceeded homewards.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some twenty yards from the house she was met by one of her sisters.
   </p>
   <p>
    “O, Tessy—what do you think! ’Liza-Lu is a-crying, and there’s a lot of
   </p>
   <p>
    folk in the house, and mother is a good deal better, but they think
   </p>
   <p>
    father is dead!”
   </p>
   <p>
    The child realized the grandeur of the news; but not as yet its
   </p>
   <p>
    sadness, and stood looking at Tess with round-eyed importance till,
   </p>
   <p>
    beholding the effect produced upon her, she said—
   </p>
   <p>
    “What, Tess, shan’t we talk to father never no more?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But father was only a little bit ill!” exclaimed Tess distractedly.
   </p>
   <p>
    ’Liza-Lu came up.
   </p>
   <p>
    “He dropped down just now, and the doctor who was there for mother said
   </p>
   <p>
    there was no chance for him, because his heart was growed in.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Yes; the Durbeyfield couple had changed places; the dying one was out
   </p>
   <p>
    of danger, and the indisposed one was dead. The news meant even more
   </p>
   <p>
    than it sounded. Her father’s life had a value apart from his personal
   </p>
   <p>
    achievements, or perhaps it would not have had much. It was the last of
   </p>
   <p>
    the three lives for whose duration the house and premises were held
   </p>
   <p>
    under a lease; and it had long been coveted by the tenant-farmer for
   </p>
   <p>
    his regular labourers, who were stinted in cottage accommodation.
   </p>
   <p>
    Moreover, “liviers” were disapproved of in villages almost as much as
   </p>
   <p>
    little freeholders, because of their independence of manner, and when a
   </p>
   <p>
    lease determined it was never renewed.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus the Durbeyfields, once d’Urbervilles, saw descending upon them the
   </p>
   <p>
    destiny which, no doubt, when they were among the Olympians of the
   </p>
   <p>
    county, they had caused to descend many a time, and severely enough,
   </p>
   <p>
    upon the heads of such landless ones as they themselves were now. So do
   </p>
   <p>
    flux and reflux—the rhythm of change—alternate and persist in
   </p>
   <p>
    everything under the sky.
   </p>
   <p>
    LI
   </p>
   <p>
    At length it was the eve of Old Lady-Day, and the agricultural world
   </p>
   <p>
    was in a fever of mobility such as only occurs at that particular date
   </p>
   <p>
    of the year. It is a day of fulfilment; agreements for outdoor service
   </p>
   <p>
    during the ensuing year, entered into at Candlemas, are to be now
   </p>
   <p>
    carried out. The labourers—or “work-folk”, as they used to call
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves immemorially till the other word was introduced from
   </p>
   <p>
    without—who wish to remain no longer in old places are removing to the
   </p>
   <p>
    new farms.
   </p>
   <p>
    These annual migrations from farm to farm were on the increase here.
   </p>
   <p>
    When Tess’s mother was a child the majority of the field-folk about
   </p>
   <p>
    Marlott had remained all their lives on one farm, which had been the
   </p>
   <p>
    home also of their fathers and grandfathers; but latterly the desire
   </p>
   <p>
    for yearly removal had risen to a high pitch. With the younger families
   </p>
   <p>
    it was a pleasant excitement which might possibly be an advantage. The
   </p>
   <p>
    Egypt of one family was the Land of Promise to the family who saw it
   </p>
   <p>
    from a distance, till by residence there it became in turn their Egypt
   </p>
   <p>
    also; and so they changed and changed.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, all the mutations so increasingly discernible in village life
   </p>
   <p>
    did not originate entirely in the agricultural unrest. A depopulation
   </p>
   <p>
    was also going on. The village had formerly contained, side by side
   </p>
   <p>
    with the argicultural labourers, an interesting and better-informed
   </p>
   <p>
    class, ranking distinctly above the former—the class to which Tess’s
   </p>
   <p>
    father and mother had belonged—and including the carpenter, the smith,
   </p>
   <p>
    the shoemaker, the huckster, together with nondescript workers other
   </p>
   <p>
    than farm-labourers; a set of people who owed a certain stability of
   </p>
   <p>
    aim and conduct to the fact of their being lifeholders like Tess’s
   </p>
   <p>
    father, or copyholders, or occasionally, small freeholders. But as the
   </p>
   <p>
    long holdings fell in, they were seldom again let to similar tenants,
   </p>
   <p>
    and were mostly pulled down, if not absolutely required by the farmer
   </p>
   <p>
    for his hands. Cottagers who were not directly employed on the land
   </p>
   <p>
    were looked upon with disfavour, and the banishment of some starved the
   </p>
   <p>
    trade of others, who were thus obliged to follow. These families, who
   </p>
   <p>
    had formed the backbone of the village life in the past, who were the
   </p>
   <p>
    depositaries of the village traditions, had to seek refuge in the large
   </p>
   <p>
    centres; the process, humorously designated by statisticians as “the
   </p>
   <p>
    tendency of the rural population towards the large towns”, being really
   </p>
   <p>
    the tendency of water to flow uphill when forced by machinery.
   </p>
   <p>
    The cottage accommodation at Marlott having been in this manner
   </p>
   <p>
    considerably curtailed by demolitions, every house which remained
   </p>
   <p>
    standing was required by the agriculturist for his work-people. Ever
   </p>
   <p>
    since the occurrence of the event which had cast such a shadow over
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess’s life, the Durbeyfield family (whose descent was not credited)
   </p>
   <p>
    had been tacitly looked on as one which would have to go when their
   </p>
   <p>
    lease ended, if only in the interests of morality. It was, indeed,
   </p>
   <p>
    quite true that the household had not been shining examples either of
   </p>
   <p>
    temperance, soberness, or chastity. The father, and even the mother,
   </p>
   <p>
    had got drunk at times, the younger children seldom had gone to church,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the eldest daughter had made queer unions. By some means the
   </p>
   <p>
    village had to be kept pure. So on this, the first Lady-Day on which
   </p>
   <p>
    the Durbeyfields were expellable, the house, being roomy, was required
   </p>
   <p>
    for a carter with a large family; and Widow Joan, her daughters Tess
   </p>
   <p>
    and ’Liza-Lu, the boy Abraham, and the younger children had to go
   </p>
   <p>
    elsewhere.
   </p>
   <p>
    On the evening preceding their removal it was getting dark betimes by
   </p>
   <p>
    reason of a drizzling rain which blurred the sky. As it was the last
   </p>
   <p>
    night they would spend in the village which had been their home and
   </p>
   <p>
    birthplace, Mrs Durbeyfield, ’Liza-Lu, and Abraham had gone out to bid
   </p>
   <p>
    some friends goodbye, and Tess was keeping house till they should
   </p>
   <p>
    return.
   </p>
   <p>
    She was kneeling in the window-bench, her face close to the casement,
   </p>
   <p>
    where an outer pane of rain-water was sliding down the inner pane of
   </p>
   <p>
    glass. Her eyes rested on the web of a spider, probably starved long
   </p>
   <p>
    ago, which had been mistakenly placed in a corner where no flies ever
   </p>
   <p>
    came, and shivered in the slight draught through the casement. Tess was
   </p>
   <p>
    reflecting on the position of the household, in which she perceived her
   </p>
   <p>
    own evil influence. Had she not come home, her mother and the children
   </p>
   <p>
    might probably have been allowed to stay on as weekly tenants. But she
   </p>
   <p>
    had been observed almost immediately on her return by some people of
   </p>
   <p>
    scrupulous character and great influence: they had seen her idling in
   </p>
   <p>
    the churchyard, restoring as well as she could with a little trowel a
   </p>
   <p>
    baby’s obliterated grave. By this means they had found that she was
   </p>
   <p>
    living here again; her mother was scolded for “harbouring” her; sharp
   </p>
   <p>
    retorts had ensued from Joan, who had independently offered to leave at
   </p>
   <p>
    once; she had been taken at her word; and here was the result.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I ought never to have come home,” said Tess to herself, bitterly.
   </p>
   <p>
    She was so intent upon these thoughts that she hardly at first took
   </p>
   <p>
    note of a man in a white mackintosh whom she saw riding down the
   </p>
   <p>
    street. Possibly it was owing to her face being near to the pane that
   </p>
   <p>
    he saw her so quickly, and directed his horse so close to the
   </p>
   <p>
    cottage-front that his hoofs were almost upon the narrow border for
   </p>
   <p>
    plants growing under the wall. It was not till he touched the window
   </p>
   <p>
    with his riding-crop that she observed him. The rain had nearly ceased,
   </p>
   <p>
    and she opened the casement in obedience to his gesture.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Didn’t you see me?” asked d’Urberville.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I was not attending,” she said. “I heard you, I believe, though I
   </p>
   <p>
    fancied it was a carriage and horses. I was in a sort of dream.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah! you heard the d’Urberville Coach, perhaps. You know the legend, I
   </p>
   <p>
    suppose?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No. My—somebody was going to tell it me once, but didn’t.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “If you are a genuine d’Urberville I ought not to tell you either, I
   </p>
   <p>
    suppose. As for me, I’m a sham one, so it doesn’t matter. It is rather
   </p>
   <p>
    dismal. It is that this sound of a non-existent coach can only be heard
   </p>
   <p>
    by one of d’Urberville blood, and it is held to be of ill-omen to the
   </p>
   <p>
    one who hears it. It has to do with a murder, committed by one of the
   </p>
   <p>
    family, centuries ago.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Now you have begun it, finish it.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Very well. One of the family is said to have abducted some beautiful
   </p>
   <p>
    woman, who tried to escape from the coach in which he was carrying her
   </p>
   <p>
    off, and in the struggle he killed her—or she killed him—I forget
   </p>
   <p>
    which. Such is one version of the tale... I see that your tubs and
   </p>
   <p>
    buckets are packed. Going away, aren’t you?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, to-morrow—Old Lady Day.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I heard you were, but could hardly believe it; it seems so sudden. Why
   </p>
   <p>
    is it?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Father’s was the last life on the property, and when that dropped we
   </p>
   <p>
    had no further right to stay. Though we might, perhaps, have stayed as
   </p>
   <p>
    weekly tenants—if it had not been for me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “What about you?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am not a—proper woman.”
   </p>
   <p>
    D’Urberville’s face flushed.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What a blasted shame! Miserable snobs! May their dirty souls be burnt
   </p>
   <p>
    to cinders!” he exclaimed in tones of ironic resentment. “That’s why
   </p>
   <p>
    you are going, is it? Turned out?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “We are not turned out exactly; but as they said we should have to go
   </p>
   <p>
    soon, it was best to go now everybody was moving, because there are
   </p>
   <p>
    better chances.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Where are you going to?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Kingsbere. We have taken rooms there. Mother is so foolish about
   </p>
   <p>
    father’s people that she will go there.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But your mother’s family are not fit for lodgings, and in a little
   </p>
   <p>
    hole of a town like that. Now why not come to my garden-house at
   </p>
   <p>
    Trantridge? There are hardly any poultry now, since my mother’s death;
   </p>
   <p>
    but there’s the house, as you know it, and the garden. It can be
   </p>
   <p>
    whitewashed in a day, and your mother can live there quite comfortably;
   </p>
   <p>
    and I will put the children to a good school. Really I ought to do
   </p>
   <p>
    something for you!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But we have already taken the rooms at Kingsbere!” she declared. “And
   </p>
   <p>
    we can wait there—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Wait—what for? For that nice husband, no doubt. Now look here, Tess, I
   </p>
   <p>
    know what men are, and, bearing in mind the _grounds_ of your
   </p>
   <p>
    separation, I am quite positive he will never make it up with you. Now,
   </p>
   <p>
    though I have been your enemy, I am your friend, even if you won’t
   </p>
   <p>
    believe it. Come to this cottage of mine. We’ll get up a regular colony
   </p>
   <p>
    of fowls, and your mother can attend to them excellently; and the
   </p>
   <p>
    children can go to school.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess breathed more and more quickly, and at length she said—
   </p>
   <p>
    “How do I know that you would do all this? Your views may change—and
   </p>
   <p>
    then—we should be—my mother would be—homeless again.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O no—no. I would guarantee you against such as that in writing, if
   </p>
   <p>
    necessary. Think it over.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess shook her head. But d’Urberville persisted; she had seldom seen
   </p>
   <p>
    him so determined; he would not take a negative.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Please just tell your mother,” he said, in emphatic tones. “It is her
   </p>
   <p>
    business to judge—not yours. I shall get the house swept out and
   </p>
   <p>
    whitened to-morrow morning, and fires lit; and it will be dry by the
   </p>
   <p>
    evening, so that you can come straight there. Now mind, I shall expect
   </p>
   <p>
    you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess again shook her head, her throat swelling with complicated
   </p>
   <p>
    emotion. She could not look up at d’Urberville.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I owe you something for the past, you know,” he resumed. “And you
   </p>
   <p>
    cured me, too, of that craze; so I am glad—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I would rather you had kept the craze, so that you had kept the
   </p>
   <p>
    practice which went with it!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am glad of this opportunity of repaying you a little. To-morrow I
   </p>
   <p>
    shall expect to hear your mother’s goods unloading... Give me your hand
   </p>
   <p>
    on it now—dear, beautiful Tess!”
   </p>
   <p>
    With the last sentence he had dropped his voice to a murmur, and put
   </p>
   <p>
    his hand in at the half-open casement. With stormy eyes she pulled the
   </p>
   <p>
    stay-bar quickly, and, in doing so, caught his arm between the casement
   </p>
   <p>
    and the stone mullion.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Damnation—you are very cruel!” he said, snatching out his arm. “No,
   </p>
   <p>
    no!—I know you didn’t do it on purpose. Well, I shall expect you, or
   </p>
   <p>
    your mother and children at least.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I shall not come—I have plenty of money!” she cried.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Where?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “At my father-in-law’s, if I ask for it.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “_If_ you ask for it. But you won’t, Tess; I know you; you’ll never ask
   </p>
   <p>
    for it—you’ll starve first!”
   </p>
   <p>
    With these words he rode off. Just at the corner of the street he met
   </p>
   <p>
    the man with the paint-pot, who asked him if he had deserted the
   </p>
   <p>
    brethren.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You go to the devil!” said d’Urberville.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess remained where she was a long while, till a sudden rebellious
   </p>
   <p>
    sense of injustice caused the region of her eyes to swell with the rush
   </p>
   <p>
    of hot tears thither. Her husband, Angel Clare himself, had, like
   </p>
   <p>
    others, dealt out hard measure to her; surely he had! She had never
   </p>
   <p>
    before admitted such a thought; but he had surely! Never in her
   </p>
   <p>
    life—she could swear it from the bottom of her soul—had she ever
   </p>
   <p>
    intended to do wrong; yet these hard judgements had come. Whatever her
   </p>
   <p>
    sins, they were not sins of intention, but of inadvertence, and why
   </p>
   <p>
    should she have been punished so persistently?
   </p>
   <p>
    She passionately seized the first piece of paper that came to hand, and
   </p>
   <p>
    scribbled the following lines:
   </p>
   <p>
    O why have you treated me so monstrously, Angel! I do not deserve
   </p>
   <p>
    it. I have thought it all over carefully, and I can never, never
   </p>
   <p>
    forgive you! You know that I did not intend to wrong you—why have
   </p>
   <p>
    you so wronged me? You are cruel, cruel indeed! I will try to
   </p>
   <p>
    forget you. It is all injustice I have received at your hands!
   </p>
   <p>
    T.
   </p>
   <p>
    She watched till the postman passed by, ran out to him with her
   </p>
   <p>
    epistle, and then again took her listless place inside the
   </p>
   <p>
    window-panes.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was just as well to write like that as to write tenderly. How could
   </p>
   <p>
    he give way to entreaty? The facts had not changed: there was no new
   </p>
   <p>
    event to alter his opinion.
   </p>
   <p>
    It grew darker, the fire-light shining over the room. The two biggest
   </p>
   <p>
    of the younger children had gone out with their mother; the four
   </p>
   <p>
    smallest, their ages ranging from three-and-a-half years to eleven, all
   </p>
   <p>
    in black frocks, were gathered round the hearth babbling their own
   </p>
   <p>
    little subjects. Tess at length joined them, without lighting a candle.
   </p>
   <p>
    “This is the last night that we shall sleep here, dears, in the house
   </p>
   <p>
    where we were born,” she said quickly. “We ought to think of it,
   </p>
   <p>
    oughtn’t we?”
   </p>
   <p>
    They all became silent; with the impressibility of their age they were
   </p>
   <p>
    ready to burst into tears at the picture of finality she had conjured
   </p>
   <p>
    up, though all the day hitherto they had been rejoicing in the idea of
   </p>
   <p>
    a new place. Tess changed the subject.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Sing to me, dears,” she said.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What shall we sing?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Anything you know; I don’t mind.”
   </p>
   <p>
    There was a momentary pause; it was broken, first, in one little
   </p>
   <p>
    tentative note; then a second voice strengthened it, and a third and a
   </p>
   <p>
    fourth chimed in unison, with words they had learnt at the
   </p>
   <p>
    Sunday-school—
   </p>
   <p>
    Here we suffer grief and pain,
   </p>
   <p>
    Here we meet to part again;
   </p>
   <p>
    In Heaven we part no more.
   </p>
   <p>
    The four sang on with the phlegmatic passivity of persons who had long
   </p>
   <p>
    ago settled the question, and there being no mistake about it, felt
   </p>
   <p>
    that further thought was not required. With features strained hard to
   </p>
   <p>
    enunciate the syllables they continued to regard the centre of the
   </p>
   <p>
    flickering fire, the notes of the youngest straying over into the
   </p>
   <p>
    pauses of the rest.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess turned from them, and went to the window again. Darkness had now
   </p>
   <p>
    fallen without, but she put her face to the pane as though to peer into
   </p>
   <p>
    the gloom. It was really to hide her tears. If she could only believe
   </p>
   <p>
    what the children were singing; if she were only sure, how different
   </p>
   <p>
    all would now be; how confidently she would leave them to Providence
   </p>
   <p>
    and their future kingdom! But, in default of that, it behoved her to do
   </p>
   <p>
    something; to be their Providence; for to Tess, as to not a few
   </p>
   <p>
    millions of others, there was ghastly satire in the poet’s lines—
   </p>
   <p>
    Not in utter nakedness
   </p>
   <p>
    But trailing clouds of glory do we come.
   </p>
   <p>
    To her and her like, birth itself was an ordeal of degrading personal
   </p>
   <p>
    compulsion, whose gratuitousness nothing in the result seemed to
   </p>
   <p>
    justify, and at best could only palliate.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the shades of the wet road she soon discerned her mother with tall
   </p>
   <p>
    ’Liza-Lu and Abraham. Mrs Durbeyfield’s pattens clicked up to the door,
   </p>
   <p>
    and Tess opened it.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I see the tracks of a horse outside the window,” said Joan. “Hev
   </p>
   <p>
    somebody called?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No,” said Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    The children by the fire looked gravely at her, and one murmured—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why, Tess, the gentleman a-horseback!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “He didn’t call,” said Tess. “He spoke to me in passing.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Who was the gentleman?” asked the mother. “Your husband?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No. He’ll never, never come,” answered Tess in stony hopelessness.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Then who was it?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh, you needn’t ask. You’ve seen him before, and so have I.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah! What did he say?” said Joan curiously.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I will tell you when we are settled in our lodging at Kingsbere
   </p>
   <p>
    to-morrow—every word.”
   </p>
   <p>
    It was not her husband, she had said. Yet a consciousness that in a
   </p>
   <p>
    physical sense this man alone was her husband seemed to weigh on her
   </p>
   <p>
    more and more.
   </p>
   <p>
    LII
   </p>
   <p>
    During the small hours of the next morning, while it was still dark,
   </p>
   <p>
    dwellers near the highways were conscious of a disturbance of their
   </p>
   <p>
    night’s rest by rumbling noises, intermittently continuing till
   </p>
   <p>
    daylight—noises as certain to recur in this particular first week of
   </p>
   <p>
    the month as the voice of the cuckoo in the third week of the same.
   </p>
   <p>
    They were the preliminaries of the general removal, the passing of the
   </p>
   <p>
    empty waggons and teams to fetch the goods of the migrating families;
   </p>
   <p>
    for it was always by the vehicle of the farmer who required his
   </p>
   <p>
    services that the hired man was conveyed to his destination. That this
   </p>
   <p>
    might be accomplished within the day was the explanation of the
   </p>
   <p>
    reverberation occurring so soon after midnight, the aim of the carters
   </p>
   <p>
    being to reach the door of the outgoing households by six o’clock, when
   </p>
   <p>
    the loading of their movables at once began.
   </p>
   <p>
    But to Tess and her mother’s household no such anxious farmer sent his
   </p>
   <p>
    team. They were only women; they were not regular labourers; they were
   </p>
   <p>
    not particularly required anywhere; hence they had to hire a waggon at
   </p>
   <p>
    their own expense, and got nothing sent gratuitously.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was a relief to Tess, when she looked out of the window that
   </p>
   <p>
    morning, to find that though the weather was windy and louring, it did
   </p>
   <p>
    not rain, and that the waggon had come. A wet Lady-Day was a spectre
   </p>
   <p>
    which removing families never forgot; damp furniture, damp bedding,
   </p>
   <p>
    damp clothing accompanied it, and left a train of ills.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her mother, ’Liza-Lu, and Abraham were also awake, but the younger
   </p>
   <p>
    children were let sleep on. The four breakfasted by the thin light, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the “house-ridding” was taken in hand.
   </p>
   <p>
    It proceeded with some cheerfulness, a friendly neighbour or two
   </p>
   <p>
    assisting. When the large articles of furniture had been packed in
   </p>
   <p>
    position, a circular nest was made of the beds and bedding, in which
   </p>
   <p>
    Joan Durbeyfield and the young children were to sit through the
   </p>
   <p>
    journey. After loading there was a long delay before the horses were
   </p>
   <p>
    brought, these having been unharnessed during the ridding; but at
   </p>
   <p>
    length, about two o’clock, the whole was under way, the cooking-pot
   </p>
   <p>
    swinging from the axle of the waggon, Mrs Durbeyfield and family at the
   </p>
   <p>
    top, the matron having in her lap, to prevent injury to its works, the
   </p>
   <p>
    head of the clock, which, at any exceptional lurch of the waggon,
   </p>
   <p>
    struck one, or one-and-a-half, in hurt tones. Tess and the next eldest
   </p>
   <p>
    girl walked alongside till they were out of the village.
   </p>
   <p>
    They had called on a few neighbours that morning and the previous
   </p>
   <p>
    evening, and some came to see them off, all wishing them well, though,
   </p>
   <p>
    in their secret hearts, hardly expecting welfare possible to such a
   </p>
   <p>
    family, harmless as the Durbeyfields were to all except themselves.
   </p>
   <p>
    Soon the equipage began to ascend to higher ground, and the wind grew
   </p>
   <p>
    keener with the change of level and soil.
   </p>
   <p>
    The day being the sixth of April, the Durbeyfield waggon met many other
   </p>
   <p>
    waggons with families on the summit of the load, which was built on a
   </p>
   <p>
    wellnigh unvarying principle, as peculiar, probably, to the rural
   </p>
   <p>
    labourer as the hexagon to the bee. The groundwork of the arrangement
   </p>
   <p>
    was the family dresser, which, with its shining handles, and
   </p>
   <p>
    finger-marks, and domestic evidences thick upon it, stood importantly
   </p>
   <p>
    in front, over the tails of the shaft-horses, in its erect and natural
   </p>
   <p>
    position, like some Ark of the Covenant that they were bound to carry
   </p>
   <p>
    reverently.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some of the households were lively, some mournful; some were stopping
   </p>
   <p>
    at the doors of wayside inns; where, in due time, the Durbeyfield
   </p>
   <p>
    menagerie also drew up to bait horses and refresh the travellers.
   </p>
   <p>
    During the halt Tess’s eyes fell upon a three-pint blue mug, which was
   </p>
   <p>
    ascending and descending through the air to and from the feminine
   </p>
   <p>
    section of a household, sitting on the summit of a load that had also
   </p>
   <p>
    drawn up at a little distance from the same inn. She followed one of
   </p>
   <p>
    the mug’s journeys upward, and perceived it to be clasped by hands
   </p>
   <p>
    whose owner she well knew. Tess went towards the waggon.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Marian and Izz!” she cried to the girls, for it was they, sitting with
   </p>
   <p>
    the moving family at whose house they had lodged. “Are you
   </p>
   <p>
    house-ridding to-day, like everybody else?”
   </p>
   <p>
    They were, they said. It had been too rough a life for them at
   </p>
   <p>
    Flintcomb-Ash, and they had come away, almost without notice, leaving
   </p>
   <p>
    Groby to prosecute them if he chose. They told Tess their destination,
   </p>
   <p>
    and Tess told them hers.
   </p>
   <p>
    Marian leant over the load, and lowered her voice. “Do you know that
   </p>
   <p>
    the gentleman who follows ’ee—you’ll guess who I mean—came to ask for
   </p>
   <p>
    ’ee at Flintcomb after you had gone? We didn’t tell’n where you was,
   </p>
   <p>
    knowing you wouldn’t wish to see him.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah—but I did see him!” Tess murmured. “He found me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And do he know where you be going?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I think so.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Husband come back?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She bade her acquaintance goodbye—for the respective carters had now
   </p>
   <p>
    come out from the inn—and the two waggons resumed their journey in
   </p>
   <p>
    opposite directions; the vehicle whereon sat Marian, Izz, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    ploughman’s family with whom they had thrown in their lot, being
   </p>
   <p>
    brightly painted, and drawn by three powerful horses with shining brass
   </p>
   <p>
    ornaments on their harness; while the waggon on which Mrs Durbeyfield
   </p>
   <p>
    and her family rode was a creaking erection that would scarcely bear
   </p>
   <p>
    the weight of the superincumbent load; one which had known no paint
   </p>
   <p>
    since it was made, and drawn by two horses only. The contrast well
   </p>
   <p>
    marked the difference between being fetched by a thriving farmer and
   </p>
   <p>
    conveying oneself whither no hirer waited one’s coming.
   </p>
   <p>
    The distance was great—too great for a day’s journey—and it was with
   </p>
   <p>
    the utmost difficulty that the horses performed it. Though they had
   </p>
   <p>
    started so early, it was quite late in the afternoon when they turned
   </p>
   <p>
    the flank of an eminence which formed part of the upland called
   </p>
   <p>
    Greenhill. While the horses stood to stale and breathe themselves Tess
   </p>
   <p>
    looked around. Under the hill, and just ahead of them, was the
   </p>
   <p>
    half-dead townlet of their pilgrimage, Kingsbere, where lay those
   </p>
   <p>
    ancestors of whom her father had spoken and sung to painfulness:
   </p>
   <p>
    Kingsbere, the spot of all spots in the world which could be considered
   </p>
   <p>
    the d’Urbervilles’ home, since they had resided there for full five
   </p>
   <p>
    hundred years.
   </p>
   <p>
    A man could be seen advancing from the outskirts towards them, and when
   </p>
   <p>
    he beheld the nature of their waggon-load he quickened his steps.
   </p>
   <p>
    “You be the woman they call Mrs Durbeyfield, I reckon?” he said to
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess’s mother, who had descended to walk the remainder of the way.
   </p>
   <p>
    She nodded. “Though widow of the late Sir John d’Urberville, poor
   </p>
   <p>
    nobleman, if I cared for my rights; and returning to the domain of his
   </p>
   <p>
    forefathers.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh? Well, I know nothing about that; but if you be Mrs Durbeyfield, I
   </p>
   <p>
    am sent to tell ’ee that the rooms you wanted be let. We didn’t know
   </p>
   <p>
    that you was coming till we got your letter this morning—when ’twas too
   </p>
   <p>
    late. But no doubt you can get other lodgings somewhere.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The man had noticed the face of Tess, which had become ash-pale at his
   </p>
   <p>
    intelligence. Her mother looked hopelessly at fault. “What shall we do
   </p>
   <p>
    now, Tess?” she said bitterly. “Here’s a welcome to your ancestors’
   </p>
   <p>
    lands! However, let’s try further.”
   </p>
   <p>
    They moved on into the town, and tried with all their might, Tess
   </p>
   <p>
    remaining with the waggon to take care of the children whilst her
   </p>
   <p>
    mother and ’Liza-Lu made inquiries. At the last return of Joan to the
   </p>
   <p>
    vehicle, an hour later, when her search for accommodation had still
   </p>
   <p>
    been fruitless, the driver of the waggon said the goods must be
   </p>
   <p>
    unloaded, as the horses were half-dead, and he was bound to return part
   </p>
   <p>
    of the way at least that night.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Very well—unload it here,” said Joan recklessly. “I’ll get shelter
   </p>
   <p>
    somewhere.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The waggon had drawn up under the churchyard wall, in a spot screened
   </p>
   <p>
    from view, and the driver, nothing loth, soon hauled down the poor heap
   </p>
   <p>
    of household goods. This done, she paid him, reducing herself to almost
   </p>
   <p>
    her last shilling thereby, and he moved off and left them, only too
   </p>
   <p>
    glad to get out of further dealings with such a family. It was a dry
   </p>
   <p>
    night, and he guessed that they would come to no harm.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess gazed desperately at the pile of furniture. The cold sunlight of
   </p>
   <p>
    this spring evening peered invidiously upon the crocks and kettles,
   </p>
   <p>
    upon the bunches of dried herbs shivering in the breeze, upon the brass
   </p>
   <p>
    handles of the dresser, upon the wicker-cradle they had all been rocked
   </p>
   <p>
    in, and upon the well-rubbed clock-case, all of which gave out the
   </p>
   <p>
    reproachful gleam of indoor articles abandoned to the vicissitudes of a
   </p>
   <p>
    roofless exposure for which they were never made. Round about were
   </p>
   <p>
    deparked hills and slopes—now cut up into little paddocks—and the green
   </p>
   <p>
    foundations that showed where the d’Urberville mansion once had stood;
   </p>
   <p>
    also an outlying stretch of Egdon Heath that had always belonged to the
   </p>
   <p>
    estate. Hard by, the aisle of the church called the d’Urberville Aisle
   </p>
   <p>
    looked on imperturbably.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Isn’t your family vault your own freehold?” said Tess’s mother, as she
   </p>
   <p>
    returned from a reconnoitre of the church and graveyard. “Why, of
   </p>
   <p>
    course ’tis, and that’s where we will camp, girls, till the place of
   </p>
   <p>
    your ancestors finds us a roof! Now, Tess and ’Liza and Abraham, you
   </p>
   <p>
    help me. We’ll make a nest for these children, and then we’ll have
   </p>
   <p>
    another look round.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess listlessly lent a hand, and in a quarter of an hour the old
   </p>
   <p>
    four-post bedstead was dissociated from the heap of goods, and erected
   </p>
   <p>
    under the south wall of the church, the part of the building known as
   </p>
   <p>
    the d’Urberville Aisle, beneath which the huge vaults lay. Over the
   </p>
   <p>
    tester of the bedstead was a beautiful traceried window, of many
   </p>
   <p>
    lights, its date being the fifteenth century. It was called the
   </p>
   <p>
    d’Urberville Window, and in the upper part could be discerned heraldic
   </p>
   <p>
    emblems like those on Durbeyfield’s old seal and spoon.
   </p>
   <p>
    Joan drew the curtains round the bed so as to make an excellent tent of
   </p>
   <p>
    it, and put the smaller children inside. “If it comes to the worst we
   </p>
   <p>
    can sleep there too, for one night,” she said. “But let us try further
   </p>
   <p>
    on, and get something for the dears to eat! O, Tess, what’s the use of
   </p>
   <p>
    your playing at marrying gentlemen, if it leaves us like this!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Accompanied by ’Liza-Lu and the boy, she again ascended the little lane
   </p>
   <p>
    which secluded the church from the townlet. As soon as they got into
   </p>
   <p>
    the street they beheld a man on horseback gazing up and down. “Ah—I’m
   </p>
   <p>
    looking for you!” he said, riding up to them. “This is indeed a family
   </p>
   <p>
    gathering on the historic spot!”
   </p>
   <p>
    It was Alec d’Urberville. “Where is Tess?” he asked.
   </p>
   <p>
    Personally Joan had no liking for Alec. She cursorily signified the
   </p>
   <p>
    direction of the church, and went on, d’Urberville saying that he would
   </p>
   <p>
    see them again, in case they should be still unsuccessful in their
   </p>
   <p>
    search for shelter, of which he had just heard. When they had gone,
   </p>
   <p>
    d’Urberville rode to the inn, and shortly after came out on foot.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the interim Tess, left with the children inside the bedstead,
   </p>
   <p>
    remained talking with them awhile, till, seeing that no more could be
   </p>
   <p>
    done to make them comfortable just then, she walked about the
   </p>
   <p>
    churchyard, now beginning to be embrowned by the shades of nightfall.
   </p>
   <p>
    The door of the church was unfastened, and she entered it for the first
   </p>
   <p>
    time in her life.
   </p>
   <p>
    Within the window under which the bedstead stood were the tombs of the
   </p>
   <p>
    family, covering in their dates several centuries. They were canopied,
   </p>
   <p>
    altar-shaped, and plain; their carvings being defaced and broken; their
   </p>
   <p>
    brasses torn from the matrices, the rivet-holes remaining like
   </p>
   <p>
    martin-holes in a sandcliff. Of all the reminders that she had ever
   </p>
   <p>
    received that her people were socially extinct, there was none so
   </p>
   <p>
    forcible as this spoliation.
   </p>
   <p>
    She drew near to a dark stone on which was inscribed:
   </p>
   <p>
    OSTIUM SEPULCHRI ANTIQUAE FAMILIAE D’URBERVILLE
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess did not read Church-Latin like a Cardinal, but she knew that this
   </p>
   <p>
    was the door of her ancestral sepulchre, and that the tall knights of
   </p>
   <p>
    whom her father had chanted in his cups lay inside.
   </p>
   <p>
    She musingly turned to withdraw, passing near an altar-tomb, the oldest
   </p>
   <p>
    of them all, on which was a recumbent figure. In the dusk she had not
   </p>
   <p>
    noticed it before, and would hardly have noticed it now but for an odd
   </p>
   <p>
    fancy that the effigy moved. As soon as she drew close to it she
   </p>
   <p>
    discovered all in a moment that the figure was a living person; and the
   </p>
   <p>
    shock to her sense of not having been alone was so violent that she was
   </p>
   <p>
    quite overcome, and sank down nigh to fainting, not, however, till she
   </p>
   <p>
    had recognized Alec d’Urberville in the form.
   </p>
   <p>
    He leapt off the slab and supported her.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I saw you come in,” he said smiling, “and got up there not to
   </p>
   <p>
    interrupt your meditations. A family gathering, is it not, with these
   </p>
   <p>
    old fellows under us here? Listen.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He stamped with his heel heavily on the floor; whereupon there arose a
   </p>
   <p>
    hollow echo from below.
   </p>
   <p>
    “That shook them a bit, I’ll warrant!” he continued. “And you thought I
   </p>
   <p>
    was the mere stone reproduction of one of them. But no. The old order
   </p>
   <p>
    changeth. The little finger of the sham d’Urberville can do more for
   </p>
   <p>
    you than the whole dynasty of the real underneath.... Now command me.
   </p>
   <p>
    What shall I do?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Go away!” she murmured.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I will—I’ll look for your mother,” said he blandly. But in passing her
   </p>
   <p>
    he whispered: “Mind this; you’ll be civil yet!”
   </p>
   <p>
    When he was gone she bent down upon the entrance to the vaults, and
   </p>
   <p>
    said—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why am I on the wrong side of this door!”
   </p>
   <p>
    In the meantime Marian and Izz Huett had journeyed onward with the
   </p>
   <p>
    chattels of the ploughman in the direction of their land of Canaan—the
   </p>
   <p>
    Egypt of some other family who had left it only that morning. But the
   </p>
   <p>
    girls did not for a long time think of where they were going. Their
   </p>
   <p>
    talk was of Angel Clare and Tess, and Tess’s persistent lover, whose
   </p>
   <p>
    connection with her previous history they had partly heard and partly
   </p>
   <p>
    guessed ere this.
   </p>
   <p>
    “’Tisn’t as though she had never known him afore,” said Marian. “His
   </p>
   <p>
    having won her once makes all the difference in the world. ’Twould be a
   </p>
   <p>
    thousand pities if he were to tole her away again. Mr Clare can never
   </p>
   <p>
    be anything to us, Izz; and why should we grudge him to her, and not
   </p>
   <p>
    try to mend this quarrel? If he could on’y know what straits she’s put
   </p>
   <p>
    to, and what’s hovering round, he might come to take care of his own.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Could we let him know?”
   </p>
   <p>
    They thought of this all the way to their destination; but the bustle
   </p>
   <p>
    of re-establishment in their new place took up all their attention
   </p>
   <p>
    then. But when they were settled, a month later, they heard of Clare’s
   </p>
   <p>
    approaching return, though they had learnt nothing more of Tess. Upon
   </p>
   <p>
    that, agitated anew by their attachment to him, yet honourably disposed
   </p>
   <p>
    to her, Marian uncorked the penny ink-bottle they shared, and a few
   </p>
   <p>
    lines were concocted between the two girls.
   </p>
   <p>
    Honour’d Sir,
   </p>
   <p>
    Look to your Wife if you do love her as much as she do love you.
   </p>
   <p>
    For she is sore put to by an Enemy in the shape of a Friend. Sir,
   </p>
   <p>
    there is one near her who ought to be Away. A woman should not be
   </p>
   <p>
    try’d beyond her Strength, and continual dropping will wear away a
   </p>
   <p>
    Stone—ay, more—a Diamond.
   </p>
   <p>
    From Two Well-Wishers
   </p>
   <p>
    This was addressed to Angel Clare at the only place they had ever heard
   </p>
   <p>
    him to be connected with, Emminster Vicarage; after which they
   </p>
   <p>
    continued in a mood of emotional exaltation at their own generosity,
   </p>
   <p>
    which made them sing in hysterical snatches and weep at the same time.
   </p>
   <p>
    End of Phase the Sixth
   </p>
   <p>
    Phase the Seventh:
   </p>
   <p>
    Fulfilment
   </p>
   <p>
    LIII
   </p>
   <p>
    It was evening at Emminster Vicarage. The two customary candles were
   </p>
   <p>
    burning under their green shades in the Vicar’s study, but he had not
   </p>
   <p>
    been sitting there. Occasionally he came in, stirred the small fire
   </p>
   <p>
    which sufficed for the increasing mildness of the spring, and went out
   </p>
   <p>
    again; sometimes pausing at the front door, going on to the
   </p>
   <p>
    drawing-room, then returning again to the front door.
   </p>
   <p>
    It faced westward, and though gloom prevailed inside, there was still
   </p>
   <p>
    light enough without to see with distinctness. Mrs Clare, who had been
   </p>
   <p>
    sitting in the drawing-room, followed him hither.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Plenty of time yet,” said the Vicar. “He doesn’t reach Chalk-Newton
   </p>
   <p>
    till six, even if the train should be punctual, and ten miles of
   </p>
   <p>
    country-road, five of them in Crimmercrock Lane, are not jogged over in
   </p>
   <p>
    a hurry by our old horse.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But he has done it in an hour with us, my dear.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Years ago.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus they passed the minutes, each well knowing that this was only
   </p>
   <p>
    waste of breath, the one essential being simply to wait.
   </p>
   <p>
    At length there was a slight noise in the lane, and the old pony-chaise
   </p>
   <p>
    appeared indeed outside the railings. They saw alight therefrom a form
   </p>
   <p>
    which they affected to recognize, but would actually have passed by in
   </p>
   <p>
    the street without identifying had he not got out of their carriage at
   </p>
   <p>
    the particular moment when a particular person was due.
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs Clare rushed through the dark passage to the door, and her husband
   </p>
   <p>
    came more slowly after her.
   </p>
   <p>
    The new arrival, who was just about to enter, saw their anxious faces
   </p>
   <p>
    in the doorway and the gleam of the west in their spectacles because
   </p>
   <p>
    they confronted the last rays of day; but they could only see his shape
   </p>
   <p>
    against the light.
   </p>
   <p>
    “O, my boy, my boy—home again at last!” cried Mrs Clare, who cared no
   </p>
   <p>
    more at that moment for the stains of heterodoxy which had caused all
   </p>
   <p>
    this separation than for the dust upon his clothes. What woman, indeed,
   </p>
   <p>
    among the most faithful adherents of the truth, believes the promises
   </p>
   <p>
    and threats of the Word in the sense in which she believes in her own
   </p>
   <p>
    children, or would not throw her theology to the wind if weighed
   </p>
   <p>
    against their happiness? As soon as they reached the room where the
   </p>
   <p>
    candles were lighted she looked at his face.
   </p>
   <p>
    “O, it is not Angel—not my son—the Angel who went away!” she cried in
   </p>
   <p>
    all the irony of sorrow, as she turned herself aside.
   </p>
   <p>
    His father, too, was shocked to see him, so reduced was that figure
   </p>
   <p>
    from its former contours by worry and the bad season that Clare had
   </p>
   <p>
    experienced, in the climate to which he had so rashly hurried in his
   </p>
   <p>
    first aversion to the mockery of events at home. You could see the
   </p>
   <p>
    skeleton behind the man, and almost the ghost behind the skeleton. He
   </p>
   <p>
    matched Crivelli’s dead _Christus_. His sunken eye-pits were of morbid
   </p>
   <p>
    hue, and the light in his eyes had waned. The angular hollows and lines
   </p>
   <p>
    of his aged ancestors had succeeded to their reign in his face twenty
   </p>
   <p>
    years before their time.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I was ill over there, you know,” he said. “I am all right now.”
   </p>
   <p>
    As if, however, to falsify this assertion, his legs seemed to give way,
   </p>
   <p>
    and he suddenly sat down to save himself from falling. It was only a
   </p>
   <p>
    slight attack of faintness, resulting from the tedious day’s journey,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the excitement of arrival.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Has any letter come for me lately?” he asked. “I received the last you
   </p>
   <p>
    sent on by the merest chance, and after considerable delay through
   </p>
   <p>
    being inland; or I might have come sooner.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It was from your wife, we supposed?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It was.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Only one other had recently come. They had not sent it on to him,
   </p>
   <p>
    knowing he would start for home so soon.
   </p>
   <p>
    He hastily opened the letter produced, and was much disturbed to read
   </p>
   <p>
    in Tess’s handwriting the sentiments expressed in her last hurried
   </p>
   <p>
    scrawl to him.
   </p>
   <p>
    O why have you treated me so monstrously, Angel! I do not deserve
   </p>
   <p>
    it. I have thought it all over carefully, and I can never, never
   </p>
   <p>
    forgive you! You know that I did not intend to wrong you—why have
   </p>
   <p>
    you so wronged me? You are cruel, cruel indeed! I will try to
   </p>
   <p>
    forget you. It is all injustice I have received at your hands!
   </p>
   <p>
    T.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It is quite true!” said Angel, throwing down the letter. “Perhaps she
   </p>
   <p>
    will never be reconciled to me!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Don’t, Angel, be so anxious about a mere child of the soil!” said his
   </p>
   <p>
    mother.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Child of the soil! Well, we all are children of the soil. I wish she
   </p>
   <p>
    were so in the sense you mean; but let me now explain to you what I
   </p>
   <p>
    have never explained before, that her father is a descendant in the
   </p>
   <p>
    male line of one of the oldest Norman houses, like a good many others
   </p>
   <p>
    who lead obscure agricultural lives in our villages, and are dubbed
   </p>
   <p>
    ‘sons of the soil.’”
   </p>
   <p>
    He soon retired to bed; and the next morning, feeling exceedingly
   </p>
   <p>
    unwell, he remained in his room pondering. The circumstances amid which
   </p>
   <p>
    he had left Tess were such that though, while on the south of the
   </p>
   <p>
    Equator and just in receipt of her loving epistle, it had seemed the
   </p>
   <p>
    easiest thing in the world to rush back into her arms the moment he
   </p>
   <p>
    chose to forgive her, now that he had arrived it was not so easy as it
   </p>
   <p>
    had seemed. She was passionate, and her present letter, showing that
   </p>
   <p>
    her estimate of him had changed under his delay—too justly changed, he
   </p>
   <p>
    sadly owned,—made him ask himself if it would be wise to confront her
   </p>
   <p>
    unannounced in the presence of her parents. Supposing that her love had
   </p>
   <p>
    indeed turned to dislike during the last weeks of separation, a sudden
   </p>
   <p>
    meeting might lead to bitter words.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare therefore thought it would be best to prepare Tess and her family
   </p>
   <p>
    by sending a line to Marlott announcing his return, and his hope that
   </p>
   <p>
    she was still living with them there, as he had arranged for her to do
   </p>
   <p>
    when he left England. He despatched the inquiry that very day, and
   </p>
   <p>
    before the week was out there came a short reply from Mrs Durbeyfield
   </p>
   <p>
    which did not remove his embarrassment, for it bore no address, though
   </p>
   <p>
    to his surprise it was not written from Marlott.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sir,
   </p>
   <p>
    J write these few lines to say that my Daughter is away from me at
   </p>
   <p>
    present, and J am not sure when she will return, but J will let you
   </p>
   <p>
    know as Soon as she do. J do not feel at liberty to tell you Where
   </p>
   <p>
    she is temperly biding. J should say that me and my Family have
   </p>
   <p>
    left Marlott for some Time.—
   </p>
   <p>
    Yours,
   </p>
   <p>
    J. Durbeyfield
   </p>
   <p>
    It was such a relief to Clare to learn that Tess was at least
   </p>
   <p>
    apparently well that her mother’s stiff reticence as to her whereabouts
   </p>
   <p>
    did not long distress him. They were all angry with him, evidently. He
   </p>
   <p>
    would wait till Mrs Durbeyfield could inform him of Tess’s return,
   </p>
   <p>
    which her letter implied to be soon. He deserved no more. His had been
   </p>
   <p>
    a love “which alters when it alteration finds”. He had undergone some
   </p>
   <p>
    strange experiences in his absence; he had seen the virtual Faustina in
   </p>
   <p>
    the literal Cornelia, a spiritual Lucretia in a corporeal Phryne; he
   </p>
   <p>
    had thought of the woman taken and set in the midst as one deserving to
   </p>
   <p>
    be stoned, and of the wife of Uriah being made a queen; and he had
   </p>
   <p>
    asked himself why he had not judged Tess constructively rather than
   </p>
   <p>
    biographically, by the will rather than by the deed?
   </p>
   <p>
    A day or two passed while he waited at his father’s house for the
   </p>
   <p>
    promised second note from Joan Durbeyfield, and indirectly to recover a
   </p>
   <p>
    little more strength. The strength showed signs of coming back, but
   </p>
   <p>
    there was no sign of Joan’s letter. Then he hunted up the old letter
   </p>
   <p>
    sent on to him in Brazil, which Tess had written from Flintcomb-Ash,
   </p>
   <p>
    and re-read it. The sentences touched him now as much as when he had
   </p>
   <p>
    first perused them.
   </p>
   <p>
    ...I must cry to you in my trouble—I have no one else!... I think I
   </p>
   <p>
    must die if you do not come soon, or tell me to come to you... please,
   </p>
   <p>
    please, not to be just—only a little kind to me.... If you would come,
   </p>
   <p>
    I could die in your arms! I would be well content to do that if so be
   </p>
   <p>
    you had forgiven me!... if you will send me one little line, and say,
   </p>
   <p>
    _I am coming soon_, I will bide on, Angel—O, so cheerfully!... think
   </p>
   <p>
    how it do hurt my heart not to see you ever—ever! Ah, if I could only
   </p>
   <p>
    make your dear heart ache one little minute of each day as mine does
   </p>
   <p>
    every day and all day long, it might lead you to show pity to your poor
   </p>
   <p>
    lonely one.... I would be content, ay, glad, to live with you as your
   </p>
   <p>
    servant, if I may not as your wife; so that I could only be near you,
   </p>
   <p>
    and get glimpses of you, and think of you as mine.... I long for only
   </p>
   <p>
    one thing in heaven or earth or under the earth, to meet you, my own
   </p>
   <p>
    dear! Come to me—come to me, and save me from what threatens me!
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare determined that he would no longer believe in her more recent and
   </p>
   <p>
    severer regard of him, but would go and find her immediately. He asked
   </p>
   <p>
    his father if she had applied for any money during his absence. His
   </p>
   <p>
    father returned a negative, and then for the first time it occurred to
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel that her pride had stood in her way, and that she had suffered
   </p>
   <p>
    privation. From his remarks his parents now gathered the real reason of
   </p>
   <p>
    the separation; and their Christianity was such that, reprobates being
   </p>
   <p>
    their especial care, the tenderness towards Tess which her blood, her
   </p>
   <p>
    simplicity, even her poverty, had not engendered, was instantly excited
   </p>
   <p>
    by her sin.
   </p>
   <p>
    Whilst he was hastily packing together a few articles for his journey
   </p>
   <p>
    he glanced over a poor plain missive also lately come to hand—the one
   </p>
   <p>
    from Marian and Izz Huett, beginning—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Honour’d Sir, Look to your Wife if you do love her as much as she do
   </p>
   <p>
    love you,” and signed, “From Two Well-Wishers.”
   </p>
   <p>
    LIV
   </p>
   <p>
    In a quarter of an hour Clare was leaving the house, whence his mother
   </p>
   <p>
    watched his thin figure as it disappeared into the street. He had
   </p>
   <p>
    declined to borrow his father’s old mare, well knowing of its necessity
   </p>
   <p>
    to the household. He went to the inn, where he hired a trap, and could
   </p>
   <p>
    hardly wait during the harnessing. In a very few minutes after, he was
   </p>
   <p>
    driving up the hill out of the town which, three or four months earlier
   </p>
   <p>
    in the year, Tess had descended with such hopes and ascended with such
   </p>
   <p>
    shattered purposes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Benvill Lane soon stretched before him, its hedges and trees purple
   </p>
   <p>
    with buds; but he was looking at other things, and only recalled
   </p>
   <p>
    himself to the scene sufficiently to enable him to keep the way. In
   </p>
   <p>
    something less than an hour-and-a-half he had skirted the south of the
   </p>
   <p>
    King’s Hintock estates and ascended to the untoward solitude of
   </p>
   <p>
    Cross-in-Hand, the unholy stone whereon Tess had been compelled by Alec
   </p>
   <p>
    d’Urberville, in his whim of reformation, to swear the strange oath
   </p>
   <p>
    that she would never wilfully tempt him again. The pale and blasted
   </p>
   <p>
    nettle-stems of the preceding year even now lingered nakedly in the
   </p>
   <p>
    banks, young green nettles of the present spring growing from their
   </p>
   <p>
    roots.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thence he went along the verge of the upland overhanging the other
   </p>
   <p>
    Hintocks, and, turning to the right, plunged into the bracing
   </p>
   <p>
    calcareous region of Flintcomb-Ash, the address from which she had
   </p>
   <p>
    written to him in one of the letters, and which he supposed to be the
   </p>
   <p>
    place of sojourn referred to by her mother. Here, of course, he did not
   </p>
   <p>
    find her; and what added to his depression was the discovery that no
   </p>
   <p>
    “Mrs Clare” had ever been heard of by the cottagers or by the farmer
   </p>
   <p>
    himself, though Tess was remembered well enough by her Christian name.
   </p>
   <p>
    His name she had obviously never used during their separation, and her
   </p>
   <p>
    dignified sense of their total severance was shown not much less by
   </p>
   <p>
    this abstention than by the hardships she had chosen to undergo (of
   </p>
   <p>
    which he now learnt for the first time) rather than apply to his father
   </p>
   <p>
    for more funds.
   </p>
   <p>
    From this place they told him Tess Durbeyfield had gone, without due
   </p>
   <p>
    notice, to the home of her parents on the other side of Blackmoor, and
   </p>
   <p>
    it therefore became necessary to find Mrs Durbeyfield. She had told him
   </p>
   <p>
    she was not now at Marlott, but had been curiously reticent as to her
   </p>
   <p>
    actual address, and the only course was to go to Marlott and inquire
   </p>
   <p>
    for it. The farmer who had been so churlish with Tess was quite
   </p>
   <p>
    smooth-tongued to Clare, and lent him a horse and man to drive him
   </p>
   <p>
    towards Marlott, the gig he had arrived in being sent back to
   </p>
   <p>
    Emminster; for the limit of a day’s journey with that horse was
   </p>
   <p>
    reached.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare would not accept the loan of the farmer’s vehicle for a further
   </p>
   <p>
    distance than to the outskirts of the Vale, and, sending it back with
   </p>
   <p>
    the man who had driven him, he put up at an inn, and next day entered
   </p>
   <p>
    on foot the region wherein was the spot of his dear Tess’s birth. It
   </p>
   <p>
    was as yet too early in the year for much colour to appear in the
   </p>
   <p>
    gardens and foliage; the so-called spring was but winter overlaid with
   </p>
   <p>
    a thin coat of greenness, and it was of a parcel with his expectations.
   </p>
   <p>
    The house in which Tess had passed the years of her childhood was now
   </p>
   <p>
    inhabited by another family who had never known her. The new residents
   </p>
   <p>
    were in the garden, taking as much interest in their own doings as if
   </p>
   <p>
    the homestead had never passed its primal time in conjunction with the
   </p>
   <p>
    histories of others, beside which the histories of these were but as a
   </p>
   <p>
    tale told by an idiot. They walked about the garden paths with thoughts
   </p>
   <p>
    of their own concerns entirely uppermost, bringing their actions at
   </p>
   <p>
    every moment in jarring collision with the dim ghosts behind them,
   </p>
   <p>
    talking as though the time when Tess lived there were not one whit
   </p>
   <p>
    intenser in story than now. Even the spring birds sang over their heads
   </p>
   <p>
    as if they thought there was nobody missing in particular.
   </p>
   <p>
    On inquiry of these precious innocents, to whom even the name of their
   </p>
   <p>
    predecessors was a failing memory, Clare learned that John Durbeyfield
   </p>
   <p>
    was dead; that his widow and children had left Marlott, declaring that
   </p>
   <p>
    they were going to live at Kingsbere, but instead of doing so had gone
   </p>
   <p>
    on to another place they mentioned. By this time Clare abhorred the
   </p>
   <p>
    house for ceasing to contain Tess, and hastened away from its hated
   </p>
   <p>
    presence without once looking back.
   </p>
   <p>
    His way was by the field in which he had first beheld her at the dance.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was as bad as the house—even worse. He passed on through the
   </p>
   <p>
    churchyard, where, amongst the new headstones, he saw one of a somewhat
   </p>
   <p>
    superior design to the rest. The inscription ran thus:
   </p>
   <p>
    In memory of John Durbeyfield, rightly d’Urberville, of the once
   </p>
   <p>
    powerful family of that Name, and Direct Descendant through an
   </p>
   <p>
    illustrious Line from Sir Pagan d’Urberville, one of the Knights of
   </p>
   <p>
    the Conqueror. Died March 10th, 18—
   </p>
   <p>
    How are the Mighty Fallen.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some man, apparently the sexton, had observed Clare standing there, and
   </p>
   <p>
    drew nigh. “Ah, sir, now that’s a man who didn’t want to lie here, but
   </p>
   <p>
    wished to be carried to Kingsbere, where his ancestors be.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “And why didn’t they respect his wish?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Oh—no money. Bless your soul, sir, why—there, I wouldn’t wish to say
   </p>
   <p>
    it everywhere, but—even this headstone, for all the flourish wrote upon
   </p>
   <p>
    en, is not paid for.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah, who put it up?”
   </p>
   <p>
    The man told the name of a mason in the village, and, on leaving the
   </p>
   <p>
    churchyard, Clare called at the mason’s house. He found that the
   </p>
   <p>
    statement was true, and paid the bill. This done, he turned in the
   </p>
   <p>
    direction of the migrants.
   </p>
   <p>
    The distance was too long for a walk, but Clare felt such a strong
   </p>
   <p>
    desire for isolation that at first he would neither hire a conveyance
   </p>
   <p>
    nor go to a circuitous line of railway by which he might eventually
   </p>
   <p>
    reach the place. At Shaston, however, he found he must hire; but the
   </p>
   <p>
    way was such that he did not enter Joan’s place till about seven
   </p>
   <p>
    o’clock in the evening, having traversed a distance of over twenty
   </p>
   <p>
    miles since leaving Marlott.
   </p>
   <p>
    The village being small he had little difficulty in finding Mrs
   </p>
   <p>
    Durbeyfield’s tenement, which was a house in a walled garden, remote
   </p>
   <p>
    from the main road, where she had stowed away her clumsy old furniture
   </p>
   <p>
    as best she could. It was plain that for some reason or other she had
   </p>
   <p>
    not wished him to visit her, and he felt his call to be somewhat of an
   </p>
   <p>
    intrusion. She came to the door herself, and the light from the evening
   </p>
   <p>
    sky fell upon her face.
   </p>
   <p>
    This was the first time that Clare had ever met her, but he was too
   </p>
   <p>
    preoccupied to observe more than that she was still a handsome woman,
   </p>
   <p>
    in the garb of a respectable widow. He was obliged to explain that he
   </p>
   <p>
    was Tess’s husband, and his object in coming there, and he did it
   </p>
   <p>
    awkwardly enough. “I want to see her at once,” he added. “You said you
   </p>
   <p>
    would write to me again, but you have not done so.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Because she’ve not come home,” said Joan.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Do you know if she is well?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t. But you ought to, sir,” said she.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I admit it. Where is she staying?”
   </p>
   <p>
    From the beginning of the interview Joan had disclosed her
   </p>
   <p>
    embarrassment by keeping her hand to the side of her cheek.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I—don’t know exactly where she is staying,” she answered. “She
   </p>
   <p>
    was—but—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Where was she?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, she is not there now.”
   </p>
   <p>
    In her evasiveness she paused again, and the younger children had by
   </p>
   <p>
    this time crept to the door, where, pulling at his mother’s skirts, the
   </p>
   <p>
    youngest murmured—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Is this the gentleman who is going to marry Tess?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “He has married her,” Joan whispered. “Go inside.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare saw her efforts for reticence, and asked—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Do you think Tess would wish me to try and find her? If not, of
   </p>
   <p>
    course—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t think she would.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Are you sure?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am sure she wouldn’t.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He was turning away; and then he thought of Tess’s tender letter.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am sure she would!” he retorted passionately. “I know her better
   </p>
   <p>
    than you do.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “That’s very likely, sir; for I have never really known her.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Please tell me her address, Mrs Durbeyfield, in kindness to a lonely
   </p>
   <p>
    wretched man!” Tess’s mother again restlessly swept her cheek with her
   </p>
   <p>
    vertical hand, and seeing that he suffered, she at last said, is a low
   </p>
   <p>
    voice—
   </p>
   <p>
    “She is at Sandbourne.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah—where there? Sandbourne has become a large place, they say.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t know more particularly than I have said—Sandbourne. For
   </p>
   <p>
    myself, I was never there.”
   </p>
   <p>
    It was apparent that Joan spoke the truth in this, and he pressed her
   </p>
   <p>
    no further.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Are you in want of anything?” he said gently.
   </p>
   <p>
    “No, sir,” she replied. “We are fairly well provided for.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Without entering the house Clare turned away. There was a station three
   </p>
   <p>
    miles ahead, and paying off his coachman, he walked thither. The last
   </p>
   <p>
    train to Sandbourne left shortly after, and it bore Clare on its
   </p>
   <p>
    wheels.
   </p>
   <p>
    LV
   </p>
   <p>
    At eleven o’clock that night, having secured a bed at one of the hotels
   </p>
   <p>
    and telegraphed his address to his father immediately on his arrival,
   </p>
   <p>
    he walked out into the streets of Sandbourne. It was too late to call
   </p>
   <p>
    on or inquire for any one, and he reluctantly postponed his purpose
   </p>
   <p>
    till the morning. But he could not retire to rest just yet.
   </p>
   <p>
    This fashionable watering-place, with its eastern and its western
   </p>
   <p>
    stations, its piers, its groves of pines, its promenades, and its
   </p>
   <p>
    covered gardens, was, to Angel Clare, like a fairy place suddenly
   </p>
   <p>
    created by the stroke of a wand, and allowed to get a little dusty. An
   </p>
   <p>
    outlying eastern tract of the enormous Egdon Waste was close at hand,
   </p>
   <p>
    yet on the very verge of that tawny piece of antiquity such a
   </p>
   <p>
    glittering novelty as this pleasure city had chosen to spring up.
   </p>
   <p>
    Within the space of a mile from its outskirts every irregularity of the
   </p>
   <p>
    soil was prehistoric, every channel an undisturbed British trackway;
   </p>
   <p>
    not a sod having been turned there since the days of the Cæsars. Yet
   </p>
   <p>
    the exotic had grown here, suddenly as the prophet’s gourd; and had
   </p>
   <p>
    drawn hither Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    By the midnight lamps he went up and down the winding way of this new
   </p>
   <p>
    world in an old one, and could discern between the trees and against
   </p>
   <p>
    the stars the lofty roofs, chimneys, gazebos, and towers of the
   </p>
   <p>
    numerous fanciful residences of which the place was composed. It was a
   </p>
   <p>
    city of detached mansions; a Mediterranean lounging-place on the
   </p>
   <p>
    English Channel; and as seen now by night it seemed even more imposing
   </p>
   <p>
    than it was.
   </p>
   <p>
    The sea was near at hand, but not intrusive; it murmured, and he
   </p>
   <p>
    thought it was the pines; the pines murmured in precisely the same
   </p>
   <p>
    tones, and he thought they were the sea.
   </p>
   <p>
    Where could Tess possibly be, a cottage-girl, his young wife, amidst
   </p>
   <p>
    all this wealth and fashion? The more he pondered, the more was he
   </p>
   <p>
    puzzled. Were there any cows to milk here? There certainly were no
   </p>
   <p>
    fields to till. She was most probably engaged to do something in one of
   </p>
   <p>
    these large houses; and he sauntered along, looking at the
   </p>
   <p>
    chamber-windows and their lights going out one by one, and wondered
   </p>
   <p>
    which of them might be hers.
   </p>
   <p>
    Conjecture was useless, and just after twelve o’clock he entered and
   </p>
   <p>
    went to bed. Before putting out his light he re-read Tess’s impassioned
   </p>
   <p>
    letter. Sleep, however, he could not—so near her, yet so far from
   </p>
   <p>
    her—and he continually lifted the window-blind and regarded the backs
   </p>
   <p>
    of the opposite houses, and wondered behind which of the sashes she
   </p>
   <p>
    reposed at that moment.
   </p>
   <p>
    He might almost as well have sat up all night. In the morning he arose
   </p>
   <p>
    at seven, and shortly after went out, taking the direction of the chief
   </p>
   <p>
    post-office. At the door he met an intelligent postman coming out with
   </p>
   <p>
    letters for the morning delivery.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Do you know the address of a Mrs Clare?” asked Angel. The postman
   </p>
   <p>
    shook his head.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then, remembering that she would have been likely to continue the use
   </p>
   <p>
    of her maiden name, Clare said—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Of a Miss Durbeyfield?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Durbeyfield?”
   </p>
   <p>
    This also was strange to the postman addressed.
   </p>
   <p>
    “There’s visitors coming and going every day, as you know, sir,” he
   </p>
   <p>
    said; “and without the name of the house ’tis impossible to find ’em.”
   </p>
   <p>
    One of his comrades hastening out at that moment, the name was repeated
   </p>
   <p>
    to him.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I know no name of Durbeyfield; but there is the name of d’Urberville
   </p>
   <p>
    at The Herons,” said the second.
   </p>
   <p>
    “That’s it!” cried Clare, pleased to think that she had reverted to the
   </p>
   <p>
    real pronunciation. “What place is The Herons?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “A stylish lodging-house. ’Tis all lodging-houses here, bless ’ee.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare received directions how to find the house, and hastened thither,
   </p>
   <p>
    arriving with the milkman. The Herons, though an ordinary villa, stood
   </p>
   <p>
    in its own grounds, and was certainly the last place in which one would
   </p>
   <p>
    have expected to find lodgings, so private was its appearance. If poor
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess was a servant here, as he feared, she would go to the back-door to
   </p>
   <p>
    that milkman, and he was inclined to go thither also. However, in his
   </p>
   <p>
    doubts he turned to the front, and rang.
   </p>
   <p>
    The hour being early, the landlady herself opened the door. Clare
   </p>
   <p>
    inquired for Teresa d’Urberville or Durbeyfield.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Mrs d’Urberville?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess, then, passed as a married woman, and he felt glad, even though
   </p>
   <p>
    she had not adopted his name.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Will you kindly tell her that a relative is anxious to see her?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It is rather early. What name shall I give, sir?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Angel.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Mr Angel?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “No; Angel. It is my Christian name. She’ll understand.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I’ll see if she is awake.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He was shown into the front room—the dining-room—and looked out through
   </p>
   <p>
    the spring curtains at the little lawn, and the rhododendrons and other
   </p>
   <p>
    shrubs upon it. Obviously her position was by no means so bad as he had
   </p>
   <p>
    feared, and it crossed his mind that she must somehow have claimed and
   </p>
   <p>
    sold the jewels to attain it. He did not blame her for one moment. Soon
   </p>
   <p>
    his sharpened ear detected footsteps upon the stairs, at which his
   </p>
   <p>
    heart thumped so painfully that he could hardly stand firm. “Dear me!
   </p>
   <p>
    what will she think of me, so altered as I am!” he said to himself; and
   </p>
   <p>
    the door opened.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess appeared on the threshold—not at all as he had expected to see
   </p>
   <p>
    her—bewilderingly otherwise, indeed. Her great natural beauty was, if
   </p>
   <p>
    not heightened, rendered more obvious by her attire. She was loosely
   </p>
   <p>
    wrapped in a cashmere dressing-gown of gray-white, embroidered in
   </p>
   <p>
    half-mourning tints, and she wore slippers of the same hue. Her neck
   </p>
   <p>
    rose out of a frill of down, and her well-remembered cable of
   </p>
   <p>
    dark-brown hair was partially coiled up in a mass at the back of her
   </p>
   <p>
    head and partly hanging on her shoulder—the evident result of haste.
   </p>
   <p>
    He had held out his arms, but they had fallen again to his side; for
   </p>
   <p>
    she had not come forward, remaining still in the opening of the
   </p>
   <p>
    doorway. Mere yellow skeleton that he was now, he felt the contrast
   </p>
   <p>
    between them, and thought his appearance distasteful to her.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Tess!” he said huskily, “can you forgive me for going away? Can’t
   </p>
   <p>
    you—come to me? How do you get to be—like this?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It is too late,” said she, her voice sounding hard through the room,
   </p>
   <p>
    her eyes shining unnaturally.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I did not think rightly of you—I did not see you as you were!” he
   </p>
   <p>
    continued to plead. “I have learnt to since, dearest Tessy mine!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Too late, too late!” she said, waving her hand in the impatience of a
   </p>
   <p>
    person whose tortures cause every instant to seem an hour. “Don’t come
   </p>
   <p>
    close to me, Angel! No—you must not. Keep away.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “But don’t you love me, my dear wife, because I have been so pulled
   </p>
   <p>
    down by illness? You are not so fickle—I am come on purpose for you—my
   </p>
   <p>
    mother and father will welcome you now!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes—O, yes, yes! But I say, I say it is too late.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She seemed to feel like a fugitive in a dream, who tries to move away,
   </p>
   <p>
    but cannot. “Don’t you know all—don’t you know it? Yet how do you come
   </p>
   <p>
    here if you do not know?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I inquired here and there, and I found the way.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I waited and waited for you,” she went on, her tones suddenly resuming
   </p>
   <p>
    their old fluty pathos. “But you did not come! And I wrote to you, and
   </p>
   <p>
    you did not come! He kept on saying you would never come any more, and
   </p>
   <p>
    that I was a foolish woman. He was very kind to me, and to mother, and
   </p>
   <p>
    to all of us after father’s death. He—”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t understand.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “He has won me back to him.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare looked at her keenly, then, gathering her meaning, flagged like
   </p>
   <p>
    one plague-stricken, and his glance sank; it fell on her hands, which,
   </p>
   <p>
    once rosy, were now white and more delicate.
   </p>
   <p>
    She continued—
   </p>
   <p>
    “He is upstairs. I hate him now, because he told me a lie—that you
   </p>
   <p>
    would not come again; and you _have_ come! These clothes are what he’s
   </p>
   <p>
    put upon me: I didn’t care what he did wi’ me! But—will you go away,
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel, please, and never come any more?”
   </p>
   <p>
    They stood fixed, their baffled hearts looking out of their eyes with a
   </p>
   <p>
    joylessness pitiful to see. Both seemed to implore something to shelter
   </p>
   <p>
    them from reality.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah—it is my fault!” said Clare.
   </p>
   <p>
    But he could not get on. Speech was as inexpressive as silence. But he
   </p>
   <p>
    had a vague consciousness of one thing, though it was not clear to him
   </p>
   <p>
    till later; that his original Tess had spiritually ceased to recognize
   </p>
   <p>
    the body before him as hers—allowing it to drift, like a corpse upon
   </p>
   <p>
    the current, in a direction dissociated from its living will.
   </p>
   <p>
    A few instants passed, and he found that Tess was gone. His face grew
   </p>
   <p>
    colder and more shrunken as he stood concentrated on the moment, and a
   </p>
   <p>
    minute or two after, he found himself in the street, walking along he
   </p>
   <p>
    did not know whither.
   </p>
   <p>
    LVI
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs Brooks, the lady who was the householder at The Herons and owner of
   </p>
   <p>
    all the handsome furniture, was not a person of an unusually curious
   </p>
   <p>
    turn of mind. She was too deeply materialized, poor woman, by her long
   </p>
   <p>
    and enforced bondage to that arithmetical demon Profit-and-Loss, to
   </p>
   <p>
    retain much curiousity for its own sake, and apart from possible
   </p>
   <p>
    lodgers’ pockets. Nevertheless, the visit of Angel Clare to her
   </p>
   <p>
    well-paying tenants, Mr and Mrs d’Urberville, as she deemed them, was
   </p>
   <p>
    sufficiently exceptional in point of time and manner to reinvigorate
   </p>
   <p>
    the feminine proclivity which had been stifled down as useless save in
   </p>
   <p>
    its bearings to the letting trade.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess had spoken to her husband from the doorway, without entering the
   </p>
   <p>
    dining-room, and Mrs Brooks, who stood within the partly-closed door of
   </p>
   <p>
    her own sitting-room at the back of the passage, could hear fragments
   </p>
   <p>
    of the conversation—if conversation it could be called—between those
   </p>
   <p>
    two wretched souls. She heard Tess re-ascend the stairs to the first
   </p>
   <p>
    floor, and the departure of Clare, and the closing of the front door
   </p>
   <p>
    behind him. Then the door of the room above was shut, and Mrs Brooks
   </p>
   <p>
    knew that Tess had re-entered her apartment. As the young lady was not
   </p>
   <p>
    fully dressed, Mrs Brooks knew that she would not emerge again for some
   </p>
   <p>
    time.
   </p>
   <p>
    She accordingly ascended the stairs softly, and stood at the door of
   </p>
   <p>
    the front room—a drawing-room, connected with the room immediately
   </p>
   <p>
    behind it (which was a bedroom) by folding-doors in the common manner.
   </p>
   <p>
    This first floor, containing Mrs Brooks’s best apartments, had been
   </p>
   <p>
    taken by the week by the d’Urbervilles. The back room was now in
   </p>
   <p>
    silence; but from the drawing-room there came sounds.
   </p>
   <p>
    All that she could at first distinguish of them was one syllable,
   </p>
   <p>
    continually repeated in a low note of moaning, as if it came from a
   </p>
   <p>
    soul bound to some Ixionian wheel—
   </p>
   <p>
    “O—O—O!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Then a silence, then a heavy sigh, and again—
   </p>
   <p>
    “O—O—O!”
   </p>
   <p>
    The landlady looked through the keyhole. Only a small space of the room
   </p>
   <p>
    inside was visible, but within that space came a corner of the
   </p>
   <p>
    breakfast table, which was already spread for the meal, and also a
   </p>
   <p>
    chair beside. Over the seat of the chair Tess’s face was bowed, her
   </p>
   <p>
    posture being a kneeling one in front of it; her hands were clasped
   </p>
   <p>
    over her head, the skirts of her dressing-gown and the embroidery of
   </p>
   <p>
    her night-gown flowed upon the floor behind her, and her stockingless
   </p>
   <p>
    feet, from which the slippers had fallen, protruded upon the carpet. It
   </p>
   <p>
    was from her lips that came the murmur of unspeakable despair.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then a man’s voice from the adjoining bedroom—
   </p>
   <p>
    “What’s the matter?”
   </p>
   <p>
    She did not answer, but went on, in a tone which was a soliloquy rather
   </p>
   <p>
    than an exclamation, and a dirge rather than a soliloquy. Mrs Brooks
   </p>
   <p>
    could only catch a portion:
   </p>
   <p>
    “And then my dear, dear husband came home to me ... and I did not know
   </p>
   <p>
    it!... And you had used your cruel persuasion upon me ... you did not
   </p>
   <p>
    stop using it—no—you did not stop! My little sisters and brothers and
   </p>
   <p>
    my mother’s needs—they were the things you moved me by ... and you said
   </p>
   <p>
    my husband would never come back—never; and you taunted me, and said
   </p>
   <p>
    what a simpleton I was to expect him!... And at last I believed you and
   </p>
   <p>
    gave way!... And then he came back! Now he is gone. Gone a second time,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I have lost him now for ever ... and he will not love me the
   </p>
   <p>
    littlest bit ever any more—only hate me!... O yes, I have lost him
   </p>
   <p>
    now—again because of—you!” In writhing, with her head on the chair, she
   </p>
   <p>
    turned her face towards the door, and Mrs Brooks could see the pain
   </p>
   <p>
    upon it, and that her lips were bleeding from the clench of her teeth
   </p>
   <p>
    upon them, and that the long lashes of her closed eyes stuck in wet
   </p>
   <p>
    tags to her cheeks. She continued: “And he is dying—he looks as if he
   </p>
   <p>
    is dying!... And my sin will kill him and not kill me!... O, you have
   </p>
   <p>
    torn my life all to pieces ... made me be what I prayed you in pity not
   </p>
   <p>
    to make me be again!... My own true husband will never, never—O God—I
   </p>
   <p>
    can’t bear this!—I cannot!”
   </p>
   <p>
    There were more and sharper words from the man; then a sudden rustle;
   </p>
   <p>
    she had sprung to her feet. Mrs Brooks, thinking that the speaker was
   </p>
   <p>
    coming to rush out of the door, hastily retreated down the stairs.
   </p>
   <p>
    She need not have done so, however, for the door of the sitting-room
   </p>
   <p>
    was not opened. But Mrs Brooks felt it unsafe to watch on the landing
   </p>
   <p>
    again, and entered her own parlour below.
   </p>
   <p>
    She could hear nothing through the floor, although she listened
   </p>
   <p>
    intently, and thereupon went to the kitchen to finish her interrupted
   </p>
   <p>
    breakfast. Coming up presently to the front room on the ground floor
   </p>
   <p>
    she took up some sewing, waiting for her lodgers to ring that she might
   </p>
   <p>
    take away the breakfast, which she meant to do herself, to discover
   </p>
   <p>
    what was the matter if possible. Overhead, as she sat, she could now
   </p>
   <p>
    hear the floorboards slightly creak, as if some one were walking about,
   </p>
   <p>
    and presently the movement was explained by the rustle of garments
   </p>
   <p>
    against the banisters, the opening and the closing of the front door,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the form of Tess passing to the gate on her way into the street.
   </p>
   <p>
    She was fully dressed now in the walking costume of a well-to-do young
   </p>
   <p>
    lady in which she had arrived, with the sole addition that over her hat
   </p>
   <p>
    and black feathers a veil was drawn.
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs Brooks had not been able to catch any word of farewell, temporary
   </p>
   <p>
    or otherwise, between her tenants at the door above. They might have
   </p>
   <p>
    quarrelled, or Mr d’Urberville might still be asleep, for he was not an
   </p>
   <p>
    early riser.
   </p>
   <p>
    She went into the back room, which was more especially her own
   </p>
   <p>
    apartment, and continued her sewing there. The lady lodger did not
   </p>
   <p>
    return, nor did the gentleman ring his bell. Mrs Brooks pondered on the
   </p>
   <p>
    delay, and on what probable relation the visitor who had called so
   </p>
   <p>
    early bore to the couple upstairs. In reflecting she leant back in her
   </p>
   <p>
    chair.
   </p>
   <p>
    As she did so her eyes glanced casually over the ceiling till they were
   </p>
   <p>
    arrested by a spot in the middle of its white surface which she had
   </p>
   <p>
    never noticed there before. It was about the size of a wafer when she
   </p>
   <p>
    first observed it, but it speedily grew as large as the palm of her
   </p>
   <p>
    hand, and then she could perceive that it was red. The oblong white
   </p>
   <p>
    ceiling, with this scarlet blot in the midst, had the appearance of a
   </p>
   <p>
    gigantic ace of hearts.
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs Brooks had strange qualms of misgiving. She got upon the table, and
   </p>
   <p>
    touched the spot in the ceiling with her fingers. It was damp, and she
   </p>
   <p>
    fancied that it was a blood stain.
   </p>
   <p>
    Descending from the table, she left the parlour, and went upstairs,
   </p>
   <p>
    intending to enter the room overhead, which was the bedchamber at the
   </p>
   <p>
    back of the drawing-room. But, nerveless woman as she had now become,
   </p>
   <p>
    she could not bring herself to attempt the handle. She listened. The
   </p>
   <p>
    dead silence within was broken only by a regular beat.
   </p>
   <p>
    Drip, drip, drip.
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs Brooks hastened downstairs, opened the front door, and ran into the
   </p>
   <p>
    street. A man she knew, one of the workmen employed at an adjoining
   </p>
   <p>
    villa, was passing by, and she begged him to come in and go upstairs
   </p>
   <p>
    with her; she feared something had happened to one of her lodgers. The
   </p>
   <p>
    workman assented, and followed her to the landing.
   </p>
   <p>
    She opened the door of the drawing-room, and stood back for him to pass
   </p>
   <p>
    in, entering herself behind him. The room was empty; the breakfast—a
   </p>
   <p>
    substantial repast of coffee, eggs, and a cold ham—lay spread upon the
   </p>
   <p>
    table untouched, as when she had taken it up, excepting that the
   </p>
   <p>
    carving-knife was missing. She asked the man to go through the
   </p>
   <p>
    folding-doors into the adjoining room.
   </p>
   <p>
    He opened the doors, entered a step or two, and came back almost
   </p>
   <p>
    instantly with a rigid face. “My good God, the gentleman in bed is
   </p>
   <p>
    dead! I think he has been hurt with a knife—a lot of blood has run down
   </p>
   <p>
    upon the floor!”
   </p>
   <p>
    The alarm was soon given, and the house which had lately been so quiet
   </p>
   <p>
    resounded with the tramp of many footsteps, a surgeon among the rest.
   </p>
   <p>
    The wound was small, but the point of the blade had touched the heart
   </p>
   <p>
    of the victim, who lay on his back, pale, fixed, dead, as if he had
   </p>
   <p>
    scarcely moved after the infliction of the blow. In a quarter of an
   </p>
   <p>
    hour the news that a gentleman who was a temporary visitor to the town
   </p>
   <p>
    had been stabbed in his bed, spread through every street and villa of
   </p>
   <p>
    the popular watering-place.
   </p>
   <p>
    LVII
   </p>
   <p>
    Meanwhile Angel Clare had walked automatically along the way by which
   </p>
   <p>
    he had come, and, entering his hotel, sat down over the breakfast,
   </p>
   <p>
    staring at nothingness. He went on eating and drinking unconsciously
   </p>
   <p>
    till on a sudden he demanded his bill; having paid which, he took his
   </p>
   <p>
    dressing-bag in his hand, the only luggage he had brought with him, and
   </p>
   <p>
    went out.
   </p>
   <p>
    At the moment of his departure a telegram was handed to him—a few words
   </p>
   <p>
    from his mother, stating that they were glad to know his address, and
   </p>
   <p>
    informing him that his brother Cuthbert had proposed to and been
   </p>
   <p>
    accepted by Mercy Chant.
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare crumpled up the paper and followed the route to the station;
   </p>
   <p>
    reaching it, he found that there would be no train leaving for an hour
   </p>
   <p>
    and more. He sat down to wait, and having waited a quarter of an hour
   </p>
   <p>
    felt that he could wait there no longer. Broken in heart and numbed, he
   </p>
   <p>
    had nothing to hurry for; but he wished to get out of a town which had
   </p>
   <p>
    been the scene of such an experience, and turned to walk to the first
   </p>
   <p>
    station onward, and let the train pick him up there.
   </p>
   <p>
    The highway that he followed was open, and at a little distance dipped
   </p>
   <p>
    into a valley, across which it could be seen running from edge to edge.
   </p>
   <p>
    He had traversed the greater part of this depression, and was climbing
   </p>
   <p>
    the western acclivity when, pausing for breath, he unconsciously looked
   </p>
   <p>
    back. Why he did so he could not say, but something seemed to impel him
   </p>
   <p>
    to the act. The tape-like surface of the road diminished in his rear as
   </p>
   <p>
    far as he could see, and as he gazed a moving spot intruded on the
   </p>
   <p>
    white vacuity of its perspective.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was a human figure running. Clare waited, with a dim sense that
   </p>
   <p>
    somebody was trying to overtake him.
   </p>
   <p>
    The form descending the incline was a woman’s, yet so entirely was his
   </p>
   <p>
    mind blinded to the idea of his wife’s following him that even when she
   </p>
   <p>
    came nearer he did not recognize her under the totally changed attire
   </p>
   <p>
    in which he now beheld her. It was not till she was quite close that he
   </p>
   <p>
    could believe her to be Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I saw you—turn away from the station—just before I got there—and I
   </p>
   <p>
    have been following you all this way!”
   </p>
   <p>
    She was so pale, so breathless, so quivering in every muscle, that he
   </p>
   <p>
    did not ask her a single question, but seizing her hand, and pulling it
   </p>
   <p>
    within his arm, he led her along. To avoid meeting any possible
   </p>
   <p>
    wayfarers he left the high road and took a footpath under some
   </p>
   <p>
    fir-trees. When they were deep among the moaning boughs he stopped and
   </p>
   <p>
    looked at her inquiringly.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Angel,” she said, as if waiting for this, “do you know what I have
   </p>
   <p>
    been running after you for? To tell you that I have killed him!” A
   </p>
   <p>
    pitiful white smile lit her face as she spoke.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What!” said he, thinking from the strangeness of her manner that she
   </p>
   <p>
    was in some delirium.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I have done it—I don’t know how,” she continued. “Still, I owed it to
   </p>
   <p>
    you, and to myself, Angel. I feared long ago, when I struck him on the
   </p>
   <p>
    mouth with my glove, that I might do it some day for the trap he set
   </p>
   <p>
    for me in my simple youth, and his wrong to you through me. He has come
   </p>
   <p>
    between us and ruined us, and now he can never do it any more. I never
   </p>
   <p>
    loved him at all, Angel, as I loved you. You know it, don’t you? You
   </p>
   <p>
    believe it? You didn’t come back to me, and I was obliged to go back to
   </p>
   <p>
    him. Why did you go away—why did you—when I loved you so? I can’t think
   </p>
   <p>
    why you did it. But I don’t blame you; only, Angel, will you forgive me
   </p>
   <p>
    my sin against you, now I have killed him? I thought as I ran along
   </p>
   <p>
    that you would be sure to forgive me now I have done that. It came to
   </p>
   <p>
    me as a shining light that I should get you back that way. I could not
   </p>
   <p>
    bear the loss of you any longer—you don’t know how entirely I was
   </p>
   <p>
    unable to bear your not loving me! Say you do now, dear, dear husband;
   </p>
   <p>
    say you do, now I have killed him!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I do love you, Tess—O, I do—it is all come back!” he said, tightening
   </p>
   <p>
    his arms round her with fervid pressure. “But how do you mean—you have
   </p>
   <p>
    killed him?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I mean that I have,” she murmured in a reverie.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What, bodily? Is he dead?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes. He heard me crying about you, and he bitterly taunted me; and
   </p>
   <p>
    called you by a foul name; and then I did it. My heart could not bear
   </p>
   <p>
    it. He had nagged me about you before. And then I dressed myself and
   </p>
   <p>
    came away to find you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    By degrees he was inclined to believe that she had faintly attempted,
   </p>
   <p>
    at least, what she said she had done; and his horror at her impulse was
   </p>
   <p>
    mixed with amazement at the strength of her affection for himself, and
   </p>
   <p>
    at the strangeness of its quality, which had apparently extinguished
   </p>
   <p>
    her moral sense altogether. Unable to realize the gravity of her
   </p>
   <p>
    conduct, she seemed at last content; and he looked at her as she lay
   </p>
   <p>
    upon his shoulder, weeping with happiness, and wondered what obscure
   </p>
   <p>
    strain in the d’Urberville blood had led to this aberration—if it were
   </p>
   <p>
    an aberration. There momentarily flashed through his mind that the
   </p>
   <p>
    family tradition of the coach and murder might have arisen because the
   </p>
   <p>
    d’Urbervilles had been known to do these things. As well as his
   </p>
   <p>
    confused and excited ideas could reason, he supposed that in the moment
   </p>
   <p>
    of mad grief of which she spoke, her mind had lost its balance, and
   </p>
   <p>
    plunged her into this abyss.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was very terrible if true; if a temporary hallucination, sad. But,
   </p>
   <p>
    anyhow, here was this deserted wife of his, this passionately-fond
   </p>
   <p>
    woman, clinging to him without a suspicion that he would be anything to
   </p>
   <p>
    her but a protector. He saw that for him to be otherwise was not, in
   </p>
   <p>
    her mind, within the region of the possible. Tenderness was absolutely
   </p>
   <p>
    dominant in Clare at last. He kissed her endlessly with his white lips,
   </p>
   <p>
    and held her hand, and said—
   </p>
   <p>
    “I will not desert you! I will protect you by every means in my power,
   </p>
   <p>
    dearest love, whatever you may have done or not have done!”
   </p>
   <p>
    They then walked on under the trees, Tess turning her head every now
   </p>
   <p>
    and then to look at him. Worn and unhandsome as he had become, it was
   </p>
   <p>
    plain that she did not discern the least fault in his appearance. To
   </p>
   <p>
    her he was, as of old, all that was perfection, personally and
   </p>
   <p>
    mentally. He was still her Antinous, her Apollo even; his sickly face
   </p>
   <p>
    was beautiful as the morning to her affectionate regard on this day no
   </p>
   <p>
    less than when she first beheld him; for was it not the face of the one
   </p>
   <p>
    man on earth who had loved her purely, and who had believed in her as
   </p>
   <p>
    pure!
   </p>
   <p>
    With an instinct as to possibilities, he did not now, as he had
   </p>
   <p>
    intended, make for the first station beyond the town, but plunged still
   </p>
   <p>
    farther under the firs, which here abounded for miles. Each clasping
   </p>
   <p>
    the other round the waist they promenaded over the dry bed of
   </p>
   <p>
    fir-needles, thrown into a vague intoxicating atmosphere at the
   </p>
   <p>
    consciousness of being together at last, with no living soul between
   </p>
   <p>
    them; ignoring that there was a corpse. Thus they proceeded for several
   </p>
   <p>
    miles till Tess, arousing herself, looked about her, and said, timidly—
   </p>
   <p>
    “Are we going anywhere in particular?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t know, dearest. Why?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t know.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Well, we might walk a few miles further, and when it is evening find
   </p>
   <p>
    lodgings somewhere or other—in a lonely cottage, perhaps. Can you walk
   </p>
   <p>
    well, Tessy?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “O yes! I could walk for ever and ever with your arm round me!”
   </p>
   <p>
    Upon the whole it seemed a good thing to do. Thereupon they quickened
   </p>
   <p>
    their pace, avoiding high roads, and following obscure paths tending
   </p>
   <p>
    more or less northward. But there was an unpractical vagueness in their
   </p>
   <p>
    movements throughout the day; neither one of them seemed to consider
   </p>
   <p>
    any question of effectual escape, disguise, or long concealment. Their
   </p>
   <p>
    every idea was temporary and unforefending, like the plans of two
   </p>
   <p>
    children.
   </p>
   <p>
    At mid-day they drew near to a roadside inn, and Tess would have
   </p>
   <p>
    entered it with him to get something to eat, but he persuaded her to
   </p>
   <p>
    remain among the trees and bushes of this half-woodland, half-moorland
   </p>
   <p>
    part of the country till he should come back. Her clothes were of
   </p>
   <p>
    recent fashion; even the ivory-handled parasol that she carried was of
   </p>
   <p>
    a shape unknown in the retired spot to which they had now wandered; and
   </p>
   <p>
    the cut of such articles would have attracted attention in the settle
   </p>
   <p>
    of a tavern. He soon returned, with food enough for half-a-dozen people
   </p>
   <p>
    and two bottles of wine—enough to last them for a day or more, should
   </p>
   <p>
    any emergency arise.
   </p>
   <p>
    They sat down upon some dead boughs and shared their meal. Between one
   </p>
   <p>
    and two o’clock they packed up the remainder and went on again.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I feel strong enough to walk any distance,” said she.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I think we may as well steer in a general way towards the interior of
   </p>
   <p>
    the country, where we can hide for a time, and are less likely to be
   </p>
   <p>
    looked for than anywhere near the coast,” Clare remarked. “Later on,
   </p>
   <p>
    when they have forgotten us, we can make for some port.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She made no reply to this beyond that of grasping him more tightly, and
   </p>
   <p>
    straight inland they went. Though the season was an English May, the
   </p>
   <p>
    weather was serenely bright, and during the afternoon it was quite
   </p>
   <p>
    warm. Through the latter miles of their walk their footpath had taken
   </p>
   <p>
    them into the depths of the New Forest, and towards evening, turning
   </p>
   <p>
    the corner of a lane, they perceived behind a brook and bridge a large
   </p>
   <p>
    board on which was painted in white letters, “This desirable Mansion to
   </p>
   <p>
    be Let Furnished”; particulars following, with directions to apply to
   </p>
   <p>
    some London agents. Passing through the gate they could see the house,
   </p>
   <p>
    an old brick building of regular design and large accommodation.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I know it,” said Clare. “It is Bramshurst Court. You can see that it
   </p>
   <p>
    is shut up, and grass is growing on the drive.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Some of the windows are open,” said Tess.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Just to air the rooms, I suppose.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “All these rooms empty, and we without a roof to our heads!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “You are getting tired, my Tess!” he said. “We’ll stop soon.” And
   </p>
   <p>
    kissing her sad mouth, he again led her onwards.
   </p>
   <p>
    He was growing weary likewise, for they had wandered a dozen or fifteen
   </p>
   <p>
    miles, and it became necessary to consider what they should do for
   </p>
   <p>
    rest. They looked from afar at isolated cottages and little inns, and
   </p>
   <p>
    were inclined to approach one of the latter, when their hearts failed
   </p>
   <p>
    them, and they sheered off. At length their gait dragged, and they
   </p>
   <p>
    stood still.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Could we sleep under the trees?” she asked.
   </p>
   <p>
    He thought the season insufficiently advanced.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I have been thinking of that empty mansion we passed,” he said. “Let
   </p>
   <p>
    us go back towards it again.”
   </p>
   <p>
    They retraced their steps, but it was half an hour before they stood
   </p>
   <p>
    without the entrance-gate as earlier. He then requested her to stay
   </p>
   <p>
    where she was, whilst he went to see who was within.
   </p>
   <p>
    She sat down among the bushes within the gate, and Clare crept towards
   </p>
   <p>
    the house. His absence lasted some considerable time, and when he
   </p>
   <p>
    returned Tess was wildly anxious, not for herself, but for him. He had
   </p>
   <p>
    found out from a boy that there was only an old woman in charge as
   </p>
   <p>
    caretaker, and she only came there on fine days, from the hamlet near,
   </p>
   <p>
    to open and shut the windows. She would come to shut them at sunset.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Now, we can get in through one of the lower windows, and rest there,”
   </p>
   <p>
    said he.
   </p>
   <p>
    Under his escort she went tardily forward to the main front, whose
   </p>
   <p>
    shuttered windows, like sightless eyeballs, excluded the possibility of
   </p>
   <p>
    watchers. The door was reached a few steps further, and one of the
   </p>
   <p>
    windows beside it was open. Clare clambered in, and pulled Tess in
   </p>
   <p>
    after him.
   </p>
   <p>
    Except the hall, the rooms were all in darkness, and they ascended the
   </p>
   <p>
    staircase. Up here also the shutters were tightly closed, the
   </p>
   <p>
    ventilation being perfunctorily done, for this day at least, by opening
   </p>
   <p>
    the hall-window in front and an upper window behind. Clare unlatched
   </p>
   <p>
    the door of a large chamber, felt his way across it, and parted the
   </p>
   <p>
    shutters to the width of two or three inches. A shaft of dazzling
   </p>
   <p>
    sunlight glanced into the room, revealing heavy, old-fashioned
   </p>
   <p>
    furniture, crimson damask hangings, and an enormous four-post bedstead,
   </p>
   <p>
    along the head of which were carved running figures, apparently
   </p>
   <p>
    Atalanta’s race.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Rest at last!” said he, setting down his bag and the parcel of viands.
   </p>
   <p>
    They remained in great quietness till the caretaker should have come to
   </p>
   <p>
    shut the windows: as a precaution, putting themselves in total darkness
   </p>
   <p>
    by barring the shutters as before, lest the woman should open the door
   </p>
   <p>
    of their chamber for any casual reason. Between six and seven o’clock
   </p>
   <p>
    she came, but did not approach the wing they were in. They heard her
   </p>
   <p>
    close the windows, fasten them, lock the door, and go away. Then Clare
   </p>
   <p>
    again stole a chink of light from the window, and they shared another
   </p>
   <p>
    meal, till by-and-by they were enveloped in the shades of night which
   </p>
   <p>
    they had no candle to disperse.
   </p>
   <p>
    LVIII
   </p>
   <p>
    The night was strangely solemn and still. In the small hours she
   </p>
   <p>
    whispered to him the whole story of how he had walked in his sleep with
   </p>
   <p>
    her in his arms across the Froom stream, at the imminent risk of both
   </p>
   <p>
    their lives, and laid her down in the stone coffin at the ruined abbey.
   </p>
   <p>
    He had never known of that till now.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why didn’t you tell me next day?” he said. “It might have prevented
   </p>
   <p>
    much misunderstanding and woe.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Don’t think of what’s past!” said she. “I am not going to think
   </p>
   <p>
    outside of now. Why should we! Who knows what to-morrow has in store?”
   </p>
   <p>
    But it apparently had no sorrow. The morning was wet and foggy, and
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare, rightly informed that the caretaker only opened the windows on
   </p>
   <p>
    fine days, ventured to creep out of their chamber and explore the
   </p>
   <p>
    house, leaving Tess asleep. There was no food on the premises, but
   </p>
   <p>
    there was water, and he took advantage of the fog to emerge from the
   </p>
   <p>
    mansion and fetch tea, bread, and butter from a shop in a little place
   </p>
   <p>
    two miles beyond, as also a small tin kettle and spirit-lamp, that they
   </p>
   <p>
    might get fire without smoke. His re-entry awoke her; and they
   </p>
   <p>
    breakfasted on what he had brought.
   </p>
   <p>
    They were indisposed to stir abroad, and the day passed, and the night
   </p>
   <p>
    following, and the next, and next; till, almost without their being
   </p>
   <p>
    aware, five days had slipped by in absolute seclusion, not a sight or
   </p>
   <p>
    sound of a human being disturbing their peacefulness, such as it was.
   </p>
   <p>
    The changes of the weather were their only events, the birds of the New
   </p>
   <p>
    Forest their only company. By tacit consent they hardly once spoke of
   </p>
   <p>
    any incident of the past subsequent to their wedding-day. The gloomy
   </p>
   <p>
    intervening time seemed to sink into chaos, over which the present and
   </p>
   <p>
    prior times closed as if it never had been. Whenever he suggested that
   </p>
   <p>
    they should leave their shelter, and go forwards towards Southampton or
   </p>
   <p>
    London, she showed a strange unwillingness to move.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Why should we put an end to all that’s sweet and lovely!” she
   </p>
   <p>
    deprecated. “What must come will come.” And, looking through the
   </p>
   <p>
    shutter-chink: “All is trouble outside there; inside here content.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He peeped out also. It was quite true; within was affection, union,
   </p>
   <p>
    error forgiven: outside was the inexorable.
   </p>
   <p>
    “And—and,” she said, pressing her cheek against his, “I fear that what
   </p>
   <p>
    you think of me now may not last. I do not wish to outlive your present
   </p>
   <p>
    feeling for me. I would rather not. I would rather be dead and buried
   </p>
   <p>
    when the time comes for you to despise me, so that it may never be
   </p>
   <p>
    known to me that you despised me.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I cannot ever despise you.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I also hope that. But considering what my life has been, I cannot see
   </p>
   <p>
    why any man should, sooner or later, be able to help despising me....
   </p>
   <p>
    How wickedly mad I was! Yet formerly I never could bear to hurt a fly
   </p>
   <p>
    or a worm, and the sight of a bird in a cage used often to make me
   </p>
   <p>
    cry.”
   </p>
   <p>
    They remained yet another day. In the night the dull sky cleared, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the result was that the old caretaker at the cottage awoke early. The
   </p>
   <p>
    brilliant sunrise made her unusually brisk; she decided to open the
   </p>
   <p>
    contiguous mansion immediately, and to air it thoroughly on such a day.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus it occurred that, having arrived and opened the lower rooms before
   </p>
   <p>
    six o’clock, she ascended to the bedchambers, and was about to turn the
   </p>
   <p>
    handle of the one wherein they lay. At that moment she fancied she
   </p>
   <p>
    could hear the breathing of persons within. Her slippers and her
   </p>
   <p>
    antiquity had rendered her progress a noiseless one so far, and she
   </p>
   <p>
    made for instant retreat; then, deeming that her hearing might have
   </p>
   <p>
    deceived her, she turned anew to the door and softly tried the handle.
   </p>
   <p>
    The lock was out of order, but a piece of furniture had been moved
   </p>
   <p>
    forward on the inside, which prevented her opening the door more than
   </p>
   <p>
    an inch or two. A stream of morning light through the shutter-chink
   </p>
   <p>
    fell upon the faces of the pair, wrapped in profound slumber, Tess’s
   </p>
   <p>
    lips being parted like a half-opened flower near his cheek. The
   </p>
   <p>
    caretaker was so struck with their innocent appearance, and with the
   </p>
   <p>
    elegance of Tess’s gown hanging across a chair, her silk stockings
   </p>
   <p>
    beside it, the pretty parasol, and the other habits in which she had
   </p>
   <p>
    arrived because she had none else, that her first indignation at the
   </p>
   <p>
    effrontery of tramps and vagabonds gave way to a momentary
   </p>
   <p>
    sentimentality over this genteel elopement, as it seemed. She closed
   </p>
   <p>
    the door, and withdrew as softly as she had come, to go and consult
   </p>
   <p>
    with her neighbours on the odd discovery.
   </p>
   <p>
    Not more than a minute had elapsed after her withdrawal when Tess woke,
   </p>
   <p>
    and then Clare. Both had a sense that something had disturbed them,
   </p>
   <p>
    though they could not say what; and the uneasy feeling which it
   </p>
   <p>
    engendered grew stronger. As soon as he was dressed he narrowly scanned
   </p>
   <p>
    the lawn through the two or three inches of shutter-chink.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I think we will leave at once,” said he. “It is a fine day. And I
   </p>
   <p>
    cannot help fancying somebody is about the house. At any rate, the
   </p>
   <p>
    woman will be sure to come to-day.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She passively assented, and putting the room in order, they took up the
   </p>
   <p>
    few articles that belonged to them, and departed noiselessly. When they
   </p>
   <p>
    had got into the Forest she turned to take a last look at the house.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Ah, happy house—goodbye!” she said. “My life can only be a question of
   </p>
   <p>
    a few weeks. Why should we not have stayed there?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Don’t say it, Tess! We shall soon get out of this district altogether.
   </p>
   <p>
    We’ll continue our course as we’ve begun it, and keep straight north.
   </p>
   <p>
    Nobody will think of looking for us there. We shall be looked for at
   </p>
   <p>
    the Wessex ports if we are sought at all. When we are in the north we
   </p>
   <p>
    will get to a port and away.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Having thus persuaded her, the plan was pursued, and they kept a
   </p>
   <p>
    bee-line northward. Their long repose at the manor-house lent them
   </p>
   <p>
    walking power now; and towards mid-day they found that they were
   </p>
   <p>
    approaching the steepled city of Melchester, which lay directly in
   </p>
   <p>
    their way. He decided to rest her in a clump of trees during the
   </p>
   <p>
    afternoon, and push onward under cover of darkness. At dusk Clare
   </p>
   <p>
    purchased food as usual, and their night march began, the boundary
   </p>
   <p>
    between Upper and Mid-Wessex being crossed about eight o’clock.
   </p>
   <p>
    To walk across country without much regard to roads was not new to
   </p>
   <p>
    Tess, and she showed her old agility in the performance. The
   </p>
   <p>
    intercepting city, ancient Melchester, they were obliged to pass
   </p>
   <p>
    through in order to take advantage of the town bridge for crossing a
   </p>
   <p>
    large river that obstructed them. It was about midnight when they went
   </p>
   <p>
    along the deserted streets, lighted fitfully by the few lamps, keeping
   </p>
   <p>
    off the pavement that it might not echo their footsteps. The graceful
   </p>
   <p>
    pile of cathedral architecture rose dimly on their left hand, but it
   </p>
   <p>
    was lost upon them now. Once out of the town they followed the
   </p>
   <p>
    turnpike-road, which after a few miles plunged across an open plain.
   </p>
   <p>
    Though the sky was dense with cloud, a diffused light from some
   </p>
   <p>
    fragment of a moon had hitherto helped them a little. But the moon had
   </p>
   <p>
    now sunk, the clouds seemed to settle almost on their heads, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    night grew as dark as a cave. However, they found their way along,
   </p>
   <p>
    keeping as much on the turf as possible that their tread might not
   </p>
   <p>
    resound, which it was easy to do, there being no hedge or fence of any
   </p>
   <p>
    kind. All around was open loneliness and black solitude, over which a
   </p>
   <p>
    stiff breeze blew.
   </p>
   <p>
    They had proceeded thus gropingly two or three miles further when on a
   </p>
   <p>
    sudden Clare became conscious of some vast erection close in his front,
   </p>
   <p>
    rising sheer from the grass. They had almost struck themselves against
   </p>
   <p>
    it.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What monstrous place is this?” said Angel.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It hums,” said she. “Hearken!”
   </p>
   <p>
    He listened. The wind, playing upon the edifice, produced a booming
   </p>
   <p>
    tune, like the note of some gigantic one-stringed harp. No other sound
   </p>
   <p>
    came from it, and lifting his hand and advancing a step or two, Clare
   </p>
   <p>
    felt the vertical surface of the structure. It seemed to be of solid
   </p>
   <p>
    stone, without joint or moulding. Carrying his fingers onward he found
   </p>
   <p>
    that what he had come in contact with was a colossal rectangular
   </p>
   <p>
    pillar; by stretching out his left hand he could feel a similar one
   </p>
   <p>
    adjoining. At an indefinite height overhead something made the black
   </p>
   <p>
    sky blacker, which had the semblance of a vast architrave uniting the
   </p>
   <p>
    pillars horizontally. They carefully entered beneath and between; the
   </p>
   <p>
    surfaces echoed their soft rustle; but they seemed to be still out of
   </p>
   <p>
    doors. The place was roofless. Tess drew her breath fearfully, and
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel, perplexed, said—
   </p>
   <p>
    “What can it be?”
   </p>
   <p>
    Feeling sideways they encountered another tower-like pillar, square and
   </p>
   <p>
    uncompromising as the first; beyond it another and another. The place
   </p>
   <p>
    was all doors and pillars, some connected above by continuous
   </p>
   <p>
    architraves.
   </p>
   <p>
    “A very Temple of the Winds,” he said.
   </p>
   <p>
    The next pillar was isolated; others composed a trilithon; others were
   </p>
   <p>
    prostrate, their flanks forming a causeway wide enough for a carriage;
   </p>
   <p>
    and it was soon obvious that they made up a forest of monoliths grouped
   </p>
   <p>
    upon the grassy expanse of the plain. The couple advanced further into
   </p>
   <p>
    this pavilion of the night till they stood in its midst.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It is Stonehenge!” said Clare.
   </p>
   <p>
    “The heathen temple, you mean?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes. Older than the centuries; older than the d’Urbervilles! Well,
   </p>
   <p>
    what shall we do, darling? We may find shelter further on.”
   </p>
   <p>
    But Tess, really tired by this time, flung herself upon an oblong slab
   </p>
   <p>
    that lay close at hand, and was sheltered from the wind by a pillar.
   </p>
   <p>
    Owing to the action of the sun during the preceding day, the stone was
   </p>
   <p>
    warm and dry, in comforting contrast to the rough and chill grass
   </p>
   <p>
    around, which had damped her skirts and shoes.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I don’t want to go any further, Angel,” she said, stretching out her
   </p>
   <p>
    hand for his. “Can’t we bide here?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I fear not. This spot is visible for miles by day, although it does
   </p>
   <p>
    not seem so now.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “One of my mother’s people was a shepherd hereabouts, now I think of
   </p>
   <p>
    it. And you used to say at Talbothays that I was a heathen. So now I am
   </p>
   <p>
    at home.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He knelt down beside her outstretched form, and put his lips upon hers.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Sleepy are you, dear? I think you are lying on an altar.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I like very much to be here,” she murmured. “It is so solemn and
   </p>
   <p>
    lonely—after my great happiness—with nothing but the sky above my face.
   </p>
   <p>
    It seems as if there were no folk in the world but we two; and I wish
   </p>
   <p>
    there were not—except ’Liza-Lu.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Clare though she might as well rest here till it should get a little
   </p>
   <p>
    lighter, and he flung his overcoat upon her, and sat down by her side.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Angel, if anything happens to me, will you watch over ’Liza-Lu for my
   </p>
   <p>
    sake?” she asked, when they had listened a long time to the wind among
   </p>
   <p>
    the pillars.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I will.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “She is so good and simple and pure. O, Angel—I wish you would marry
   </p>
   <p>
    her if you lose me, as you will do shortly. O, if you would!”
   </p>
   <p>
    “If I lose you I lose all! And she is my sister-in-law.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “That’s nothing, dearest. People marry sister-laws continually about
   </p>
   <p>
    Marlott; and ’Liza-Lu is so gentle and sweet, and she is growing so
   </p>
   <p>
    beautiful. O, I could share you with her willingly when we are spirits!
   </p>
   <p>
    If you would train her and teach her, Angel, and bring her up for your
   </p>
   <p>
    own self!... She had all the best of me without the bad of me; and if
   </p>
   <p>
    she were to become yours it would almost seem as if death had not
   </p>
   <p>
    divided us... Well, I have said it. I won’t mention it again.”
   </p>
   <p>
    She ceased, and he fell into thought. In the far north-east sky he
   </p>
   <p>
    could see between the pillars a level streak of light. The uniform
   </p>
   <p>
    concavity of black cloud was lifting bodily like the lid of a pot,
   </p>
   <p>
    letting in at the earth’s edge the coming day, against which the
   </p>
   <p>
    towering monoliths and trilithons began to be blackly defined.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Did they sacrifice to God here?” asked she.
   </p>
   <p>
    “No,” said he.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Who to?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “I believe to the sun. That lofty stone set away by itself is in the
   </p>
   <p>
    direction of the sun, which will presently rise behind it.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “This reminds me, dear,” she said. “You remember you never would
   </p>
   <p>
    interfere with any belief of mine before we were married? But I knew
   </p>
   <p>
    your mind all the same, and I thought as you thought—not from any
   </p>
   <p>
    reasons of my own, but because you thought so. Tell me now, Angel, do
   </p>
   <p>
    you think we shall meet again after we are dead? I want to know.”
   </p>
   <p>
    He kissed her to avoid a reply at such a time.
   </p>
   <p>
    “O, Angel—I fear that means no!” said she, with a suppressed sob. “And
   </p>
   <p>
    I wanted so to see you again—so much, so much! What—not even you and I,
   </p>
   <p>
    Angel, who love each other so well?”
   </p>
   <p>
    Like a greater than himself, to the critical question at the critical
   </p>
   <p>
    time he did not answer; and they were again silent. In a minute or two
   </p>
   <p>
    her breathing became more regular, her clasp of his hand relaxed, and
   </p>
   <p>
    she fell asleep. The band of silver paleness along the east horizon
   </p>
   <p>
    made even the distant parts of the Great Plain appear dark and near;
   </p>
   <p>
    and the whole enormous landscape bore that impress of reserve,
   </p>
   <p>
    taciturnity, and hesitation which is usual just before day. The
   </p>
   <p>
    eastward pillars and their architraves stood up blackly against the
   </p>
   <p>
    light, and the great flame-shaped Sun-stone beyond them; and the Stone
   </p>
   <p>
    of Sacrifice midway. Presently the night wind died out, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    quivering little pools in the cup-like hollows of the stones lay still.
   </p>
   <p>
    At the same time something seemed to move on the verge of the dip
   </p>
   <p>
    eastward—a mere dot. It was the head of a man approaching them from the
   </p>
   <p>
    hollow beyond the Sun-stone. Clare wished they had gone onward, but in
   </p>
   <p>
    the circumstances decided to remain quiet. The figure came straight
   </p>
   <p>
    towards the circle of pillars in which they were.
   </p>
   <p>
    He heard something behind him, the brush of feet. Turning, he saw over
   </p>
   <p>
    the prostrate columns another figure; then before he was aware, another
   </p>
   <p>
    was at hand on the right, under a trilithon, and another on the left.
   </p>
   <p>
    The dawn shone full on the front of the man westward, and Clare could
   </p>
   <p>
    discern from this that he was tall, and walked as if trained. They all
   </p>
   <p>
    closed in with evident purpose. Her story then was true! Springing to
   </p>
   <p>
    his feet, he looked around for a weapon, loose stone, means of escape,
   </p>
   <p>
    anything. By this time the nearest man was upon him.
   </p>
   <p>
    “It is no use, sir,” he said. “There are sixteen of us on the Plain,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the whole country is reared.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Let her finish her sleep!” he implored in a whisper of the men as they
   </p>
   <p>
    gathered round.
   </p>
   <p>
    When they saw where she lay, which they had not done till then, they
   </p>
   <p>
    showed no objection, and stood watching her, as still as the pillars
   </p>
   <p>
    around. He went to the stone and bent over her, holding one poor little
   </p>
   <p>
    hand; her breathing now was quick and small, like that of a lesser
   </p>
   <p>
    creature than a woman. All waited in the growing light, their faces and
   </p>
   <p>
    hands as if they were silvered, the remainder of their figures dark,
   </p>
   <p>
    the stones glistening green-gray, the Plain still a mass of shade. Soon
   </p>
   <p>
    the light was strong, and a ray shone upon her unconscious form,
   </p>
   <p>
    peering under her eyelids and waking her.
   </p>
   <p>
    “What is it, Angel?” she said, starting up. “Have they come for me?”
   </p>
   <p>
    “Yes, dearest,” he said. “They have come.”
   </p>
   <p>
    “It is as it should be,” she murmured. “Angel, I am almost glad—yes,
   </p>
   <p>
    glad! This happiness could not have lasted. It was too much. I have had
   </p>
   <p>
    enough; and now I shall not live for you to despise me!”
   </p>
   <p>
    She stood up, shook herself, and went forward, neither of the men
   </p>
   <p>
    having moved.
   </p>
   <p>
    “I am ready,” she said quietly.
   </p>
   <p>
    LIX
   </p>
   <p>
    The city of Wintoncester, that fine old city, aforetime capital of
   </p>
   <p>
    Wessex, lay amidst its convex and concave downlands in all the
   </p>
   <p>
    brightness and warmth of a July morning. The gabled brick, tile, and
   </p>
   <p>
    freestone houses had almost dried off for the season their integument
   </p>
   <p>
    of lichen, the streams in the meadows were low, and in the sloping High
   </p>
   <p>
    Street, from the West Gateway to the mediæval cross, and from the
   </p>
   <p>
    mediæval cross to the bridge, that leisurely dusting and sweeping was
   </p>
   <p>
    in progress which usually ushers in an old-fashioned market-day.
   </p>
   <p>
    From the western gate aforesaid the highway, as every Wintoncestrian
   </p>
   <p>
    knows, ascends a long and regular incline of the exact length of a
   </p>
   <p>
    measured mile, leaving the houses gradually behind. Up this road from
   </p>
   <p>
    the precincts of the city two persons were walking rapidly, as if
   </p>
   <p>
    unconscious of the trying ascent—unconscious through preoccupation and
   </p>
   <p>
    not through buoyancy. They had emerged upon this road through a narrow,
   </p>
   <p>
    barred wicket in a high wall a little lower down. They seemed anxious
   </p>
   <p>
    to get out of the sight of the houses and of their kind, and this road
   </p>
   <p>
    appeared to offer the quickest means of doing so. Though they were
   </p>
   <p>
    young, they walked with bowed heads, which gait of grief the sun’s rays
   </p>
   <p>
    smiled on pitilessly.
   </p>
   <p>
    One of the pair was Angel Clare, the other a tall budding creature—half
   </p>
   <p>
    girl, half woman—a spiritualized image of Tess, slighter than she, but
   </p>
   <p>
    with the same beautiful eyes—Clare’s sister-in-law, ’Liza-Lu. Their
   </p>
   <p>
    pale faces seemed to have shrunk to half their natural size. They moved
   </p>
   <p>
    on hand in hand, and never spoke a word, the drooping of their heads
   </p>
   <p>
    being that of Giotto’s “Two Apostles”.
   </p>
   <p>
    When they had nearly reached the top of the great West Hill the clocks
   </p>
   <p>
    in the town struck eight. Each gave a start at the notes, and, walking
   </p>
   <p>
    onward yet a few steps, they reached the first milestone, standing
   </p>
   <p>
    whitely on the green margin of the grass, and backed by the down, which
   </p>
   <p>
    here was open to the road. They entered upon the turf, and, impelled by
   </p>
   <p>
    a force that seemed to overrule their will, suddenly stood still,
   </p>
   <p>
    turned, and waited in paralyzed suspense beside the stone.
   </p>
   <p>
    The prospect from this summit was almost unlimited. In the valley
   </p>
   <p>
    beneath lay the city they had just left, its more prominent buildings
   </p>
   <p>
    showing as in an isometric drawing—among them the broad cathedral
   </p>
   <p>
    tower, with its Norman windows and immense length of aisle and nave,
   </p>
   <p>
    the spires of St Thomas’s, the pinnacled tower of the College, and,
   </p>
   <p>
    more to the right, the tower and gables of the ancient hospice, where
   </p>
   <p>
    to this day the pilgrim may receive his dole of bread and ale. Behind
   </p>
   <p>
    the city swept the rotund upland of St Catherine’s Hill; further off,
   </p>
   <p>
    landscape beyond landscape, till the horizon was lost in the radiance
   </p>
   <p>
    of the sun hanging above it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Against these far stretches of country rose, in front of the other city
   </p>
   <p>
    edifices, a large red-brick building, with level gray roofs, and rows
   </p>
   <p>
    of short barred windows bespeaking captivity, the whole contrasting
   </p>
   <p>
    greatly by its formalism with the quaint irregularities of the Gothic
   </p>
   <p>
    erections. It was somewhat disguised from the road in passing it by
   </p>
   <p>
    yews and evergreen oaks, but it was visible enough up here. The wicket
   </p>
   <p>
    from which the pair had lately emerged was in the wall of this
   </p>
   <p>
    structure. From the middle of the building an ugly flat-topped
   </p>
   <p>
    octagonal tower ascended against the east horizon, and viewed from this
   </p>
   <p>
    spot, on its shady side and against the light, it seemed the one blot
   </p>
   <p>
    on the city’s beauty. Yet it was with this blot, and not with the
   </p>
   <p>
    beauty, that the two gazers were concerned.
   </p>
   <p>
    Upon the cornice of the tower a tall staff was fixed. Their eyes were
   </p>
   <p>
    riveted on it. A few minutes after the hour had struck something moved
   </p>
   <p>
    slowly up the staff, and extended itself upon the breeze. It was a
   </p>
   <p>
    black flag.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Justice” was done, and the President of the Immortals, in Æschylean
   </p>
   <p>
    phrase, had ended his sport with Tess. And the d’Urberville knights and
   </p>
   <p>
    dames slept on in their tombs unknowing. The two speechless gazers bent
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves down to the earth, as if in prayer, and remained thus a long
   </p>
   <p>
    time, absolutely motionless: the flag continued to wave silently. As
   </p>
   <p>
    soon as they had strength, they arose, joined hands again, and went on.
