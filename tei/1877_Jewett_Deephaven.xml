   <p>
    Kate Lancaster's Plan
   </p>
   <p>
    I had been spending the winter in Boston, and Kate Lancaster and I had
   </p>
   <p>
    been together a great deal, for we are the best of friends. It happened
   </p>
   <p>
    that the morning when this story begins I had waked up feeling sorry,
   </p>
   <p>
    and as if something dreadful were going to happen. There did not seem to
   </p>
   <p>
    be any good reason for it, so I undertook to discourage myself more by
   </p>
   <p>
    thinking that it would soon be time to leave town, and how much I should
   </p>
   <p>
    miss being with Kate and my other friends. My mind was still disquieted
   </p>
   <p>
    when I went down to breakfast; but beside my plate I found, with a
   </p>
   <p>
    hoped-for letter from my father, a note from Kate. To this day I have
   </p>
   <p>
    never known any explanation of that depression of my spirits, and I hope
   </p>
   <p>
    that the good luck which followed will help some reader to lose fear,
   </p>
   <p>
    and to smile at such shadows if any chance to come.
   </p>
   <p>
    Kate had evidently written to me in an excited state of mind, for her
   </p>
   <p>
    note was not so trig-looking as usual; but this is what she said:--
   </p>
   <p>
    Dear Helen,--I have a plan--I think it a most delightful plan--in
   </p>
   <p>
    which you and I are chief characters. Promise that you will say
   </p>
   <p>
    yes; if you do not you will have to remember all your life that you
   </p>
   <p>
    broke a girl's heart. Come round early, and lunch with me and dine
   </p>
   <p>
    with me. I'm to be all alone, and it's a long story and will need a
   </p>
   <p>
    great deal of talking over.
   </p>
   <p>
    K.
   </p>
   <p>
    I showed this note to my aunt, and soon went round, very much
   </p>
   <p>
    interested. My latch-key opened the Lancasters' door, and I hurried to
   </p>
   <p>
    the parlor, where I heard my friend practising with great diligence. I
   </p>
   <p>
    went up to her, and she turned her head and kissed me solemnly. You need
   </p>
   <p>
    not smile; we are not sentimental girls, and are both much averse to
   </p>
   <p>
    indiscriminate kissing, though I have not the adroit habit of shying in
   </p>
   <p>
    which Kate is proficient. It would sometimes be impolite in any one
   </p>
   <p>
    else, but she shies so affectionately.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Won't you sit down, dear?" she said, with great ceremony, and went on
   </p>
   <p>
    with her playing, which was abominable that morning; her fingers stepped
   </p>
   <p>
    on each other, and, whatever the tune might have been in reality, it
   </p>
   <p>
    certainly had a most remarkable incoherence as I heard it then. I took
   </p>
   <p>
    up the new Littell and made believe read it, and finally threw it at
   </p>
   <p>
    Kate; you would have thought we were two children.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Have you heard that my grand-aunt, Miss Katharine Brandon of Deephaven,
   </p>
   <p>
    is dead?" I knew that she had died in November, at least six months
   </p>
   <p>
    before.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Don't be nonsensical, Kate!" said I. "What is it you are going to tell
   </p>
   <p>
    me?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "My grand-aunt died very old, and was the last of her generation. She
   </p>
   <p>
    had a sister and three brothers, one of whom had the honor of being my
   </p>
   <p>
    grandfather. Mamma is sole heir to the family estates in Deephaven,
   </p>
   <p>
    wharf-property and all, and it is a great inconvenience to her. The
   </p>
   <p>
    house is a charming old house, and some of my ancestors who followed the
   </p>
   <p>
    sea brought home the greater part of its furnishings. Miss Katharine was
   </p>
   <p>
    a person who ignored all frivolities, and her house was as sedate as
   </p>
   <p>
    herself. I have been there but little, for when I was a child my aunt
   </p>
   <p>
    found no pleasure in the society of noisy children who upset her
   </p>
   <p>
    treasures, and when I was older she did not care to see strangers, and
   </p>
   <p>
    after I left school she grew more and more feeble; I had not been there
   </p>
   <p>
    for two years when she died. Mamma went down very often. The town is a
   </p>
   <p>
    quaint old place which has seen better days. There are high rocks at the
   </p>
   <p>
    shore, and there is a beach, and there are woods inland, and hills, and
   </p>
   <p>
    there is the sea. It might be dull in Deephaven for two young ladies who
   </p>
   <p>
    were fond of gay society and dependent upon excitement, I suppose; but
   </p>
   <p>
    for two little girls who were fond of each other and could play in the
   </p>
   <p>
    boats, and dig and build houses in the sea-sand, and gather shells, and
   </p>
   <p>
    carry their dolls wherever they went, what could be pleasanter?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Nothing," said I, promptly.
   </p>
   <p>
    Kate had told this a little at a time, with a few appropriate bars of
   </p>
   <p>
    music between, which suddenly reminded me of the story of a Chinese
   </p>
   <p>
    procession which I had read in one of Marryat's novels when I was a
   </p>
   <p>
    child: "A thousand white elephants richly caparisoned,--ti-tum
   </p>
   <p>
    tilly-lily," and so on, for a page or two. She seemed to have finished
   </p>
   <p>
    her story for that time, and while it was dawning upon me what she
   </p>
   <p>
    meant, she sang a bit from one of Jean Ingelow's verses:--
   </p>
   <p>
    "Will ye step aboard, my dearest,
   </p>
   <p>
    For the high seas lie before us?"
   </p>
   <p>
    and then came over to sit beside me and tell the whole story in a more
   </p>
   <p>
    sensible fashion.
   </p>
   <p>
    "You know that my father has been meaning to go to England in the
   </p>
   <p>
    autumn? Yesterday he told us that he is to leave in a month and will be
   </p>
   <p>
    away all summer, and mamma is going with him. Jack and Willy are to join
   </p>
   <p>
    a party of their classmates who are to spend nearly the whole of the
   </p>
   <p>
    long vacation at Lake Superior. I don't care to go abroad again now, and
   </p>
   <p>
    I did not like any plan that was proposed to me. Aunt Anna was here all
   </p>
   <p>
    the afternoon, and she is going to take the house at Newport, which is
   </p>
   <p>
    very pleasant and unexpected, for she hates housekeeping. Mamma thought
   </p>
   <p>
    of course that I would go with her, but I did not wish to do that, and
   </p>
   <p>
    it would only result in my keeping house for her visitors, whom I know
   </p>
   <p>
    very little; and she will be much more free and independent by herself.
   </p>
   <p>
    Beside, she can have my room if I am not there. I have promised to make
   </p>
   <p>
    her a long visit in Baltimore next winter instead. I told mamma that I
   </p>
   <p>
    should like to stay here and go away when I choose. There are ever so
   </p>
   <p>
    many visits which I have promised; I could stay with you and your Aunt
   </p>
   <p>
    Mary at Lenox if she goes there, for a while, and I have always wished
   </p>
   <p>
    to spend a summer in town; but mamma did not encourage that at all. In
   </p>
   <p>
    the evening papa gave her a letter which had come from Mr. Dockum, the
   </p>
   <p>
    man who takes care of Aunt Katharine's place, and the most charming idea
   </p>
   <p>
    came into my head, and I said I meant to spend my summer in Deephaven.
   </p>
   <p>
    "At first they laughed at me, and then they said I might go if I chose,
   </p>
   <p>
    and at last they thought nothing could be pleasanter, and mamma wishes
   </p>
   <p>
    she were going herself. I asked if she did not think you would be the
   </p>
   <p>
    best person to keep me company, and she does, and papa announced that he
   </p>
   <p>
    was just going to suggest my asking you. I am to take Ann and Maggie,
   </p>
   <p>
    who will be overjoyed, for they came from that part of the country, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the other servants are to go with Aunt Anna, and old Nora will come to
   </p>
   <p>
    take care of this house, as she always does. Perhaps you and I will come
   </p>
   <p>
    up to town once in a while for a few days. We shall have such jolly
   </p>
   <p>
    housekeeping. Mamma and I sat up very late last night, and everything is
   </p>
   <p>
    planned. Mr. Dockum's house is very near Aunt Katharine's, so we shall
   </p>
   <p>
    not be lonely; though I know you're no more afraid of that than I. O
   </p>
   <p>
    Helen, won't you go?"
   </p>
   <p>
    Do you think it took me long to decide?
   </p>
   <p>
    Mr. and Mrs. Lancaster sailed the 10th of June, and my Aunt Mary went to
   </p>
   <p>
    spend her summer among the Berkshire Hills, so I was at the Lancasters'
   </p>
   <p>
    ready to welcome Kate when she came home, after having said good by to
   </p>
   <p>
    her father and mother. We meant to go to Deephaven in a week, but were
   </p>
   <p>
    obliged to stay in town longer. Boston was nearly deserted of our
   </p>
   <p>
    friends at the last, and we used to take quiet walks in the cool of the
   </p>
   <p>
    evening after dinner, up and down the street, or sit on the front steps
   </p>
   <p>
    in company with the servants left in charge of the other houses, who
   </p>
   <p>
    also sometimes walked up and down and looked at us wonderingly. We had
   </p>
   <p>
    much shopping to do in the daytime, for there was a probability of our
   </p>
   <p>
    spending many days in doors, and as we were not to be near any large
   </p>
   <p>
    town, and did not mean to come to Boston for weeks at least, there was a
   </p>
   <p>
    great deal to be remembered and arranged. We enjoyed making our plans,
   </p>
   <p>
    and deciding what we should want, and going to the shops together. I
   </p>
   <p>
    think we felt most important the day we conferred with Ann and made out
   </p>
   <p>
    a list of the provisions which must be ordered. This was being
   </p>
   <p>
    housekeepers in earnest. Mr. Dockum happened to come to town, and we
   </p>
   <p>
    sent Ann and Maggie, with most of our boxes, to Deephaven in his company
   </p>
   <p>
    a day or two before we were ready to go ourselves, and when we reached
   </p>
   <p>
    there the house was opened and in order for us.
   </p>
   <p>
    On our journey to Deephaven we left the railway twelve miles from that
   </p>
   <p>
    place, and took passage in a stage-coach. There was only one passenger
   </p>
   <p>
    beside ourselves. She was a very large, thin, weather-beaten woman, and
   </p>
   <p>
    looked so tired and lonesome and good-natured, that I could not help
   </p>
   <p>
    saying it was very dusty; and she was apparently delighted to answer
   </p>
   <p>
    that she should think everybody was sweeping, and she always felt, after
   </p>
   <p>
    being in the cars a while, as if she had been taken all to pieces and
   </p>
   <p>
    left in the different places. And this was the beginning of our
   </p>
   <p>
    friendship with Mrs. Kew.
   </p>
   <p>
    After this conversation we looked industriously out of the window into
   </p>
   <p>
    the pastures and pine-woods. I had given up my seat to her, for I do not
   </p>
   <p>
    mind riding backward in the least, and you would have thought I had done
   </p>
   <p>
    her the greatest favor of her life. I think she was the most grateful of
   </p>
   <p>
    women, and I was often reminded of a remark one of my friends once made
   </p>
   <p>
    about some one: "If you give Bessie a half-sheet of letter-paper, she
   </p>
   <p>
    behaves to you as if it were the most exquisite of presents!" Kate and I
   </p>
   <p>
    had some fruit left in our lunch-basket, and divided it with Mrs. Kew,
   </p>
   <p>
    but after the first mouthful we looked at each other in dismay. "Lemons
   </p>
   <p>
    with oranges' clothes on, aren't they?" said she, as Kate threw hers out
   </p>
   <p>
    of the window, and mine went after it for company; and after this we
   </p>
   <p>
    began to be very friendly indeed. We both liked the odd woman, there was
   </p>
   <p>
    something so straightforward and kindly about her.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Are you going to Deephaven, dear?" she asked me, and then: "I wonder if
   </p>
   <p>
    you are going to stay long? All summer? Well, that's clever! I do hope
   </p>
   <p>
    you will come out to the Light to see me; young folks 'most always like
   </p>
   <p>
    my place. Most likely your friends will fetch you."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Do you know the Brandon house?" asked Kate.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Well as I do the meeting-house. There! I wonder I didn't know from the
   </p>
   <p>
    beginning, but I have been a trying all the way to settle it who you
   </p>
   <p>
    could be. I've been up country some weeks, stopping with my mother, and
   </p>
   <p>
    she seemed so set to have me stay till strawberry-time, and would hardly
   </p>
   <p>
    let me come now. You see she's getting to be old; why, every time I've
   </p>
   <p>
    come away for fifteen years she's said it was the last time I'd ever see
   </p>
   <p>
    her, but she's a dreadful smart woman of her age. 'He' wrote me some o'
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs. Lancaster's folks were going to take the Brandon house this summer;
   </p>
   <p>
    and so you are the ones? It's a sightly old place; I used to go and see
   </p>
   <p>
    Miss Katharine. She must have left a power of china-ware. She set a
   </p>
   <p>
    great deal by the house, and she kept everything just as it used to be
   </p>
   <p>
    in her mother's day."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Then you live in Deephaven too?" asked Kate.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I've been here the better part of my life. I was raised up among the
   </p>
   <p>
    hills in Vermont, and I shall always be a real up-country woman if I
   </p>
   <p>
    live here a hundred years. The sea doesn't come natural to me, it kind
   </p>
   <p>
    of worries me, though you won't find a happier woman than I be, 'long
   </p>
   <p>
    shore. When I was first married 'he' had a schooner and went to the
   </p>
   <p>
    banks, and once he was off on a whaling voyage, and I hope I may never
   </p>
   <p>
    come to so long a three years as those were again, though I was up to
   </p>
   <p>
    mother's. Before I was married he had been 'most everywhere. When he
   </p>
   <p>
    came home that time from whaling, he found I'd taken it so to heart that
   </p>
   <p>
    he said he'd never go off again, and then he got the chance to keep
   </p>
   <p>
    Deephaven Light, and we've lived there seventeen years come January.
   </p>
   <p>
    There isn't great pay, but then nobody tries to get it away from us, and
   </p>
   <p>
    we've got so's to be contented, if it is lonesome in winter."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Do you really live in the lighthouse? I remember how I used to beg to
   </p>
   <p>
    be taken out there when I was a child, and how I used to watch for the
   </p>
   <p>
    light at night," said Kate, enthusiastically.
   </p>
   <p>
    So began a friendship which we both still treasure, for knowing Mrs. Kew
   </p>
   <p>
    was one of the pleasantest things which happened to us in that
   </p>
   <p>
    delightful summer, and she used to do so much for our pleasure, and was
   </p>
   <p>
    so good to us. When we went out to the lighthouse for the last time to
   </p>
   <p>
    say good by, we were very sorry girls indeed. We had no idea until then
   </p>
   <p>
    how much she cared for us, and her affection touched us very much. She
   </p>
   <p>
    told us that she loved us as if we belonged to her, and begged us not to
   </p>
   <p>
    forget her,--as if we ever could!--and to remember that there was always
   </p>
   <p>
    a home and a warm heart for us if she were alive. Kate and I have often
   </p>
   <p>
    agreed that few of our acquaintances are half so entertaining. Her
   </p>
   <p>
    comparisons were most striking and amusing, and her comments upon the
   </p>
   <p>
    books she read--for she was a great reader--were very shrewd and clever,
   </p>
   <p>
    and always to the point. She was never out of temper, even when the
   </p>
   <p>
    barrels of oil were being rolled across her kitchen floor. And she was
   </p>
   <p>
    such a wise woman! This stage-ride, which we expected to find tiresome,
   </p>
   <p>
    we enjoyed very much, and we were glad to think, when the coach stopped,
   </p>
   <p>
    and "he" came to meet her with great satisfaction, that we had one
   </p>
   <p>
    friend in Deephaven at all events.
   </p>
   <p>
    I liked the house from my very first sight of it. It stood behind a row
   </p>
   <p>
    of poplars which were as green and flourishing as the poplars which
   </p>
   <p>
    stand in stately processions in the fields around Quebec. It was an
   </p>
   <p>
    imposing great white house, and the lilacs were tall, and there were
   </p>
   <p>
    crowds of rose-bushes not yet out of bloom; and there were box borders,
   </p>
   <p>
    and there were great elms at the side of the house and down the road.
   </p>
   <p>
    The hall door stood wide open, and my hostess turned to me as we went
   </p>
   <p>
    in, with one of her sweet, sudden smiles. "Won't we have a good time,
   </p>
   <p>
    Nelly?" said she. And I thought we should.
   </p>
   <p>
    So our summer's housekeeping began in most pleasant fashion. It was just
   </p>
   <p>
    at sunset, and Ann's and Maggie's presence made the house seem familiar
   </p>
   <p>
    at once. Maggie had been unpacking for us, and there was a delicious
   </p>
   <p>
    supper ready for the hungry girls. Later in the evening we went down to
   </p>
   <p>
    the shore, which was not very far away; the fresh sea-air was welcome
   </p>
   <p>
    after the dusty day, and it seemed so quiet and pleasant in Deephaven.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Brandon House and the Lighthouse
   </p>
   <p>
    I do not know that the Brandon house is really very remarkable, but I
   </p>
   <p>
    never have been in one that interested me in the same way. Kate used to
   </p>
   <p>
    recount to select audiences at school some of her experiences with her
   </p>
   <p>
    Aunt Katharine, and it was popularly believed that she once carried down
   </p>
   <p>
    some indestructible picture-books when they were first in fashion, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the old lady basted them for her to hem round the edges at the rate of
   </p>
   <p>
    two a day. It may have been fabulous. It was impossible to imagine any
   </p>
   <p>
    children in the old place; everything was for grown people; even the
   </p>
   <p>
    stair-railing was too high to slide down on. The chairs looked as if
   </p>
   <p>
    they had been put, at the furnishing of the house, in their places, and
   </p>
   <p>
    there they meant to remain. The carpets were particularly interesting,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I remember Kate's pointing out to me one day a great square figure
   </p>
   <p>
    in one, and telling me she used to keep house there with her dolls for
   </p>
   <p>
    lack of a better play-house, and if one of them chanced to fall outside
   </p>
   <p>
    the boundary stripe, it was immediately put to bed with a cold. It is a
   </p>
   <p>
    house with great possibilities; it might easily be made charming. There
   </p>
   <p>
    are four very large rooms on the lower floor, and six above, a wide hall
   </p>
   <p>
    in each story, and a fascinating garret over the whole, where were many
   </p>
   <p>
    mysterious old chests and boxes, in one of which we found Kate's
   </p>
   <p>
    grandmother's love-letters; and you may be sure the vista of rummages
   </p>
   <p>
    which Mr. Lancaster had laughed about was explored to its very end. The
   </p>
   <p>
    rooms all have elaborate cornices, and the lower hall is very fine, with
   </p>
   <p>
    an archway dividing it, and panellings of all sorts, and a great door at
   </p>
   <p>
    each end, through which the lilacs in front and the old pensioner
   </p>
   <p>
    plum-trees in the garden are seen exchanging bows and gestures. Coming
   </p>
   <p>
    from the Lancasters' high city house, it did not seem as if we had to go
   </p>
   <p>
    up stairs at all there, for every step of the stairway is so broad and
   </p>
   <p>
    low, and you come half-way to a square landing with an old
   </p>
   <p>
    straight-backed chair in each farther corner; and between them a large,
   </p>
   <p>
    round-topped window, with a cushioned seat, looking out on the garden
   </p>
   <p>
    and the village, the hills far inland, and the sunset beyond all. Then
   </p>
   <p>
    you turn and go up a few more steps to the upper hall, where we used to
   </p>
   <p>
    stay a great deal. There were more old chairs and a pair of remarkable
   </p>
   <p>
    sofas, on which we used to deposit the treasures collected in our
   </p>
   <p>
    wanderings. The wide window which looks out on the lilacs and the sea
   </p>
   <p>
    was a favorite seat of ours. Facing each other on either side of it are
   </p>
   <p>
    two old secretaries, and one of them we ascertained to be the
   </p>
   <p>
    hiding-place of secret drawers, in which may be found valuable records
   </p>
   <p>
    deposited by ourselves one rainy day when we first explored it. We
   </p>
   <p>
    wrote, between us, a tragic "journal" on some yellow old letter-paper we
   </p>
   <p>
    found in the desk. We put it in the most hidden drawer by itself, and
   </p>
   <p>
    flatter ourselves that it will be regarded with great interest some time
   </p>
   <p>
    or other. Of one of the front rooms, "the best chamber," we stood rather
   </p>
   <p>
    in dread. It is very remarkable that there seem to be no ghost-stories
   </p>
   <p>
    connected with any part of the house, particularly this. We are neither
   </p>
   <p>
    of us nervous; but there is certainly something dismal about the room.
   </p>
   <p>
    The huge curtained bed and immense easy-chairs, windows, and everything
   </p>
   <p>
    were draped in some old-fashioned kind of white cloth which always
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed to be waving and moving about of itself. The carpet was most
   </p>
   <p>
    singularly colored with dark reds and indescribable grays and browns,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the pattern, after a whole summer's study, could never be followed
   </p>
   <p>
    with one's eye. The paper was captured in a French prize somewhere some
   </p>
   <p>
    time in the last century, and part of the figure was shaggy, and therein
   </p>
   <p>
    little spiders found habitation, and went visiting their acquaintances
   </p>
   <p>
    across the shiny places. The color was an unearthly pink and a
   </p>
   <p>
    forbidding maroon, with dim white spots, which gave it the appearance of
   </p>
   <p>
    having moulded. It made you low-spirited to look long in the mirror; and
   </p>
   <p>
    the great lounge one could not have cheerful associations with, after
   </p>
   <p>
    hearing that Miss Brandon herself did not like it, having seen so many
   </p>
   <p>
    of her relatives lie there dead. There were fantastic china ornaments
   </p>
   <p>
    from Bible subjects on the mantel, and the only picture was one of the
   </p>
   <p>
    Maid of Orleans tied with an unnecessarily strong rope to a very stout
   </p>
   <p>
    stake. The best parlor we also rarely used, because all the portraits
   </p>
   <p>
    which hung there had for some unaccountable reason taken a violent
   </p>
   <p>
    dislike to us, and followed us suspiciously with their eyes. The
   </p>
   <p>
    furniture was stately and very uncomfortable, and there was something
   </p>
   <p>
    about the room which suggested an invisible funeral.
   </p>
   <p>
    There is not very much to say about the dining-room. It was not
   </p>
   <p>
    specially interesting, though the sea was in sight from one of the
   </p>
   <p>
    windows. There were some old Dutch pictures on the wall, so dark that
   </p>
   <p>
    one could scarcely make out what they were meant to represent, and one
   </p>
   <p>
    or two engravings. There was a huge sideboard, for which Kate had
   </p>
   <p>
    brought down from Boston Miss Brandon's own silver which had stood there
   </p>
   <p>
    for so many years, and looked so much more at home and in place than any
   </p>
   <p>
    other possibly could have looked, and Kate also found in the closet the
   </p>
   <p>
    three great decanters with silver labels chained round their necks,
   </p>
   <p>
    which had always been the companions of the tea-service in her aunt's
   </p>
   <p>
    lifetime. From the little closets in the sideboard there came a most
   </p>
   <p>
    significant odor of cake and wine whenever one opened the doors. We used
   </p>
   <p>
    Miss Brandon's beautiful old blue India china which she had given to
   </p>
   <p>
    Kate, and which had been carefully packed all winter. Kate sat at the
   </p>
   <p>
    head and I at the foot of the round table, and I must confess that we
   </p>
   <p>
    were apt to have either a feast or a famine, for at first we often
   </p>
   <p>
    forgot to provide our dinners. If this were the case Maggie was sure to
   </p>
   <p>
    serve us with most derisive elegance, and make us wait for as much
   </p>
   <p>
    ceremony as she thought necessary for one of Mrs. Lancaster's
   </p>
   <p>
    dinner-parties.
   </p>
   <p>
    The west parlor was our favorite room down stairs. It had a great
   </p>
   <p>
    fireplace framed in blue and white Dutch tiles which ingeniously and
   </p>
   <p>
    instructively represented the careers of the good and the bad man; the
   </p>
   <p>
    starting-place of each being a very singular cradle in the centre at the
   </p>
   <p>
    top. The last two of the series are very high art: a great coffin stands
   </p>
   <p>
    in the foreground of each, and the virtuous man is being led off by two
   </p>
   <p>
    disagreeable-looking angels, while the wicked one is hastening from an
   </p>
   <p>
    indescribable but unpleasant assemblage of claws and horns and eyes
   </p>
   <p>
    which is rapidly advancing from the distance, open-mouthed, and bringing
   </p>
   <p>
    a chain with it.
   </p>
   <p>
    There was a large cabinet holding all the small curiosities and
   </p>
   <p>
    knick-knacks there seemed to be no other place for,--odd china figures
   </p>
   <p>
    and cups and vases, unaccountable Chinese carvings and exquisite corals
   </p>
   <p>
    and sea-shells, minerals and Swiss wood-work, and articles of vertu
   </p>
   <p>
    from the South Seas. Underneath were stored boxes of letters and old
   </p>
   <p>
    magazines; for this was one of the houses where nothing seems to have
   </p>
   <p>
    been thrown away. In one parting we found a parcel of old manuscript
   </p>
   <p>
    sermons, the existence of which was a mystery, until Kate remembered
   </p>
   <p>
    there had been a gifted son of the house who entered the ministry and
   </p>
   <p>
    soon died. The windows had each a pane of stained glass, and on the wide
   </p>
   <p>
    sills we used to put our immense bouquets of field-flowers. There was
   </p>
   <p>
    one place which I liked and sat in more than any other. The chimney
   </p>
   <p>
    filled nearly the whole side of the room, all but this little corner,
   </p>
   <p>
    where there was just room for a very comfortable high-backed cushioned
   </p>
   <p>
    chair, and a narrow window where I always had a bunch of fresh green
   </p>
   <p>
    ferns in a tall champagne-glass. I used to write there often, and always
   </p>
   <p>
    sat there when Kate sang and played. She sent for a tuner, and used to
   </p>
   <p>
    successfully coax the long-imprisoned music from the antiquated piano,
   </p>
   <p>
    and sing for her visitors by the hour. She almost always sang her oldest
   </p>
   <p>
    songs, for they seemed most in keeping with everything about us. I used
   </p>
   <p>
    to fancy that the portraits liked our being there. There was one young
   </p>
   <p>
    girl who seemed solitary and forlorn among the rest in the room, who
   </p>
   <p>
    were all middle-aged. For their part they looked amiable, but rather
   </p>
   <p>
    unhappy, as if she had come in and interrupted their conversation. We
   </p>
   <p>
    both grew very fond of her, and it seemed, when we went in the last
   </p>
   <p>
    morning on purpose to take leave of her, as if she looked at us
   </p>
   <p>
    imploringly. She was soon afterward boxed up, and now enjoys society
   </p>
   <p>
    after her own heart in Kate's room in Boston.
   </p>
   <p>
    There was the largest sofa I ever saw opposite the fireplace; it must
   </p>
   <p>
    have been brought in in pieces, and built in the room. It was broad
   </p>
   <p>
    enough for Kate and me to lie on together, and very high and square; but
   </p>
   <p>
    there was a pile of soft cushions at one end. We used to enjoy it
   </p>
   <p>
    greatly in September, when the evenings were long and cool, and we had
   </p>
   <p>
    many candles, and a fire--and crickets too--on the hearth, and the dear
   </p>
   <p>
    dog lying on the rug. I remember one rainy night, just before Miss
   </p>
   <p>
    Tennant and Kitty Bruce went away; we had a real drift-wood fire, and
   </p>
   <p>
    blew out the lights and told stories. Miss Margaret knows so many and
   </p>
   <p>
    tells them so well. Kate and I were unusually entertaining, for we
   </p>
   <p>
    became familiar with the family record of the town, and could recount
   </p>
   <p>
    marvellous adventures by land and sea, and ghost-stories by the dozen.
   </p>
   <p>
    We had never either of us been in a society consisting of so many
   </p>
   <p>
    travelled people! Hardly a man but had been the most of his life at sea.
   </p>
   <p>
    Speaking of ghost-stories, I must tell you that once in the summer two
   </p>
   <p>
    Cambridge girls who were spending a week with us unwisely enticed us
   </p>
   <p>
    into giving some thrilling recitals, which nearly frightened them out of
   </p>
   <p>
    their wits, and Kate and I were finally in terror ourselves. We had all
   </p>
   <p>
    been on the sofa in the dark, singing and talking, and were waiting in
   </p>
   <p>
    great suspense after I had finished one of such particular horror that I
   </p>
   <p>
    declared it should be the last, when we heard footsteps on the hall
   </p>
   <p>
    stairs. There were lights in the dining-room which shone faintly through
   </p>
   <p>
    the half-closed door, and we saw something white and shapeless come
   </p>
   <p>
    slowly down, and clutched each other's gowns in agony. It was only
   </p>
   <p>
    Kate's dog, who came in and laid his head in her lap and slept
   </p>
   <p>
    peacefully. We thought we could not sleep a wink after this, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    bravely went alone out to the light to see my watch, and, finding it was
   </p>
   <p>
    past twelve, we concluded to sit up all night and to go down to the
   </p>
   <p>
    shore at sunrise, it would be so much easier than getting up early some
   </p>
   <p>
    morning. We had been out rowing and had taken a long walk the day
   </p>
   <p>
    before, and were obliged to dance and make other slight exertions to
   </p>
   <p>
    keep ourselves awake at one time. We lunched at two, and I never shall
   </p>
   <p>
    forget the sunrise that morning; but we were singularly quiet and
   </p>
   <p>
    abstracted that day, and indeed for several days after Deephaven was "a
   </p>
   <p>
    land in which it seemed always afternoon," we breakfasted so late.
   </p>
   <p>
    As Mrs. Kew had said, there was "a power of china." Kate and I were
   </p>
   <p>
    convinced that the lives of her grandmothers must have been spent in
   </p>
   <p>
    giving tea-parties. We counted ten sets of cups, beside quantities of
   </p>
   <p>
    stray ones; and some member of the family had evidently devoted her time
   </p>
   <p>
    to making a collection of pitchers.
   </p>
   <p>
    There was an escritoire in Miss Brandon's own room, which we looked over
   </p>
   <p>
    one day. There was a little package of letters; ship letters mostly,
   </p>
   <p>
    tied with a very pale and tired-looking blue ribbon. They were in a
   </p>
   <p>
    drawer with a locket holding a faded miniature on ivory and a lock of
   </p>
   <p>
    brown hair, and there were also some dry twigs and bits of leaf which
   </p>
   <p>
    had long ago been bright wild-roses, such as still bloom among the
   </p>
   <p>
    Deephaven rocks. Kate said that she had often heard her mother wonder
   </p>
   <p>
    why her aunt never had cared to marry, for she had chances enough
   </p>
   <p>
    doubtless, and had been rich and handsome and finely educated. So there
   </p>
   <p>
    was a sailor lover after all, and perhaps he had been lost at sea and
   </p>
   <p>
    she faithfully kept the secret, never mourning outwardly. "And I always
   </p>
   <p>
    thought her the most matter-of-fact old lady," said Kate; "yet here's
   </p>
   <p>
    her romance, after all." We put the letters outside on a chair to read,
   </p>
   <p>
    but afterwards carefully replaced them, without untying them. I'm glad
   </p>
   <p>
    we did. There were other letters which we did read, and which interested
   </p>
   <p>
    us very much,--letters from her girl friends written in the
   </p>
   <p>
    boarding-school vacations, and just after she finished school. Those in
   </p>
   <p>
    one of the smaller packages were charming; it must have been such a
   </p>
   <p>
    bright, nice girl who wrote them! They were very few, and were tied with
   </p>
   <p>
    black ribbon, and marked on the outside in girlish writing: "My dearest
   </p>
   <p>
    friend, Dolly McAllister, died September 3, 1809, aged eighteen." The
   </p>
   <p>
    ribbon had evidently been untied and the letters read many times. One
   </p>
   <p>
    began: "My dear, delightful Kitten: I am quite overjoyed to find my
   </p>
   <p>
    father has business which will force him to go to Deephaven next week,
   </p>
   <p>
    and he kindly says if there be no more rain I may ride with him to see
   </p>
   <p>
    you. I will surely come, for if there is danger of spattering my gown,
   </p>
   <p>
    and he bids me stay at home, I shall go galloping after him and overtake
   </p>
   <p>
    him when it is too late to send me back. I have so much to tell you." I
   </p>
   <p>
    wish I knew more about the visit. Poor Miss Katharine! it made us sad to
   </p>
   <p>
    look over these treasures of her girlhood. There were her compositions
   </p>
   <p>
    and exercise-books; some samplers and queer little keepsakes; withered
   </p>
   <p>
    flowers and some pebbles and other things of like value, with which
   </p>
   <p>
    there was probably some pleasant association. "Only think of her keeping
   </p>
   <p>
    them all her days," said I to Kate. "I am continually throwing some
   </p>
   <p>
    relic of the kind away, because I forget why I have it!"
   </p>
   <p>
    There was a box in the lower part which Kate was glad to find, for she
   </p>
   <p>
    had heard her mother wonder if some such things were not in existence.
   </p>
   <p>
    It held a crucifix and a mass-book and some rosaries, and Kate told me
   </p>
   <p>
    Miss Katharine's youngest and favorite brother had become a Roman
   </p>
   <p>
    Catholic while studying in Europe. It was a dreadful blow to the family;
   </p>
   <p>
    for in those days there could have been few deeper disgraces to the
   </p>
   <p>
    Brandon family than to have one of its sons go over to popery. Only Miss
   </p>
   <p>
    Katharine treated him with kindness, and after a time he disappeared
   </p>
   <p>
    without telling even her where he was going, and was only heard from
   </p>
   <p>
    indirectly once or twice afterward. It was a great grief to her. "And
   </p>
   <p>
    mamma knows," said Kate, "that she always had a lingering hope of his
   </p>
   <p>
    return, for one of the last times she saw Aunt Katharine before she was
   </p>
   <p>
    ill she spoke of soon going to be with all the rest, and said, 'Though
   </p>
   <p>
    your Uncle Henry, dear,'--and stopped and smiled sadly; 'you'll think me
   </p>
   <p>
    a very foolish old woman, but I never quite gave up thinking he might
   </p>
   <p>
    come home.'"

   <p>
    Mrs. Kew did the honors of the lighthouse thoroughly on our first visit;
   </p>
   <p>
    but I think we rarely went to see her that we did not make some
   </p>
   <p>
    entertaining discovery. Mr. Kew's nephew, a guileless youth of forty,
   </p>
   <p>
    lived with them, and the two men were of a mechanical turn and had
   </p>
   <p>
    invented numerous aids to housekeeping,--appendages to the stove, and
   </p>
   <p>
    fixtures on the walls for everything that could be hung up; catches in
   </p>
   <p>
    the floor to hold the doors open, and ingenious apparatus to close them;
   </p>
   <p>
    but, above all, a system of barring and bolting for the wide "fore
   </p>
   <p>
    door," which would have disconcerted an energetic battering-ram. After
   </p>
   <p>
    all this work being expended, Mrs. Kew informed us that it was usually
   </p>
   <p>
    wide open all night in summer weather. On the back of this door I
   </p>
   <p>
    discovered one day a row of marks, and asked their significance. It
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed that Mrs. Kew had attempted one summer to keep count of the
   </p>
   <p>
    number of people who inquired about the depredations of the neighbors'
   </p>
   <p>
    chickens. Mrs. Kew's bedroom was partly devoted to the fine arts. There
   </p>
   <p>
    was a large collection of likenesses of her relatives and friends on the
   </p>
   <p>
    wall, which was interesting in the extreme. Mrs. Kew was always much
   </p>
   <p>
    pleased to tell their names, and her remarks about any feature not
   </p>
   <p>
    exactly perfect were very searching and critical. "That's my oldest
   </p>
   <p>
    brother's wife, Clorinthy Adams that was. She's well featured, if it
   </p>
   <p>
    were not for her nose, and that looks as if it had been thrown at her,
   </p>
   <p>
    and she wasn't particular about having it on firm, in hopes of getting a
   </p>
   <p>
    better one. She sets by her looks, though."
   </p>
   <p>
    There were often sailing-parties that came there from up and down the
   </p>
   <p>
    coast. One day Kate and I were spending the afternoon at the Light; we
   </p>
   <p>
    had been fishing, and were sitting in the doorway listening to a
   </p>
   <p>
    reminiscence of the winter Mrs. Kew kept school at the Four Corners; saw
   </p>
   <p>
    a boatful coming, and all lost our tempers. Mrs. Kew had a lame ankle,
   </p>
   <p>
    and Kate offered to go up with the visitors. There were some girls and
   </p>
   <p>
    young men who stood on the rocks awhile, and then asked us, with much
   </p>
   <p>
    better manners than the people who usually came, if they could see the
   </p>
   <p>
    lighthouse, and Kate led the way. She was dressed that day in a costume
   </p>
   <p>
    we both frequently wore, of gray skirts and blue sailor-jacket, and her
   </p>
   <p>
    boots were much the worse for wear. The celebrated Lancaster complexion
   </p>
   <p>
    was rather darkened by the sun. Mrs. Kew expressed a wish to know what
   </p>
   <p>
    questions they would ask her, and I followed after a few minutes. They
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed to have finished asking about the lantern, and to have become
   </p>
   <p>
    personal.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Don't you get tired staying here?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "No, indeed!" said Kate.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Is that your sister down stairs?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "No, I have no sister."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I should think you would wish she was. Aren't you ever lonesome?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Everybody is, sometimes," said Kate.
   </p>
   <p>
    "But it's such a lonesome place!" said one of the girls. "I should think
   </p>
   <p>
    you would get work away. I live in Boston. Why, it's so awful quiet!
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing but the water, and the wind, when it blows; and I think either
   </p>
   <p>
    of them is worse than nothing. And only this little bit of a rocky
   </p>
   <p>
    place! I should want to go to walk."
   </p>
   <p>
    I heard Kate pleasantly refuse the offer of pay for her services, and
   </p>
   <p>
    then they began to come down the steep stairs laughing and chattering
   </p>
   <p>
    with each other. Kate stayed behind to close the doors and leave
   </p>
   <p>
    everything all right, and the girl who had talked the most waited too,
   </p>
   <p>
    and when they were on the stairs just above me, and the others out of
   </p>
   <p>
    hearing, she said, "You're real good to show us the things. I guess
   </p>
   <p>
    you'll think I'm silly, but I do like you ever so much! I wish you would
   </p>
   <p>
    come to Boston. I'm in a real nice store,--H----'s, on Winter Street;
   </p>
   <p>
    and they will want new saleswomen in October. Perhaps you could be at my
   </p>
   <p>
    counter. I'd teach you, and you could board with me. I've got a real
   </p>
   <p>
    comfortable room, and I suppose I might have more things, for I get good
   </p>
   <p>
    pay; but I like to send money home to mother. I'm at my aunt's now, but
   </p>
   <p>
    I am going back next Monday, and if you will tell me what your name is,
   </p>
   <p>
    I'll find out for certain about the place, and write you. My name's Mary
   </p>
   <p>
    Wendell."
   </p>
   <p>
    I knew by Kate's voice that this had touched her. "You are very kind;
   </p>
   <p>
    thank you heartily," said she; "but I cannot go and work with you. I
   </p>
   <p>
    should like to know more about you. I live in Boston too; my friend and
   </p>
   <p>
    I are staying over in Deephaven for the summer only." And she held out
   </p>
   <p>
    her hand to the girl, whose face had changed from its first expression
   </p>
   <p>
    of earnest good-humor to a very startled one; and when she noticed
   </p>
   <p>
    Kate's hand, and a ring of hers, which had been turned round, she looked
   </p>
   <p>
    really frightened.
   </p>
   <p>
    "O, will you please excuse me?" said she, blushing. "I ought to have
   </p>
   <p>
    known better; but you showed us round so willing, and I never thought of
   </p>
   <p>
    your not living here. I didn't mean to be rude."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Of course you did not, and you were not. I am very glad you said it,
   </p>
   <p>
    and glad you like me," said Kate; and just then the party called the
   </p>
   <p>
    girl, and she hurried away, and I joined Kate. "Then you heard it all.
   </p>
   <p>
    That was worth having!" said she. "She was such an honest little soul,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I mean to look for her when I get home."
   </p>
   <p>
    Sometimes we used to go out to the Light early in the morning with the
   </p>
   <p>
    fishermen who went that way to the fishing-grounds, but we usually made
   </p>
   <p>
    the voyage early in the afternoon if it were not too hot, and we went
   </p>
   <p>
    fishing off the rocks or sat in the house with Mrs. Kew, who often
   </p>
   <p>
    related some of her Vermont experiences, or Mr. Kew would tell us
   </p>
   <p>
    surprising sea-stories and ghost-stories like a story-book sailor. Then
   </p>
   <p>
    we would have an unreasonably good supper and afterward climb the ladder
   </p>
   <p>
    to the lantern to see the lamps lighted, and sit there for a while
   </p>
   <p>
    watching the ships and the sunset. Almost all the coasters came in sight
   </p>
   <p>
    of Deephaven, and the sea outside the light was their grand highway.
   </p>
   <p>
    Twice from the lighthouse we saw a yacht squadron like a flock of great
   </p>
   <p>
    white birds. As for the sunsets, it used to seem often as if we were
   </p>
   <p>
    near the heart of them, for the sea all around us caught the color of
   </p>
   <p>
    the clouds, and though the glory was wonderful, I remember best one
   </p>
   <p>
    still evening when there was a bank of heavy gray clouds in the west
   </p>
   <p>
    shutting down like a curtain, and the sea was silver-colored. You could
   </p>
   <p>
    look under and beyond the curtain of clouds into the palest, clearest
   </p>
   <p>
    yellow sky. There was a little black boat in the distance drifting
   </p>
   <p>
    slowly, climbing one white wave after another, as if it were bound out
   </p>
   <p>
    into that other world beyond. But presently the sun came from behind the
   </p>
   <p>
    clouds, and the dazzling golden light changed the look of everything,
   </p>
   <p>
    and it was the time then to say one thought it a beautiful sunset; while
   </p>
   <p>
    before one could only keep very still, and watch the boat, and wonder if
   </p>
   <p>
    heaven would not be somehow like that far, faint color, which was
   </p>
   <p>
    neither sea nor sky.
   </p>
   <p>
    When we came down from the lighthouse and it grew late, we would beg for
   </p>
   <p>
    an hour or two longer on the water, and row away in the twilight far out
   </p>
   <p>
    from land, where, with our faces turned from the Light, it seemed as if
   </p>
   <p>
    we were alone, and the sea shoreless; and as the darkness closed round
   </p>
   <p>
    us softly, we watched the stars come out, and were always glad to see
   </p>
   <p>
    Kate's star and my star, which we had chosen when we were children. I
   </p>
   <p>
    used long ago to be sure of one thing,--that, however far away heaven
   </p>
   <p>
    might be, it could not be out of sight of the stars. Sometimes in the
   </p>
   <p>
    evening we waited out at sea for the moonrise, and then we would take
   </p>
   <p>
    the oars again and go slowly in, once in a while singing or talking, but
   </p>
   <p>
    oftenest silent.
   </p>
   <p>
    My Lady Brandon and the Widow Jim
   </p>
   <p>
    When it was known that we had arrived in Deephaven, the people who had
   </p>
   <p>
    known Miss Brandon so well, and Mrs. Lancaster also, seemed to consider
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves Kate's friends by inheritance, and were exceedingly polite to
   </p>
   <p>
    us, in either calling upon us or sending pleasant messages. Before the
   </p>
   <p>
    first week had ended we had no lack of society. They were not strangers
   </p>
   <p>
    to Kate, to begin with, and as for me, I think it is easy for me to be
   </p>
   <p>
    contented, and to feel at home anywhere. I have the good fortune and the
   </p>
   <p>
    misfortune to belong to the navy,--that is, my father does,--and my life
   </p>
   <p>
    has been consequently an unsettled one, except during the years of my
   </p>
   <p>
    school life, when my friendship with Kate began.
   </p>
   <p>
    I think I should be happy in any town if I were living there with Kate
   </p>
   <p>
    Lancaster. I will not praise my friend as I can praise her, or say half
   </p>
   <p>
    the things I might say honestly. She is so fresh and good and true, and
   </p>
   <p>
    enjoys life so heartily. She is so child-like, without being childish;
   </p>
   <p>
    and I do not tell you that she is faultless, but when she makes mistakes
   </p>
   <p>
    she is sorrier and more ready to hopefully try again than any girl I
   </p>
   <p>
    know. Perhaps you would like to know something about us, but I am not
   </p>
   <p>
    writing Kate's biography and my own, only telling you of one summer
   </p>
   <p>
    which we spent together. Sometimes in Deephaven we were between six and
   </p>
   <p>
    seven years old, but at other times we have felt irreparably grown-up,
   </p>
   <p>
    and as if we carried a crushing weight of care and duty. In reality we
   </p>
   <p>
    are both twenty-four, and it is a pleasant age, though I think next year
   </p>
   <p>
    is sure to be pleasanter, for we do not mind growing older, since we
   </p>
   <p>
    have lost nothing that we mourn about, and are gaining so much. I shall
   </p>
   <p>
    be glad if you learn to know Kate a little in my stories. It is not that
   </p>
   <p>
    I am fond of her and endow her with imagined virtues and graces; no one
   </p>
   <p>
    can fail to see how unaffected she is, or not notice her thoughtfulness
   </p>
   <p>
    and generosity and her delightful fun, which never has a trace of
   </p>
   <p>
    coarseness or silliness. It was very pleasant having her for one's
   </p>
   <p>
    companion, for she has an unusual power of winning people's confidence,
   </p>
   <p>
    and of knowing with surest instinct how to meet them on their own
   </p>
   <p>
    ground. It is the girl's being so genuinely sympathetic and interested
   </p>
   <p>
    which makes every one ready to talk to her and be friends with her; just
   </p>
   <p>
    as the sunshine makes it easy for flowers to grow which the chilly winds
   </p>
   <p>
    hinder. She is not polite for the sake of seeming polite, but polite for
   </p>
   <p>
    the sake of being kind, and there is not a particle of what Hugh Miller
   </p>
   <p>
    justly calls the insolence of condescension about her; she is not
   </p>
   <p>
    brilliantly talented, yet she does everything in a charming fashion of
   </p>
   <p>
    her own; she is not profoundly learned, yet she knows much of which many
   </p>
   <p>
    wise people are ignorant, and while she is a patient scholar in both
   </p>
   <p>
    little things and great, she is no less a teacher to all her
   </p>
   <p>
    friends,--dear Kate Lancaster!
   </p>
   <p>
    We knew that we were considered Miss Brandon's representatives in
   </p>
   <p>
    Deephaven society, and this was no slight responsibility, as she had
   </p>
   <p>
    received much honor and respect. We heard again and again what a loss
   </p>
   <p>
    she had been to the town, and we tried that summer to do nothing to
   </p>
   <p>
    lessen the family reputation, and to give pleasure as well as take it,
   </p>
   <p>
    though we were singularly persistent in our pursuit of a good time. I
   </p>
   <p>
    grew much interested in what I heard of Miss Brandon, and it seems to me
   </p>
   <p>
    that it is a great privilege to have an elderly person in one's
   </p>
   <p>
    neighborhood, in town or country, who is proud, and conservative, and
   </p>
   <p>
    who lives in stately fashion; who is intolerant of sham and of useless
   </p>
   <p>
    novelties, and clings to the old ways of living and behaving as if it
   </p>
   <p>
    were part of her religion. There is something immensely respectable
   </p>
   <p>
    about the gentlewomen of the old school. They ignore all bustle and
   </p>
   <p>
    flashiness, and the conceit of the younger people, who act as if at last
   </p>
   <p>
    it had been time for them to appear and manage this world as it ought to
   </p>
   <p>
    have been managed before. Their position in modern society is much like
   </p>
   <p>
    that of the King's Chapel in its busy street in Boston. It perhaps might
   </p>
   <p>
    not have been easy to approach Miss Brandon, but I am sure that if I had
   </p>
   <p>
    visited in Deephaven during her lifetime I should have been very proud
   </p>
   <p>
    if I had been asked to take tea at her house, and should have liked to
   </p>
   <p>
    speak afterward of my acquaintance with her. It would have been
   </p>
   <p>
    impossible not to pay her great deference; it is a pleasure to think
   </p>
   <p>
    that she must have found this world a most polite world, and have had
   </p>
   <p>
    the highest opinion of its good manners. Noblesse oblige: that is
   </p>
   <p>
    true in more ways than one!
   </p>
   <p>
    I cannot help wondering if those of us who will be left by and by to
   </p>
   <p>
    represent our own generation will seem to have such superior elegance of
   </p>
   <p>
    behavior; if we shall receive so much respect and be so much valued. It
   </p>
   <p>
    is hard to imagine it. We know that the world gains new refinements and
   </p>
   <p>
    a better culture; but to us there never will be such imposing ladies and
   </p>
   <p>
    gentlemen as these who belong to the old school.
   </p>
   <p>
    The morning after we reached Deephaven we were busy up stairs, and there
   </p>
   <p>
    was a determined blow at the knocker of the front door. I went down to
   </p>
   <p>
    see who was there, and had the pleasure of receiving our first caller.
   </p>
   <p>
    She was a prim little old woman who looked pleased and expectant, who
   </p>
   <p>
    wore a neat cap and front, and whose eyes were as bright as black beads.
   </p>
   <p>
    She wore no bonnet, and had thrown a little three-cornered shawl, with
   </p>
   <p>
    palm-leaf figures, over her shoulders; and it was evident that she was a
   </p>
   <p>
    near neighbor. She was very short and straight and thin, and so quick
   </p>
   <p>
    that she darted like a pickerel when she moved about. It occurred to me
   </p>
   <p>
    at once that she was a very capable person, and had "faculty," and, dear
   </p>
   <p>
    me, how fast she talked! She hesitated a moment when she saw me, and
   </p>
   <p>
    dropped a fragment of a courtesy. "Miss Lan'k'ster?" said she,
   </p>
   <p>
    doubtfully.
   </p>
   <p>
    "No," said I, "I'm Miss Denis: Miss Lancaster is at home, though: come
   </p>
   <p>
    in, won't you?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "O Mrs. Patton!" said Kate, who came down just then. "How very kind of
   </p>
   <p>
    you to come over so soon! I should have gone to see you to-day. I was
   </p>
   <p>
    asking Mrs. Kew last night if you were here."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Land o' compassion!" said Mrs. Patton, as she shook Kate's hand
   </p>
   <p>
    delightedly. "Where'd ye s'pose I'd be, dear? I ain't like to move away
   </p>
   <p>
    from Deephaven now, after I've held by the place so long, I've got as
   </p>
   <p>
    many roots as the big ellum. Well, I should know you were a Brandon, no
   </p>
   <p>
    matter where I see you. You've got a real Brandon look; tall and
   </p>
   <p>
    straight, ain't you? It's four or five years since I saw you, except
   </p>
   <p>
    once at church, and once you went by, down to the shore, I suppose. It
   </p>
   <p>
    was a windy day in the spring of the year."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I remember it very well," said Kate. "Those were both visits of only a
   </p>
   <p>
    day or two, and I was here at Aunt Katharine's funeral, and went away
   </p>
   <p>
    that same evening. Do you remember once I was here in the summer for a
   </p>
   <p>
    longer visit, five or six years ago, and I helped you pick currants in
   </p>
   <p>
    the garden? You had a very old mug."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Now, whoever would ha' thought o' your rec'lecting that?" said Mrs.
   </p>
   <p>
    Patton. "Yes. I had that mug because it was handy to carry about among
   </p>
   <p>
    the bushes, and then I'd empt' it into the basket as fast as I got it
   </p>
   <p>
    full. Your aunt always told me to pick all I wanted; she couldn't use
   </p>
   <p>
    'em, but they used to make sights o' currant wine in old times. I s'pose
   </p>
   <p>
    that mug would be considerable of a curiosity to anybody that wasn't
   </p>
   <p>
    used to seeing it round. My grand'ther Joseph Toggerson--my mother was a
   </p>
   <p>
    Toggerson--picked it up on the long sands in a wad of sea-weed: strange
   </p>
   <p>
    it wasn't broke, but it's tough; I've dropped it on the floor, many's
   </p>
   <p>
    the time, and it ain't even chipped. There's some Dutch reading on it
   </p>
   <p>
    and it's marked 1732. Now I shouldn't ha' thought you'd remembered that
   </p>
   <p>
    old mug, I declare. Your aunt she had a monstrous sight of chiny. She's
   </p>
   <p>
    told me where 'most all of it come from, but I expect I've forgot. My
   </p>
   <p>
    memory fails me a good deal by spells. If you hadn't come down I suppose
   </p>
   <p>
    your mother would have had the chiny packed up this spring,--what she
   </p>
   <p>
    didn't take with her after your aunt died. S'pose she hasn't made up her
   </p>
   <p>
    mind what to do with the house?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "No," said Kate; "she wishes she could: it is a great puzzle to us."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I hope you will find it in middling order," said Mrs. Patton, humbly.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Me and Mis' Dockum have done the best we knew,--opened the windows and
   </p>
   <p>
    let in the air and tried to keep it from getting damp. I fixed all the
   </p>
   <p>
    woollens with fresh camphire and tobacco the last o' the winter; you
   </p>
   <p>
    have to be dreadful careful in one o' these old houses, 'less everything
   </p>
   <p>
    gets creaking with moths in no time. Miss Katharine, how she did hate
   </p>
   <p>
    the sight of a moth-miller! There's something I'll speak about before I
   </p>
   <p>
    forget it: the mice have eat the backs of a pile o' old books that's
   </p>
   <p>
    stored away in the west chamber closet next to Miss Katharine's room,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I set a trap there, but it was older 'n the ten commandments, that
   </p>
   <p>
    trap was, and the spring's rusty. I guess you'd better get some new ones
   </p>
   <p>
    and set round in different places, 'less the mice'll pester you. There
   </p>
   <p>
    ain't been no chance for 'em to get much of a living 'long through the
   </p>
   <p>
    winter, but they'll be sure to come back quick as they find there's
   </p>
   <p>
    likely to be good board. I see your aunt's cat setting out on the front
   </p>
   <p>
    steps. She never was no great of a mouser, but it went to my heart to
   </p>
   <p>
    see how pleased she looks! Come right back, didn't she? How they do hold
   </p>
   <p>
    to their old haunts!"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Was that Miss Brandon's cat?" I asked, with great interest. "She has
   </p>
   <p>
    been up stairs with us, but I supposed she belonged to some neighbor,
   </p>
   <p>
    and had strayed in. She behaved as if she felt at home, poor old pussy!"
   </p>
   <p>
    "We must keep her here," said Kate.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Mis' Dockum took her after your mother went off, and Miss Katharine's
   </p>
   <p>
    maids," said Mrs. Patton; "but she told me that it was a long spell
   </p>
   <p>
    before she seemed to feel contented. She used to set on the steps and
   </p>
   <p>
    cry by the hour together, and try to get in, to first one door and then
   </p>
   <p>
    another. I used to think how bad Miss Katharine would feel; she set a
   </p>
   <p>
    great deal by a cat, and she took notice of this as long as she did of
   </p>
   <p>
    anything. Her mind failed her, you know. Great loss to Deephaven, she
   </p>
   <p>
    was. Proud woman, and some folks were scared of her; but I always got
   </p>
   <p>
    along with her, and I wouldn't ask for no kinder friend nor neighbor.
   </p>
   <p>
    I've had my troubles, and I've seen the day I was suffering poor, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    couldn't have brought myself to ask town help nohow, but I wish ye'd ha'
   </p>
   <p>
    heared her scold me when she found it out; and she come marching into my
   </p>
   <p>
    kitchen one morning, like a grenadier, and says she, 'Why didn't you
   </p>
   <p>
    send and tell me how sick and poor you are?' says she. And she said
   </p>
   <p>
    she'd ha' been so glad to help me all along, but she thought I had
   </p>
   <p>
    means,--everybody did; and I see the tears in her eyes, but she was
   </p>
   <p>
    scolding me and speaking as if she was dreadful mad. She made me
   </p>
   <p>
    comfortable, and she sent over one o' her maids to see to me, and got
   </p>
   <p>
    the doctor, and a load o' stuff come up from the store, so I didn't have
   </p>
   <p>
    to buy anything for a good many weeks. I got better and so's to work,
   </p>
   <p>
    but she never'd let me say nothing about it. I had a good deal o'
   </p>
   <p>
    trouble, and I thought I'd lost my health, but I hadn't, and that was
   </p>
   <p>
    thirty or forty years ago. There never was nothing going on at the great
   </p>
   <p>
    house that she didn't have me over, sewing or cleaning or company; and
   </p>
   <p>
    I got so that I knew how she liked to have things done. I felt as if it
   </p>
   <p>
    was my own sister, though I never had one, when I was going over to help
   </p>
   <p>
    lay her out. She used to talk as free to me as she would to Miss Lorimer
   </p>
   <p>
    or Miss Carew. I s'pose ye ain't seen nothing o' them yet? She was a
   </p>
   <p>
    good Christian woman, Miss Katharine was. 'The memory of the just is
   </p>
   <p>
    blessed'; that's what Mr. Lorimer said in his sermon the Sunday after
   </p>
   <p>
    she died, and there wasn't a blood-relation there to hear it. I declare
   </p>
   <p>
    it looked pitiful to see that pew empty that ought to ha' been the
   </p>
   <p>
    mourners' pew. Your mother, Mis' Lancaster, had to go home Saturday,
   </p>
   <p>
    your father was going away sudden to Washington, I've understood, and
   </p>
   <p>
    she come back again the first of the week. There! it didn't make no sort
   </p>
   <p>
    o' difference, p'r'aps nobody thought of it but me. There hadn't been
   </p>
   <p>
    anybody in the pew more than a couple o' times since she used to sit
   </p>
   <p>
    there herself, regular as Sunday come." And Mrs. Patton looked for a
   </p>
   <p>
    minute as if she were going to cry, but she changed her mind upon second
   </p>
   <p>
    thought.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Your mother gave me most of Miss Katharine's clothes; this cap belonged
   </p>
   <p>
    to her, that I've got on now; it's 'most wore out, but it does for
   </p>
   <p>
    mornings."
   </p>
   <p>
    "O," said Kate, "I have two new ones for you in one of my trunks! Mamma
   </p>
   <p>
    meant to choose them herself, but she had not time, and so she told me,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I think I found the kind she thought you would like."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Now I'm sure!" said Mrs. Patton, "if that ain't kind; you don't tell me
   </p>
   <p>
    that Mis' Lancaster thought of me just as she was going off? I shall set
   </p>
   <p>
    everything by them caps, and I'm much obliged to you too, Miss Kate. I
   </p>
   <p>
    was just going to speak of that time you were here and saw the mug; you
   </p>
   <p>
    trimmed a cap for Miss Katharine to give me, real Boston style. I guess
   </p>
   <p>
    that box of cap-fixings is up on the top shelf of Miss Katharine's
   </p>
   <p>
    closet now, to the left hand," said Mrs. Patton, with wistful certainty.
   </p>
   <p>
    "She used to make her every-day caps herself, and she had some beautiful
   </p>
   <p>
    materials laid away that she never used. Some folks has laughed at me
   </p>
   <p>
    for being so particular 'bout wearing caps except for best, but I don't
   </p>
   <p>
    know's it's presuming beyond my station, and somehow I feel more respect
   </p>
   <p>
    for myself when I have a good cap on. I can't get over your mother's
   </p>
   <p>
    rec'lecting about me; and she sent me a handsome present o' money this
   </p>
   <p>
    spring for looking after the house. I never should have asked for a
   </p>
   <p>
    cent; it's a pleasure to me to keep an eye on it, out o' respect to your
   </p>
   <p>
    aunt. I was so pleased when I heard you were coming long o' your friend.
   </p>
   <p>
    I like to see the old place open; it was about as bad as having no
   </p>
   <p>
    meeting. I miss seeing the lights, and your aunt was a great hand for
   </p>
   <p>
    lighting up bright; the big hall lantern was lit every night, and she
   </p>
   <p>
    put it out when she went up stairs. She liked to go round same's if it
   </p>
   <p>
    was day. You see I forget all the time she was sick, and go back to the
   </p>
   <p>
    days when she was well and about the house. When her mind was failing
   </p>
   <p>
    her, and she was up stairs in her room, her eyesight seemed to be lost
   </p>
   <p>
    part of the time, and sometimes she'd tell us to get the lamp and a
   </p>
   <p>
    couple o' candles in the middle o' the day, and then she'd be as
   </p>
   <p>
    satisfied! But she used to take a notion to set in the dark, some
   </p>
   <p>
    nights, and think, I s'pose. I should have forty fits, if I undertook
   </p>
   <p>
    it. That was a good while ago; and do you rec'lect how she used to play
   </p>
   <p>
    the piano? She used to be a great hand to play when she was young."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Indeed I remember it," said Kate, who told me afterward how her aunt
   </p>
   <p>
    used to sit at the piano in the twilight and play to herself. "She was
   </p>
   <p>
    formerly a skilful musician," said my friend, "though one would not have
   </p>
   <p>
    imagined she cared for music. When I was a child she used to play in
   </p>
   <p>
    company of an evening, and once when I was here one of her old friends
   </p>
   <p>
    asked for a tune, and she laughingly said that her day was over and her
   </p>
   <p>
    fingers were stiff; though I believe she might have played as well as
   </p>
   <p>
    ever then, if she had cared to try. But once in a while when she had
   </p>
   <p>
    been quiet all day and rather sad--I am ashamed that I used to think she
   </p>
   <p>
    was cross--she would open the piano and sit there until late, while I
   </p>
   <p>
    used to be enchanted by her memories of dancing-tunes, and old psalms,
   </p>
   <p>
    and marches and songs. There was one tune which I am sure had a history:
   </p>
   <p>
    there was a sweet wild cadence in it, and she would come back to it
   </p>
   <p>
    again and again, always going through with it in the same measured way.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have remembered so many things about my aunt since I have been here,"
   </p>
   <p>
    said Kate, "which I hardly noticed and did not understand when they
   </p>
   <p>
    happened. I was afraid of her when I was a little girl, but I think if
   </p>
   <p>
    I had grown up sooner, I should have enjoyed her heartily. It never used
   </p>
   <p>
    to occur to me that she had a spark of tenderness or of sentiment, until
   </p>
   <p>
    just before she was ill, but I have been growing more fond of her ever
   </p>
   <p>
    since. I might have given her a great deal more pleasure. It was not
   </p>
   <p>
    long after I was through school that she became so feeble, and of course
   </p>
   <p>
    she liked best having mamma come to see her; one of us had to be at
   </p>
   <p>
    home. I have thought lately how careful one ought to be, to be kind and
   </p>
   <p>
    thoughtful to one's old friends. It is so soon too late to be good to
   </p>
   <p>
    them, and then one is always so sorry."
   </p>
   <p>
    I must tell you more of Mrs. Patton; of course it was not long before we
   </p>
   <p>
    returned her call, and we were much entertained; we always liked to see
   </p>
   <p>
    our friends in their own houses. Her house was a little way down the
   </p>
   <p>
    road, unpainted and gambrel-roofed, but so low that the old lilac-bushes
   </p>
   <p>
    which clustered round it were as tall as the eaves. The Widow Jim (as
   </p>
   <p>
    nearly every one called her in distinction to the widow Jack Patton, who
   </p>
   <p>
    was a tailoress and lived at the other end of the town) was a very
   </p>
   <p>
    useful person. I suppose there must be her counterpart in all old New
   </p>
   <p>
    England villages. She sewed, and she made elaborate rugs, and she had a
   </p>
   <p>
    decided talent for making carpets,--if there were one to be made, which
   </p>
   <p>
    must have happened seldom. But there were a great many to be turned and
   </p>
   <p>
    made over in Deephaven, and she went to the Carews' and Lorimers' at
   </p>
   <p>
    house-cleaning time or in seasons of great festivity. She had no equal
   </p>
   <p>
    in sickness, and knew how to brew every old-fashioned dose and to make
   </p>
   <p>
    every variety of herb-tea, and when her nursing was put to an end by her
   </p>
   <p>
    patient's death, she was commander-in-chief at the funeral, and stood
   </p>
   <p>
    near the doorway to direct the mourning friends to their seats; and I
   </p>
   <p>
    have no reason to doubt that she sometimes even had the immense
   </p>
   <p>
    responsibility of making out the order of the procession, since she had
   </p>
   <p>
    all genealogy and relationship at her tongue's end. It was an awful
   </p>
   <p>
    thing in Deephaven, we found, if the precedence was wrongly assigned,
   </p>
   <p>
    and once we chanced to hear some bitter remarks because the cousins of
   </p>
   <p>
    the departed wife had been placed after the husband's relatives,--"the
   </p>
   <p>
    blood-relations ridin' behind them that was only kin by marriage! I
   </p>
   <p>
    don't wonder they felt hurt!" said the person who spoke; a most
   </p>
   <p>
    unselfish and unassuming soul, ordinarily.
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs. Patton knew everybody's secrets, but she told them judiciously if
   </p>
   <p>
    at all. She chattered all day to you as a sparrow twitters, and you did
   </p>
   <p>
    not tire of her; and Kate and I were never more agreeably entertained
   </p>
   <p>
    than when she told us of old times and of Kate's ancestors and their
   </p>
   <p>
    contemporaries; for her memory was wonderful, and she had either seen
   </p>
   <p>
    everything that had happened in Deephaven for a long time, or had
   </p>
   <p>
    received the particulars from reliable witnesses. She had known much
   </p>
   <p>
    trouble; her husband had been but small satisfaction to her, and it was
   </p>
   <p>
    not to be wondered at if she looked upon all proposed marriages with
   </p>
   <p>
    compassion. She was always early at church, and she wore the same bonnet
   </p>
   <p>
    that she had when Kate was a child; it was such a well-preserved, proper
   </p>
   <p>
    black straw bonnet, with discreet bows of ribbon, and a useful lace veil
   </p>
   <p>
    to protect it from the weather.
   </p>
   <p>
    She showed us into the best room the first time we went to see her. It
   </p>
   <p>
    was the plainest little room, and very dull, and there was an exact
   </p>
   <p>
    sufficiency about its furnishings. Yet there was a certain dignity about
   </p>
   <p>
    it; it was unmistakably a best room, and not a place where one might
   </p>
   <p>
    make a litter or carry one's every-day work. You felt at once that
   </p>
   <p>
    somebody valued the prim old-fashioned chairs, and the two half-moon
   </p>
   <p>
    tables, and the thin carpet, which must have needed anxious stretching
   </p>
   <p>
    every spring to make it come to the edge of the floor. There were some
   </p>
   <p>
    mourning-pieces by way of decoration, inscribed with the names of Mrs.
   </p>
   <p>
    Patton's departed friends,--two worked in crewel to the memory of her
   </p>
   <p>
    father and mother, and two paper memorials, with the woman weeping under
   </p>
   <p>
    the willow at the side of a monument. They were all brown with age; and
   </p>
   <p>
    there was a sampler beside, worked by "Judith Beckett, aged ten," and
   </p>
   <p>
    all five were framed in slender black frames and hung very high on the
   </p>
   <p>
    walls. There was a rocking-chair which looked as if it felt too grand
   </p>
   <p>
    for use, and considered itself imposing. It tilted far back on its
   </p>
   <p>
    rockers, and was bent forward at the top to make one's head
   </p>
   <p>
    uncomfortable. It need not have troubled itself; nobody would ever wish
   </p>
   <p>
    to sit there. It was such a big rocking-chair, and Mrs. Patton was proud
   </p>
   <p>
    of it; always generously urging her guests to enjoy its comfort, which
   </p>
   <p>
    was imaginary with her, as she was so short that she could hardly have
   </p>
   <p>
    climbed into it without assistance.
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs. Patton was a little ceremonious at first, but soon recovered
   </p>
   <p>
    herself and told us a great deal which we were glad to hear. I asked her
   </p>
   <p>
    once if she had not always lived at Deephaven. "Here and beyond East
   </p>
   <p>
    Parish," said she. "Mr. Patton,--that was my husband,--he owned a good
   </p>
   <p>
    farm there when I married him, but I come back here again after he died;
   </p>
   <p>
    place was all mortgaged. I never got a cent, and I was poorer than when
   </p>
   <p>
    I started. I worked harder 'n ever I did before or since to keep things
   </p>
   <p>
    together, but 't wasn't any kind o' use. Your mother knows all about it,
   </p>
   <p>
    Miss Kate,"--as if we might not be willing to believe it on her
   </p>
   <p>
    authority. "I come back here a widow and destitute, and I tell you the
   </p>
   <p>
    world looked fair to me when I left this house first to go over there.
   </p>
   <p>
    Don't you run no risks, you're better off as you be, dears. But land
   </p>
   <p>
    sakes alive, 'he' didn't mean no hurt! and he set everything by me when
   </p>
   <p>
    he was himself. I don't make no scruples of speaking about it, everybody
   </p>
   <p>
    knows how it was, but I did go through with everything. I never knew
   </p>
   <p>
    what the day would bring forth," said the widow, as if this were the
   </p>
   <p>
    first time she had had a chance to tell her sorrows to a sympathizing
   </p>
   <p>
    audience. She did not seem to mind talking about the troubles of her
   </p>
   <p>
    married life any more than a soldier minds telling the story of his
   </p>
   <p>
    campaigns, and dwells with pride on the worst battle of all.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her favorite subject always was Miss Brandon, and after a pause she said
   </p>
   <p>
    that she hoped we were finding everything right in the house; she had
   </p>
   <p>
    meant to take up the carpet in the best spare room, but it didn't seem
   </p>
   <p>
    to need it; it was taken up the year before, and the room had not been
   </p>
   <p>
    used since, there was not a mite of dust under it last time. And Kate
   </p>
   <p>
    assured her, with an appearance of great wisdom, that she did not think
   </p>
   <p>
    it could be necessary at all.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I come home and had a good cry yesterday after I was over to see you,"
   </p>
   <p>
    said Mrs. Patton, and I could not help wondering if she really could
   </p>
   <p>
    cry, for she looked so perfectly dried up, so dry that she might rustle
   </p>
   <p>
    in the wind. "Your aunt had been failin' so long that just after she
   </p>
   <p>
    died it was a relief, but I've got so's to forget all about that, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    miss her as she used to be; it seemed as if you had stepped into her
   </p>
   <p>
    place, and you look some as she used to when she was young."
   </p>
   <p>
    "You must miss her," said Kate, "and I know how much she used to depend
   </p>
   <p>
    upon you. You were very kind to her."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I sat up with her the night she died," said the widow, with mournful
   </p>
   <p>
    satisfaction. "I have lived neighbor to her all my life except the
   </p>
   <p>
    thirteen years I was married, and there wasn't a week I wasn't over to
   </p>
   <p>
    the great house except I was off to a distance taking care of the sick.
   </p>
   <p>
    When she got to be feeble she always wanted me to 'tend to the cleaning
   </p>
   <p>
    and to see to putting the canopies and curtains on the bedsteads, and
   </p>
   <p>
    she wouldn't trust nobody but me to handle some of the best china. I
   </p>
   <p>
    used to say, 'Miss Katharine, why don't you have some young folks come
   </p>
   <p>
    and stop with you? There's Mis' Lancaster's daughter a growing up'; but
   </p>
   <p>
    she didn't seem to care for nobody but your mother. You wouldn't believe
   </p>
   <p>
    what a hand she used to be for company in her younger days. Surprisin'
   </p>
   <p>
    how folks alters. When I first rec'lect her much she was as straight as
   </p>
   <p>
    an arrow, and she used to go to Boston visiting and come home with the
   </p>
   <p>
    top of the fashion. She always did dress elegant. It used to be gay
   </p>
   <p>
    here, and she was always going down to the Lorimers' or the Carews' to
   </p>
   <p>
    tea, and they coming here. Her sister was married; she was a good deal
   </p>
   <p>
    older; but some of her brothers were at home. There was your grandfather
   </p>
   <p>
    and Mr. Henry. I don't think she ever got it over,--his disappearing so.
   </p>
   <p>
    There were lots of folks then that's dead and gone, and they used to
   </p>
   <p>
    have their card-parties, and old Cap'n Manning--he's dead and gone--used
   </p>
   <p>
    to have 'em all to play whist every fortnight, sometimes three or four
   </p>
   <p>
    tables, and they always had cake and wine handed round, or the cap'n
   </p>
   <p>
    made some punch, like's not, with oranges in it, and lemons; he knew
   </p>
   <p>
    how! He was a bachelor to the end of his days, the old cap'n was, but he
   </p>
   <p>
    used to entertain real handsome. I rec'lect one night they was a playin'
   </p>
   <p>
    after the wine was brought in, and he upset his glass all over Miss
   </p>
   <p>
    Martha Lorimer's invisible-green watered silk, and spoilt the better
   </p>
   <p>
    part of two breadths. She sent right over for me early the next morning
   </p>
   <p>
    to see if I knew of anything to take out the spots, but I didn't, though
   </p>
   <p>
    I can take grease out o' most any material. We tried clear alcohol, and
   </p>
   <p>
    saleratus-water, and hartshorn, and pouring water through, and heating
   </p>
   <p>
    of it, and when we got through it was worse than when we started. She
   </p>
   <p>
    felt dreadful bad about it, and at last she says, 'Judith, we won't work
   </p>
   <p>
    over it any more, but if you 'll give me a day some time or 'nother,
   </p>
   <p>
    we'll rip it up and make a quilt of it.' I see that quilt last time I
   </p>
   <p>
    was in Miss Rebecca's north chamber. Miss Martha was her aunt; you never
   </p>
   <p>
    saw her; she was dead and gone before your day. It was a silk old Cap'n
   </p>
   <p>
    Peter Lorimer, her brother, who left 'em his money, brought home from
   </p>
   <p>
    sea, and she had worn it for best and second best eleven year. It looked
   </p>
   <p>
    as good as new, and she never would have ripped it up if she could have
   </p>
   <p>
    matched it. I said it seemed to be a shame, but it was a curi's figure.
   </p>
   <p>
    Cap'n Manning fetched her one to pay for it the next time he went to
   </p>
   <p>
    Boston. She didn't want to take it, but he wouldn't take no for an
   </p>
   <p>
    answer; he was free-handed, the cap'n was. I helped 'em make it 'long of
   </p>
   <p>
    Mary Ann Simms the dressmaker,--she's dead and gone too,--the time it
   </p>
   <p>
    was made. It was brown, and a beautiful-looking piece, but it wore
   </p>
   <p>
    shiny, and she made a double-gown of it before she died."
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs. Patton brought Kate and me some delicious old-fashioned cake with
   </p>
   <p>
    much spice in it, and told us it was made by old Mrs. Chantrey Brandon's
   </p>
   <p>
    receipt which she got in England, that it would keep a year, and she
   </p>
   <p>
    always kept a loaf by her, now that she could afford it; she supposed we
   </p>
   <p>
    knew Miss Katharine had named her in her will long before she was sick.
   </p>
   <p>
    "It has put me beyond fear of want," said Mrs. Patton. "I won't deny
   </p>
   <p>
    that I used to think it would go hard with me when I got so old I
   </p>
   <p>
    couldn't earn my living. You see I never laid up but a little, and it's
   </p>
   <p>
    hard for a woman who comes of respectable folks to be a pauper in her
   </p>
   <p>
    last days; but your aunt, Miss Kate, she thought of it too, and I'm sure
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm thankful to be so comfortable, and to stay in my house, which I
   </p>
   <p>
    couldn't have done, like's not. Miss Rebecca Lorimer said to me after I
   </p>
   <p>
    got news of the will, 'Why, Mis' Patton, you don't suppose your friends
   </p>
   <p>
    would ever have let you want!' And I says, 'My friends are kind,--the
   </p>
   <p>
    Lord bless 'em!--but I feel better to be able to do for myself than to
   </p>
   <p>
    be beholden.'"
   </p>
   <p>
    After this long call we went down to the post-office, and coming home
   </p>
   <p>
    stopped for a while in the old burying-ground, which we had noticed the
   </p>
   <p>
    day before; and we sat for the first time on the great stone in the
   </p>
   <p>
    wall, in the shade of a maple-tree, where we so often waited afterward
   </p>
   <p>
    for the stage to come with the mail, or rested on our way home from a
   </p>
   <p>
    walk. It was a comfortable perch; we used to read our letters there, I
   </p>
   <p>
    remember.
   </p>
   <p>
    I must tell you a little about the Deephaven burying-ground, for its
   </p>
   <p>
    interest was inexhaustible, and I do not know how much time we may have
   </p>
   <p>
    spent in reading the long epitaphs on the grave-stones and trying to
   </p>
   <p>
    puzzle out the inscriptions, which were often so old and worn that we
   </p>
   <p>
    could only trace a letter here and there. It was a neglected corner of
   </p>
   <p>
    the world, and there were straggling sumachs and acacias scattered about
   </p>
   <p>
    the enclosure, while a row of fine old elms marked the boundary of two
   </p>
   <p>
    sides. The grass was long and tangled, and most of the stones leaned one
   </p>
   <p>
    way or the other, and some had fallen flat. There were a few handsome
   </p>
   <p>
    old family monuments clustered in one corner, among which the one that
   </p>
   <p>
    marked Miss Brandon's grave looked so new and fresh that it seemed
   </p>
   <p>
    inappropriate. "It should have been dingy to begin with, like the rest,"
   </p>
   <p>
    said Kate one day; "but I think it will make itself look like its
   </p>
   <p>
    neighbors as soon as possible."
   </p>
   <p>
    There were many stones which were sacred to the memory of men who had
   </p>
   <p>
    been lost at sea, almost always giving the name of the departed ship,
   </p>
   <p>
    which was so kept in remembrance; and one felt as much interest in the
   </p>
   <p>
    ship Starlight, supposed to have foundered off the Cape of Good Hope, as
   </p>
   <p>
    in the poor fellow who had the ill luck to be one of her crew. There
   </p>
   <p>
    were dozens of such inscriptions, and there were other stones
   </p>
   <p>
    perpetuating the fame of Honourable gentlemen who had been members of
   </p>
   <p>
    His Majesty's Council, or surveyors of His Majesty's Woods, or King's
   </p>
   <p>
    Officers of Customs for the town of Deephaven. Some of the epitaphs were
   </p>
   <p>
    beautiful, showing that tenderness for the friends who had died, that
   </p>
   <p>
    longing to do them justice, to fully acknowledge their virtues and
   </p>
   <p>
    dearness, which is so touching, and so unmistakable even under the
   </p>
   <p>
    stiff, quaint expressions and formal words which were thought suitable
   </p>
   <p>
    to be chiselled on the stones, so soon to be looked at carelessly by
   </p>
   <p>
    the tearless eyes of strangers. We often used to notice names, and learn
   </p>
   <p>
    their history from the old people whom we knew, and in this way we heard
   </p>
   <p>
    many stories which we never shall forget. It is wonderful, the romance
   </p>
   <p>
    and tragedy and adventure which one may find in a quiet old-fashioned
   </p>
   <p>
    country town, though to heartily enjoy the every-day life one must care
   </p>
   <p>
    to study life and character, and must find pleasure in thought and
   </p>
   <p>
    observation of simple things, and have an instinctive, delicious
   </p>
   <p>
    interest in what to other eyes is unflavored dulness.
   </p>
   <p>
    To go back to Mrs. Patton; on our way home, after our first call upon
   </p>
   <p>
    her, we stopped to speak to Mrs. Dockum, who mentioned that she had seen
   </p>
   <p>
    us going in to the "Widow Jim's."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Willin' woman," said Mrs. Dockum, "always been respected; got an
   </p>
   <p>
    uncommon facility o' speech. I never saw such a hand to talk, but then
   </p>
   <p>
    she has something to say, which ain't the case with everybody. Good
   </p>
   <p>
    neighbor, does according to her means always. Dreadful tough time of it
   </p>
   <p>
    with her husband, shif'less and drunk all his time. Noticed that dent in
   </p>
   <p>
    the side of her forehead, I s'pose? That's where he liked to have killed
   </p>
   <p>
    her; slung a stone bottle at her."
   </p>
   <p>
    "What!" said Kate and I, very much shocked.
   </p>
   <p>
    "She don't like to have it inquired about; but she and I were sitting up
   </p>
   <p>
    with 'Manda Damer one night, and she gave me the particulars. I knew he
   </p>
   <p>
    did it, for she had a fit o' sickness afterward. Had sliced cucumbers
   </p>
   <p>
    for breakfast that morning; he was very partial to them, and he wanted
   </p>
   <p>
    some vinegar. Happened to be two bottles in the cellar-way; were just
   </p>
   <p>
    alike, and one of 'em was vinegar and the other had sperrit in it at
   </p>
   <p>
    haying-time. He takes up the wrong one and pours on quick, and out come
   </p>
   <p>
    the hayseed and flies, and he give the bottle a sling, and it hit her
   </p>
   <p>
    there where you see the scar; might put the end of your finger into the
   </p>
   <p>
    dent. He said he meant to break the bottle ag'in the door, but it went
   </p>
   <p>
    slant-wise, sort of. I don' know, I'm sure" (meditatively). "She said he
   </p>
   <p>
    was good-natured; it was early in the mornin', and he hadn't had time to
   </p>
   <p>
    get upset; but he had a high temper naturally, and so much drink hadn't
   </p>
   <p>
    made it much better. She had good prospects when she married him.
   </p>
   <p>
    Six-foot-two and red cheeks and straight as a Noroway pine; had a good
   </p>
   <p>
    property from his father, and his mother come of a good family, but he
   </p>
   <p>
    died in debt; drank like a fish. Yes, 'twas a shame, nice woman; good
   </p>
   <p>
    consistent church-member; always been respected; useful among the sick."
   </p>
   <p>
    Deephaven Society
   </p>
   <p>
    It was curious to notice, in this quaint little fishing-village by the
   </p>
   <p>
    sea, how clearly the gradations of society were defined. The place
   </p>
   <p>
    prided itself most upon having been long ago the residence of one
   </p>
   <p>
    Governor Chantrey, who was a rich shipowner and East India merchant, and
   </p>
   <p>
    whose fame and magnificence were almost fabulous. It was a never-ceasing
   </p>
   <p>
    regret that his house should have burned down after he died, and there
   </p>
   <p>
    is no doubt that if it were still standing it would rival any ruin of
   </p>
   <p>
    the Old World.
   </p>
   <p>
    The elderly people, though laying claim to no slight degree of present
   </p>
   <p>
    consequence, modestly ignored it, and spoke with pride of the grand way
   </p>
   <p>
    in which life was carried on by their ancestors, the Deephaven families
   </p>
   <p>
    of old times. I think Kate and I were assured at least a hundred times
   </p>
   <p>
    that Governor Chantrey kept a valet, and his wife, Lady Chantrey, kept a
   </p>
   <p>
    maid, and that the governor had an uncle in England who was a baronet;
   </p>
   <p>
    and I believe this must have been why our friends felt so deep an
   </p>
   <p>
    interest in the affairs of the English nobility: they no doubt felt
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves entitled to seats near the throne itself. There were formerly
   </p>
   <p>
    five families who kept their coaches in Deephaven; there were balls at
   </p>
   <p>
    the governor's, and regal entertainments at other of the grand mansions;
   </p>
   <p>
    there is not a really distinguished person in the country who will not
   </p>
   <p>
    prove to have been directly or indirectly connected with Deephaven. We
   </p>
   <p>
    were shown the cellar of the Chantrey house, and the terraces, and a few
   </p>
   <p>
    clumps of lilacs, and the grand rows of elms. There are still two of the
   </p>
   <p>
    governor's warehouses left, but his ruined wharves are fast
   </p>
   <p>
    disappearing, and are almost deserted, except by small barefooted boys
   </p>
   <p>
    who sit on the edges to fish for sea-perch when the tide comes in. There
   </p>
   <p>
    is an imposing monument in the burying-ground to the great man and his
   </p>
   <p>
    amiable consort. I am sure that if there were any surviving relatives of
   </p>
   <p>
    the governor they would receive in Deephaven far more deference than is
   </p>
   <p>
    consistent with the principles of a republican government; but the
   </p>
   <p>
    family became extinct long since, and I have heard, though it is not a
   </p>
   <p>
    subject that one may speak of lightly, that the sons were unworthy their
   </p>
   <p>
    noble descent and came to inglorious ends.
   </p>
   <p>
    There were still remaining a few representatives of the old families,
   </p>
   <p>
    who were treated with much reverence by the rest of the townspeople,
   </p>
   <p>
    although they were, like the conies of Scripture, a feeble folk.
   </p>
   <p>
    Deephaven is utterly out of fashion. It never recovered from the effects
   </p>
   <p>
    of the embargo of 1807, and a sand-bar has been steadily filling in the
   </p>
   <p>
    mouth of the harbor. Though the fishing gives what occupation there is
   </p>
   <p>
    for the inhabitants of the place, it is by no means sufficient to draw
   </p>
   <p>
    recruits from abroad. But nobody in Deephaven cares for excitement, and
   </p>
   <p>
    if some one once in a while has the low taste to prefer a more active
   </p>
   <p>
    life, he is obliged to go elsewhere in search of it, and is spoken of
   </p>
   <p>
    afterward with kind pity. I well remember the Widow Moses said to me, in
   </p>
   <p>
    speaking of a certain misguided nephew of hers, "I never could see what
   </p>
   <p>
    could 'a' sot him out to leave so many privileges and go way off to
   </p>
   <p>
    Lynn, with all them children too. Why, they lived here no more than a
   </p>
   <p>
    cable's length from the meetin'-house!"
   </p>
   <p>
    There were two schooners owned in town, and 'Bijah Mauley and Jo Sands
   </p>
   <p>
    owned a trawl. There were some schooners and a small brig slowly going
   </p>
   <p>
    to pieces by the wharves, and indeed all Deephaven looked more or less
   </p>
   <p>
    out of repair. All along shore one might see dories and wherries and
   </p>
   <p>
    whale-boats, which had been left to die a lingering death. There is
   </p>
   <p>
    something piteous to me in the sight of an old boat. If one I had used
   </p>
   <p>
    much and cared for were past its usefulness, I should say good by to it,
   </p>
   <p>
    and have it towed out to sea and sunk; it never should be left to fall
   </p>
   <p>
    to pieces above high-water mark.
   </p>
   <p>
    Even the commonest fishermen felt a satisfaction, and seemed to realize
   </p>
   <p>
    their privilege, in being residents of Deephaven; but among the nobility
   </p>
   <p>
    and gentry there lingered a fierce pride in their family and town
   </p>
   <p>
    records, and a hardly concealed contempt and pity for people who were
   </p>
   <p>
    obliged to live in other parts of the world. There were acknowledged to
   </p>
   <p>
    be a few disadvantages,--such as living nearly a dozen miles from the
   </p>
   <p>
    railway,--but, as Miss Honora Carew said, the tone of Deephaven society
   </p>
   <p>
    had always been very high, and it was very nice that there had never
   </p>
   <p>
    been any manufacturing element introduced. She could not feel too
   </p>
   <p>
    grateful, herself, that there was no disagreeable foreign population.
   </p>
   <p>
    "But," said Kate one day, "wouldn't you like to have some pleasant new
   </p>
   <p>
    people brought into town?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Certainly, my dear," said Miss Honora, rather doubtfully; "I have
   </p>
   <p>
    always been public-spirited; but then, we always have guests in summer,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I am growing old. I should not care to enlarge my acquaintance to
   </p>
   <p>
    any great extent." Miss Honora and Mrs. Dent had lived gay lives in
   </p>
   <p>
    their younger days, and were interested and connected with the outside
   </p>
   <p>
    world more than any of our Deephaven friends; but they were quite
   </p>
   <p>
    contented to stay in their own house, with their books and letters and
   </p>
   <p>
    knitting, and they carefully read Littell and "the new magazine," as
   </p>
   <p>
    they called the Atlantic.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Carews were very intimate with the minister and his sister, and
   </p>
   <p>
    there were one or two others who belonged to this set. There was Mr.
   </p>
   <p>
    Joshua Dorsey, who wore his hair in a queue, was very deaf, and carried
   </p>
   <p>
    a ponderous cane which had belonged to his venerated father,--a much
   </p>
   <p>
    taller man than he. He was polite to Kate and me, but we never knew him
   </p>
   <p>
    much. He went to play whist with the Carews every Monday evening, and
   </p>
   <p>
    commonly went out fishing once a week. He had begun the practice of law,
   </p>
   <p>
    but he had lost his hearing, and at the same time his lady-love had
   </p>
   <p>
    inconsiderately fallen in love with somebody else; after which he
   </p>
   <p>
    retired from active business life. He had a fine library, which he
   </p>
   <p>
    invited us to examine. He had many new books, but they looked shockingly
   </p>
   <p>
    overdressed, in their fresher bindings, beside the old brown volumes of
   </p>
   <p>
    essays and sermons, and lighter works in many-volume editions.
   </p>
   <p>
    A prominent link in society was Widow Tully, who had been the
   </p>
   <p>
    much-respected housekeeper of old Captain Manning for forty years. When
   </p>
   <p>
    he died he left her the use of his house and family pew, besides an
   </p>
   <p>
    annuity. The existence of Mr. Tully seemed to be a myth. During the
   </p>
   <p>
    first of his widow's residence in town she had been much affected when
   </p>
   <p>
    obliged to speak of him, and always represented herself as having seen
   </p>
   <p>
    better days and as being highly connected. But she was apt to be
   </p>
   <p>
    ungrammatical when excited, and there was a whispered tradition that
   </p>
   <p>
    she used to keep a toll-bridge in a town in Connecticut; though the
   </p>
   <p>
    mystery of her previous state of existence will probably never be
   </p>
   <p>
    solved. She wore mourning for the captain which would have befitted his
   </p>
   <p>
    widow, and patronized the townspeople conspicuously, while she herself
   </p>
   <p>
    was treated with much condescension by the Carews and Lorimers. She
   </p>
   <p>
    occupied, on the whole, much the same position that Mrs. Betty Barker
   </p>
   <p>
    did in Cranford. And, indeed, Kate and I were often reminded of that
   </p>
   <p>
    estimable town. We heard that Kate's aunt, Miss Brandon, had never been
   </p>
   <p>
    appreciative of Mrs. Tully's merits, and that since her death the others
   </p>
   <p>
    had received Mrs. Tully into their society rather more.
   </p>
   <p>
    It seemed as if all the clocks in Deephaven, and all the people with
   </p>
   <p>
    them, had stopped years ago, and the people had been doing over and over
   </p>
   <p>
    what they had been busy about during the last week of their unambitious
   </p>
   <p>
    progress. Their clothes had lasted wonderfully well, and they had no
   </p>
   <p>
    need to earn money when there was so little chance to spend it; indeed,
   </p>
   <p>
    there were several families who seemed to have no more visible means of
   </p>
   <p>
    support than a balloon. There were no young people whom we knew, though
   </p>
   <p>
    a number used to come to church on Sunday from the inland farms, or "the
   </p>
   <p>
    country," as we learned to say. There were children among the
   </p>
   <p>
    fishermen's families at the shore, but a few years will see Deephaven
   </p>
   <p>
    possessed by two classes instead of the time-honored three.
   </p>
   <p>
    As for our first Sunday at church, it must be in vain to ask you to
   </p>
   <p>
    imagine our delight when we heard the tuning of a bass-viol in the
   </p>
   <p>
    gallery just before service. We pressed each other's hands most
   </p>
   <p>
    tenderly, looked up at the singers' seats, and then trusted ourselves to
   </p>
   <p>
    look at each other. It was more than we had hoped for. There were also a
   </p>
   <p>
    violin and sometimes a flute, and a choir of men and women singers,
   </p>
   <p>
    though the congregation were expected to join in the psalm-singing. The
   </p>
   <p>
    first hymn was
   </p>
   <p>
    "The Lord our God is full of might,
   </p>
   <p>
    The winds obey his will,"
   </p>
   <p>
    to the tune of St. Ann's. It was all so delightfully old-fashioned; our
   </p>
   <p>
    pew was a square pew, and was by an open window looking seaward. We
   </p>
   <p>
    also had a view of the entire congregation, and as we were somewhat
   </p>
   <p>
    early, we watched the people come in, with great interest. The Deephaven
   </p>
   <p>
    aristocracy came with stately step up the aisle; this was all the chance
   </p>
   <p>
    there was for displaying their unquestioned dignity in public.
   </p>
   <p>
    Many of the people drove to church in wagons that were low and old and
   </p>
   <p>
    creaky, with worn buffalo-robes over the seat, and some hay tucked
   </p>
   <p>
    underneath for the sleepy, undecided old horse. Some of the younger
   </p>
   <p>
    farmers and their wives had high, shiny wagons, with tall
   </p>
   <p>
    horsewhips,--which they sometimes brought into church,--and they drove
   </p>
   <p>
    up to the steps with a consciousness of being conspicuous and enviable.
   </p>
   <p>
    They had a bashful look when they came in, and for a few minutes after
   </p>
   <p>
    they took their seats they evidently felt that all eyes were fixed upon
   </p>
   <p>
    them; but after a little while they were quite at their ease, and looked
   </p>
   <p>
    critically at the new arrivals.
   </p>
   <p>
    The old folks interested us most. "Do you notice how many more old women
   </p>
   <p>
    there are than old men?" whispered Kate to me. And we wondered if the
   </p>
   <p>
    husbands and brothers had been drowned, and if it must not be sad to
   </p>
   <p>
    look at the blue, sunshiny sea beyond the marshes, if the far-away white
   </p>
   <p>
    sails reminded them of some ships that had never sailed home into
   </p>
   <p>
    Deephaven harbor, or of fishing-boats that had never come back to land.
   </p>
   <p>
    The girls and young men adorned themselves in what they believed to be
   </p>
   <p>
    the latest fashion, but the elderly women were usually relics of old
   </p>
   <p>
    times in manner and dress. They wore to church thin, soft silk gowns
   </p>
   <p>
    that must have been brought from over the seas years upon years before,
   </p>
   <p>
    and wide collars fastened with mourning-pins holding a lock of hair.
   </p>
   <p>
    They had big black bonnets, some of them with stiff capes, such as Kate
   </p>
   <p>
    and I had not seen before since our childhood. They treasured large
   </p>
   <p>
    rusty lace veils of scraggly pattern, and wore sometimes, on pleasant
   </p>
   <p>
    Sundays, white China-crape shawls with attenuated fringes; and there
   </p>
   <p>
    were two or three of these shawls in the congregation which had been
   </p>
   <p>
    dyed black, and gave an aspect of meekness and general unworthiness to
   </p>
   <p>
    the aged wearer, they clung and drooped about the figure in such a
   </p>
   <p>
    hopeless way. We used to notice often the most interesting scarfs,
   </p>
   <p>
    without which no Deephaven woman considered herself in full dress.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sometimes there were red India scarfs in spite of its being hot weather;
   </p>
   <p>
    but our favorite ones were long strips of silk, embroidered along the
   </p>
   <p>
    edges and at the ends with dismal-colored floss in odd patterns. I think
   </p>
   <p>
    there must have been a fashion once, in Deephaven, of working these
   </p>
   <p>
    scarfs, and I should not be surprised to find that it was many years
   </p>
   <p>
    before the fashion of working samplers came about. Our friends always
   </p>
   <p>
    wore black mitts on warm Sundays, and many of them carried neat little
   </p>
   <p>
    bags of various designs on their arms, containing a precisely folded
   </p>
   <p>
    pocket-handkerchief, and a frugal lunch of caraway seeds or red and
   </p>
   <p>
    white peppermints. I should like you to see, with your own eyes, Widow
   </p>
   <p>
    Ware and Miss Exper'ence Hull, two old sisters whose personal appearance
   </p>
   <p>
    we delighted in, and whom we saw feebly approaching down the street this
   </p>
   <p>
    first Sunday morning under the shadow of the two last members of an
   </p>
   <p>
    otherwise extinct race of parasols.
   </p>
   <p>
    There were two or three old men who sat near us. They were
   </p>
   <p>
    sailors,--there is something unmistakable about a sailor,--and they had
   </p>
   <p>
    a curiously ancient, uncanny look, as if they might have belonged to the
   </p>
   <p>
    crew of the Mayflower, or even have cruised about with the Northmen in
   </p>
   <p>
    the times of Harold Harfager and his comrades. They had been blown about
   </p>
   <p>
    by so many winter winds, so browned by summer suns, and wet by salt
   </p>
   <p>
    spray, that their hands and faces looked like leather, with a few deep
   </p>
   <p>
    folds instead of wrinkles. They had pale blue eyes, very keen and quick;
   </p>
   <p>
    their hair looked like the fine sea-weed which clings to the kelp-roots
   </p>
   <p>
    and mussel-shells in little locks. These friends of ours sat solemnly at
   </p>
   <p>
    the heads of their pews and looked unflinchingly at the minister, when
   </p>
   <p>
    they were not dozing, and they sang with voices like the howl of the
   </p>
   <p>
    wind, with an occasional deep note or two.
   </p>
   <p>
    Have you never seen faces that seemed old-fashioned? Many of the people
   </p>
   <p>
    in Deephaven church looked as if they must be--if not supernaturally
   </p>
   <p>
    old--exact copies of their remote ancestors. I wonder if it is not
   </p>
   <p>
    possible that the features and expression may be almost perfectly
   </p>
   <p>
    reproduced. These faces were not modern American faces, but belonged
   </p>
   <p>
    rather to the days of the early settlement of the country, the old
   </p>
   <p>
    colonial times. We often heard quaint words and expressions which we
   </p>
   <p>
    never had known anywhere else but in old books. There was a great deal
   </p>
   <p>
    of sea-lingo in use; indeed, we learned a great deal ourselves,
   </p>
   <p>
    unconsciously, and used it afterward to the great amusement of our
   </p>
   <p>
    friends; but there were also many peculiar provincialisms, and among the
   </p>
   <p>
    people who lived on the lonely farms inland we often noticed words we
   </p>
   <p>
    had seen in Chaucer, and studied out at school in our English literature
   </p>
   <p>
    class. Everything in Deephaven was more or less influenced by the sea;
   </p>
   <p>
    the minister spoke oftenest of Peter and his fishermen companions, and
   </p>
   <p>
    prayed most earnestly every Sunday morning for those who go down to the
   </p>
   <p>
    sea in ships. He made frequent allusions and drew numberless
   </p>
   <p>
    illustrations of a similar kind for his sermons, and indeed I am in
   </p>
   <p>
    doubt whether, if the Bible had been written wholly in inland countries,
   </p>
   <p>
    it would have been much valued in Deephaven.
   </p>
   <p>
    The singing was very droll, for there was a majority of old voices,
   </p>
   <p>
    which had seen their best days long before, and the bass-viol was
   </p>
   <p>
    excessively noticeable, and apt to be a little ahead of the time the
   </p>
   <p>
    singers kept, while the violin lingered after. Somewhere on the other
   </p>
   <p>
    side of the church we heard an acute voice which rose high above all the
   </p>
   <p>
    rest of the congregation, sharp as a needle, and slightly cracked, with
   </p>
   <p>
    a limitless supply of breath. It rose and fell gallantly, and clung long
   </p>
   <p>
    to the high notes of Dundee. It was like the wail of the banshee, which
   </p>
   <p>
    sounds clear to the fated hearer above all other noises. We afterward
   </p>
   <p>
    became acquainted with the owner of this voice, and were surprised to
   </p>
   <p>
    find her a meek widow, who was like a thin black beetle in her pathetic
   </p>
   <p>
    cypress veil and big black bonnet. She looked as if she had forgotten
   </p>
   <p>
    who she was, and spoke with an apologetic whine; but we heard she had a
   </p>
   <p>
    temper as high as her voice, and as much to be dreaded as the
   </p>
   <p>
    equinoctial gale.
   </p>
   <p>
    Near the church was the parsonage, where Mr. Lorimer lived, and the old
   </p>
   <p>
    Lorimer house not far beyond was occupied by Miss Rebecca Lorimer. Some
   </p>
   <p>
    stranger might ask the question why the minister and his sister did not
   </p>
   <p>
    live together, but you would have understood it at once after you had
   </p>
   <p>
    lived for a little while in town. They were very fond of each other, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the minister dined with Miss Rebecca on Sundays, and she passed the day
   </p>
   <p>
    with him on Wednesdays, and they ruled their separate households with
   </p>
   <p>
    decision and dignity. I think Mr. Lorimer's house showed no signs of
   </p>
   <p>
    being without a mistress, any more than his sister's betrayed the want
   </p>
   <p>
    of a master's care and authority.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Carews were very kind friends of ours, and had been Miss Brandon's
   </p>
   <p>
    best friends. We heard that there had always been a coolness between
   </p>
   <p>
    Miss Brandon and Miss Lorimer, and that, though they exchanged visits
   </p>
   <p>
    and were always polite, there was a chill in the politeness, and one
   </p>
   <p>
    would never have suspected them of admiring each other at all. We had
   </p>
   <p>
    the whole history of the trouble, which dated back scores of years, from
   </p>
   <p>
    Miss Honora Carew, but we always took pains to appear ignorant of the
   </p>
   <p>
    feud, and I think Miss Lorimer was satisfied that it was best not to
   </p>
   <p>
    refer to it, and to let bygones be bygones. It would not have been true
   </p>
   <p>
    Deephaven courtesy to prejudice Kate against her grand-aunt, and Miss
   </p>
   <p>
    Rebecca cherished her dislike in silence, which gave us a most grand
   </p>
   <p>
    respect for her, since we knew she thought herself in the right; though
   </p>
   <p>
    I think it never had come to an open quarrel between these majestic
   </p>
   <p>
    aristocrats.
   </p>
   <p>
    Miss Honora Carew and Mr. Dick and their elder sister, Mrs. Dent, had a
   </p>
   <p>
    charmingly sedate and quiet home in the old Carew house. Mrs. Dent was
   </p>
   <p>
    ill a great deal while we were there, but she must have been a very
   </p>
   <p>
    brilliant woman, and was not at all dull when we knew her. She had
   </p>
   <p>
    outlived her husband and her children, and she had, several years before
   </p>
   <p>
    our summer there, given up her own home, which was in the city, and had
   </p>
   <p>
    come back to Deephaven. Miss Honora--dear Miss Honora!--had been one of
   </p>
   <p>
    the brightest, happiest girls, and had lost none of her brightness and
   </p>
   <p>
    happiness by growing old. She had lost none of her fondness for society,
   </p>
   <p>
    though she was so contented in quiet Deephaven, and I think she enjoyed
   </p>
   <p>
    Kate's and my stories of our pleasures as much as we did hers of old
   </p>
   <p>
    times. We used to go to see her almost every day. "Mr. Dick," as they
   </p>
   <p>
    called their brother, had once been a merchant in the East Indies, and
   </p>
   <p>
    there were quantities of curiosities and most beautiful china which he
   </p>
   <p>
    had brought and sent home, which gave the house a character of its own.
   </p>
   <p>
    He had been very rich and had lost some of his money, and then he came
   </p>
   <p>
    home and was still considered to possess princely wealth by his
   </p>
   <p>
    neighbors. He had a great fondness for reading and study, which had not
   </p>
   <p>
    been lost sight of during his business life, and he spent most of his
   </p>
   <p>
    time in his library. He and Mr. Lorimer had their differences of opinion
   </p>
   <p>
    about certain points of theology, and this made them much fonder of each
   </p>
   <p>
    other's society, and gave them a great deal of pleasure; for after every
   </p>
   <p>
    series of arguments, each was sure that he had vanquished the other, or
   </p>
   <p>
    there were alternate victories and defeats which made life vastly
   </p>
   <p>
    interesting and important.
   </p>
   <p>
    Miss Carew and Mrs. Dent had a great treasury of old brocades and laces
   </p>
   <p>
    and ornaments, which they showed us one day, and told us stories of the
   </p>
   <p>
    wearers, or, if they were their own, there were always some
   </p>
   <p>
    reminiscences which they liked to talk over with each other and with us.
   </p>
   <p>
    I never shall forget the first evening we took tea with them; it
   </p>
   <p>
    impressed us very much, and yet nothing wonderful happened. Tea was
   </p>
   <p>
    handed round by an old-fashioned maid, and afterward we sat talking in
   </p>
   <p>
    the twilight, looking out at the garden. It was such a delight to have
   </p>
   <p>
    tea served in this way. I wonder that the fashion has been almost
   </p>
   <p>
    forgotten. Kate and I took much pleasure in choosing our tea-poys; hers
   </p>
   <p>
    had a mandarin parading on the top, and mine a flight of birds and a
   </p>
   <p>
    pagoda; and we often used them afterward, for Miss Honora asked us to
   </p>
   <p>
    come to tea whenever we liked. "A stupid, common country town" some one
   </p>
   <p>
    dared to call Deephaven in a letter once, and how bitterly we resented
   </p>
   <p>
    it! That was a house where one might find the best society, and the most
   </p>
   <p>
    charming manners and good-breeding, and if I were asked to tell you what
   </p>
   <p>
    I mean by the word "lady," I should ask you to go, if it were possible,
   </p>
   <p>
    to call upon Miss Honora Carew.
   </p>
   <p>
    After a while the elder sister said, "My dears, we always have prayers
   </p>
   <p>
    at nine, for I have to go up stairs early nowadays." And then the
   </p>
   <p>
    servants came in, and she read solemnly the King of glory Psalm, which I
   </p>
   <p>
    have always liked best, and then Mr. Dick read the church prayers, the
   </p>
   <p>
    form of prayer to be used in families. We stayed later to talk with Miss
   </p>
   <p>
    Honora after we had said good night to Mrs. Dent. And we told each
   </p>
   <p>
    other, as we went home in the moonlight down the quiet street, how much
   </p>
   <p>
    we had enjoyed the evening, for somehow the house and the people had
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing to do with the present, or the hurry of modern life. I have
   </p>
   <p>
    never heard that psalm since without its bringing back that summer night
   </p>
   <p>
    in Deephaven, the beautiful quaint old room, and Kate and I feeling so
   </p>
   <p>
    young and worldly, by contrast, the flickering, shaded light of the
   </p>
   <p>
    candles, the old book, and the voices that said Amen.
   </p>
   <p>
    There were several other fine old houses in Deephaven beside this and
   </p>
   <p>
    the Brandon house, though that was rather the most imposing. There were
   </p>
   <p>
    two or three which had not been kept in repair, and were deserted, and
   </p>
   <p>
    of course they were said to be haunted, and we were told of their
   </p>
   <p>
    ghosts, and why they walked, and when. From some of the local
   </p>
   <p>
    superstitions Kate and I have vainly endeavored ever since to shake
   </p>
   <p>
    ourselves free. There was a most heathenish fear of doing certain things
   </p>
   <p>
    on Friday, and there were countless signs in which we still have
   </p>
   <p>
    confidence. When the moon is very bright and other people grow
   </p>
   <p>
    sentimental, we only remember that it is a fine night to catch hake.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Captains
   </p>
   <p>
    I should consider my account of Deephaven society incomplete if I did
   </p>
   <p>
    not tell you something of the ancient mariners, who may be found every
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasant morning sunning themselves like turtles on one of the wharves.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sometimes there was a considerable group of them, but the less constant
   </p>
   <p>
    members of the club were older than the rest, and the epidemics of
   </p>
   <p>
    rheumatism in town were sadly frequent. We found that it was etiquette
   </p>
   <p>
    to call them each captain, but I think some of the Deephaven men took
   </p>
   <p>
    the title by brevet upon arriving at a proper age.
   </p>
   <p>
    They sat close together because so many of them were deaf, and when we
   </p>
   <p>
    were lucky enough to overhear the conversation, it seemed to concern
   </p>
   <p>
    their adventures at sea, or the freight carried out by the Sea Duck, the
   </p>
   <p>
    Ocean Rover, or some other Deephaven ship,--the particulars of the
   </p>
   <p>
    voyage and its disasters and successes being as familiar as the
   </p>
   <p>
    wanderings of the children of Israel to an old parson. There were
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes violent altercations when the captains differed as to the
   </p>
   <p>
    tonnage of some craft that had been a prey to the winds and waves,
   </p>
   <p>
    dry-rot, or barnacles fifty years before. The old fellows puffed away at
   </p>
   <p>
    little black pipes with short stems, and otherwise consumed tobacco in
   </p>
   <p>
    fabulous quantities. It is needless to say that they gave an immense
   </p>
   <p>
    deal of attention to the weather. We used to wish we could join this
   </p>
   <p>
    agreeable company, but we found that the appearance of an outsider
   </p>
   <p>
    caused a disapproving silence, and that the meeting was evidently not to
   </p>
   <p>
    be interfered with. Once we were impertinent enough to hide ourselves
   </p>
   <p>
    for a while just round the corner of the warehouse, but we were afraid
   </p>
   <p>
    or ashamed to try it again, though the conversation was inconceivably
   </p>
   <p>
    edifying. Captain Isaac Horn, the eldest and wisest of all, was
   </p>
   <p>
    discoursing upon some cloth he had purchased once in Bristol, which the
   </p>
   <p>
    shopkeeper delayed sending until just as they were ready to weigh
   </p>
   <p>
    anchor.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I happened to take a look at that cloth," said the captain, in a loud
   </p>
   <p>
    droning voice, "and as quick as I got sight of it, I spoke onpleasant
   </p>
   <p>
    of that swindling English fellow, and the crew, they stood back. I was
   </p>
   <p>
    dreadful high-tempered in them days, mind ye; and I had the gig manned.
   </p>
   <p>
    We was out in the stream, just ready to sail. 'T was no use waiting any
   </p>
   <p>
    longer for the wind to change, and we was going north-about. I went
   </p>
   <p>
    ashore, and when I walks into his shop ye never see a creatur' so
   </p>
   <p>
    wilted. Ye see the miser'ble sculpin thought I'd never stop to open the
   </p>
   <p>
    goods, an' it was a chance I did, mind ye! 'Lor,' says he, grinning and
   </p>
   <p>
    turning the color of a biled lobster, 'I s'posed ye were a standing out
   </p>
   <p>
    to sea by this time.' 'No,' says I, 'and I've got my men out here on the
   </p>
   <p>
    quay a landing that cloth o' yourn, and if you don't send just what I
   </p>
   <p>
    bought and paid for down there to go back in the gig within fifteen
   </p>
   <p>
    minutes, I'll take ye by the collar and drop ye into the dock.' I was
   </p>
   <p>
    twice the size of him, mind ye, and master strong. 'Don't ye like it?'
   </p>
   <p>
    says he, edging round; 'I'll change it for ye, then.' Ter'ble perlite he
   </p>
   <p>
    was. 'Like it?' says I, 'it looks as if it were built of dog's hair and
   </p>
   <p>
    divil's wool, kicked together by spiders; and it's coarser than Irish
   </p>
   <p>
    frieze; three threads to an armful,' says I."
   </p>
   <p>
    This was evidently one of the captain's favorite stories, for we heard
   </p>
   <p>
    an approving grumble from the audience.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the course of a walk inland we made a new acquaintance, Captain Lant,
   </p>
   <p>
    whom we had noticed at church, and who sometimes joined the company on
   </p>
   <p>
    the wharf. We had been walking through the woods, and coming out to his
   </p>
   <p>
    fields we went on to the house for some water. There was no one at home
   </p>
   <p>
    but the captain, who told us cheerfully that he should be pleased to
   </p>
   <p>
    serve us, though his women-folks had gone off to a funeral, the other
   </p>
   <p>
    side of the P'int. He brought out a pitcherful of milk, and after we had
   </p>
   <p>
    drunk some, we all sat down together in the shade. The captain brought
   </p>
   <p>
    an old flag-bottomed chair from the woodhouse, and sat down facing Kate
   </p>
   <p>
    and me, with an air of certainty that he was going to hear something new
   </p>
   <p>
    and make some desirable new acquaintances, and also that he could tell
   </p>
   <p>
    something it would be worth our while to hear. He looked more and more
   </p>
   <p>
    like a well-to-do old English sparrow, and chippered faster and faster.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Queer ye should know I'm a sailor so quick; why, I've been a-farming
   </p>
   <p>
    it this twenty years; have to go down to the shore and take a day's
   </p>
   <p>
    fishing every hand's turn, though, to keep the old hulk clear of
   </p>
   <p>
    barnacles. There! I do wish I lived nigher the shore, where I could see
   </p>
   <p>
    the folks I know, and talk about what's been a-goin' on. You don't know
   </p>
   <p>
    anything about it, you don't; but it's tryin' to a man to be called 'old
   </p>
   <p>
    Cap'n Lant,' and, so to speak, be forgot when there's anything stirring,
   </p>
   <p>
    and be called gran'ther by clumsy creatur's goin' on fifty and sixty,
   </p>
   <p>
    who can't do no more work to-day than I can; an' then the women-folks
   </p>
   <p>
    keeps a-tellin' me to be keerful and not fall, and as how I'm too old to
   </p>
   <p>
    go out fishing; and when they want to be soft-spoken, they say as how
   </p>
   <p>
    they don't see as I fail, and how wonderful I keep my hearin'. I never
   </p>
   <p>
    did want to farm it, but 'she' always took it to heart when I was off on
   </p>
   <p>
    a v'y'ge, and this farm and some consider'ble means beside come to her
   </p>
   <p>
    from her brother, and they all sot to and give me no peace of mind till
   </p>
   <p>
    I sold out my share of the Ann Eliza and come ashore for good. I did
   </p>
   <p>
    keep an eighth of the Pactolus, and I was ship's husband for a long
   </p>
   <p>
    spell, but she never was heard from on her last voyage to Singapore. I
   </p>
   <p>
    was the lonesomest man, when I first come ashore, that ever you see.
   </p>
   <p>
    Well, you are master hands to walk, if you come way up from the Brandon
   </p>
   <p>
    house. I wish the women was at home. Know Miss Brandon? Why, yes; and I
   </p>
   <p>
    remember all her brothers and sisters, and her father and mother. I can
   </p>
   <p>
    see 'em now coming into meeting, proud as Lucifer and straight as a
   </p>
   <p>
    mast, every one of 'em. Miss Katharine, she always had her butter from
   </p>
   <p>
    this very farm. Some of the folks used to go down every Saturday, and my
   </p>
   <p>
    wife, she's been in the house a hundred times, I s'pose. So you are
   </p>
   <p>
    Hathaway Brandon's grand-daughter?" (to Kate); "why, he and I have been
   </p>
   <p>
    out fishing together many's the time,--he and Chantrey, his next younger
   </p>
   <p>
    brother. Henry, he was a disapp'intment; he went to furrin parts and
   </p>
   <p>
    turned out a Catholic priest, I s'pose you've heard? I never was so set
   </p>
   <p>
    ag'in Mr. Henry as some folks was. He was the pleasantest spoken of the
   </p>
   <p>
    whole on 'em. You do look like the Brandons; you really favor 'em
   </p>
   <p>
    consider'ble. Well, I'm pleased to see ye, I'm sure."
   </p>
   <p>
    We asked him many questions about the old people, and found he knew all
   </p>
   <p>
    the family histories and told them with great satisfaction. We found he
   </p>
   <p>
    had his pet stories, and it must have been gratifying to have an
   </p>
   <p>
    entirely new and fresh audience. He was adroit in leading the
   </p>
   <p>
    conversation around to a point where the stories would come in
   </p>
   <p>
    appropriately, and we helped him as much as possible. In a small
   </p>
   <p>
    neighborhood all the people know each other's stories and experiences by
   </p>
   <p>
    heart, and I have no doubt the old captain had been snubbed many times
   </p>
   <p>
    on beginning a favorite anecdote. There was a story which he told us
   </p>
   <p>
    that first day, which he assured us was strictly true, and it is
   </p>
   <p>
    certainly a remarkable instance of the influence of one mind upon
   </p>
   <p>
    another at a distance. It seems to me worth preserving, at any rate; and
   </p>
   <p>
    as we heard it from the old man, with his solemn voice and serious
   </p>
   <p>
    expression and quaint gestures, it was singularly impressive.
   </p>
   <p>
    "When I was a youngster," said Captain Lant, "I was an orphan, and I was
   </p>
   <p>
    bound out to old Mr. Peletiah Daw's folks, over on the Ridge Road. It
   </p>
   <p>
    was in the time of the last war, and he had a nephew, Ben Dighton, a
   </p>
   <p>
    dreadful high-strung, wild fellow, who had gone off on a privateer. The
   </p>
   <p>
    old man, he set everything by Ben; he would disoblige his own boys any
   </p>
   <p>
    day to please him. This was in his latter days, and he used to have
   </p>
   <p>
    spells of wandering and being out of his head; and he used to call for
   </p>
   <p>
    Ben and talk sort of foolish about him, till they would tell him to
   </p>
   <p>
    stop. Ben never did a stroke of work for him, either, but he was a
   </p>
   <p>
    handsome fellow, and had a way with him when he was good-natured. One
   </p>
   <p>
    night old Peletiah had been very bad all day and was getting quieted
   </p>
   <p>
    down, and it was after supper; we sat round in the kitchen, and he lay
   </p>
   <p>
    in the bedroom opening out. There were some pitch-knots blazing, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    light shone in on the bed, and all of a sudden something made me look up
   </p>
   <p>
    and look in; and there was the old man setting up straight, with his
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes shining at me like a cat's. 'Stop 'em!' says he; 'stop 'em!' and
   </p>
   <p>
    his two sons run in then to catch hold of him, for they thought he was
   </p>
   <p>
    beginning with one of his wild spells; but he fell back on the bed and
   </p>
   <p>
    began to cry like a baby. 'O, dear me,' says he, 'they've hung
   </p>
   <p>
    him,--hung him right up to the yard-arm! O, they oughtn't to have done
   </p>
   <p>
    it; cut him down quick! he didn't think; he means well, Ben does; he was
   </p>
   <p>
    hasty. O my God, I can't bear to see him swing round by the neck! It's
   </p>
   <p>
    poor Ben hung up to the yard-arm. Let me alone, I say!' Andrew and
   </p>
   <p>
    Moses, they were holding him with all their might, and they were both
   </p>
   <p>
    hearty men, but he 'most got away from them once or twice, and he
   </p>
   <p>
    screeched and howled like a mad creatur', and then he would cry again
   </p>
   <p>
    like a child. He was worn out after a while and lay back quiet, and said
   </p>
   <p>
    over and over, 'Poor Ben!' and 'hung at the yard-arm'; and he told the
   </p>
   <p>
    neighbors next day, but nobody noticed him much, and he seemed to forget
   </p>
   <p>
    it as his mind come back. All that summer he was miser'ble, and towards
   </p>
   <p>
    cold weather he failed right along, though he had been a master strong
   </p>
   <p>
    man in his day, and his timbers held together well. Along late in the
   </p>
   <p>
    fall he had taken to his bed, and one day there came to the house a
   </p>
   <p>
    fellow named Sim Decker, a reckless fellow he was too, who had gone out
   </p>
   <p>
    in the same ship with Ben. He pulled a long face when he came in, and
   </p>
   <p>
    said he had brought bad news. They had been taken prisoner and carried
   </p>
   <p>
    into port and put in jail, and Ben Dighton had got a fever there and
   </p>
   <p>
    died.
   </p>
   <p>
    "'You lie!' says the old man from the bedroom, speaking as loud and
   </p>
   <p>
    f'erce as ever you heard. 'They hung him to the yard-arm!'
   </p>
   <p>
    "'Don't mind him,' says Andrew; 'he's wandering-like, and he had a bad
   </p>
   <p>
    dream along back in the spring; I s'posed he'd forgotten it.' But the
   </p>
   <p>
    Decker fellow he turned pale, and kept talking crooked while he listened
   </p>
   <p>
    to old Peletiah a-scolding to himself. He answered the questions the
   </p>
   <p>
    women-folks asked him,--they took on a good deal,--but pretty soon he
   </p>
   <p>
    got up and winked to me and Andrew, and we went out in the yard. He
   </p>
   <p>
    began to swear, and then says he, 'When did the old man have his dream?'
   </p>
   <p>
    Andrew couldn't remember, but I knew it was the night before he sold the
   </p>
   <p>
    gray colt, and that was the 24th of April.
   </p>
   <p>
    "'Well,' says Sim Decker, 'on the twenty-third day of April Ben Dighton
   </p>
   <p>
    was hung to the yard-arm, and I see 'em do it, Lord help him! I didn't
   </p>
   <p>
    mean to tell the women, and I s'posed you'd never know, for I'm all the
   </p>
   <p>
    one of the ship's company you're ever likely to see. We were taken
   </p>
   <p>
    prisoner, and Ben was mad as fire, and they were scared of him and
   </p>
   <p>
    chained him to the deck; and while he was sulking there, a little
   </p>
   <p>
    parrot of a midshipman come up and grinned at him, and snapped his
   </p>
   <p>
    fingers in his face; and Ben lifted his hands with the heavy irons and
   </p>
   <p>
    sprung at him like a tiger, and the boy dropped dead as a stone; and
   </p>
   <p>
    they put the bight of a rope round Ben's neck and slung him right up to
   </p>
   <p>
    the yard-arm, and there he swung back and forth until as soon as we
   </p>
   <p>
    dared one of us clim' up and cut the rope and let him go over the ship's
   </p>
   <p>
    side; and they put us in irons for that, curse 'em! How did that old man
   </p>
   <p>
    in there know, and he bedridden here, nigh upon three thousand miles
   </p>
   <p>
    off?' says he. But I guess there wasn't any of us could tell him," said
   </p>
   <p>
    Captain Lant in conclusion. "It's something I never could account for,
   </p>
   <p>
    but it's true as truth. I've known more such cases; some folks laughs at
   </p>
   <p>
    me for believing 'em,--'the cap'n's yarns,' they calls 'em,--but if
   </p>
   <p>
    you'll notice, everybody's got some yarn of that kind they do believe,
   </p>
   <p>
    if they won't believe yours. And there's a good deal happens in the
   </p>
   <p>
    world that's myster'ous. Now there was Widder Oliver Pinkham, over to
   </p>
   <p>
    the P'int, told me with her own lips that she--" But just here we saw
   </p>
   <p>
    the captain's expression alter suddenly, and looked around to see a
   </p>
   <p>
    wagon coming up the lane. We immediately said we must go home, for it
   </p>
   <p>
    was growing late, but asked permission to come again and hear the Widow
   </p>
   <p>
    Oliver Pinkham story. We stopped, however, to see "the women-folks," and
   </p>
   <p>
    afterward became so intimate with them that we were invited to spend the
   </p>
   <p>
    afternoon and take tea, which invitation we accepted with great pride.
   </p>
   <p>
    We went out fishing, also, with the captain and "Danny," of whom I will
   </p>
   <p>
    tell you presently. I often think of Captain Lant in the winter, for he
   </p>
   <p>
    told Kate once that he "felt master old in winter to what he did in
   </p>
   <p>
    summer." He likes reading, fortunately, and we had a letter from him,
   </p>
   <p>
    not long ago, acknowledging the receipt of some books of travel by land
   </p>
   <p>
    and water which we had luckily thought to send him. He gave the latitude
   </p>
   <p>
    and longitude of Deephaven at the beginning of his letter, and signed
   </p>
   <p>
    himself, "Respectfully yours with esteem, Jacob Lant (condemned as
   </p>
   <p>
    unseaworthy)."
   </p>
   <p>
    Danny
   </p>
   <p>
    Deephaven seemed more like one of the lazy little English seaside towns
   </p>
   <p>
    than any other. It was not in the least American. There was no
   </p>
   <p>
    excitement about anything; there were no manufactories; nobody seemed in
   </p>
   <p>
    the least hurry. The only foreigners were a few stranded sailors. I do
   </p>
   <p>
    not know when a house or a new building of any kind had been built; the
   </p>
   <p>
    men were farmers, or went outward in boats, or inward in fish-wagons, or
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes mackerel and halibut fishing in schooners for the city
   </p>
   <p>
    markets. Sometimes a schooner came to one of the wharves to load with
   </p>
   <p>
    hay or firewood; but Deephaven used to be a town of note, rich and busy,
   </p>
   <p>
    as its forsaken warehouses show.
   </p>
   <p>
    We knew almost all the fisher-people at the shore, even old Dinnett, who
   </p>
   <p>
    lived an apparently desolate life by himself in a hut and was reputed to
   </p>
   <p>
    have been a bloodthirsty pirate in his youth. He was consequently feared
   </p>
   <p>
    by all the children, and for misdemeanors in his latter days avoided
   </p>
   <p>
    generally. Kate talked with him awhile one day on the shore, and made
   </p>
   <p>
    him come up with her for a bandage for his hand which she saw he had
   </p>
   <p>
    hurt badly; and the next morning he brought us a "new" lobster
   </p>
   <p>
    apiece,--fishermen mean that a thing is only not salted when they say it
   </p>
   <p>
    is "fresh." We happened to be in the hall, and received him ourselves,
   </p>
   <p>
    and gave him a great piece of tobacco and (unintentionally) the means of
   </p>
   <p>
    drinking our health. "Bless your pretty hearts!" said he; "may ye be
   </p>
   <p>
    happy, and live long, and get good husbands, and if they ain't good to
   </p>
   <p>
    you may they die from you!"
   </p>
   <p>
    None of our friends were more interesting than the fishermen. The
   </p>
   <p>
    fish-houses, which might be called the business centre of the town, were
   </p>
   <p>
    at a little distance from the old warehouses, farther down the harbor
   </p>
   <p>
    shore, and were ready to fall down in despair. There were some fishermen
   </p>
   <p>
    who lived near by, but most of them were also farmers in a small way,
   </p>
   <p>
    and lived in the village or farther inland. From our eastern windows we
   </p>
   <p>
    could see the moorings, and we always liked to watch the boats go out or
   </p>
   <p>
    come straying in, one after the other, ripping and skimming under the
   </p>
   <p>
    square little sails; and we often went down to the fish-houses to see
   </p>
   <p>
    what kind of a catch there had been.
   </p>
   <p>
    I should have imagined that the sea would become very commonplace to men
   </p>
   <p>
    whose business was carried on in boats, and who had spent night after
   </p>
   <p>
    night and day after day from their boyhood on the water; but that is a
   </p>
   <p>
    mistake. They have an awe of the sea and of its mysteries, and of what
   </p>
   <p>
    it hides away from us. They are childish in their wonder at any strange
   </p>
   <p>
    creature which they find. If they have not seen the sea-serpent, they
   </p>
   <p>
    believe, I am sure, that other people have, and when a great shark or
   </p>
   <p>
    black-fish or sword-fish was taken and brought in shore, everybody went
   </p>
   <p>
    to see it, and we talked about it, and how brave its conqueror was, and
   </p>
   <p>
    what a fight there had been, for a long time afterward.
   </p>
   <p>
    I said that we liked to see the boats go out, but I must not give you
   </p>
   <p>
    the impression that we saw them often, for they weighed anchor at an
   </p>
   <p>
    early hour in the morning. I remember once there was a light fog over
   </p>
   <p>
    the sea, lifting fast, as the sun was coming up, and the brownish sails
   </p>
   <p>
    disappeared in the mist, while voices could still be heard for some
   </p>
   <p>
    minutes after the men were hidden from sight. This gave one a curious
   </p>
   <p>
    feeling, but afterward, when the sun had risen, everything looked much
   </p>
   <p>
    the same as usual; the fog had gone, and the dories and even the larger
   </p>
   <p>
    boats were distant specks on the sparkling sea.
   </p>
   <p>
    One afternoon we made a new acquaintance in this wise. We went down to
   </p>
   <p>
    the shore to see if we could hire a conveyance to the lighthouse the
   </p>
   <p>
    next morning. We often went out early in one of the fishing-boats, and
   </p>
   <p>
    after we had stayed as long as we pleased, Mr. Kew would bring us home.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was quiet enough that day, for not a single boat had come in, and
   </p>
   <p>
    there were no men to be seen along-shore. There was a solemn company of
   </p>
   <p>
    lobster-coops or cages which had been brought in to be mended. They
   </p>
   <p>
    always amused Kate. She said they seemed to her like droll old women
   </p>
   <p>
    telling each other secrets. These were scattered about in different
   </p>
   <p>
    attitudes, and looked more confidential than usual.
   </p>
   <p>
    Just as we were going away we happened to see a man at work in one of
   </p>
   <p>
    the sheds. He was the fisherman whom we knew least of all; an
   </p>
   <p>
    odd-looking, silent sort of man, more sunburnt and weather-beaten than
   </p>
   <p>
    any of the others. We had learned to know him by the bright red flannel
   </p>
   <p>
    shirt he always wore, and besides, he was lame; some one told us he had
   </p>
   <p>
    had a bad fall once, on board ship. Kate and I had always wished we
   </p>
   <p>
    could find a chance to talk with him. He looked up at us pleasantly, and
   </p>
   <p>
    when we nodded and smiled, he said "Good day" in a gruff, hearty voice,
   </p>
   <p>
    and went on with his work, cleaning mackerel.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Do you mind our watching you?" asked Kate.
   </p>
   <p>
    "No, ma'am!" said the fisherman emphatically. So there we stood.
   </p>
   <p>
    Those fish-houses were curious places, so different from any other kind
   </p>
   <p>
    of workshop. In this there was a seine, or part of one, festooned among
   </p>
   <p>
    the cross-beams overhead, and there were snarled fishing-lines, and
   </p>
   <p>
    barrows to carry fish in, like wheelbarrows without wheels; there were
   </p>
   <p>
    the queer round lobster-nets, and "kits" of salt mackerel, tubs of bait,
   </p>
   <p>
    and piles of clams; and some queer bones, and parts of remarkable fish,
   </p>
   <p>
    and lobster-claws of surprising size fastened on the walls for ornament.
   </p>
   <p>
    There was a pile of rubbish down at the end; I dare say it was all
   </p>
   <p>
    useful, however,--there is such mystery about the business.
   </p>
   <p>
    Kate and I were never tired of hearing of the fish that come at
   </p>
   <p>
    different times of the year, and go away again, like the birds; or of
   </p>
   <p>
    the actions of the dog-fish, which the 'longshore-men hate so bitterly;
   </p>
   <p>
    and then there are such curious legends and traditions, of which almost
   </p>
   <p>
    all fishermen have a store.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I think mackerel are the prettiest fish that swim," said I presently.
   </p>
   <p>
    "So do I, miss," said the man, "not to say but I've seen more
   </p>
   <p>
    fancy-looking fish down in southern waters, bright as any flower you
   </p>
   <p>
    ever see; but a mackerel," holding up one admiringly, "why, they're so
   </p>
   <p>
    clean-built and trig-looking! Put a cod alongside, and he looks as
   </p>
   <p>
    lumbering as an old-fashioned Dutch brig aside a yacht.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Those are good-looking fish, but they an't made much account of,"
   </p>
   <p>
    continued our friend, as he pushed aside the mackerel and took another
   </p>
   <p>
    tub. "They're hake, I s'pose you know. But I forgot,--I can't stop to
   </p>
   <p>
    bother with them now." And he pulled forward a barrow full of small
   </p>
   <p>
    fish, flat and hard, with pointed, bony heads.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Those are porgies, aren't they?" asked Kate.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes," said the man, "an' I'm going to sliver them for the trawls."
   </p>
   <p>
    We knew what the trawls were, and supposed that the porgies were to be
   </p>
   <p>
    used for bait; and we soon found out what "slivering" meant, by seeing
   </p>
   <p>
    him take them by the head and cut a slice from first one side and then
   </p>
   <p>
    the other in such a way that the pieces looked not unlike smaller fish.
   </p>
   <p>
    "It seems to me," said I, "that fishermen always have sharper knives
   </p>
   <p>
    than other people."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes, we do like a sharp knife in our trade; and then we are mostly
   </p>
   <p>
    strong-handed."
   </p>
   <p>
    He was throwing the porgies' heads and backbones--all that was left of
   </p>
   <p>
    them after slivering--in a heap, and now several cats walked in as if
   </p>
   <p>
    they felt at home, and began a hearty lunch. "What a troop of pussies
   </p>
   <p>
    there is round here," said I; "I wonder what will become of them in the
   </p>
   <p>
    winter,--though, to be sure, the fishing goes on just the same."
   </p>
   <p>
    "The better part of them don't get through the cold weather," said
   </p>
   <p>
    Danny. "Two or three of the old ones have been here for years, and are
   </p>
   <p>
    as much belonging to Deephaven as the meetin'-house; but the rest of
   </p>
   <p>
    them an't to be depended on. You'll miss the young ones by the dozen,
   </p>
   <p>
    come spring. I don't know myself but they move inland in the fall of the
   </p>
   <p>
    year; they're knowing enough, if that's all!"
   </p>
   <p>
    Kate and I stood in the wide doorway, arm in arm, looking sometimes at
   </p>
   <p>
    the queer fisherman and the porgies, and sometimes out to sea. It was
   </p>
   <p>
    low tide; the wind had risen a little, and the heavy salt air blew
   </p>
   <p>
    toward us from the wet brown ledges in the rocky harbor. The sea was
   </p>
   <p>
    bright blue, and the sun was shining. Two gulls were swinging lazily to
   </p>
   <p>
    and fro; there was a flock of sand-pipers down by the water's edge, in a
   </p>
   <p>
    great hurry, as usual.
   </p>
   <p>
    Presently the fisherman spoke again, beginning with an odd laugh: "I
   </p>
   <p>
    was scared last winter! Jack Scudder and me, we were up in the Cap'n
   </p>
   <p>
    Manning storehouse hunting for a half-bar'l of salt the skipper said was
   </p>
   <p>
    there. It was an awful blustering kind of day, with a thin icy rain
   </p>
   <p>
    blowing from all points at once; sea roaring as if it wished it could
   </p>
   <p>
    come ashore and put a stop to everything. Bad days at sea, them are;
   </p>
   <p>
    rigging all froze up. As I was saying, we were hunting for a half-bar'l
   </p>
   <p>
    of salt, and I laid hold of a bar'l that had something heavy in the
   </p>
   <p>
    bottom, and tilted it up, and my eye! there was a stir and a scratch and
   </p>
   <p>
    a squeal, and out went some kind of a creatur', and I jumped back, not
   </p>
   <p>
    looking for anything live, but I see in a minute it was a cat; and
   </p>
   <p>
    perhaps you think it is a big story, but there were eight more in there,
   </p>
   <p>
    hived in together to keep warm. I car'd 'em up some new fish that night;
   </p>
   <p>
    they seemed short of provisions. We hadn't been out fishing as much as
   </p>
   <p>
    common, and they hadn't dared to be round the fish-houses much, for a
   </p>
   <p>
    fellow who came in on a coaster had a dog, and he used to chase 'em.
   </p>
   <p>
    Hard chance they had, and lots of 'em died, I guess; but there seem to
   </p>
   <p>
    be some survivin' relatives, an' al'ays just so hungry! I used to feed
   </p>
   <p>
    them some when I was ashore. I think likely you've heard that a cat will
   </p>
   <p>
    fetch you bad luck; but I don't know's that made much difference to me.
   </p>
   <p>
    I kind of like to keep on the right side of 'em, too; if ever I have a
   </p>
   <p>
    bad dream there's sure to be a cat in it; but I was brought up to be
   </p>
   <p>
    clever to dumb beasts, an' I guess it's my natur'. Except fish," said
   </p>
   <p>
    Danny after a minute's thought; "but then it never seems like they had
   </p>
   <p>
    feelin's like creatur's that live ashore." And we all laughed heartily
   </p>
   <p>
    and felt well acquainted.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I s'pose you misses will laugh if I tell ye I kept a kitty once
   </p>
   <p>
    myself." This was said rather shyly, and there was evidently a story, so
   </p>
   <p>
    we were much interested, and Kate said, "Please tell us about it; was it
   </p>
   <p>
    at sea?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes, it was at sea; leastways, on a coaster. I got her in a sing'lar
   </p>
   <p>
    kind of way: it was one afternoon we were lying alongside Charlestown
   </p>
   <p>
    Bridge, and I heard a young cat screeching real pitiful; and after I
   </p>
   <p>
    looked all round, I see her in the water clutching on to the pier of the
   </p>
   <p>
    bridge, and some little divils of boys were heaving rocks down at her. I
   </p>
   <p>
    got into the schooner's tag-boat quick, I tell ye, and pushed off for
   </p>
   <p>
    her, 'n' she let go just as I got there, 'n' I guess you never saw a
   </p>
   <p>
    more miser'ble-looking creatur' than I fished out of the water. Cold
   </p>
   <p>
    weather it was. Her leg was hurt, and her eye, and I thought first I'd
   </p>
   <p>
    drop her overboard again, and then I didn't, and I took her aboard the
   </p>
   <p>
    schooner and put her by the stove. I thought she might as well die where
   </p>
   <p>
    it was warm. She eat a little mite of chowder before night, but she was
   </p>
   <p>
    very slim; but next morning, when I went to see if she was dead, she
   </p>
   <p>
    fell to licking my finger, and she did purr away like a dolphin. One of
   </p>
   <p>
    her eyes was out, where a stone had took her, and she never got any use
   </p>
   <p>
    of it, but she used to look at you so clever with the other, and she got
   </p>
   <p>
    well of her lame foot after a while. I got to be ter'ble fond of her.
   </p>
   <p>
    She was just the knowingest thing you ever saw, and she used to sleep
   </p>
   <p>
    alongside of me in my bunk, and like as not she would go on deck with me
   </p>
   <p>
    when it was my watch. I was coasting then for a year and eight months,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I kept her all the time. We used to be in harbor consider'ble, and
   </p>
   <p>
    about eight o'clock in the forenoon I used to drop a line and catch her
   </p>
   <p>
    a couple of cunners. Now, it is cur'us that she used to know when I was
   </p>
   <p>
    fishing for her. She would pounce on them fish and carry them off and
   </p>
   <p>
    growl, and she knew when I got a bite,--she'd watch the line; but when
   </p>
   <p>
    we were mackereling she never give us any trouble. She would never lift
   </p>
   <p>
    a paw to touch any of our fish. She didn't have the thieving ways common
   </p>
   <p>
    to most cats. She used to set round on deck in fair weather, and when
   </p>
   <p>
    the wind blew she al'ays kept herself below. Sometimes when we were in
   </p>
   <p>
    port she would go ashore awhile, and fetch back a bird or a mouse, but
   </p>
   <p>
    she wouldn't eat it till she come and showed it to me. She never wanted
   </p>
   <p>
    to stop long ashore, though I never shut her up; I always give her her
   </p>
   <p>
    liberty. I got a good deal of joking about her from the fellows, but she
   </p>
   <p>
    was a sight of company. I don' know as I ever had anything like me as
   </p>
   <p>
    much as she did. Not to say as I ever had much of any trouble with
   </p>
   <p>
    anybody, ashore or afloat. I'm a still kind of fellow, for all I look so
   </p>
   <p>
    rough.
   </p>
   <p>
    "But then, I han't had a home, what I call a home, since I was going on
   </p>
   <p>
    nine year old."
   </p>
   <p>
    "How has that happened?" asked Kate.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Well, mother, she died, and I was bound out to a man in the tanning
   </p>
   <p>
    trade, and I hated him, and I hated the trade; and when I was a little
   </p>
   <p>
    bigger I ran away, and I've followed the sea ever since. I wasn't much
   </p>
   <p>
    use to him, I guess; leastways, he never took the trouble to hunt me up.
   </p>
   <p>
    "About the best place I ever was in was a hospital. It was in foreign
   </p>
   <p>
    parts. Ye see I'm crippled some? I fell from the topsail yard to the
   </p>
   <p>
    deck, and I struck my shoulder, and broke my leg, and banged myself all
   </p>
   <p>
    up. It was to a nuns' hospital where they took me. All of the nuns were
   </p>
   <p>
    Catholics, and they wore big white things on their heads. I don't
   </p>
   <p>
    suppose you ever saw any. Have you? Well, now, that's queer! When I was
   </p>
   <p>
    first there I was scared of them; they were real ladies, and I wasn't
   </p>
   <p>
    used to being in a house, any way. One of them, that took care of me
   </p>
   <p>
    most of the time, why, she would even set up half the night with me, and
   </p>
   <p>
    I couldn't begin to tell you how good-natured she was, an' she'd look
   </p>
   <p>
    real sorry too. I used to be ugly, I ached so, along in the first of my
   </p>
   <p>
    being there, but I spoke of it when I was coming away, and she said it
   </p>
   <p>
    was all right. She used to feed me, that lady did; and there were some
   </p>
   <p>
    days I couldn't lift my head, and she would rise it on her arm. She give
   </p>
   <p>
    me a little mite of a book, when I come away. I'm not much of a hand at
   </p>
   <p>
    reading, but I always kept it on account of her. She was so pleased when
   </p>
   <p>
    I got so's to set up in a chair and look out of the window. She wasn't
   </p>
   <p>
    much of a hand to talk English. I did feel bad to come away from there;
   </p>
   <p>
    I 'most wished I could be sick a while longer. I never said much of
   </p>
   <p>
    anything either, and I don't know but she thought it was queer, but I am
   </p>
   <p>
    a dreadful clumsy man to say anything, and I got flustered. I don't
   </p>
   <p>
    know's I mind telling you; I was 'most a-crying. I used to think I'd lay
   </p>
   <p>
    by some money and ship for there and carry her something real pretty.
   </p>
   <p>
    But I don't rank able-bodied seaman like I used, and it's as much as I
   </p>
   <p>
    can do to get a berth on a coaster; I suppose I might go as cook. I
   </p>
   <p>
    liked to have died with my hurt at that hospital, but when I was getting
   </p>
   <p>
    well it made me think of when I was a mite of a chap to home before
   </p>
   <p>
    mother died, to be laying there in a clean bed with somebody to do for
   </p>
   <p>
    me. Guess you think I'm a good hand to spin long yarns; somehow it comes
   </p>
   <p>
    easy to talk to-day."
   </p>
   <p>
    "What became of your cat?" asked Kate, after a pause, during which our
   </p>
   <p>
    friend sliced away at the porgies.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I never rightfully knew; it was in Salem harbor, and a windy night. I
   </p>
   <p>
    was on deck consider'ble, for the schooner pitched lively, and once or
   </p>
   <p>
    twice she dragged her anchor. I never saw the kitty after she eat her
   </p>
   <p>
    supper. I remember I gave her some milk,--I used to buy her a pint once
   </p>
   <p>
    in a while for a treat; I don't know but she might have gone off on a
   </p>
   <p>
    cake of ice, but it did seem as if she had too much sense for that. Most
   </p>
   <p>
    likely she missed her footing, and fell overboard in the dark. She was
   </p>
   <p>
    marked real pretty, black and white, and kep' herself just as clean! She
   </p>
   <p>
    knew as well as could be when foul weather was coming; she would bother
   </p>
   <p>
    round and act queer; but when the sun was out she would sit round on
   </p>
   <p>
    deck as pleased as a queen. There! I feel bad sometimes when I think of
   </p>
   <p>
    her, and I never went into Salem since without hoping that I should see
   </p>
   <p>
    her. I don't know but if I was a-going to begin my life over again, I'd
   </p>
   <p>
    settle down ashore and have a snug little house and farm it. But I guess
   </p>
   <p>
    I shall do better at fishing. Give me a trig-built topsail schooner
   </p>
   <p>
    painted up nice, with a stripe on her, and clean sails, and a fresh wind
   </p>
   <p>
    with the sun a-shining, and I feel first-rate."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Do you believe that codfish swallow stones before a storm?" asked Kate.
   </p>
   <p>
    I had been thinking about the lonely fisherman in a sentimental way, and
   </p>
   <p>
    so irrelevant a question shocked me. "I saw he felt slightly embarrassed
   </p>
   <p>
    at having talked about his affairs so much," Kate told me afterward,
   </p>
   <p>
    "and I thought we should leave him feeling more at his ease if we talked
   </p>
   <p>
    about fish for a while." And sure enough he did seem relieved, and gave
   </p>
   <p>
    us his opinion about the codfish at once, adding that he never cared
   </p>
   <p>
    much for cod any way; folks up country bought 'em a good deal, he heard.
   </p>
   <p>
    Give him a haddock right out of the water for his dinner!
   </p>
   <p>
    "I never can remember," said Kate, "whether it is cod or haddock that
   </p>
   <p>
    have a black stripe along their sides--"
   </p>
   <p>
    "O, those are haddock," said I; "they say that the Devil caught a
   </p>
   <p>
    haddock once, and it slipped through his fingers and got scorched; so
   </p>
   <p>
    all the haddock had the same mark afterward."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Well, now, how did you know that old story?" said Danny, laughing
   </p>
   <p>
    heartily; "ye mustn't believe all the old stories ye hear, mind ye!"
   </p>
   <p>
    "O, no," said we.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Hullo! There's Jim Toggerson's boat close in shore. She sets low in
   </p>
   <p>
    the water, so he's done well. He and Skipper Scudder have been out
   </p>
   <p>
    deep-sea fishing since yesterday."
   </p>
   <p>
    Our friend pushed the porgies back into a corner, stuck his knife into a
   </p>
   <p>
    beam, and we hurried down to the shore. Kate and I sat on the pebbles,
   </p>
   <p>
    and he went out to the moorings in a dirty dory to help unload the fish.
   </p>
   <p>
    We afterward saw a great deal of Danny, as all the men called him. But
   </p>
   <p>
    though Kate and I tried our best and used our utmost skill and tact to
   </p>
   <p>
    make him tell us more about himself, he never did. But perhaps there was
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing more to be told.
   </p>
   <p>
    The day we left Deephaven we went down to the shore to say good by to
   </p>
   <p>
    him and to some other friends, and he said, "Goin', are ye? Well, I'm
   </p>
   <p>
    sorry; ye've treated me first-rate; the Lord bless ye!" and then was so
   </p>
   <p>
    much mortified at the way he had said farewell that he turned and fled
   </p>
   <p>
    round the corner of the fish-house.
   </p>
   <p>
    Captain Sands
   </p>
   <p>
    Old Captain Sands was one of the most prominent citizens of Deephaven,
   </p>
   <p>
    and a very good friend of Kate's and mine. We often met him, and grew
   </p>
   <p>
    much interested in him before we knew him well. He had a reputation in
   </p>
   <p>
    town for being peculiar and somewhat visionary; but every one seemed to
   </p>
   <p>
    like him, and at last one morning, when we happened to be on our way to
   </p>
   <p>
    the wharves, we stopped at the door of an old warehouse which we had
   </p>
   <p>
    never seen opened before. Captain Sands sat just inside, smoking his
   </p>
   <p>
    pipe, and we said good morning, and asked him if he did not think there
   </p>
   <p>
    was a fog coming in by and by. We had thought a little of going out to
   </p>
   <p>
    the lighthouse. The cap'n rose slowly, and came out so that he could see
   </p>
   <p>
    farther round to the east. "There's some scud coming in a'ready," said
   </p>
   <p>
    he. "None to speak of yet, I don't know's you can see it,--yes, you're
   </p>
   <p>
    right; there's a heavy bank of fog lyin' off, but it won't be in under
   </p>
   <p>
    two or three hours yet, unless the wind backs round more and freshens
   </p>
   <p>
    up. Weren't thinking of going out, were ye?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "A little," said Kate, "but we had nearly given it up. We are getting to
   </p>
   <p>
    be very weather-wise, and we pride ourselves on being quick at seeing
   </p>
   <p>
    fogs." At which the cap'n smiled and said we were consider'ble young to
   </p>
   <p>
    know much about weather, but it looked well that we took some interest
   </p>
   <p>
    in it; most young people were fools about weather, and would just as
   </p>
   <p>
    soon set off to go anywhere right under the edge of a thunder-shower.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Come in and set down, won't ye?" he added; "it ain't much of a place;
   </p>
   <p>
    I've got a lot of old stuff stowed away here that the women-folks don't
   </p>
   <p>
    want up to the house. I'm a great hand for keeping things." And he
   </p>
   <p>
    looked round fondly at the contents of the wide low room. "I come down
   </p>
   <p>
    here once in a while and let in the sun, and sometimes I want to hunt up
   </p>
   <p>
    something or 'nother; kind of stow-away place, ye see." And then he
   </p>
   <p>
    laughed apologetically, rubbing his hands together, and looking out to
   </p>
   <p>
    sea again as if he wished to appear unconcerned; yet we saw that he
   </p>
   <p>
    wondered if we thought it ridiculous for a man of his age to have
   </p>
   <p>
    treasured up so much trumpery in that cobwebby place. There were some
   </p>
   <p>
    whole oars and the sail of his boat and two or three killicks and
   </p>
   <p>
    painters, not to forget a heap of worn-out oars and sails in one corner
   </p>
   <p>
    and a sailor's hammock slung across the beam overhead, and there were
   </p>
   <p>
    some sailor's chests and the capstan of a ship and innumerable boxes
   </p>
   <p>
    which all seemed to be stuffed full, besides no end of things lying on
   </p>
   <p>
    the floor and packed away on shelves and hanging to rusty big-headed
   </p>
   <p>
    nails in the wall. I saw some great lumps of coral, and large, rough
   </p>
   <p>
    shells, a great hornet's nest, and a monstrous lobster-shell. The cap'n
   </p>
   <p>
    had cobbled and tied up some remarkable old chairs for the accommodation
   </p>
   <p>
    of himself and his friends.
   </p>
   <p>
    "What a nice place!" said Kate in a frank, delighted way which could not
   </p>
   <p>
    have failed to be gratifying.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Well, no," said the cap'n, with his slow smile, "it ain't what you'd
   </p>
   <p>
    rightly call 'nice,' as I know of: it ain't never been cleared out all
   </p>
   <p>
    at once since I began putting in. There's nothing that's worth anything,
   </p>
   <p>
    either, to anybody but me. Wife, she's said to me a hundred times, 'Why
   </p>
   <p>
    don't you overhaul them old things and burn 'em?' She's al'ays at me
   </p>
   <p>
    about letting the property, as if it were a corner-lot in Broadway.
   </p>
   <p>
    That's all women-folks know about business!" And here the captain caught
   </p>
   <p>
    himself tripping, and looked uneasy for a minute. "I suppose I might
   </p>
   <p>
    have let it for a fish-house, but it's most too far from the shore to be
   </p>
   <p>
    handy--and--well--there are some things here that I set a good deal by."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Isn't that a sword-fish's sword in that piece of wood?" Kate asked
   </p>
   <p>
    presently; and was answered that it was found broken off as we saw it,
   </p>
   <p>
    in the hull of a wreck that went ashore on Blue P'int when the captain
   </p>
   <p>
    was a young man, and he had sawed it out and kept it ever
   </p>
   <p>
    since,--fifty-nine years. Of course we went closer to look at it, and we
   </p>
   <p>
    both felt a great sympathy for this friend of ours, because we have the
   </p>
   <p>
    same fashion of keeping worthless treasures, and we understood perfectly
   </p>
   <p>
    how dear such things may be.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Do you mind if we look round a little?" I asked doubtfully, for I knew
   </p>
   <p>
    how I should hate having strangers look over my own treasury. But
   </p>
   <p>
    Captain Sands looked pleased at our interest, and said cheerfully that
   </p>
   <p>
    we might overhaul as much as we chose. Kate discovered first an old
   </p>
   <p>
    battered wooden figure-head of a ship,--a woman's head with long curly
   </p>
   <p>
    hair falling over the shoulders. The paint was almost gone, and the dust
   </p>
   <p>
    covered most of what was left: still there was a wonderful spirit and
   </p>
   <p>
    grace, and a wild, weird beauty which attracted us exceedingly; but the
   </p>
   <p>
    captain could only tell us that it had belonged to the wreck of a Danish
   </p>
   <p>
    brig which had been driven on the reef where the lighthouse stands now,
   </p>
   <p>
    and his father had found this on the long sands a day or two afterward.
   </p>
   <p>
    "That was a dreadful storm," said the captain. "I've heard the old folks
   </p>
   <p>
    tell about it; it was when I was only a year or two old. There were
   </p>
   <p>
    three merchantmen wrecked within five miles of Deephaven. This one was
   </p>
   <p>
    all stove to splinters, and they used to say she had treasure aboard.
   </p>
   <p>
    When I was small I used to have a great idea of going out there to the
   </p>
   <p>
    rocks at low water and trying to find some gold, but I never made out no
   </p>
   <p>
    great." And he smiled indulgently at the thought of his youthful dream.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Kate," said I, "do you see what beauties these Turk's-head knots are?"
   </p>
   <p>
    We had been taking a course of first lessons in knots from Danny, and
   </p>
   <p>
    had followed by learning some charmingly intricate ones from Captain
   </p>
   <p>
    Lant, the stranded mariner who lived on a farm two miles or so inland.
   </p>
   <p>
    Kate came over to look at the Turk's-heads, which were at either end of
   </p>
   <p>
    the rope handles of a little dark-blue chest.
   </p>
   <p>
    Captain Sands turned in his chair and nodded approval. "That's a neat
   </p>
   <p>
    piece of work, and it was a first-rate seaman who did it; he's dead and
   </p>
   <p>
    gone years ago, poor young fellow; an I-talian he was, who sailed on the
   </p>
   <p>
    Ranger three or four long voyages. He fell from the mast-head on the
   </p>
   <p>
    voyage home from Callao. Cap'n Manning and old Mr. Lorimer, they owned
   </p>
   <p>
    the Ranger, and when she come into port and they got the news they took
   </p>
   <p>
    it as much to heart as if he'd been some relation. He was smart as a
   </p>
   <p>
    whip, and had a way with him, and the pleasantest kind of a voice; you
   </p>
   <p>
    couldn't help liking him. They found out that he had a mother alive in
   </p>
   <p>
    Port Mahon, and they sent his pay and some money he had in the bank at
   </p>
   <p>
    Riverport out to her by a ship that was going to the Mediterranean. He
   </p>
   <p>
    had some clothes in his chest, and they sold those and sent her the
   </p>
   <p>
    money,--all but some trinkets they supposed he was keeping for her; I
   </p>
   <p>
    rec'lect he used to speak consider'ble about his mother. I shipped one
   </p>
   <p>
    v'y'ge with him before the mast, before I went out mate of the Daylight.
   </p>
   <p>
    I happened to be in port the time the Ranger got in, an' I see this
   </p>
   <p>
    chist lying round in Cap'n Manning's storehouse, and I offered to give
   </p>
   <p>
    him what it was worth; but we was good friends, and he told me take it
   </p>
   <p>
    if I wanted it, it was no use to him, and I've kept it ever since.
   </p>
   <p>
    "There are some of his traps in it now, I believe; ye can look." And we
   </p>
   <p>
    took off some tangled cod-lines and opened the chest. There was only a
   </p>
   <p>
    round wooden box in the till, and in some idle hour at sea the young
   </p>
   <p>
    sailor had carved his initials and an anchor and the date on the cover.
   </p>
   <p>
    We found some sail-needles and a palm in this "kit," as the sailors call
   </p>
   <p>
    it, and a little string of buttons with some needles and yarn and thread
   </p>
   <p>
    in a neat little bag, which perhaps his mother had made for him when he
   </p>
   <p>
    started off on his first voyage. Besides these things there was only a
   </p>
   <p>
    fanciful little broken buckle, green and gilt, which he might have
   </p>
   <p>
    picked up in some foreign street, and his protection-paper carefully
   </p>
   <p>
    folded, wherein he was certified as being a citizen of the United
   </p>
   <p>
    States, with dark complexion and dark hair.
   </p>
   <p>
    "He was one of the pleasantest fellows that ever I shipped with," said
   </p>
   <p>
    the captain, with a gruff tenderness in his voice. "Always willin' to do
   </p>
   <p>
    his work himself, and like's not when the other fellows up the rigging
   </p>
   <p>
    were cold, or ugly about something or 'nother, he'd say something that
   </p>
   <p>
    would set them all laughing, and somehow it made you good-natured to see
   </p>
   <p>
    him round. He was brought up a Catholic, I s'pose; anyway, he had some
   </p>
   <p>
    beads, and sometimes they would joke him about 'em on board ship, but he
   </p>
   <p>
    would blaze up in a minute, ugly as a tiger. I never saw him mad about
   </p>
   <p>
    anything else, though he wouldn't stand it if anybody tried to crowd
   </p>
   <p>
    him. He fell from the main-to'-gallant yard to the deck, and was dead
   </p>
   <p>
    when they picked him up. They were off the Bermudas. I suppose he lost
   </p>
   <p>
    his balance, but I never could see how; he was sure-footed, and as quick
   </p>
   <p>
    as a cat. They said they saw him try to catch at the stay, but there was
   </p>
   <p>
    a heavy sea running, and the ship rolled just so's to let him through
   </p>
   <p>
    between the rigging, and he struck the deck like a stone. I don't
   </p>
   <p>
    know's that chest has been opened these ten years,--I declare it carries
   </p>
   <p>
    me back to look at those poor little traps of his. Well, it's the way of
   </p>
   <p>
    the world; we think we're somebody, and we have our day, but it isn't
   </p>
   <p>
    long afore we're forgotten."
   </p>
   <p>
    The captain reached over for the paper, and taking out a clumsy pair of
   </p>
   <p>
    steel-bowed spectacles, read it through carefully. "I'll warrant he took
   </p>
   <p>
    good care of this," said he. "He was an I-talian, and no more of an
   </p>
   <p>
    American citizen than a Chinese; I wonder he hadn't called himself John
   </p>
   <p>
    Jones, that's the name most of the foreigners used to take when they got
   </p>
   <p>
    their papers. I remember once I was sick with a fever in Chelsea
   </p>
   <p>
    Hospital, and one morning they came bringing in the mate of a Portugee
   </p>
   <p>
    brig on a stretcher, and the surgeon asked what his name was. 'John
   </p>
   <p>
    Jones,' says he. 'O, say something else,' says the surgeon; 'we've got
   </p>
   <p>
    five John Joneses here a'ready, and it's getting to be no name at all.'
   </p>
   <p>
    Sailors are great hands for false names; they have a trick of using them
   </p>
   <p>
    when they have any money to leave ashore, for fear their shipmates will
   </p>
   <p>
    go and draw it out. I suppose there are thousands of dollars unclaimed
   </p>
   <p>
    in New York banks, where men have left it charged to their false names;
   </p>
   <p>
    then they get lost at sea or something, and never go to get it, and
   </p>
   <p>
    nobody knows whose it is. They're curious folks, take 'em altogether,
   </p>
   <p>
    sailors is; specially these foreign fellows that wander about from ship
   </p>
   <p>
    to ship. They're getting to be a dreadful low set, too, of late years.
   </p>
   <p>
    It's the last thing I'd want a boy of mine to do,--ship before the mast
   </p>
   <p>
    with one of these mixed crews. It's a dog's life, anyway, and the risks
   </p>
   <p>
    and the chances against you are awful. It's a good while before you can
   </p>
   <p>
    lay up anything, unless you are part owner. I saw all the p'ints a good
   </p>
   <p>
    deal plainer after I quit followin' the sea myself, though I've always
   </p>
   <p>
    been more or less into navigation until this last war come on. I know
   </p>
   <p>
    when I was ship's husband of the Polly and Susan there was a young man
   </p>
   <p>
    went out cap'n of her,--her last voyage, and she never was heard from.
   </p>
   <p>
    He had a wife and two or three little children, and for all he was so
   </p>
   <p>
    smart, they would have been about the same as beggars, if I hadn't
   </p>
   <p>
    happened to have his life insured the day I was having the papers made
   </p>
   <p>
    out for the ship. I happened to think of it. Five thousand dollars there
   </p>
   <p>
    was, and I sent it to the widow along with his primage. She hadn't
   </p>
   <p>
    expected nothing, or next to nothing, and she was pleased, I tell ye."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I think it was very kind in you to think of that, Captain Sands," said
   </p>
   <p>
    Kate. And the old man said, flushing a little, "Well, I'm not so smart
   </p>
   <p>
    as some of the men who started when I did, and some of 'em went ahead of
   </p>
   <p>
    me, but some of 'em didn't, after all. I've tried to be honest, and to
   </p>
   <p>
    do just about as nigh right as I could, and you know there's an old
   </p>
   <p>
    sayin' that a cripple in the right road will beat a racer in the wrong."
   </p>
   <p>
    The Circus at Denby
   </p>
   <p>
    Kate and I looked forward to a certain Saturday with as much eagerness
   </p>
   <p>
    as if we had been little school-boys, for on that day we were to go to a
   </p>
   <p>
    circus at Denby, a town perhaps eight miles inland. There had not been a
   </p>
   <p>
    circus so near Deephaven for a long time, and nobody had dared to
   </p>
   <p>
    believe the first rumor of it, until two dashing young men had deigned
   </p>
   <p>
    to come themselves to put up the big posters on the end of 'Bijah
   </p>
   <p>
    Mauley's barn. All the boys in town came as soon as possible to see
   </p>
   <p>
    these amazing pictures, and some were wretched in their secret hearts at
   </p>
   <p>
    the thought that they might not see the show itself. Tommy Dockum was
   </p>
   <p>
    more interested than any one else, and mentioned the subject so
   </p>
   <p>
    frequently one day when he went blackberrying with us, that we grew
   </p>
   <p>
    enthusiastic, and told each other what fun it would be to go, for
   </p>
   <p>
    everybody would be there, and it would be the greatest loss to us if we
   </p>
   <p>
    were absent. I thought I had lost my childish fondness for circuses, but
   </p>
   <p>
    it came back redoubled; and Kate may contradict me if she chooses, but I
   </p>
   <p>
    am sure she never looked forward to the Easter Oratorio with half the
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasure she did to this "caravan," as most of the people called it.
   </p>
   <p>
    We felt that it was a great pity that any of the boys and girls should
   </p>
   <p>
    be left lamenting at home, and finding that there were some of our
   </p>
   <p>
    acquaintances and Tommy's who saw no chance of going, we engaged Jo
   </p>
   <p>
    Sands and Leander Dockum to carry them to Denby in two fish-wagons, with
   </p>
   <p>
    boards laid across for the extra seats. We saw them join the straggling
   </p>
   <p>
    train of carriages which had begun to go through the village from all
   </p>
   <p>
    along shore, soon after daylight, and they started on their journey
   </p>
   <p>
    shouting and carousing, with their pockets crammed with early apples and
   </p>
   <p>
    other provisions. We thought it would have been fun enough to see the
   </p>
   <p>
    people go by, for we had had no idea until then how many inhabitants
   </p>
   <p>
    that country held.
   </p>
   <p>
    We had asked Mrs. Kew to go with us; but she was half an hour later than
   </p>
   <p>
    she had promised, for, since there was no wind, she could not come
   </p>
   <p>
    ashore in the sail-boat, and Mr. Kew had had to row her in in the dory.
   </p>
   <p>
    We saw the boat at last nearly in shore, and drove down to meet it: even
   </p>
   <p>
    the horse seemed to realize what a great day it was, and showed a
   </p>
   <p>
    disposition to friskiness, evidently as surprising to himself as to us.
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs. Kew was funnier that day than we had ever known her, which is
   </p>
   <p>
    saying a great deal, and we should not have had half so good a time if
   </p>
   <p>
    she had not been with us; although she lived in the lighthouse, and had
   </p>
   <p>
    no chance to "see passing," which a woman prizes so highly in the
   </p>
   <p>
    country, she had a wonderful memory for faces, and could tell us the
   </p>
   <p>
    names of all Deephaveners and of most of the people we met outside its
   </p>
   <p>
    limits. She looked impressed and solemn as she hurried up from the
   </p>
   <p>
    water's edge, giving Mr. Kew some parting charges over her shoulder as
   </p>
   <p>
    he pushed off the boat to go back; but after we had convinced her that
   </p>
   <p>
    the delay had not troubled us, she seemed more cheerful. It was evident
   </p>
   <p>
    that she felt the importance of the occasion, and that she was pleased
   </p>
   <p>
    at our having chosen her for company. She threw back her veil entirely,
   </p>
   <p>
    sat very straight, and took immense pains to bow to every acquaintance
   </p>
   <p>
    whom she met. She wore her best Sunday clothes, and her manner was
   </p>
   <p>
    formal for the first few minutes; it was evident that she felt we were
   </p>
   <p>
    meeting under unusual circumstances, and that, although we had often met
   </p>
   <p>
    before on the friendliest terms, our having asked her to make this
   </p>
   <p>
    excursion in public required a different sort of behavior at her hands,
   </p>
   <p>
    and a due amount of ceremony and propriety. But this state of things did
   </p>
   <p>
    not last long, as she soon made a remark at which Kate and I laughed so
   </p>
   <p>
    heartily in lighthouse-acquaintance fashion, that she unbent, and gave
   </p>
   <p>
    her whole mind to enjoying herself.
   </p>
   <p>
    When we came by the store where the post-office was kept we saw a small
   </p>
   <p>
    knot of people gathered round the door, and stopped to see what had
   </p>
   <p>
    happened. There was a forlorn horse standing near, with his harness tied
   </p>
   <p>
    up with fuzzy ends of rope, and the wagon was cobbled together with
   </p>
   <p>
    pieces of board; the whole craft looked as if it might be wrecked with
   </p>
   <p>
    the least jar. In the wagon were four or five stupid-looking boys and
   </p>
   <p>
    girls, one of whom was crying softly. Their father was sick, some one
   </p>
   <p>
    told us. "He was took faint, but he is coming to all right; they have
   </p>
   <p>
    give him something to take: their name is Craper, and they live way over
   </p>
   <p>
    beyond the Ridge, on Stone Hill. They were goin' over to Denby to the
   </p>
   <p>
    circus, and the man was calc'lating to get doctored, but I d' know's he
   </p>
   <p>
    can get so fur; he's powerful slim-looking to me." Kate and I went to
   </p>
   <p>
    see if we could be of any use, and when we went into the store we saw
   </p>
   <p>
    the man leaning back in his chair, looking ghastly pale, and as if he
   </p>
   <p>
    were far gone in consumption. Kate spoke to him, and he said he was
   </p>
   <p>
    better; he had felt bad all the way along, but he hadn't given up. He
   </p>
   <p>
    was pitiful, poor fellow, with his evident attempt at dressing up. He
   </p>
   <p>
    had the bushiest, dustiest red hair and whiskers, which made the pallor
   </p>
   <p>
    of his face still more striking, and his illness had thinned and paled
   </p>
   <p>
    his rough, clumsy hands. I thought what a hard piece of work it must
   </p>
   <p>
    have been for him to start for the circus that morning, and how
   </p>
   <p>
    kind-hearted he must be to have made such an effort for his children's
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasure. As we went out they stared at us gloomily. The shadow of their
   </p>
   <p>
    disappointment touched and chilled our pleasure.
   </p>
   <p>
    Somebody had turned the horse so that he was heading toward home, and by
   </p>
   <p>
    his actions he showed that he was the only one of the party who was
   </p>
   <p>
    glad. We were so sorry for the children; perhaps it had promised to be
   </p>
   <p>
    the happiest day of their lives, and now they must go back to their
   </p>
   <p>
    uninteresting home without having seen the great show.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I am so sorry you are disappointed," said Kate, as we were wondering
   </p>
   <p>
    how the man who had followed us could ever climb into the wagon.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Heh?" said he, blankly, as if he did not know what her words meant.
   </p>
   <p>
    "What fool has been a turning o' this horse?" he asked a man who was
   </p>
   <p>
    looking on.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Why, which way be ye goin'?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "To the circus," said Mr. Craper, with decision, "where d'ye s'pose?
   </p>
   <p>
    That's where I started for, anyways." And he climbed in and glanced
   </p>
   <p>
    round to count the children, struck the horse with the willow switch,
   </p>
   <p>
    and they started off briskly, while everybody laughed. Kate and I joined
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs. Kew, who had enjoyed the scene.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Well, there!" said she, "I wonder the folks in the old North
   </p>
   <p>
    burying-ground ain't a-rising up to go to Denby to that caravan!"
   </p>
   <p>
    We reached Denby at noon; it was an uninteresting town which had grown
   </p>
   <p>
    up around some mills. There was a great commotion in the streets, and it
   </p>
   <p>
    was evident that we had lost much in not having seen the procession.
   </p>
   <p>
    There was a great deal of business going on in the shops, and there were
   </p>
   <p>
    two or three hand-organs at large, near one of which we stopped awhile
   </p>
   <p>
    to listen, just after we had met Leander and given the horse into his
   </p>
   <p>
    charge. Mrs. Kew finished her shopping as soon as possible, and we
   </p>
   <p>
    hurried toward the great tents, where all the flags were flying. I think
   </p>
   <p>
    I have not told you that we were to have the benefit of seeing a
   </p>
   <p>
    menagerie in addition to the circus, and you may be sure we went
   </p>
   <p>
    faithfully round to see everything that the cages held.
   </p>
   <p>
    I cannot truthfully say that it was a good show; it was somewhat dreary,
   </p>
   <p>
    now that I think of it quietly and without excitement. The creatures
   </p>
   <p>
    looked tired, and as if they had been on the road for a great many
   </p>
   <p>
    years. The animals were all old, and there was a shabby great elephant
   </p>
   <p>
    whose look of general discouragement went to my heart, for it seemed as
   </p>
   <p>
    if he were miserably conscious of a misspent life. He stood dejected and
   </p>
   <p>
    motionless at one side of the tent, and it was hard to believe that
   </p>
   <p>
    there was a spark of vitality left in him. A great number of the people
   </p>
   <p>
    had never seen an elephant before, and we heard a thin little old man,
   </p>
   <p>
    who stood near us, say delightedly, "There's the old creatur', and no
   </p>
   <p>
    mistake, Ann 'Liza. I wanted to see him most of anything. My sakes
   </p>
   <p>
    alive, ain't he big!"
   </p>
   <p>
    And Ann 'Liza, who was stout and sleepy-looking, droned out, "Ye-es,
   </p>
   <p>
    there's consider'ble of him; but he looks as if he ain't got no
   </p>
   <p>
    animation."
   </p>
   <p>
    Kate and I turned away and laughed, while Mrs. Kew said confidentially,
   </p>
   <p>
    as the couple moved away, "She needn't be a reflectin' on the poor
   </p>
   <p>
    beast. That's Mis Seth Tanner, and there isn't a woman in Deephaven nor
   </p>
   <p>
    East Parish to be named the same day with her for laziness. I'm glad she
   </p>
   <p>
    didn't catch sight of me; she'd have talked about nothing for a
   </p>
   <p>
    fortnight."
   </p>
   <p>
    There was a picture of a huge snake in Deephaven, and I was just
   </p>
   <p>
    wondering where he could be, or if there ever had been one, when we
   </p>
   <p>
    heard a boy ask the same question of the man whose thankless task it was
   </p>
   <p>
    to stir up the lions with a stick to make them roar. "The snake's dead,"
   </p>
   <p>
    he answered good-naturedly. "Didn't you have to dig an awful long grave
   </p>
   <p>
    for him?" asked the boy; but the man said he reckoned they curled him up
   </p>
   <p>
    some, and smiled as he turned to his lions, who looked as if they needed
   </p>
   <p>
    a tonic. Everybody lingered longest before the monkeys, who seemed to be
   </p>
   <p>
    the only lively creatures in the whole collection; and finally we made
   </p>
   <p>
    our way into the other tent, and perched ourselves on a high seat, from
   </p>
   <p>
    whence we had a capital view of the audience and the ring, and could see
   </p>
   <p>
    the people come in. Mrs. Kew was on the lookout for acquaintances, and
   </p>
   <p>
    her spirits as well as our own seemed to rise higher and higher. She was
   </p>
   <p>
    on the alert, moving her head this way and that to catch sight of
   </p>
   <p>
    people, giving us a running commentary in the mean time. It was very
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasant to see a person so happy as Mrs. Kew was that day, and I dare
   </p>
   <p>
    say in speaking of the occasion she would say the same thing of Kate and
   </p>
   <p>
    me,--for it was such a good time! We bought some peanuts, without which
   </p>
   <p>
    no circus seems complete, and we listened to the conversations which
   </p>
   <p>
    were being carried on around us while we were waiting for the
   </p>
   <p>
    performance to begin. There were two old farmers whom we had noticed
   </p>
   <p>
    occasionally in Deephaven; one was telling the other, with great
   </p>
   <p>
    confusion of pronouns, about a big pig which had lately been killed.
   </p>
   <p>
    "John did feel dreadful disappointed at having to kill now," we heard
   </p>
   <p>
    him say, "bein' as he had calc'lated to kill along near Thanksgivin'
   </p>
   <p>
    time; there was goin' to be a new moon then, and he expected to get
   </p>
   <p>
    seventy-five or a hundred pound more on to him. But he didn't seem to
   </p>
   <p>
    gain, and me and 'Bijah both told him he'd be better to kill now, while
   </p>
   <p>
    everything was favor'ble, and if he set out to wait something might
   </p>
   <p>
    happen to him, and then I've always held that you can't get no hog only
   </p>
   <p>
    just so fur, and for my part I don't like these great overgrown
   </p>
   <p>
    creatur's. I like well enough to see a hog that'll weigh six hunderd,
   </p>
   <p>
    just for the beauty on't, but for my eatin' give me one that'll just
   </p>
   <p>
    rise three. 'Bijah's accurate, and he says he is goin' to weigh risin'
   </p>
   <p>
    five hundred and fifty. I shall stop, as I go home, to John's wife's
   </p>
   <p>
    brother's and see if they've got the particulars yet; John was goin' to
   </p>
   <p>
    get the scales this morning. I guess likely consider'ble many'll gather
   </p>
   <p>
    there to-morrow after meeting. John didn't calc'late to cut up till
   </p>
   <p>
    Monday."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I guess likely I 'll stop in to-morrow," said the other man; "I like to
   </p>
   <p>
    see a han'some hog. Chester White, you said? Consider them best, don't
   </p>
   <p>
    ye?" But this question never was answered, for the greater part of the
   </p>
   <p>
    circus company in gorgeous trappings came parading in.
   </p>
   <p>
    The circus was like all other circuses, except that it was shabbier than
   </p>
   <p>
    most, and the performers seemed to have less heart in it than usual.
   </p>
   <p>
    They did their best, and went through with their parts conscientiously,
   </p>
   <p>
    but they looked as if they never had had a good time in their lives. The
   </p>
   <p>
    audience was hilarious, and cheered and laughed at the tired clown until
   </p>
   <p>
    he looked as if he thought his speeches might possibly be funny, after
   </p>
   <p>
    all. We were so glad we had pleased the poor thing; and when he sang a
   </p>
   <p>
    song our satisfaction was still greater, and so he sang it all over
   </p>
   <p>
    again. Perhaps he had been associating with people who were used to
   </p>
   <p>
    circuses. The afternoon was hot, and the boys with Japanese fans and
   </p>
   <p>
    trays of lemonade did a remarkable business for so late in the season;
   </p>
   <p>
    the brass band on the other side of the tent shrieked its very best, and
   </p>
   <p>
    all the young men of the region had brought their girls, and some of
   </p>
   <p>
    these countless pairs of country lovers we watched a great deal, as they
   </p>
   <p>
    "kept company" with more or less depth of satisfaction in each other. We
   </p>
   <p>
    had a grand chance to see the fashions, and there were many old people
   </p>
   <p>
    and a great number of little children, and some families had evidently
   </p>
   <p>
    locked their house door behind them, since they had brought both the dog
   </p>
   <p>
    and the baby.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Doesn't it seem as if you were a child again?" Kate asked me. "I am
   </p>
   <p>
    sure this is just the same as the first circus I ever saw. It grows more
   </p>
   <p>
    and more familiar, and it puzzles me to think they should not have
   </p>
   <p>
    altered in the least while I have changed so much, and have even had
   </p>
   <p>
    time to grow up. You don't know how it is making me remember other
   </p>
   <p>
    things of which I have not thought for years. I was seven years old when
   </p>
   <p>
    I went that first time. Uncle Jack invited me. I had a new parasol, and
   </p>
   <p>
    he laughed because I would hold it over my shoulder when the sun was in
   </p>
   <p>
    my face. He took me into the side-shows and bought me everything I asked
   </p>
   <p>
    for, on the way home, and we did not get home until twilight. The rest
   </p>
   <p>
    of the family had dined at four o'clock and gone out for a long drive,
   </p>
   <p>
    and it was such fun to have our dinner by ourselves. I sat at the head
   </p>
   <p>
    of the table in mamma's place, and when Bridget came down and insisted
   </p>
   <p>
    that I must go to bed, Uncle Jack came softly up stairs and sat by the
   </p>
   <p>
    window, smoking and telling me stories. He ran and hid in the closet
   </p>
   <p>
    when we heard mamma coming up, and when she found him out by the
   </p>
   <p>
    cigar-smoke, and made believe scold him, I thought she was in earnest,
   </p>
   <p>
    and begged him off. Yes; and I remember that Bridget sat in the next
   </p>
   <p>
    room, making her new dress so she could wear it to church next day. I
   </p>
   <p>
    thought it was a beautiful dress, and besought mamma to have one like
   </p>
   <p>
    it. It was bright green with yellow spots all over it," said Kate. "Ah,
   </p>
   <p>
    poor Uncle Jack! he was so good to me! We were always telling stories of
   </p>
   <p>
    what we would do when I was grown up. He died in Canton the next year,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I cried myself ill; but for a long time I thought he might not be
   </p>
   <p>
    dead, after all, and might come home any day. He used to seem so old to
   </p>
   <p>
    me, and he really was just out of college and not so old as I am now.
   </p>
   <p>
    That day at the circus he had a pink rosebud in his buttonhole, and--ah!
   </p>
   <p>
    when have I ever thought of this before!--a woman sat before us who had
   </p>
   <p>
    a stiff little cape on her bonnet like a shelf, and I carefully put
   </p>
   <p>
    peanuts round the edge of it, and when she moved her head they would
   </p>
   <p>
    fall. I thought it was the best fun in the world, and I wished Uncle
   </p>
   <p>
    Jack to ride the donkey; I was sure he could keep on, because his horse
   </p>
   <p>
    had capered about with him one day on Beacon Street, and I thought him a
   </p>
   <p>
    perfect rider, since nothing had happened to him then."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I remember," said Mrs. Kew, presently, "that just before I was married
   </p>
   <p>
    'he' took me over to Wareham Corners to a caravan. My sister Hannah and
   </p>
   <p>
    the young man who was keeping company with her went too. I haven't been
   </p>
   <p>
    to one since till to-day, and it does carry me back same's it does you,
   </p>
   <p>
    Miss Kate. It doesn't seem more than five years ago, and what would I
   </p>
   <p>
    have thought if I had known 'he' and I were going to keep a lighthouse
   </p>
   <p>
    and be contented there, what's more, and sometimes not get ashore for a
   </p>
   <p>
    fortnight; settled, gray-headed old folks! We were gay enough in those
   </p>
   <p>
    days. I know old Miss Sabrina Smith warned me that I'd better think
   </p>
   <p>
    twice before I took up with Tom Kew, for he was a light-minded young
   </p>
   <p>
    man. I speak o' that to him in the winter-time, when he sets reading the
   </p>
   <p>
    almanac half asleep and I'm knitting, and the wind's a' howling and the
   </p>
   <p>
    waves coming ashore on those rocks as if they wished they could put out
   </p>
   <p>
    the light and blow down the lighthouse. We were reflected on a good deal
   </p>
   <p>
    for going to that caravan; some of the old folks didn't think it was
   </p>
   <p>
    improvin'--Well, I should think that man was a trying to break his
   </p>
   <p>
    neck!"
   </p>
   <p>
    Coming out of the great tent was disagreeable enough, and we seemed to
   </p>
   <p>
    have chosen the worst time, for the crowd pushed fiercely, though I
   </p>
   <p>
    suppose nobody was in the least hurry, and we were all severely jammed,
   </p>
   <p>
    while from somewhere underneath came the wails of a deserted dog. We had
   </p>
   <p>
    not meant to see the side-shows, and went carelessly past two or three
   </p>
   <p>
    tents; but when we came in sight of the picture of the Kentucky
   </p>
   <p>
    giantess, we noticed that Mrs. Kew looked at it wistfully, and we
   </p>
   <p>
    immediately asked if she cared anything about going to see the wonder,
   </p>
   <p>
    whereupon she confessed that she never heard of such a thing as a
   </p>
   <p>
    woman's weighing six hundred and fifty pounds, so we all three went in.
   </p>
   <p>
    There were only two or three persons inside the tent, beside a little
   </p>
   <p>
    boy who played the hand-organ.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Kentucky giantess sat in two chairs on a platform, and there was a
   </p>
   <p>
    large cage of monkeys just beyond, toward which Kate and I went at once.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Why, she isn't more than two thirds as big as the picture," said Mrs.
   </p>
   <p>
    Kew, in a regretful whisper; "but I guess she's big enough; doesn't she
   </p>
   <p>
    look discouraged, poor creatur'?" Kate and I felt ashamed of ourselves
   </p>
   <p>
    for being there. No matter if she had consented to be carried round for
   </p>
   <p>
    a show, it must have been horrible to be stared at and joked about day
   </p>
   <p>
    after day; and we gravely looked at the monkeys, and in a few minutes
   </p>
   <p>
    turned to see if Mrs. Kew were not ready to come away, when to our
   </p>
   <p>
    surprise we saw that she was talking to the giantess with great
   </p>
   <p>
    interest, and we went nearer.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I thought your face looked natural the minute I set foot inside the
   </p>
   <p>
    door," said Mrs. Kew; "but you've--altered some since I saw you, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    couldn't place you till I heard you speak. Why, you used to be spare; I
   </p>
   <p>
    am amazed, Marilly! Where are your folks?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "I don't wonder you are surprised," said the giantess. "I was a good
   </p>
   <p>
    ways from this when you knew me, wasn't I? But father he run through
   </p>
   <p>
    with every cent he had before he died, and 'he' took to drink and it
   </p>
   <p>
    killed him after a while, and then I begun to grow worse and worse, till
   </p>
   <p>
    I couldn't do nothing to earn a dollar, and everybody was a coming to
   </p>
   <p>
    see me, till at last I used to ask 'em ten cents apiece, and I scratched
   </p>
   <p>
    along somehow till this man came round and heard of me, and he offered
   </p>
   <p>
    me my keep and good pay to go along with him. He had another giantess
   </p>
   <p>
    before me, but she had begun to fall away consider'ble, so he paid her
   </p>
   <p>
    off and let her go. This other giantess was an awful expense to him, she
   </p>
   <p>
    was such an eater; now I don't have no great of an appetite,"--this was
   </p>
   <p>
    said plaintively,--"and he's raised my pay since I've been with him
   </p>
   <p>
    because we did so well. I took up with his offer because I was nothing
   </p>
   <p>
    but a drag and never will be. I'm as comfortable as I can be, but it's a
   </p>
   <p>
    pretty hard business. My oldest boy is able to do for himself, but he's
   </p>
   <p>
    married this last year, and his wife don't want me. I don't know's I
   </p>
   <p>
    blame her either. It would be something like if I had a daughter now;
   </p>
   <p>
    but there, I'm getting to like travelling first-rate; it gives anybody a
   </p>
   <p>
    good deal to think of."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I was asking the folks about you when I was up home the early part of
   </p>
   <p>
    the summer," said Mrs. Kew, "but all they knew was that you were living
   </p>
   <p>
    out in New York State. Have you been living in Kentucky long? I saw it
   </p>
   <p>
    on the picture outside."
   </p>
   <p>
    "No," said the giantess, "that was a picture the man bought cheap from
   </p>
   <p>
    another show that broke up last year. It says six hundred and fifty
   </p>
   <p>
    pounds, but I don't weigh more than four hundred. I haven't been weighed
   </p>
   <p>
    for some time past. Between you and me I don't weigh so much as that,
   </p>
   <p>
    but you mustn't mention it, for it would spoil my reputation, and might
   </p>
   <p>
    hender my getting another engagement." And then the poor giantess lost
   </p>
   <p>
    her professional look and tone as she said, "I believe I'd rather die
   </p>
   <p>
    than grow any bigger. I do lose heart sometimes, and wish I was a smart
   </p>
   <p>
    woman and could keep house. I'd be smarter than ever I was when I had
   </p>
   <p>
    the chance; I tell you that! Is Tom along with you?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "No. I came with these young ladies, Miss Lancaster and Miss Denis, who
   </p>
   <p>
    are stopping over to Deephaven for the summer." Kate and I turned as we
   </p>
   <p>
    heard this introduction; we were standing close by, and I am proud to
   </p>
   <p>
    say that I never saw Kate treat any one more politely than she did that
   </p>
   <p>
    absurd, pitiful creature with the gilt crown and many bracelets. It was
   </p>
   <p>
    not that she said much, but there was such an exquisite courtesy in her
   </p>
   <p>
    manner, and an apparent unconsciousness of there being anything in the
   </p>
   <p>
    least surprising or uncommon about the giantess.
   </p>
   <p>
    Just then a party of people came in, and Mrs. Kew said good by
   </p>
   <p>
    reluctantly. "It has done me sights of good to see you," said our new
   </p>
   <p>
    acquaintance; "I was feeling down-hearted just before you came in. I'm
   </p>
   <p>
    pleased to see somebody that remembers me as I used to be." And they
   </p>
   <p>
    shook hands in a way that meant a great deal, and when Kate and I said
   </p>
   <p>
    good afternoon the giantess looked at us gratefully, and said, "I'm very
   </p>
   <p>
    much obliged to you for coming in, young ladies."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Walk in! walk in!" the man was shouting as we came away. "Walk in and
   </p>
   <p>
    see the wonder of the world, ladies and gentlemen,--the largest woman
   </p>
   <p>
    ever seen in America,--the great Kentucky giantess!"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Wouldn't you have liked to stay longer?" Kate asked Mrs. Kew as we came
   </p>
   <p>
    down the street. But she answered that it would be no satisfaction; the
   </p>
   <p>
    people were coming in, and she would have no chance to talk. "I never
   </p>
   <p>
    knew her very well; she is younger than I, and she used to go to meeting
   </p>
   <p>
    where I did, but she lived five or six miles from our house. She's had a
   </p>
   <p>
    hard time of it, according to her account," said Mrs. Kew. "She used to
   </p>
   <p>
    be a dreadful flighty, high-tempered girl, but she's lost that now, I
   </p>
   <p>
    can see by her eyes. I was running over in my mind to see if there was
   </p>
   <p>
    anything I could do for her, but I don't know as there is. She said the
   </p>
   <p>
    man who hired her was kind. I guess your treating her so polite did her
   </p>
   <p>
    as much good as anything. She used to be real ambitious. I had it on my
   </p>
   <p>
    tongue's end to ask her if she couldn't get a few days' leave and come
   </p>
   <p>
    out to stop with me, but I thought just in time that she'd sink the dory
   </p>
   <p>
    in a minute. There! seeing her has took away all the fun," said Mrs. Kew
   </p>
   <p>
    ruefully; and we were all dismal for a while, but at last, after we were
   </p>
   <p>
    fairly started for home, we began to be merry again.
   </p>
   <p>
    We passed the Craper family whom we had seen at the store in the
   </p>
   <p>
    morning; the children looked as stupid as ever, but the father, I am
   </p>
   <p>
    sorry to say, had been tempted to drink more whiskey than was good for
   </p>
   <p>
    him. He had a bright flush on his cheeks, and he was flourishing his
   </p>
   <p>
    whip, and hoarsely singing some meaningless tune. "Poor creature!" said
   </p>
   <p>
    I, "I should think this day's pleasuring would kill him." "Now, wouldn't
   </p>
   <p>
    you think so?" said Mrs. Kew, sympathizingly; "but the truth is, you
   </p>
   <p>
    couldn't kill one of those Crapers if you pounded him in a mortar."
   </p>
   <p>
    We had a pleasant drive home, and we kept Mrs. Kew to supper, and
   </p>
   <p>
    afterward went down to the shore to see her set sail for home. Mr. Kew
   </p>
   <p>
    had come in some time before, and had been waiting for the moon to rise.
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs. Kew told us that she should have enough to think of for a year, she
   </p>
   <p>
    had enjoyed the day so much; and we stood on the pebbles watching the
   </p>
   <p>
    boat out of the harbor, and wishing ourselves on board, it was such a
   </p>
   <p>
    beautiful evening.
   </p>
   <p>
    *       *       *       *       *
   </p>
   <p>
    We went to another show that summer, the memory of which will never
   </p>
   <p>
    fade. It is somewhat impertinent to call it a show, and "public
   </p>
   <p>
    entertainment" is equally inappropriate, though we certainly were
   </p>
   <p>
    entertained. It had been raining for two or three days; the
   </p>
   <p>
    Deephavenites spoke of it as "a spell of weather." Just after tea, one
   </p>
   <p>
    Thursday evening, Kate and I went down to the post-office. When we
   </p>
   <p>
    opened the great hall door, the salt air was delicious, but we found the
   </p>
   <p>
    town apparently wet through and discouraged; and though it had almost
   </p>
   <p>
    stopped raining just then, there was a Scotch mist, like a snow-storm
   </p>
   <p>
    with the chill taken off, and the Chantrey elms dripped hurriedly, and
   </p>
   <p>
    creaked occasionally in the east-wind.
   </p>
   <p>
    "There will not be a cap'n on the wharves for a week after this," said
   </p>
   <p>
    I to Kate; "only think of the cases of rheumatism!"
   </p>
   <p>
    We stopped for a few minutes at the Carews', who were as much surprised
   </p>
   <p>
    to see us as if we had been mermaids out of the sea, and begged us to
   </p>
   <p>
    give ourselves something warm to drink, and to change our boots the
   </p>
   <p>
    moment we got home. Then we went on to the post-office. Kate went in,
   </p>
   <p>
    but stopped, as she came out with our letters, to read a written notice
   </p>
   <p>
    securely fastened to the grocery door by four large carpet-tacks with
   </p>
   <p>
    wide leathers round their necks.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Dear," said she, exultantly, "there's going to be a lecture to-night in
   </p>
   <p>
    the church,--a free lecture on the Elements of True Manhood. Wouldn't
   </p>
   <p>
    you like to go?" And we went.
   </p>
   <p>
    We were fifteen minutes later than the time appointed, and were sorry to
   </p>
   <p>
    find that the audience was almost imperceptible. The dampness had
   </p>
   <p>
    affected the antiquated lamps so that those on the walls and on the
   </p>
   <p>
    front of the gallery were the dimmest lights I ever saw, and sent their
   </p>
   <p>
    feeble rays through a small space the edges of which were clearly
   </p>
   <p>
    defined. There were two rather more energetic lights on the table near
   </p>
   <p>
    the pulpit, where the lecturer sat, and as we were in the rear of the
   </p>
   <p>
    church, we could see the yellow fog between ourselves and him. There
   </p>
   <p>
    were fourteen persons in the audience, and we were all huddled together
   </p>
   <p>
    in a cowardly way in the pews nearest the door: three old men, four
   </p>
   <p>
    women, and four children, besides ourselves and the sexton, a deaf
   </p>
   <p>
    little old man with a wooden leg.
   </p>
   <p>
    The children whispered noisily, and soon, to our surprise, the lecturer
   </p>
   <p>
    rose and began. He bowed, and treated us with beautiful deference, and
   </p>
   <p>
    read his dreary lecture with enthusiasm. I wish I could say, for his
   </p>
   <p>
    sake, that it was interesting; but I cannot tell a lie, and it was so
   </p>
   <p>
    long! He went on and on, until it seemed as if I had been there ever
   </p>
   <p>
    since I was a little girl. Kate and I did not dare to look at each
   </p>
   <p>
    other, and in my desperation at feeling her quiver with laughter, I
   </p>
   <p>
    moved to the other end of the pew, knocking over a big hymn-book on the
   </p>
   <p>
    way, which attracted so much attention that I have seldom felt more
   </p>
   <p>
    embarrassed in my life. Kate's great dog rose several times to shake
   </p>
   <p>
    himself and yawn loudly, and then lie down again despairingly.
   </p>
   <p>
    You would have thought the man was addressing an enthusiastic Young
   </p>
   <p>
    Men's Christian Association. He exhorted with fervor upon our duties as
   </p>
   <p>
    citizens and as voters, and told us a great deal about George Washington
   </p>
   <p>
    and Benjamin Franklin, whom he urged us to choose as our examples. He
   </p>
   <p>
    waited for applause after each of his outbursts of eloquence, and
   </p>
   <p>
    presently went on again, in no wise disconcerted at the silence, and as
   </p>
   <p>
    if he were sure that he would fetch us next time. The rain began to fall
   </p>
   <p>
    again heavily, and the wind wailed around the meeting-house. If the
   </p>
   <p>
    lecture had been upon any other subject it would not have been so hard
   </p>
   <p>
    for Kate and me to keep sober faces; but it was directed entirely toward
   </p>
   <p>
    young men, and there was not a young man there.
   </p>
   <p>
    The children in front of us mildly scuffled with each other at one time,
   </p>
   <p>
    until the one at the end of the pew dropped a marble, which struck the
   </p>
   <p>
    floor and rolled with a frightful noise down the edge of the aisle where
   </p>
   <p>
    there was no carpet. The congregation instinctively started up to look
   </p>
   <p>
    after it, but we recollected ourselves and leaned back again in our
   </p>
   <p>
    places, while the awed children, after keeping unnaturally quiet, fell
   </p>
   <p>
    asleep, and tumbled against each other helplessly. After a time the man
   </p>
   <p>
    sat down and wiped his forehead, looking well satisfied; and when we
   </p>
   <p>
    were wondering whether we might with propriety come away, he rose again,
   </p>
   <p>
    and said it was a free lecture, and he thanked us for our kind patronage
   </p>
   <p>
    on that inclement night; but in other places which he had visited there
   </p>
   <p>
    had been a contribution taken up for the cause. It would, perhaps, do no
   </p>
   <p>
    harm,--would the sexton--But the sexton could not have heard the sound
   </p>
   <p>
    of a cannon at that distance, and slumbered on. Neither Kate nor I had
   </p>
   <p>
    any money, except a twenty-dollar bill in my purse, and some coppers in
   </p>
   <p>
    the pocket of her water-proof cloak which she assured me she was
   </p>
   <p>
    prepared to give; but we saw no signs of the sexton's waking, and as one
   </p>
   <p>
    of the women kindly went forward to wake the children, we all rose and
   </p>
   <p>
    came away.
   </p>
   <p>
    After we had made as much fun and laughed as long as we pleased that
   </p>
   <p>
    night, we became suddenly conscious of the pitiful side of it all; and
   </p>
   <p>
    being anxious that every one should have the highest opinion of
   </p>
   <p>
    Deephaven, we sent Tom Dockum early in the morning with an anonymous
   </p>
   <p>
    note to the lecturer, whom he found without much trouble; but afterward
   </p>
   <p>
    we were disturbed at hearing that he was going to repeat his lecture
   </p>
   <p>
    that evening,--the wind having gone round to the northwest,--and I have
   </p>
   <p>
    no doubt there were a good many women able to be out, and that he
   </p>
   <p>
    harvested enough ten-cent pieces to pay his expenses without our help;
   </p>
   <p>
    though he had particularly told us it was for "the cause," the evening
   </p>
   <p>
    before, and that ought to have been a consolation.
   </p>
   <p>
    Cunner-Fishing
   </p>
   <p>
    One of the chief pleasures in Deephaven was our housekeeping. Going to
   </p>
   <p>
    market was apt to use up a whole morning, especially if we went to the
   </p>
   <p>
    fish-houses. We depended somewhat upon supplies from Boston, but
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes we used to chase a butcher who took a drive in his old
   </p>
   <p>
    canvas-topped cart when he felt like it, and as for fish, there were
   </p>
   <p>
    always enough to be caught, even if we could not buy any. Our
   </p>
   <p>
    acquaintances would often ask if we had anything for dinner that day,
   </p>
   <p>
    and would kindly suggest that somebody had been boiling lobsters, or
   </p>
   <p>
    that a boat had just come in with some nice mackerel, or that somebody
   </p>
   <p>
    over on the Ridge was calculating to kill a lamb, and we had better
   </p>
   <p>
    speak for a quarter in good season. I am afraid we were looked upon as
   </p>
   <p>
    being in danger of becoming epicures, which we certainly are not, and we
   </p>
   <p>
    undoubtedly roused a great deal of interest because we used to eat
   </p>
   <p>
    mushrooms, which grew in the suburbs of the town in wild luxuriance.
   </p>
   <p>
    One morning Maggie told us that there was nothing in the house for
   </p>
   <p>
    dinner, and, taking an early start, we went at once down to the store to
   </p>
   <p>
    ask if the butcher had been seen, but finding that he had gone out
   </p>
   <p>
    deep-sea fishing for two days, and that when he came back he had planned
   </p>
   <p>
    to kill a veal, we left word for a sufficient piece of the doomed animal
   </p>
   <p>
    to be set apart for our family, and strolled down to the shore to see if
   </p>
   <p>
    we could find some mackerel; but there was not a fisherman in sight, and
   </p>
   <p>
    after going to all the fish-houses we concluded that we had better
   </p>
   <p>
    provide for ourselves. We had not brought our own lines, but we knew
   </p>
   <p>
    where Danny kept his, and after finding a basket of suitable size, and
   </p>
   <p>
    taking some clams from Danny's bait-tub, we went over to the hull of an
   </p>
   <p>
    old schooner which was going to pieces alongside one of the ruined
   </p>
   <p>
    wharves. We looked down the hatchway into the hold, and could see the
   </p>
   <p>
    flounders and sculpin swimming about lazily, and once in a while a
   </p>
   <p>
    little pollock scooted down among them impertinently and then
   </p>
   <p>
    disappeared. "There is that same big flounder that we saw day before
   </p>
   <p>
    yesterday," said I. "I know him because one of his fins is half gone. I
   </p>
   <p>
    don't believe he can get out, for the hole in the side of the schooner
   </p>
   <p>
    isn't very wide, and it is higher up than flounders ever swim. Perhaps
   </p>
   <p>
    he came in when he was young, and was too lazy to go out until he was so
   </p>
   <p>
    large he couldn't. Flounders always look so lazy, and as if they thought
   </p>
   <p>
    a great deal of themselves."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I hope they will think enough of themselves to keep away from my hook
   </p>
   <p>
    this morning," said Kate, philosophically, "and the sculpin too. I am
   </p>
   <p>
    going to fish for cunners alone, and keep my line short." And she
   </p>
   <p>
    perched herself on the quarter, baited her hook carefully, and threw it
   </p>
   <p>
    over, with a clam-shell to call attention. I went to the rail at the
   </p>
   <p>
    side, and we were presently much encouraged by pulling up two small
   </p>
   <p>
    cunners, and felt that our prospects for dinner were excellent. Then I
   </p>
   <p>
    unhappily caught so large a sculpin that it was like pulling up an open
   </p>
   <p>
    umbrella, and after I had thrown him into the hold to keep company with
   </p>
   <p>
    the flounder, our usual good luck seemed to desert us. It was one of the
   </p>
   <p>
    days when, in spite of twitching the line and using all the tricks we
   </p>
   <p>
    could think of, the cunners would either eat our bait or keep away
   </p>
   <p>
    altogether. Kate at last said we must starve unless we could catch the
   </p>
   <p>
    big flounder, and asked me to drop my hook down the hatchway; but it
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed almost too bad to destroy his innocent happiness. Just then we
   </p>
   <p>
    heard the noise of oars, and to our delight saw Cap'n Sands in his dory
   </p>
   <p>
    just beyond the next wharf. "Any luck?" said he. "S'pose ye don't care
   </p>
   <p>
    anything about going out this morning?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "We are not amusing ourselves; we are trying to catch some fish for
   </p>
   <p>
    dinner," said Kate. "Could you wait out by the red buoy while we get a
   </p>
   <p>
    few more, and then should you be back by noon, or are you going for a
   </p>
   <p>
    longer voyage, Captain Sands?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "I was going out to Black Rock for cunners myself," said the cap'n. "I
   </p>
   <p>
    should be pleased to take ye, if ye'd like to go." So we wound up our
   </p>
   <p>
    lines, and took our basket and clams and went round to meet the boat. I
   </p>
   <p>
    felt like rowing, and took the oars while Kate was mending her sinker
   </p>
   <p>
    and the cap'n was busy with a snarled line.
   </p>
   <p>
    "It's pretty hot," said he, presently, "but I see a breeze coming in,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the clouds seem to be thickening; I guess we shall have it cooler
   </p>
   <p>
    'long towards noon. It looked last night as if we were going to have
   </p>
   <p>
    foul weather, but the scud seemed to blow off, and it was as pretty a
   </p>
   <p>
    morning as ever I see. 'A growing moon chaws up the clouds,' my
   </p>
   <p>
    gran'ther used to say. He was as knowing about the weather as anybody I
   </p>
   <p>
    ever come across; 'most always hit it just about right. Some folks lay
   </p>
   <p>
    all the weather to the moon, accordin' to where she quarters, and when
   </p>
   <p>
    she's in perigee we're going to have this kind of weather, and when
   </p>
   <p>
    she's in apogee she's got to do so and so for sartain; but gran'ther he
   </p>
   <p>
    used to laugh at all them things. He said it never made no kind of
   </p>
   <p>
    difference, and he went by the looks of the clouds and the feel of the
   </p>
   <p>
    air, and he thought folks couldn't make no kind of rules that held good,
   </p>
   <p>
    that had to do with the moon. Well, he did use to depend on the moon
   </p>
   <p>
    some; everybody knows we aren't so likely to have foul weather in a
   </p>
   <p>
    growing moon as we be when she's waning. But some folks I could name,
   </p>
   <p>
    they can't do nothing without having the moon's opinion on it. When I
   </p>
   <p>
    went my second voyage afore the mast we was in port ten days at Cadiz,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the ship she needed salting dreadful. The mate kept telling the
   </p>
   <p>
    captain how low the salt was in her, and we was going a long voyage from
   </p>
   <p>
    there, but no, he wouldn't have her salted nohow, because it was the
   </p>
   <p>
    wane of the moon. He was an amazing set kind of man, the cap'n was, and
   </p>
   <p>
    would have his own way on sea or shore. The mate was his own brother,
   </p>
   <p>
    and they used to fight like a cat and dog; they owned most of the ship
   </p>
   <p>
    between 'em. I was slushing the mizzen-mast, and heard 'em a disputin'
   </p>
   <p>
    about the salt. The cap'n was a first-rate seaman and died rich, but he
   </p>
   <p>
    was dreadful notional. I know one time we were a lyin' out in the stream
   </p>
   <p>
    all ready to weigh anchor, and everything was in trim, the men were up
   </p>
   <p>
    in the rigging and a fresh breeze going out, just what we'd been waiting
   </p>
   <p>
    for, and the word was passed to take in sail and make everything fast.
   </p>
   <p>
    The men swore, and everybody said the cap'n had had some kind of a
   </p>
   <p>
    warning. But that night it began to blow, and I tell you afore morning
   </p>
   <p>
    we were glad enough we were in harbor. The old Victor she dragged her
   </p>
   <p>
    anchor, and the fore-to'gallant sail and r'yal got loose somehow and was
   </p>
   <p>
    blown out of the bolt-ropes. Most of the canvas and rigging was old, but
   </p>
   <p>
    we had first-rate weather after that, and didn't bend near all the new
   </p>
   <p>
    sail we had aboard, though the cap'n was most afraid we'd come short
   </p>
   <p>
    when we left Boston. That was 'most sixty year ago," said the captain,
   </p>
   <p>
    reflectively. "How time does slip away! You young folks haven't any
   </p>
   <p>
    idea. She was a first-rate ship, the old Victor was, though I suppose
   </p>
   <p>
    she wouldn't cut much of a dash now 'longside of some of the new
   </p>
   <p>
    clippers.
   </p>
   <p>
    "There used to be some strange-looking crafts in those days; there was
   </p>
   <p>
    the old brig Hannah. They used to say she would sail backwards as fast
   </p>
   <p>
    as forwards, and she was so square in the bows, they used to call her
   </p>
   <p>
    the sugar-box. She was master old, the Hannah was, and there wasn't a
   </p>
   <p>
    port from here to New Orleans where she wasn't known; she used to carry
   </p>
   <p>
    a master cargo for her size, more than some ships that ranked two
   </p>
   <p>
    hundred and fifty ton, and she was put down for two hundred. She used to
   </p>
   <p>
    make good voyages, the Hannah did, and then there was the Pactolus; she
   </p>
   <p>
    was just about such another,--you would have laughed to see her. She
   </p>
   <p>
    sailed out of this port for a good many years. Cap'n Wall he told me
   </p>
   <p>
    that if he had her before the wind with a cargo of cotton, she would
   </p>
   <p>
    make a middling good run, but load her deep with salt, and you might as
   </p>
   <p>
    well try to sail a stick of oak timber with a handkerchief. She was a
   </p>
   <p>
    stout-built ship: I shouldn't wonder if her timbers were afloat
   </p>
   <p>
    somewhere yet; she was sold to some parties out in San Francisco. There!
   </p>
   <p>
    everything's changed from what it was when I used to follow the sea. I
   </p>
   <p>
    wonder sometimes if the sailors have as queer works aboard ship as they
   </p>
   <p>
    used. Bless ye! Deephaven used to be a different place to what it is
   </p>
   <p>
    now; there was hardly a day in the year that you didn't hear the
   </p>
   <p>
    shipwrights' hammers, and there was always something going on at the
   </p>
   <p>
    wharves. You would see the folks from up country comin' in with their
   </p>
   <p>
    loads of oak knees and plank, and logs o' rock-maple for keels when
   </p>
   <p>
    there was snow on the ground in winter-time, and the big sticks of
   </p>
   <p>
    timber-pine for masts would come crawling along the road with their
   </p>
   <p>
    three and four yoke of oxen all frosted up, the sleds creaking and the
   </p>
   <p>
    snow growling and the men flapping their arms to keep warm, and
   </p>
   <p>
    hallooing as if there wan't nothin' else goin' on in the world except to
   </p>
   <p>
    get them masts to the ship-yard. Bless ye! two o' them teams together
   </p>
   <p>
    would stretch from here 'most up to the Widow Jim's place,--no such
   </p>
   <p>
    timber-pines nowadays."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I suppose the sailors are very jolly together sometimes," said Kate,
   </p>
   <p>
    meditatively, with the least flicker of a smile at me. The captain did
   </p>
   <p>
    not answer for a minute, as he was battling with an obstinate snarl in
   </p>
   <p>
    his line; but when he had found the right loop he said, "I've had the
   </p>
   <p>
    best times and the hardest times of my life at sea, that's certain! I
   </p>
   <p>
    was just thinking it over when you spoke. I'll tell you some stories one
   </p>
   <p>
    day or 'nother that'll please you. Land! you've no idea what tricks some
   </p>
   <p>
    of those wild fellows will be up to. Now, saying they fetch home a cargo
   </p>
   <p>
    of wines and they want a drink; they've got a trick so they can get it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Saying it's champagne, they'll fetch up a basket, and how do you suppose
   </p>
   <p>
    they'll get into it?"
   </p>
   <p>
    Of course we didn't know.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Well, every basket will be counted, and they're fastened up particular,
   </p>
   <p>
    so they can tell in a minute if they've been tampered with; and neither
   </p>
   <p>
    must you draw the corks if you could get the basket open. I suppose ye
   </p>
   <p>
    may have seen champagne, how it's all wired and waxed. Now, they take a
   </p>
   <p>
    clean tub, them fellows do, and just shake the basket and jounce it up
   </p>
   <p>
    and down till they break the bottles and let the wine drain out; then
   </p>
   <p>
    they take it down in the hold and put it back with the rest, and when
   </p>
   <p>
    the cargo is delivered there's only one or two whole bottles in that
   </p>
   <p>
    basket, and there's a dreadful fuss about its being stowed so foolish."
   </p>
   <p>
    The captain told this with an air of great satisfaction, but we did not
   </p>
   <p>
    show the least suspicion that he might have assisted at some such
   </p>
   <p>
    festivity.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Then they have a way of breaking into a cask. It won't do to start the
   </p>
   <p>
    bung, and it won't do to bore a hole where it can be seen, but they're
   </p>
   <p>
    up to that: they slip back one of the end hoops and bore two holes
   </p>
   <p>
    underneath it, one for the air to go in and one for the liquor to come
   </p>
   <p>
    out, and after they get all out they want they put in some spigots and
   </p>
   <p>
    cut them down close to the stave, knock back the hoop again, and there
   </p>
   <p>
    ye are, all trig."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I never should have thought of it," said Kate, admiringly.
   </p>
   <p>
    "There isn't nothing," Cap'n Sands went on, "that'll hender some masters
   </p>
   <p>
    from cheating the owners a little. Get them off in a foreign port, and
   </p>
   <p>
    there's nobody to watch, and they most of them have a feeling that they
   </p>
   <p>
    ain't getting full pay, and they'll charge things to the ship that she
   </p>
   <p>
    never seen nor heard of. There were two shipmasters that sailed out of
   </p>
   <p>
    Salem. I heard one of 'em tell the story. They had both come into port
   </p>
   <p>
    from Liverpool nigh the same time, and one of 'em, he was dressed up in
   </p>
   <p>
    a handsome suit of clothes, and the other looked kind of poverty-struck.
   </p>
   <p>
    'Where did you get them clothes?' says he. 'Why, to Liverpool,' says the
   </p>
   <p>
    other; 'you don't mean to say you come away without none, cheap as cloth
   </p>
   <p>
    was there?' 'Why, yes,' says the other cap'n,--'I can't afford to wear
   </p>
   <p>
    such clothes as those be, and I don't see how you can, either.' 'Charge
   </p>
   <p>
    'em to the ship, bless ye; the owners expect it.'
   </p>
   <p>
    "So the next v'y'ge the poor cap'n he had a nice rig for himself made to
   </p>
   <p>
    the best tailor's in Bristol, and charged it, say ten pounds, in the
   </p>
   <p>
    ship's account; and when he came home the ship's husband he was looking
   </p>
   <p>
    over the papers, and 'What's this?' says he, 'how come the ship to run
   </p>
   <p>
    up a tailor's bill?' 'Why, them's mine,' says the cap'n, very meaching.
   </p>
   <p>
    'I understood that there wouldn't be no objection made.' 'Well, you made
   </p>
   <p>
    a mistake,' says the other, laughing; 'guess I'd better scratch this
   </p>
   <p>
    out.' And it wasn't long before the cap'n met the one who had put him up
   </p>
   <p>
    to doing it, and he give him a blowing up for getting him into such a
   </p>
   <p>
    fix. 'Land sakes alive!' says he, 'were you fool enough to set it down
   </p>
   <p>
    in the account? Why, I put mine in, so many bolts of Russia duck.'"
   </p>
   <p>
    Captain Sands seemed to enjoy this reminiscence, and to our
   </p>
   <p>
    satisfaction, in a few minutes, after he had offered to take the oars,
   </p>
   <p>
    he went on to tell us another story.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Why, as for cheating, there's plenty of that all over the world. The
   </p>
   <p>
    first v'y'ge I went into Havana as master of the Deerhound, she had
   </p>
   <p>
    never been in the port before and had to be measured and recorded, and
   </p>
   <p>
    then pay her tonnage duties every time she went into port there
   </p>
   <p>
    afterward, according to what she was registered on the custom-house
   </p>
   <p>
    books. The inspector he come aboard, and he went below and looked round,
   </p>
   <p>
    and he measured her between decks; but he never offered to set down any
   </p>
   <p>
    figgers, and when we came back into the cabin, says he, 'Yes--yes--good
   </p>
   <p>
    ship! you put one bloon front of this eye, so!' says he, 'an' I not
   </p>
   <p>
    see with him; and you put one more doubloon front of other eye, and how
   </p>
   <p>
    you think I see at all what figger you write?' So I took his book and I
   </p>
   <p>
    set down her measurements and made her out twenty ton short, and he took
   </p>
   <p>
    his doubloons and shoved 'em into his pocket. There, it isn't what you
   </p>
   <p>
    call straight dealing, but everybody done it that dared, and you'd eat
   </p>
   <p>
    up all the profits of a v'y'ge and the owners would just as soon you'd
   </p>
   <p>
    try a little up-country air, if you paid all those dues according to
   </p>
   <p>
    law. Tonnage was dreadful high and wharfage too, in some ports, and
   </p>
   <p>
    they'd get your last cent some way or 'nother if ye weren't sharp.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Old Cap'n Carew, uncle to them ye see to meeting, did a smart thing in
   </p>
   <p>
    the time of the embargo. Folks got tired of it, and it was dreadful hard
   </p>
   <p>
    times; ships rotting at the wharves, and Deephaven never was quite the
   </p>
   <p>
    same afterward, though the old place held out for a good while before
   </p>
   <p>
    she let go as ye see her now. You'd 'a' had a hard grip on't when I was
   </p>
   <p>
    a young man to make me believe it would ever be so dull here. Well,
   </p>
   <p>
    Cap'n Carew he bought an old brig that was lying over by East Parish,
   </p>
   <p>
    and he began fitting her up and loading her for the West Indies, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    farmers they'd come in there by night from all round the country, to
   </p>
   <p>
    sell salt-fish and lumber and potatoes, and glad enough they were, I
   </p>
   <p>
    tell ye. The rigging was put in order, and it wasn't long before she was
   </p>
   <p>
    ready to sail, and it was all kept mighty quiet. She lay up to an old
   </p>
   <p>
    wharf in a cove where she wouldn't be much noticed, and they took care
   </p>
   <p>
    not to paint her any or to attract any attention.
   </p>
   <p>
    "One day Cap'n Carew was over in Riverport dining out with some
   </p>
   <p>
    gentlemen, and the revenue officer sat next to him, and by and by says
   </p>
   <p>
    he, 'Why won't ye take a ride with me this afternoon? I've had warning
   </p>
   <p>
    that there's a brig loading for the West Indies over beyond Deephaven
   </p>
   <p>
    somewheres, and I'm going over to seize her.' And he laughed to himself
   </p>
   <p>
    as if he expected fun, and something in his pocket beside. Well, the
   </p>
   <p>
    first minute that Cap'n Carew dared, after dinner, he slipped out, and
   </p>
   <p>
    he hired the swiftest horse in Riverport and rode for dear life, and
   </p>
   <p>
    told the folks who were in the secret, and some who weren't, what was
   </p>
   <p>
    the matter, and every soul turned to and helped finish loading her and
   </p>
   <p>
    getting the rigging ready and the water aboard; but just as they were
   </p>
   <p>
    leaving the cove--the wind was blowing just right--along came the
   </p>
   <p>
    revenue officer with two or three men, and they come off in a boat and
   </p>
   <p>
    boarded her as important as could be.
   </p>
   <p>
    "'Won't ye step into the cabin, gentlemen, and take a glass o' wine?'
   </p>
   <p>
    says Cap'n Carew, very polite; and the wind came in fresher,--something
   </p>
   <p>
    like a squall for a few minutes,--and the men had the sails spread
   </p>
   <p>
    before you could say Jack Robi'son, and before those fellows knew what
   </p>
   <p>
    they were about the old brig was a standing out to sea, and the folks on
   </p>
   <p>
    the wharves cheered and yelled. The Cap'n gave the officers a good scare
   </p>
   <p>
    and offered 'em a free passage to the West Indies, and finally they said
   </p>
   <p>
    they wouldn't report at headquarters if he'd let 'em go ashore; so he
   </p>
   <p>
    told the sailors to lower their boat about two miles off Deephaven, and
   </p>
   <p>
    they pulled ashore meek enough. Cap'n Carew had a first-rate run, and
   </p>
   <p>
    made a lot of money, so I have heard it said. Bless ye! every shipmaster
   </p>
   <p>
    would have done just the same if he had dared, and everybody was glad
   </p>
   <p>
    when they heard about it. Dreadful foolish piece of business that
   </p>
   <p>
    embargo was!
   </p>
   <p>
    "Now I declare," said Captain Sands, after he had finished this
   </p>
   <p>
    narrative, "here I'm a telling stories and you're doin' all the work.
   </p>
   <p>
    You'll pull a boat ahead of anybody, if you keep on. Tom Kew was
   </p>
   <p>
    a-praisin' up both of you to me the other day: says he, 'They don't put
   </p>
   <p>
    on no airs, but I tell ye they can pull a boat well, and swim like
   </p>
   <p>
    fish,' says he. There now, if you'll give me the oars I'll put the dory
   </p>
   <p>
    just where I want her, and you can be getting your lines ready. I know a
   </p>
   <p>
    place here where it's always toler'ble fishing, and I guess we'll get
   </p>
   <p>
    something."
   </p>
   <p>
    Kate and I cracked our clams on the gunwale of the boat, and cut them
   </p>
   <p>
    into nice little bits for bait with a piece of the shell, and by the
   </p>
   <p>
    time the captain had thrown out the killick we were ready to begin, and
   </p>
   <p>
    found the fishing much more exciting than it had been at the wharf.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I don't know as I ever see 'em bite faster," said the old sailor,
   </p>
   <p>
    presently; "guess it's because they like the folks that's fishing. Well,
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm pleased. I thought I'd let 'Bijah take some along to Denby in the
   </p>
   <p>
    cart to-morrow if I got more than I could use at home. I didn't
   </p>
   <p>
    calc'late on having such a lively crew aboard. I s'pose ye wouldn't care
   </p>
   <p>
    about going out a little further by and by to see if we can't get two or
   </p>
   <p>
    three haddock?" And we answered that we should like nothing better.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was growing cloudy, and was much cooler,--the perfection of a day for
   </p>
   <p>
    fishing,--and we sat there diligently pulling in cunners, and talking a
   </p>
   <p>
    little once in a while. The tide was nearly out, and Black Rock looked
   </p>
   <p>
    almost large enough to be called an island. The sea was smooth and the
   </p>
   <p>
    low waves broke lazily among the seaweed-covered ledges, while our boat
   </p>
   <p>
    swayed about on the water, lifting and falling gently as the waves went
   </p>
   <p>
    in shore. We were not a very long way from the lighthouse, and once we
   </p>
   <p>
    could see Mrs. Kew's big white apron as she stood in the doorway for a
   </p>
   <p>
    few minutes. There was no noise except the plash of the low-tide waves
   </p>
   <p>
    and the occasional flutter of a fish in the bottom of the dory. Kate and
   </p>
   <p>
    I always killed our fish at once by a rap on the head, for it certainly
   </p>
   <p>
    saved the poor creatures much discomfort, and ourselves as well, and it
   </p>
   <p>
    made it easier to take them off the hook than if they were flopping
   </p>
   <p>
    about and making us aware of our cruelty.
   </p>
   <p>
    Suddenly the captain wound up his line and said he thought we'd better
   </p>
   <p>
    be going in, and Kate and I looked at him with surprise. "It is only
   </p>
   <p>
    half past ten," said I, looking at my watch. "Don't hurry in on our
   </p>
   <p>
    account," added Kate, persuasively, for we were having a very good time.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I guess we won't mind about the haddock. I've got a feelin' we'd better
   </p>
   <p>
    go ashore." And he looked up into the sky and turned to see the west. "I
   </p>
   <p>
    knew there was something the matter; there's going to be a shower." And
   </p>
   <p>
    we looked behind us to see a bank of heavy clouds coming over fast. "I
   </p>
   <p>
    wish we had two pair of oars," said Captain Sands. "I'm afraid we shall
   </p>
   <p>
    get caught."
   </p>
   <p>
    "You needn't mind us," said Kate. "We aren't in the least afraid of our
   </p>
   <p>
    clothes, and we don't get cold when we're wet; we have made sure of
   </p>
   <p>
    that."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Well, I'm glad to hear that," said the cap'n. "Women-folks are apt to
   </p>
   <p>
    be dreadful scared of a wetting; but I'd just as lief not get wet
   </p>
   <p>
    myself. I had a twinge of rheumatism yesterday. I guess we'll get
   </p>
   <p>
    ashore fast enough. No. I feel well enough to-day, but you can row if
   </p>
   <p>
    you want to, and I'll take the oars the last part of the way."
   </p>
   <p>
    When we reached the moorings the clouds were black, and the thunder
   </p>
   <p>
    rattled and boomed over the sea, while heavy spatters of rain were
   </p>
   <p>
    already falling. We did not go to the wharves, but stopped down the
   </p>
   <p>
    shore at the fish-houses, the nearer place of shelter. "You just select
   </p>
   <p>
    some of those cunners," said the captain, who was beginning to be a
   </p>
   <p>
    little out of breath, "and then you can run right up and get under
   </p>
   <p>
    cover, and I'll put a bit of old sail over the rest of the fish to keep
   </p>
   <p>
    the fresh water off." By the time the boat touched the shore and we had
   </p>
   <p>
    pulled it up on the pebbles, the rain had begun in good earnest. Luckily
   </p>
   <p>
    there was a barrow lying near, and we loaded that in a hurry, and just
   </p>
   <p>
    then the captain caught sight of a well-known red shirt in an open door,
   </p>
   <p>
    and shouted, "Halloa, Danny! lend us a hand with these fish, for we're
   </p>
   <p>
    nigh on to being shipwrecked." And then we ran up to the fish-house and
   </p>
   <p>
    waited awhile, though we stood in the doorway watching the lightning,
   </p>
   <p>
    and there were so many leaks in the roof that we might almost as well
   </p>
   <p>
    have been out of doors. It was one of Danny's quietest days, and he
   </p>
   <p>
    silently beheaded hake, only winking at us once very gravely at
   </p>
   <p>
    something our other companion said.
   </p>
   <p>
    "There!" said Captain Sands, "folks may say what they have a mind to; I
   </p>
   <p>
    didn't see that shower coming up, and I know as well as I want to that
   </p>
   <p>
    my wife did, and impressed it on my mind. Our house sets high, and she
   </p>
   <p>
    watches the sky and is al'ays a worrying when I go out fishing for fear
   </p>
   <p>
    something's going to happen to me,' specially sence I've got to be along
   </p>
   <p>
    in years."
   </p>
   <p>
    This was just what Kate and I wished to hear, for we had been told that
   </p>
   <p>
    Captain Sands had most decided opinions on dreams and other mysteries,
   </p>
   <p>
    and could tell some stories which were considered incredible by even a
   </p>
   <p>
    Deephaven audience, to whom the marvellous was of every-day occurrence.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Then it has happened before?" asked Kate. "I wondered why you started
   </p>
   <p>
    so suddenly to come in."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Happened!" said the captain. "Bless ye, yes! I'll tell you my views
   </p>
   <p>
    about these p'ints one o' those days. I've thought a good deal about
   </p>
   <p>
    'em by spells. Not that I can explain 'em, nor anybody else, but it's no
   </p>
   <p>
    use to laugh at 'em as some folks do. Cap'n Lant--you know Cap'n
   </p>
   <p>
    Lant?--he and I have talked it over consider'ble, and he says to me,
   </p>
   <p>
    'Everybody's got some story of the kind they will believe in spite of
   </p>
   <p>
    everything, and yet they won't believe yourn.'"
   </p>
   <p>
    The shower seemed to be over now, and we felt compelled to go home, as
   </p>
   <p>
    the captain did not go on with his remarks. I hope he did not see
   </p>
   <p>
    Danny's wink. Skipper Scudder, who was Danny's friend and partner, came
   </p>
   <p>
    up just then and asked us if we knew what the sign was when the sun came
   </p>
   <p>
    out through the rain. I said that I had always heard it would rain again
   </p>
   <p>
    next day. "O no," said Skipper Scudder, "the Devil is whipping his
   </p>
   <p>
    wife."
   </p>
   <p>
    After dinner Kate and I went for a walk through some pine woods which
   </p>
   <p>
    were beautiful after the rain; the mosses and lichens which had been
   </p>
   <p>
    dried up were all freshened and blooming out in the dampness. The smell
   </p>
   <p>
    of the wet pitch-pines was unusually sweet, and we wandered about for an
   </p>
   <p>
    hour or two there, to find some ferns we wanted, and then walked over
   </p>
   <p>
    toward East Parish, and home by the long beach late in the afternoon. We
   </p>
   <p>
    came as far as the boat-landing, meaning to go home through the lane,
   </p>
   <p>
    but to our delight we saw Captain Sands sitting alone on an old
   </p>
   <p>
    overturned whaleboat, whittling busily at a piece of dried kelp. "Good
   </p>
   <p>
    evenin'," said our friend, cheerfully. And we explained that we had
   </p>
   <p>
    taken a long walk and thought we would rest awhile before we went home
   </p>
   <p>
    to supper. Kate perched herself on the boat, and I sat down on a ship's
   </p>
   <p>
    knee which lay on the pebbles.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Didn't get any hurt from being out in the shower, I hope?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "No, indeed," laughed Kate, "and we had such a good time. I hope you
   </p>
   <p>
    won't mind taking us out again some time."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Bless ye! no," said the captain. "My girl Lo'isa, she that's Mis
   </p>
   <p>
    Winslow over to Riverport, used to go out with me a good deal, and it
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed natural to have you aboard. I missed Lo'isa after she got
   </p>
   <p>
    married, for she was al'ays ready to go anywhere 'long of father. She's
   </p>
   <p>
    had slim health of late years. I tell 'em she's been too much shut up
   </p>
   <p>
    out of the fresh air and sun. When she was young her mother never could
   </p>
   <p>
    pr'vail on her to set in the house stiddy and sew, and she used to have
   </p>
   <p>
    great misgivin's that Lo'isa never was going to be capable. How about
   </p>
   <p>
    those fish you caught this morning? good, were they? Mis Sands had
   </p>
   <p>
    dinner on the stocks when I got home, and she said she wouldn't fry any
   </p>
   <p>
    'til supper-time; but I calc'lated to have 'em this noon. I like 'em
   </p>
   <p>
    best right out o' the water. Little more and we should have got them
   </p>
   <p>
    wet. That's one of my whims; I can't bear to let fish get rained on."
   </p>
   <p>
    "O Captain Sands!" said I, there being a convenient pause, "you were
   </p>
   <p>
    speaking of your wife just now; did you ask her if she saw the shower?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "First thing she spoke of when I got into the house. 'There,' says she,
   </p>
   <p>
    'I was afraid you wouldn't see the rain coming in time, and I had my
   </p>
   <p>
    heart in my mouth when it began to thunder. I thought you'd get soaked
   </p>
   <p>
    through, and be laid up for a fortnight,' says she. 'I guess a summer
   </p>
   <p>
    shower won't hurt an old sailor like me,' says I." And the captain
   </p>
   <p>
    reached for another piece of his kelp-stalk, and whittled away more
   </p>
   <p>
    busily than ever. Kate took out her knife and also began to cut kelp,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I threw pebbles in the hope of hitting a spider which sat
   </p>
   <p>
    complacently on a stone not far away, and when he suddenly vanished
   </p>
   <p>
    there was nothing for me to do but to whittle kelp also.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Do you suppose," said Kate, "that Mrs. Sands really made you know about
   </p>
   <p>
    that shower?"
   </p>
   <p>
    The captain put on his most serious look, coughed slowly, and moved
   </p>
   <p>
    himself a few inches nearer us, along the boat. I think he fully
   </p>
   <p>
    understood the importance and solemnity of the subject. "It ain't for us
   </p>
   <p>
    to say what we do know or don't, for there's nothing sartain, but I made
   </p>
   <p>
    up my mind long ago that there's something about these p'ints that's
   </p>
   <p>
    myster'ous. My wife and me will be sitting there to home and there won't
   </p>
   <p>
    be no word between us for an hour, and then of a sudden we'll speak up
   </p>
   <p>
    about the same thing. Now the way I view it, she either puts it into my
   </p>
   <p>
    head or I into hers. I've spoke up lots of times about something, when I
   </p>
   <p>
    didn't know what I was going to say when I began, and she'll say she was
   </p>
   <p>
    just thinking of that. Like as not you have noticed it sometimes? There
   </p>
   <p>
    was something my mind was dwellin' on yesterday, and she come right out
   </p>
   <p>
    with it, and I'd a good deal rather she hadn't," said the captain,
   </p>
   <p>
    ruefully. "I didn't want to rake it all over ag'in, I'm sure." And then
   </p>
   <p>
    he recollected himself, and was silent, which his audience must confess
   </p>
   <p>
    to have regretted for a moment.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I used to think a good deal about such things when I was younger, and
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm free to say I took more stock in dreams and such like than I do now.
   </p>
   <p>
    I rec'lect old Parson Lorimer--this Parson Lorimer's father who was
   </p>
   <p>
    settled here first--spoke to me once about it, and said it was a
   </p>
   <p>
    tempting of Providence, and that we hadn't no right to pry into secrets.
   </p>
   <p>
    I know I had a dream-book then that I picked up in a shop in Bristol
   </p>
   <p>
    once when I was there on the Ranger, and all the young folks were beset
   </p>
   <p>
    to get sight of it. I see what fools it made of folks, bothering their
   </p>
   <p>
    heads about such things, and I pretty much let them go: all this stuff
   </p>
   <p>
    about spirit-rappings is enough to make a man crazy. You don't get no
   </p>
   <p>
    good by it. I come across a paper once with a lot of letters in it from
   </p>
   <p>
    sperits, and I cast my eye over 'em, and I says to myself, 'Well, I
   </p>
   <p>
    always was given to understand that when we come to a futur' state we
   </p>
   <p>
    was goin' to have more wisdom than we can get afore'; but them letters
   </p>
   <p>
    hadn't any more sense to 'em, nor so much, as a man could write here
   </p>
   <p>
    without schooling, and I should think that if the letters be all
   </p>
   <p>
    straight, if the folks who wrote 'em had any kind of ambition they'd
   </p>
   <p>
    want to be movin' back here again. But as for one person's having
   </p>
   <p>
    something to do with another any distance off, why, that's another
   </p>
   <p>
    thing; there ain't any nonsense about that. I know it's true jest as
   </p>
   <p>
    well as I want to," said the cap'n, warming up. "I'll tell ye how I was
   </p>
   <p>
    led to make up my mind about it. One time I waked a man up out of a
   </p>
   <p>
    sound sleep looking at him, and it set me to thinking. First, there
   </p>
   <p>
    wasn't any noise, and then ag'in there wasn't any touch so he could feel
   </p>
   <p>
    it, and I says to myself, 'Why couldn't I ha' done it the width of two
   </p>
   <p>
    rooms as well as one, and why couldn't I ha' done it with my back
   </p>
   <p>
    turned?' It couldn't have been the looking so much as the thinking. And
   </p>
   <p>
    then I car'd it further, and I says, 'Why ain't a mile as good as a
   </p>
   <p>
    yard? and it's the thinking that does it,' says I, 'and we've got some
   </p>
   <p>
    faculty or other that we don't know much about. We've got some way of
   </p>
   <p>
    sending our thought like a bullet goes out of a gun and it hits. We
   </p>
   <p>
    don't know nothing except what we see. And some folks is scared, and
   </p>
   <p>
    some more thinks it is all nonsense and laughs. But there's something we
   </p>
   <p>
    haven't got the hang of.' It makes me think o' them little black
   </p>
   <p>
    polliwogs that turns into frogs in the fresh-water puddles in the ma'sh.
   </p>
   <p>
    There's a time before their tails drop off and their legs have sprouted
   </p>
   <p>
    out, when they don't get any use o' their legs, and I dare say they're
   </p>
   <p>
    in their way consider'ble; but after they get to be frogs they find out
   </p>
   <p>
    what they're for without no kind of trouble. I guess we shall turn these
   </p>
   <p>
    fac'lties to account some time or 'nother. Seems to me, though, that we
   </p>
   <p>
    might depend on 'em now more than we do."
   </p>
   <p>
    The captain was under full sail on what we had heard was his pet
   </p>
   <p>
    subject, and it was a great satisfaction to listen to what he had to
   </p>
   <p>
    say. It loses a great deal in being written, for the old sailor's voice
   </p>
   <p>
    and gestures and thorough earnestness all carried no little persuasion.
   </p>
   <p>
    And it was impossible not to be sure that he knew more than people
   </p>
   <p>
    usually do about these mysteries in which he delighted.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Now, how can you account for this?" said he. "I remember not more than
   </p>
   <p>
    ten years ago my son's wife was stopping at our house, and she had left
   </p>
   <p>
    her child at home while she come away for a rest. And after she had been
   </p>
   <p>
    there two or three days, one morning she was sitting in the kitchen
   </p>
   <p>
    'long o' the folks, and all of a sudden she jumped out of her chair and
   </p>
   <p>
    ran into the bedroom, and next minute she come out laughing, and looking
   </p>
   <p>
    kind of scared. 'I could ha' taken my oath,' says she,'that I heard Katy
   </p>
   <p>
    cryin' out mother,' says she, 'just as if she was hurt. I heard it so
   </p>
   <p>
    plain that before I stopped to think it seemed as if she were right in
   </p>
   <p>
    the next room. I'm afeard something has happened.' But the folks
   </p>
   <p>
    laughed, and said she must ha' heard one of the lambs. 'No, it wasn't,'
   </p>
   <p>
    says she, 'it was Katy.' And sure enough, just after dinner a young man
   </p>
   <p>
    who lived neighbor to her come riding into the yard post-haste to get
   </p>
   <p>
    her to go home, for the baby had pulled some hot water over on to
   </p>
   <p>
    herself and was nigh scalded to death and cryin' for her mother every
   </p>
   <p>
    minute. Now, who's going to explain that? It wasn't any common hearing
   </p>
   <p>
    that heard that child's cryin' fifteen miles. And I can tell you another
   </p>
   <p>
    thing that happened among my own folks. There was an own cousin of mine
   </p>
   <p>
    married to a man by the name of John Hathorn. He was trading up to
   </p>
   <p>
    Parsonsfield, and business run down, so he wound up there, and thought
   </p>
   <p>
    he'd make a new start. He moved down to Denby, and while he was getting
   </p>
   <p>
    under way, he left his family up to the old place, and at the time I
   </p>
   <p>
    speak of, was going to move 'em down in about a fortnight.
   </p>
   <p>
    "One morning his wife was fidgeting round, and finally she came down
   </p>
   <p>
    stairs with her bonnet and shawl on, and said somebody must put the
   </p>
   <p>
    horse right into the wagon and take her down to Denby. 'Why, what for,
   </p>
   <p>
    mother?' they says. 'Don't stop to talk,' says she; 'your father is
   </p>
   <p>
    sick, and wants me. It's been a worrying me since before day, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    can't stand it no longer.' And the short of the story is that she kept
   </p>
   <p>
    hurrying 'em faster and faster, and then she got hold of the reins
   </p>
   <p>
    herself, and when they got within five miles of the place the horse fell
   </p>
   <p>
    dead, and she was nigh about crazy, and they took another horse at a
   </p>
   <p>
    farm-house on the road. It was the spring of the year, and the going was
   </p>
   <p>
    dreadful, and when they got to the house John Hathorn had just died, and
   </p>
   <p>
    he had been calling for his wife up to 'most the last breath he drew. He
   </p>
   <p>
    had been taken sick sudden the day before, but the folks knew it was bad
   </p>
   <p>
    travelling, and that she was a feeble woman to come near thirty miles,
   </p>
   <p>
    and they had no idee he was so bad off. I'm telling you the living
   </p>
   <p>
    truth," said Captain Sands, with an emphatic shake of his head. "There's
   </p>
   <p>
    more folks than me can tell about it, and if you were goin' to keel-haul
   </p>
   <p>
    me next minute, and hang me to the yard-arm afterward, I couldn't say it
   </p>
   <p>
    different. I was up to Parsonsfield to the funeral; it was just after I
   </p>
   <p>
    quit following the sea. I never saw a woman so broke down as she was.
   </p>
   <p>
    John was a nice man; stiddy and pleasant-spoken and straightforrard and
   </p>
   <p>
    kind to his folks. He belonged to the Odd Fellows, and they all marched
   </p>
   <p>
    to the funeral. There was a good deal of respect shown him, I tell ye.
   </p>
   <p>
    "There is another story I'd like to have ye hear, if it's so that you
   </p>
   <p>
    ain't beat out hearing me talk. When I get going I slip along as easy as
   </p>
   <p>
    a schooner wing-and-wing afore the wind.
   </p>
   <p>
    "This happened to my own father, but I never heard him say much about
   </p>
   <p>
    it; never could get him to talk it over to any length, best I could do.
   </p>
   <p>
    But gran'ther, his father, told me about it nigh upon fifty times,
   </p>
   <p>
    first and last, and always the same way. Gran'ther lived to be old, and
   </p>
   <p>
    there was ten or a dozen years after his wife died that he lived year
   </p>
   <p>
    and year about with Uncle Tobias's folks and our folks. Uncle Tobias
   </p>
   <p>
    lived over on the Ridge. I got home from my first v'y'ge as mate of the
   </p>
   <p>
    Daylight just in time for his funeral. I was disapp'inted to find the
   </p>
   <p>
    old man was gone. I'd fetched him some first-rate tobacco, for he was a
   </p>
   <p>
    great hand to smoke, and I was calc'latin' on his being pleased: old
   </p>
   <p>
    folks like to be thought of, and then he set more by me than by the
   </p>
   <p>
    other boys. I know I used to be sorry for him when I was a little
   </p>
   <p>
    fellow. My father's second wife she was a well-meaning woman, but an
   </p>
   <p>
    awful driver with her work, and she was always making of him feel he
   </p>
   <p>
    wasn't no use. I do' know as she meant to, either. He never said
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing, and he was always just so pleasant, and he was fond of his
   </p>
   <p>
    book, and used to set round reading, and tried to keep himself out of
   </p>
   <p>
    the way just as much as he could. There was one winter when I was small
   </p>
   <p>
    that I had the scarlet-fever, and was very slim for a long time
   </p>
   <p>
    afterward, and I used to keep along o' gran'ther, and he would tell me
   </p>
   <p>
    stories. He'd been a sailor,--it runs in our blood to foller the
   </p>
   <p>
    sea,--and he'd been wrecked two or three times and been taken by the
   </p>
   <p>
    Algerine pirates. You remind me to tell you some time about that; and I
   </p>
   <p>
    wonder if you ever heard about old Citizen Leigh, that used to be about
   </p>
   <p>
    here when I was a boy. He was taken by the Algerines once, same's
   </p>
   <p>
    gran'ther, and they was dreadful f'erce just then, and they sent him
   </p>
   <p>
    home to get the ransom money for the crew; but it was a monstrous price
   </p>
   <p>
    they asked, and the owners wouldn't give it to him, and they s'posed
   </p>
   <p>
    likely the men was dead by that time, any way. Old Citizen Leigh he went
   </p>
   <p>
    crazy, and used to go about the streets with a bundle of papers in his
   </p>
   <p>
    hands year in and year out. I've seen him a good many times. Gran'ther
   </p>
   <p>
    used to tell me how he escaped. I'll remember it for ye some day if
   </p>
   <p>
    you'll put me in mind.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I got to be mate when I was twenty, and I was as strong a fellow as you
   </p>
   <p>
    could scare up, and darin'!--why, it makes my blood run cold when I
   </p>
   <p>
    think of the reckless things I used to do. I was off at sea after I was
   </p>
   <p>
    fifteen year old, and there wasn't anybody so glad to see me as
   </p>
   <p>
    gran'ther when I came home. I expect he used to be lonesome after I
   </p>
   <p>
    went off, but then his mind failed him quite a while before he died.
   </p>
   <p>
    Father was clever to him, and he'd get him anything he spoke about; but
   </p>
   <p>
    he wasn't a man to set round and talk, and he never took notice himself
   </p>
   <p>
    when gran'ther was out of tobacco, so sometimes it would be a day or
   </p>
   <p>
    two. I know better how he used to feel now that I'm getting to be along
   </p>
   <p>
    in years myself, and likely to be some care to the folks before long. I
   </p>
   <p>
    never could bear to see old folks neglected; nice old men and women who
   </p>
   <p>
    have worked hard in their day and been useful and willin'. I've seen 'em
   </p>
   <p>
    many a time when they couldn't help knowing that the folks would a
   </p>
   <p>
    little rather they'd be in heaven, and a good respectable headstone put
   </p>
   <p>
    up for 'em in the burying-ground.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Well, now, I'm sure I've forgot what I was going to tell you. O, yes;
   </p>
   <p>
    about grandmother dreaming about father when he come home from sea.
   </p>
   <p>
    Well, to go back to the first of it, gran'ther never was rugged; he had
   </p>
   <p>
    ship-fever when he was a young man, and though he lived to be so old, he
   </p>
   <p>
    never could work hard and never got forehanded; and Aunt Hannah Starbird
   </p>
   <p>
    over at East Parish took my sister to fetch up, because she was named
   </p>
   <p>
    for her, and Melinda and Tobias stayed at home with the old folks, and
   </p>
   <p>
    my father went to live with an uncle over in Riverport, whom he was
   </p>
   <p>
    named for. He was in the West India trade and was well-off, and he had
   </p>
   <p>
    no children, so they expected he would do well by father. He was
   </p>
   <p>
    dreadful high-tempered. I've heard say he had the worst temper that was
   </p>
   <p>
    ever raised in Deephaven.
   </p>
   <p>
    "One day he set father to putting some cherries into a bar'l of rum, and
   </p>
   <p>
    went off down to his wharf to see to the loading of a vessel, and afore
   </p>
   <p>
    he come back father found he'd got hold of the wrong bar'l, and had
   </p>
   <p>
    sp'ilt a bar'l of the best Holland gin; he tried to get the cherries
   </p>
   <p>
    out, but that wasn't any use, and he was dreadful afraid of Uncle
   </p>
   <p>
    Matthew, and he run away, and never was heard of from that time out.
   </p>
   <p>
    They supposed he'd run away to sea, as he had a leaning that way, but
   </p>
   <p>
    nobody ever knew for certain; and his mother she 'most mourned herself
   </p>
   <p>
    to death. Gran'ther told me that it got so at last that if they could
   </p>
   <p>
    only know for sure that he was dead it was all they would ask. But it
   </p>
   <p>
    went on four years, and gran'ther got used to it some; though
   </p>
   <p>
    grandmother never would give up. And one morning early, before day, she
   </p>
   <p>
    waked him up, and says she, 'We're going to hear from Matthew. Get up
   </p>
   <p>
    quick and go down to the store!' 'Nonsense,' says he. 'I've seen him,'
   </p>
   <p>
    says grandmother, 'and he's coming home. He looks older, but just the
   </p>
   <p>
    same other ways, and he's got long hair, like a horse's mane, all down
   </p>
   <p>
    over his shoulders.' 'Well, let the dead rest,' says gran'ther; 'you've
   </p>
   <p>
    thought about the boy till your head is turned.' 'I tell you I saw
   </p>
   <p>
    Matthew himself,' says she, 'and I want you to go right down to see if
   </p>
   <p>
    there isn't a letter.' And she kept at him till he saddled the horse,
   </p>
   <p>
    and he got down to the store before it was opened in the morning, and he
   </p>
   <p>
    had to wait round, and when the man came over to unlock it he was 'most
   </p>
   <p>
    ashamed to tell what his errand was, for he had been so many times, and
   </p>
   <p>
    everybody supposed the boy was dead. When he asked for a letter, the man
   </p>
   <p>
    said there was none there, and asked if he was expecting any particular
   </p>
   <p>
    one. He didn't get many letters, I s'pose; all his folks lived about
   </p>
   <p>
    here, and people didn't write any to speak of in those days. Gran'ther
   </p>
   <p>
    said he thought he wouldn't make such a fool of himself again, but he
   </p>
   <p>
    didn't say anything, and he waited round awhile, talking to one and
   </p>
   <p>
    another who came up, and by and by says the store-keeper, who was
   </p>
   <p>
    reading a newspaper that had just come, 'Here's some news for you,
   </p>
   <p>
    Sands, I do believe! There are three vessels come into Boston harbor
   </p>
   <p>
    that have been out whaling and sealing in the South Seas for three or
   </p>
   <p>
    four years, and your son Matthew's name is down on the list of the
   </p>
   <p>
    crew.' 'I tell ye,' says gran'ther, 'I took that paper, and I got on my
   </p>
   <p>
    horse and put for home, and your grandmother she hailed me, and she
   </p>
   <p>
    said, "You've heard, haven't you?" before I told her a word.'
   </p>
   <p>
    "Gran'ther he got his breakfast and started right off for Boston, and
   </p>
   <p>
    got there early the second day, and went right down on the wharves.
   </p>
   <p>
    Somebody lent him a boat, and he went out to where there were two
   </p>
   <p>
    sealers laying off riding at anchor, and he asked a sailor if Matthew
   </p>
   <p>
    was aboard. 'Ay, ay,' says the sailor, 'he's down below.' And he sung
   </p>
   <p>
    out for him, and when he come up out of the hold his hair was long, down
   </p>
   <p>
    over his shoulders like a horse's mane, just as his mother saw it in the
   </p>
   <p>
    dream. Gran'ther he didn't know what to say,--it scared him,--and he
   </p>
   <p>
    asked how it happened; and father told how they'd been off sealing in
   </p>
   <p>
    the South Seas, and he and another man had lived alone on an island for
   </p>
   <p>
    months, and the whole crew had grown wild in their ways of living, being
   </p>
   <p>
    off so long, and for one thing had gone without caps and let their hair
   </p>
   <p>
    grow. The rest of the men had been ashore and got fixed up smart, but he
   </p>
   <p>
    had been busy, and had put it off till that morning; he was just going
   </p>
   <p>
    ashore then. Father was all struck up when he heard about the dream, and
   </p>
   <p>
    said his mind had been dwellin' on his mother and going home, and he
   </p>
   <p>
    come down to let her see him just as he was and she said it was the same
   </p>
   <p>
    way he looked in the dream. He never would have his hair cut--father
   </p>
   <p>
    wouldn't--and wore it in a queue. I remember seeing him with it when I
   </p>
   <p>
    was a boy; but his second wife didn't like the looks of it, and she come
   </p>
   <p>
    up behind him one day and cut it off with the scissors. He was terrible
   </p>
   <p>
    worked up about it. I never see father so mad as he was that day. Now
   </p>
   <p>
    this is just as true as the Bible," said Captain Sands. "I haven't put a
   </p>
   <p>
    word to it, and gran'ther al'ays told a story just as it was. That woman
   </p>
   <p>
    saw her son; but if you ask me what kind of eyesight it was, I can't
   </p>
   <p>
    tell you, nor nobody else."
   </p>
   <p>
    Later that evening Kate and I drifted into a long talk about the
   </p>
   <p>
    captain's stories and these mysterious powers of which we know so
   </p>
   <p>
    little. It was somewhat chilly in the house, and we had kindled a fire
   </p>
   <p>
    in the fireplace, which at first made a blaze which lighted the old room
   </p>
   <p>
    royally, and then quieted down into red coals and lazy puffs of smoke.
   </p>
   <p>
    We had carried the lights away, and sat with our feet on the fender, and
   </p>
   <p>
    Kate's great dog was lying between us on the rug. I remember that
   </p>
   <p>
    evening so well; we could see the stars through the window plainer and
   </p>
   <p>
    plainer as the fire went down, and we could hear the noise of the sea.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Do you remember in the old myth of Demeter and Persephone," Kate asked
   </p>
   <p>
    me, "where Demeter takes care of the child and gives it ambrosia and
   </p>
   <p>
    hides it in fire, because she loves it and wishes to make it immortal,
   </p>
   <p>
    and to give it eternal youth; and then the mother finds it out and cries
   </p>
   <p>
    in terror to hinder her, and the goddess angrily throws the child down
   </p>
   <p>
    and rushes away? And he had to share the common destiny of mankind,
   </p>
   <p>
    though he always had some wonderful inscrutable grace and wisdom,
   </p>
   <p>
    because a goddess had loved him and held him in her arms. I always
   </p>
   <p>
    thought that part of the story beautiful where Demeter throws off her
   </p>
   <p>
    disguise and is no longer an old woman, and the great house is filled
   </p>
   <p>
    with brightness like lightning, and she rushes out through the halls
   </p>
   <p>
    with her yellow hair waving over her shoulders, and the people would
   </p>
   <p>
    give anything to bring her back again, and to undo their mistake. I knew
   </p>
   <p>
    it almost all by heart once," said Kate, "and I am always finding a new
   </p>
   <p>
    meaning in it. I was just thinking that it may be that we all have given
   </p>
   <p>
    to us more or less of another nature, as the child had whom Demeter
   </p>
   <p>
    wished to make like the gods. I believe old Captain Sands is right, and
   </p>
   <p>
    we have these instincts which defy all our wisdom and for which we never
   </p>
   <p>
    can frame any laws. We may laugh at them, but we are always meeting
   </p>
   <p>
    them, and one cannot help knowing that it has been the same through all
   </p>
   <p>
    history. They are powers which are imperfectly developed in this life,
   </p>
   <p>
    but one cannot help the thought that the mystery of this world may be
   </p>
   <p>
    the commonplace of the next."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I wonder," said I, "why it is that one hears so much more of such
   </p>
   <p>
    things from simple country people. They believe in dreams, and they have
   </p>
   <p>
    a kind of fetichism, and believe so heartily in supernatural causes. I
   </p>
   <p>
    suppose nothing could shake Mrs. Patton's faith in warnings. There is no
   </p>
   <p>
    end of absurdity in it, and yet there is one side of such lives for
   </p>
   <p>
    which one cannot help having reverence; they live so much nearer to
   </p>
   <p>
    nature than people who are in cities, and there is a soberness about
   </p>
   <p>
    country people oftentimes that one cannot help noticing. I wonder if
   </p>
   <p>
    they are unconsciously awed by the strength and purpose in the world
   </p>
   <p>
    about them, and the mysterious creative power which is at work with them
   </p>
   <p>
    on their familiar farms. In their simple life they take their instincts
   </p>
   <p>
    for truths, and perhaps they are not always so far wrong as we imagine.
   </p>
   <p>
    Because they are so instinctive and unreasoning they may have a more
   </p>
   <p>
    complete sympathy with Nature, and may hear her voices when wiser ears
   </p>
   <p>
    are deaf. They have much in common, after all, with the plants which
   </p>
   <p>
    grow up out of the ground and the wild creatures which depend upon
   </p>
   <p>
    their instincts wholly."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I think," said Kate, "that the more one lives out of doors the more
   </p>
   <p>
    personality there seems to be in what we call inanimate things. The
   </p>
   <p>
    strength of the hills and the voice of the waves are no longer only
   </p>
   <p>
    grand poetical sentences, but an expression of something real, and more
   </p>
   <p>
    and more one finds God himself in the world, and believes that we may
   </p>
   <p>
    read the thoughts that He writes for us in the book of Nature." And
   </p>
   <p>
    after this we were silent for a while, and in the mean time it grew very
   </p>
   <p>
    late, and we watched the fire until there were only a few sparks left in
   </p>
   <p>
    the ashes. The stars faded away and the moon came up out of the sea, and
   </p>
   <p>
    we barred the great hall door and went up stairs to bed. The lighthouse
   </p>
   <p>
    lamp burned steadily, and it was the only light that had not been blown
   </p>
   <p>
    out in all Deephaven.
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs. Bonny
   </p>
   <p>
    I am sure that Kate Lancaster and I must have spent by far the greater
   </p>
   <p>
    part of the summer out of doors. We often made long expeditions out into
   </p>
   <p>
    the suburbs of Deephaven, sometimes being gone all day, and sometimes
   </p>
   <p>
    taking a long afternoon stroll and coming home early in the evening
   </p>
   <p>
    hungry as hunters and laden with treasure, whether we had been through
   </p>
   <p>
    the pine woods inland or alongshore, whether we had met old friends or
   </p>
   <p>
    made some desirable new acquaintances. We had a fashion of calling at
   </p>
   <p>
    the farm-houses, and by the end of the season we knew as many people as
   </p>
   <p>
    if we had lived in Deephaven all our days. We used to ask for a drink of
   </p>
   <p>
    water; this was our unfailing introduction, and afterward there were
   </p>
   <p>
    many interesting subjects which one could introduce, and we could always
   </p>
   <p>
    give the latest news at the shore. It was amusing to see the curiosity
   </p>
   <p>
    which we aroused. Many of the people came into Deephaven only on special
   </p>
   <p>
    occasions, and I must confess that at first we were often naughty enough
   </p>
   <p>
    to wait until we had been severely cross-questioned before we gave a
   </p>
   <p>
    definite account of ourselves. Kate was very clever at making
   </p>
   <p>
    unsatisfactory answers when she cared to do so. We did not understand,
   </p>
   <p>
    for some time, with what a keen sense of enjoyment many of those people
   </p>
   <p>
    made the acquaintance of an entirely new person who cordially gave the
   </p>
   <p>
    full particulars about herself; but we soon learned to call this by
   </p>
   <p>
    another name than impertinence.
   </p>
   <p>
    I think there were no points of interest in that region which we did not
   </p>
   <p>
    visit with conscientious faithfulness. There were cliffs and
   </p>
   <p>
    pebble-beaches, the long sands and the short sands; there were Black
   </p>
   <p>
    Rock and Roaring Rock, High Point and East Point, and Spouting Rock; we
   </p>
   <p>
    went to see where a ship had been driven ashore in the night, all hands
   </p>
   <p>
    being lost and not a piece of her left larger than an axe-handle; we
   </p>
   <p>
    visited the spot where a ship had come ashore in the fog, and had been
   </p>
   <p>
    left high and dry on the edge of the marsh when the tide went out; we
   </p>
   <p>
    saw where the brig Methuselah had been wrecked, and the shore had been
   </p>
   <p>
    golden with her cargo of lemons and oranges, which one might carry away
   </p>
   <p>
    by the wherryful.
   </p>
   <p>
    Inland there were not many noted localities, but we used to enjoy the
   </p>
   <p>
    woods, and our explorations among the farms, immensely. To the westward
   </p>
   <p>
    the land was better and the people well-to-do; but we went oftenest
   </p>
   <p>
    toward the hills and among the poorer people. The land was uneven and
   </p>
   <p>
    full of ledges, and the people worked hard for their living, at most
   </p>
   <p>
    laying aside only a few dollars each year. Some of the more enterprising
   </p>
   <p>
    young people went away to work in shops and factories; but the custom
   </p>
   <p>
    was by no means universal, and the people had a hungry, discouraged
   </p>
   <p>
    look. It is all very well to say that they knew nothing better, that it
   </p>
   <p>
    was the only life of which they knew anything; there was too often a
   </p>
   <p>
    look of disappointment in their faces, and sooner or later we heard or
   </p>
   <p>
    guessed many stories: that this young man had wished for an education,
   </p>
   <p>
    but there had been no money to spare for books or schooling; and that
   </p>
   <p>
    one had meant to learn a trade, but there must be some one to help his
   </p>
   <p>
    father with the farm-work, and there was no money to hire a man to work
   </p>
   <p>
    in his place if he went away. The older people had a hard look, as if
   </p>
   <p>
    they had always to be on the alert and must fight for their place in the
   </p>
   <p>
    world. One could only forgive and pity their petty sharpness, which
   </p>
   <p>
    showed itself in trifling bargains, when one understood how much a
   </p>
   <p>
    single dollar seemed where dollars came so rarely. We used to pity the
   </p>
   <p>
    young girls so much. It was plain that those who knew how much easier
   </p>
   <p>
    and pleasanter our lives were could not help envying us.
   </p>
   <p>
    There was a high hill half a dozen miles from Deephaven which was known
   </p>
   <p>
    in its region as "the mountain." It was the highest land anywhere near
   </p>
   <p>
    us, and having been told that there was a fine view from the top, one
   </p>
   <p>
    day we went there, with Tommy Dockum for escort. We overtook Mr.
   </p>
   <p>
    Lorimer, the minister, on his way to make parochial calls upon some
   </p>
   <p>
    members of his parish who lived far from church, and to our delight he
   </p>
   <p>
    proposed to go with us instead. It was a great satisfaction to have him
   </p>
   <p>
    for a guide, for he knew both the country and the people more intimately
   </p>
   <p>
    than any one else. It was a long climb to the top of the hill, but not a
   </p>
   <p>
    hard one. The sky was clear, and there was a fresh wind, though we had
   </p>
   <p>
    left none at all at the sea-level. After lunch, Kate and I spread our
   </p>
   <p>
    shawls over a fine cushion of mountain-cranberry, and had a long talk
   </p>
   <p>
    with Mr. Lorimer about ancient and modern Deephaven. He always seemed as
   </p>
   <p>
    much pleased with our enthusiasm for the town as if it had been a
   </p>
   <p>
    personal favor and compliment to himself. I remember how far we could
   </p>
   <p>
    see, that day, and how we looked toward the far-away blue mountains, and
   </p>
   <p>
    then out over the ocean. Deephaven looked insignificant from that height
   </p>
   <p>
    and distance, and indeed the country seemed to be mostly covered with
   </p>
   <p>
    the pointed tops of pines and spruces, and there were long tracts of
   </p>
   <p>
    maple and beech woods with their coloring of lighter, fresher green.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Suppose we go down, now," said Mr. Lorimer, long before Kate and I had
   </p>
   <p>
    meant to propose such a thing; and our feeling was that of dismay. "I
   </p>
   <p>
    should like to take you to make a call with me. Did you ever hear of old
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs. Bonny?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "No," said we, and cheerfully gathered our wraps and baskets; and when
   </p>
   <p>
    Tommy finally came panting up the hill after we had begun to think that
   </p>
   <p>
    our shoutings and whistling were useless, we sent him down to the
   </p>
   <p>
    horses, and went down ourselves by another path. It led us a long
   </p>
   <p>
    distance through a grove of young beeches; the last year's whitish
   </p>
   <p>
    leaves lay thick on the ground, and the new leaves made so close a roof
   </p>
   <p>
    overhead that the light was strangely purple, as if it had come through
   </p>
   <p>
    a great church window of stained glass. After this we went through some
   </p>
   <p>
    hemlock growth, where, on the lower branches, the pale green of the new
   </p>
   <p>
    shoots and the dark green of the old made an exquisite contrast each to
   </p>
   <p>
    the other. Finally we came out at Mrs. Bonny's. Mr. Lorimer had told us
   </p>
   <p>
    something about her on the way down, saying in the first place that she
   </p>
   <p>
    was one of the queerest characters he knew. Her husband used to be a
   </p>
   <p>
    charcoal-burner and basket-maker, and she used to sell butter and
   </p>
   <p>
    berries and eggs, and choke-pears preserved in molasses. She always came
   </p>
   <p>
    down to Deephaven on a little black horse, with her goods in baskets and
   </p>
   <p>
    bags which were fastened to the saddle in a mysterious way. She had the
   </p>
   <p>
    reputation of not being a neat housekeeper, and none of the wise women
   </p>
   <p>
    of the town would touch her butter especially, so it was always a joke
   </p>
   <p>
    when she coaxed a new resident or a strange shipmaster into buying her
   </p>
   <p>
    wares; but the old woman always managed to jog home without the freight
   </p>
   <p>
    she had brought. "She must be very old, now," said Mr. Lorimer; "I have
   </p>
   <p>
    not seen her in a long time. It cannot be possible that her horse is
   </p>
   <p>
    still alive!" And we all laughed when we saw Mrs. Bonny's steed at a
   </p>
   <p>
    little distance, for the shaggy old creature was covered with mud,
   </p>
   <p>
    pine-needles, and dead leaves, with half the last year's burdock-burs in
   </p>
   <p>
    all Deephaven snarled into his mane and tail and sprinkled over his fur,
   </p>
   <p>
    which looked nearly as long as a buffalo's. He had hurt his leg, and his
   </p>
   <p>
    kind mistress had tied it up with a piece of faded red calico and an end
   </p>
   <p>
    of ragged rope. He gave us a civil neigh, and looked at us curiously.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then an impertinent little yellow-and-white dog, with one ear standing
   </p>
   <p>
    up straight and the other drooping over, began to bark with all his
   </p>
   <p>
    might; but he retreated when he saw Kate's great dog, who was walking
   </p>
   <p>
    solemnly by her side and did not deign to notice him. Just now Mrs.
   </p>
   <p>
    Bonny appeared at the door of the house, shading her eyes with her hand,
   </p>
   <p>
    to see who was coming. "Landy!" said she, "if it ain't old Parson
   </p>
   <p>
    Lorimer! And who be these with ye?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "This is Miss Kate Lancaster of Boston, Miss Katharine Brandon's niece,
   </p>
   <p>
    and her friend Miss Denis."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Pleased to see ye," said the old woman; "walk in and lay off your
   </p>
   <p>
    things." And we followed her into the house. I wish you could have seen
   </p>
   <p>
    her: she wore a man's coat, cut off so that it made an odd short jacket,
   </p>
   <p>
    and a pair of men's boots much the worse for wear; also, some short
   </p>
   <p>
    skirts, beside two or three aprons, the inner one being a dress-apron,
   </p>
   <p>
    as she took off the outer ones and threw them into a corner; and on her
   </p>
   <p>
    head was a tight cap, with strings to tie under her chin. I thought it
   </p>
   <p>
    was a nightcap, and that she had forgotten to take it off, and dreaded
   </p>
   <p>
    her mortification if she should suddenly become conscious of it; but I
   </p>
   <p>
    need not have troubled myself, for while we were with her she pulled it
   </p>
   <p>
    on and tied it tighter, as if she considered it ornamental.
   </p>
   <p>
    There were only two rooms in the house; we went into the kitchen, which
   </p>
   <p>
    was occupied by a flock of hens and one turkey. The latter was evidently
   </p>
   <p>
    undergoing a course of medical treatment behind the stove, and was
   </p>
   <p>
    allowed to stay with us, while the hens were remorselessly hustled out
   </p>
   <p>
    with a hemlock broom. They all congregated on the doorstep, apparently
   </p>
   <p>
    wishing to hear everything that was said.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Ben up on the mountain?" asked our hostess. "Real sightly place. Goin'
   </p>
   <p>
    to be a master lot o' rosbries; get any down to the shore sence I quit
   </p>
   <p>
    comin'?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "O yes," said Mr. Lorimer, "but we miss seeing you."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I s'pose so," said Mrs. Bonny, smoothing her apron complacently; "but
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm getting old, and I tell 'em I'm goin' to take my comfort; sence 'he'
   </p>
   <p>
    died, I don't put myself out no great; I've got money enough to keep me
   </p>
   <p>
    long's I live. Beckett's folks goes down often, and I sends by them for
   </p>
   <p>
    what store stuff I want."
   </p>
   <p>
    "How are you now?" asked the minister; "I think I heard you were ill in
   </p>
   <p>
    the spring."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Stirrin', I'm obliged to ye. I wasn't laid up long, and I was so's I
   </p>
   <p>
    could get about most of the time. I've got the best bitters ye ever see,
   </p>
   <p>
    good for the spring of the year. S'pose yer sister, Miss Lorimer,
   </p>
   <p>
    wouldn't like some? she used to be weakly lookin'." But her brother
   </p>
   <p>
    refused the offer, saying that she had not been so well for many years.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Do you often get out to church nowadays, Mrs. Bonny? I believe Mr. Reid
   </p>
   <p>
    preaches in the school-house sometimes, down by the great ledge; doesn't
   </p>
   <p>
    he?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Well, yes, he does; but I don't know as I get much of any good. Parson
   </p>
   <p>
    Reid, he's a worthy creatur', but he never seems to have nothin' to say
   </p>
   <p>
    about foreordination and them p'ints. Old Parson Padelford was the man!
   </p>
   <p>
    I used to set under his preachin' a good deal; I had an aunt living down
   </p>
   <p>
    to East Parish. He'd get worked up, and he'd shut up the Bible and
   </p>
   <p>
    preach the hair off your head, 'long at the end of the sermon. Couldn't
   </p>
   <p>
    understand more nor a quarter part what he said," said Mrs. Bonny,
   </p>
   <p>
    admiringly. "Well, we were a-speaking about the meeting over to the
   </p>
   <p>
    ledge; I don't know's I like them people any to speak of. They had a
   </p>
   <p>
    great revival over there in the fall, and one Sunday I thought's how I'd
   </p>
   <p>
    go; and when I got there, who should be a-prayin' but old Ben Patey,--he
   </p>
   <p>
    always lays out to get converted,--and he kep' it up diligent till I
   </p>
   <p>
    couldn't stand it no longer; and by and by says he, 'I've been a
   </p>
   <p>
    wanderer'; and I up and says, 'Yes, you have, I'll back ye up on that,
   </p>
   <p>
    Ben; ye've wandered around my wood-lot and spoilt half the likely young
   </p>
   <p>
    oaks and ashes I've got, a-stealing your basket-stuff.' And the folks
   </p>
   <p>
    laughed out loud, and up he got and cleared. He's an awful old thief,
   </p>
   <p>
    and he's no idea of being anything else. I wa'n't a-goin' to set there
   </p>
   <p>
    and hear him makin' b'lieve to the Lord. If anybody's heart is in it, I
   </p>
   <p>
    ain't a-goin' to hender 'em; I'm a professor, and I ain't ashamed of it,
   </p>
   <p>
    week-days nor Sundays neither. I can't bear to see folks so pious to
   </p>
   <p>
    meeting, and cheat yer eye-teeth out Monday morning. Well, there! we
   </p>
   <p>
    ain't none of us perfect; even old Parson Moody was round-shouldered,
   </p>
   <p>
    they say."
   </p>
   <p>
    "You were speaking of the Becketts just now," said Mr. Lorimer (after we
   </p>
   <p>
    had stopped laughing, and Mrs. Bonny had settled her big steel-bowed
   </p>
   <p>
    spectacles, and sat looking at him with an expression of extreme wisdom.
   </p>
   <p>
    One might have ventured to call her "peart," I think). "How do they get
   </p>
   <p>
    on? I am seldom in this region nowadays, since Mr. Reid has taken it
   </p>
   <p>
    under his charge."
   </p>
   <p>
    "They get along, somehow or 'nother," replied Mrs. Bonny; "they've got
   </p>
   <p>
    the best farm this side of the ledge, but they're dreadful lazy and
   </p>
   <p>
    shiftless, them young folks. Old Mis' Hate-evil Beckett was tellin' me
   </p>
   <p>
    the other day--she that was Samanthy Barnes, you know--that one of the
   </p>
   <p>
    boys got fighting, the other side of the mountain, and come home with
   </p>
   <p>
    his nose broke and a piece o' one ear bit off. I forget which ear it
   </p>
   <p>
    was. Their mother is a real clever, willin' woman, and she takes it to
   </p>
   <p>
    heart, but it's no use for her to say anything. Mis' Hate-evil Beckett,
   </p>
   <p>
    says she, 'It does make my man feel dreadful to see his brother's folks
   </p>
   <p>
    carry on so.' 'But there,' says I, 'Mis' Beckett, it's just such things
   </p>
   <p>
    as we read of; Scriptur' is fulfilled: In the larter days there shall be
   </p>
   <p>
    disobedient children.'"
   </p>
   <p>
    This application of the text was too much for us, but Mrs. Bonny looked
   </p>
   <p>
    serious, and we did not like to laugh. Two or three of the exiled fowls
   </p>
   <p>
    had crept slyly in, dodging underneath our chairs, and had perched
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves behind the stove. They were long-legged, half-grown
   </p>
   <p>
    creatures, and just at this minute one rash young rooster made a manful
   </p>
   <p>
    attempt to crow. "Do tell!" said his mistress, who rose in great wrath,
   </p>
   <p>
    "you needn't be so forth-putting, as I knows on!" After this we were
   </p>
   <p>
    urged to stay and have some supper. Mrs. Bonny assured us she could pick
   </p>
   <p>
    a likely young hen in no time, fry her with a bit of pork, and get us up
   </p>
   <p>
    "a good meat tea"; but we had to disappoint her, as we had some distance
   </p>
   <p>
    to walk to the house where we had left our horses, and a long drive
   </p>
   <p>
    home.
   </p>
   <p>
    Kate asked if she would be kind enough to lend us a tumbler (for ours
   </p>
   <p>
    was in the basket, which was given into Tommy's charge). We were
   </p>
   <p>
    thirsty, and would like to go back to the spring and get some water.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes, dear," said Mrs. Bonny, "I've got a glass, if it's so's I can find
   </p>
   <p>
    it." And she pulled a chair under the little cupboard over the
   </p>
   <p>
    fireplace, mounted it, and opened the door. Several things fell out at
   </p>
   <p>
    her, and after taking a careful survey she went in, head and shoulders,
   </p>
   <p>
    until I thought that she would disappear altogether; but soon she came
   </p>
   <p>
    back, and reaching in took out one treasure after another, putting them
   </p>
   <p>
    on the mantel-piece or dropping them on the floor. There were some
   </p>
   <p>
    bunches of dried herbs, a tin horn, a lump of tallow in a broken plate,
   </p>
   <p>
    a newspaper, and an old boot, with a number of turkey-wings tied
   </p>
   <p>
    together, several bottles, and a steel trap, and finally, such a
   </p>
   <p>
    tumbler! which she produced with triumph, before stepping down. She
   </p>
   <p>
    poured out of it on the table a mixture of old buttons and squash-seeds,
   </p>
   <p>
    beside a lump of beeswax which she said she had lost, and now pocketed
   </p>
   <p>
    with satisfaction. She wiped the tumbler on her apron and handed it to
   </p>
   <p>
    Kate, but we were not so thirsty as we had been, though we thanked her
   </p>
   <p>
    and went down to the spring, coming back as soon as possible, for we
   </p>
   <p>
    could not lose a bit of the conversation.
   </p>
   <p>
    There was a beautiful view from the doorstep, and we stopped a minute
   </p>
   <p>
    there. "Real sightly, ain't it?" said Mrs. Bonny. "But you ought to be
   </p>
   <p>
    here and look across the woods some morning just at sun-up. Why, the sky
   </p>
   <p>
    is all yaller and red, and them low lands topped with fog! Yes, it's
   </p>
   <p>
    nice weather, good growin' weather, this week. Corn and all the rest of
   </p>
   <p>
    the trade looks first-rate. I call it a forrard season. It's just such
   </p>
   <p>
    weather as we read of, ain't it?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "I don't remember where, just at this moment," said Mr. Lorimer.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Why, in the almanac, bless ye!" said she, with a tone of pity in her
   </p>
   <p>
    grum voice; could it be possible he didn't know,--the Deephaven
   </p>
   <p>
    minister!
   </p>
   <p>
    We asked her to come and see us. She said she had always thought she'd
   </p>
   <p>
    get a chance some time to see Miss Katharine Brandon's house. She should
   </p>
   <p>
    be pleased to call, and she didn't know but she should be down to the
   </p>
   <p>
    shore before very long. She was 'shamed to look so shif'less that day,
   </p>
   <p>
    but she had some good clothes in a chist in the bedroom, and a boughten
   </p>
   <p>
    bonnet with a good cypress veil, which she had when "he" died. She
   </p>
   <p>
    calculated they would do, though they might be old-fashioned, some. She
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed greatly pleased at Mr. Lorimer's having taken the trouble to come
   </p>
   <p>
    to see her. All those people had a great reverence for "the minister."
   </p>
   <p>
    We were urged to come again in "rosbry" time, which was near at hand,
   </p>
   <p>
    and she gave us messages for some of her old customers and
   </p>
   <p>
    acquaintances. "I believe some of those old creatur's will never die,"
   </p>
   <p>
    said she; "why, they're getting to be ter'ble old, ain't they, Mr.
   </p>
   <p>
    Lorimer? There! ye've done me a sight of good, and I wish I could ha'
   </p>
   <p>
    found the Bible, to hear ye read a Psalm." When Mr. Lorimer shook hands
   </p>
   <p>
    with her, at leaving, she made him a most reverential courtesy. He was
   </p>
   <p>
    the greatest man she knew; and once during the call, when he was
   </p>
   <p>
    speaking of serious things in his simple, earnest way, she had so devout
   </p>
   <p>
    a look, and seemed so interested, that Kate and I, and Mr. Lorimer
   </p>
   <p>
    himself, caught a new, fresh meaning in the familiar words he spoke.
   </p>
   <p>
    Living there in the lonely clearing, deep in the woods and far from any
   </p>
   <p>
    neighbor, she knew all the herbs and trees and the harmless wild
   </p>
   <p>
    creatures who lived among them, by heart; and she had an amazing store
   </p>
   <p>
    of tradition and superstition, which made her so entertaining to us that
   </p>
   <p>
    we went to see her many times before we came away in the autumn. We went
   </p>
   <p>
    with her to find some pitcher-plants, one day, and it was wonderful how
   </p>
   <p>
    much she knew about the woods, what keen observation she had. There was
   </p>
   <p>
    something so wild and unconventional about Mrs. Bonny that it was like
   </p>
   <p>
    taking an afternoon walk with a good-natured Indian. We used to carry
   </p>
   <p>
    her offerings of tobacco, for she was a great smoker, and advised us to
   </p>
   <p>
    try it, if ever we should be troubled with nerves, or "narves," as she
   </p>
   <p>
    pronounced the name of that affliction.
   </p>
   <p>
    In Shadow
   </p>
   <p>
    Soon after we went to Deephaven we took a long drive one day with Mr.
   </p>
   <p>
    Dockum, the kindest and silentest of men. He had the care of the Brandon
   </p>
   <p>
    property, and had some business at that time connected with a large
   </p>
   <p>
    tract of pasture-land perhaps ten miles from town. We had heard of the
   </p>
   <p>
    coast-road which led to it, how rocky and how rough and wild it was, and
   </p>
   <p>
    when Kate heard by chance that Mr. Dockum meant to go that way, she
   </p>
   <p>
    asked if we might go with him. He said he would much rather take us than
   </p>
   <p>
    "go sole alone," but he should be away until late and we must take our
   </p>
   <p>
    dinner, which we did not mind doing at all.
   </p>
   <p>
    After we were three or four miles from Deephaven the country looked very
   </p>
   <p>
    different. The shore was so rocky that there were almost no places where
   </p>
   <p>
    a boat could put in, so there were no fishermen in the region, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    farms were scattered wide apart; the land was so poor that even the
   </p>
   <p>
    trees looked hungry. At the end of our drive we left the horse at a
   </p>
   <p>
    lonely little farm-house close by the sea. Mr. Dockum was to walk a long
   </p>
   <p>
    way inland through the woods with a man whom he had come to meet, and he
   </p>
   <p>
    told us if we followed the shore westward a mile or two we should find
   </p>
   <p>
    some very high rocks, for which he knew we had a great liking. It was a
   </p>
   <p>
    delightful day to spend out of doors; there was an occasional whiff of
   </p>
   <p>
    east-wind. Seeing us seemed to be a perfect godsend to the people whose
   </p>
   <p>
    nearest neighbors lived far out of sight. We had a long talk with them
   </p>
   <p>
    before we went for our walk. The house was close by the water by a
   </p>
   <p>
    narrow cove, around which the rocks were low, but farther down the shore
   </p>
   <p>
    the land rose more and more, and at last we stood at the edge of the
   </p>
   <p>
    highest rocks of all and looked far down at the sea, dashing its white
   </p>
   <p>
    spray high over the ledges that quiet day. What could it be in winter
   </p>
   <p>
    when there was a storm and the great waves came thundering in?
   </p>
   <p>
    After we had explored the shore to our hearts' content and were tired,
   </p>
   <p>
    we rested for a while in the shadow of some gnarled pitch-pines which
   </p>
   <p>
    stood close together, as near the sea as they dared. They looked like a
   </p>
   <p>
    band of outlaws; they were such wild-looking trees. They seemed very
   </p>
   <p>
    old, and as if their savage fights with the winter winds had made them
   </p>
   <p>
    hard-hearted. And yet the little wild-flowers and the thin green
   </p>
   <p>
    grass-blades were growing fearlessly close around their feet; and there
   </p>
   <p>
    were some comfortable birds'-nests in safe corners of their rough
   </p>
   <p>
    branches.
   </p>
   <p>
    When we went back to the house at the cove we had to wait some time for
   </p>
   <p>
    Mr. Dockum. We succeeded in making friends with the children, and gave
   </p>
   <p>
    them some candy and the rest of our lunch, which luckily had been even
   </p>
   <p>
    more abundant than usual. They looked thin and pitiful, but even in that
   </p>
   <p>
    lonely place, where they so seldom saw a stranger or even a neighbor,
   </p>
   <p>
    they showed that there was an evident effort to make them look like
   </p>
   <p>
    other children, and they were neatly dressed, though there could be no
   </p>
   <p>
    mistake about their being very poor. One forlorn little soul, with
   </p>
   <p>
    honest gray eyes and a sweet, shy smile, showed us a string of beads
   </p>
   <p>
    which she wore round her neck; there were perhaps two dozen of them,
   </p>
   <p>
    blue and white, on a bit of twine, and they were the dearest things in
   </p>
   <p>
    all her world. When we came away we were so glad that we could give the
   </p>
   <p>
    man more than he asked us for taking care of the horse, and his thanks
   </p>
   <p>
    touched us.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I hope ye may never know what it is to earn every dollar as hard as I
   </p>
   <p>
    have. I never earned any money as easy as this before. I don't feel as
   </p>
   <p>
    if I ought to take it. I've done the best I could," said the man, with
   </p>
   <p>
    the tears coming into his eyes, and a huskiness in his voice. "I've done
   </p>
   <p>
    the best I could, and I'm willin' and my woman is, but everything seems
   </p>
   <p>
    to have been ag'in' us; we never seem to get forehanded. It looks
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes as if the Lord had forgot us, but my woman she never wants me
   </p>
   <p>
    to say that; she says He ain't, and that we might be worse off,--but I
   </p>
   <p>
    don' know. I haven't had my health; that's hendered me most. I'm a
   </p>
   <p>
    boat-builder by trade, but the business's all run down; folks buys 'em
   </p>
   <p>
    second-hand nowadays, and you can't make nothing. I can't stand it to
   </p>
   <p>
    foller deep-sea fishing, and--well, you see what my land's wuth. But my
   </p>
   <p>
    oldest boy, he's getting ahead. He pushed off this spring, and he works
   </p>
   <p>
    in a box-shop to Boston; a cousin o' his mother's got him the chance. He
   </p>
   <p>
    sent me ten dollars a spell ago and his mother a shawl. I don't see how
   </p>
   <p>
    he done it, but he's smart!"
   </p>
   <p>
    This seemed to be the only bright spot in their lives, and we admired
   </p>
   <p>
    the shawl and sat down in the house awhile with the mother, who seemed
   </p>
   <p>
    kind and patient and tired, and to have great delight in talking about
   </p>
   <p>
    what one should wear. Kate and I thought and spoke often of these people
   </p>
   <p>
    afterward, and when one day we met the man in Deephaven we sent some
   </p>
   <p>
    things to the children and his wife, and begged him to come to the house
   </p>
   <p>
    whenever he came to town; but we never saw him again, and though we made
   </p>
   <p>
    many plans for going again to the cove, we never did. At one time the
   </p>
   <p>
    road was reported impassable, and we put off our second excursion for
   </p>
   <p>
    this reason and others until just before we left Deephaven, late in
   </p>
   <p>
    October.
   </p>
   <p>
    We knew the coast-road would be bad after the fall rains, and we found
   </p>
   <p>
    that Leander, the eldest of the Dockum boys, had some errand that way,
   </p>
   <p>
    so he went with us. We enjoyed the drive that morning in spite of the
   </p>
   <p>
    rough road. The air was warm, and sweet with the smell of
   </p>
   <p>
    bayberry-bushes and pitch-pines and the delicious saltness of the sea,
   </p>
   <p>
    which was not far from us all the way. It was a perfect autumn day.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sometimes we crossed pebble beaches, and then went farther inland,
   </p>
   <p>
    through woods and up and down steep little hills; over shaky bridges
   </p>
   <p>
    which crossed narrow salt creeks in the marsh-lands. There was a little
   </p>
   <p>
    excitement about the drive, and an exhilaration in the air, and we
   </p>
   <p>
    laughed at jokes forgotten the next minute, and sang, and were jolly
   </p>
   <p>
    enough. Leander, who had never happened to see us in exactly this
   </p>
   <p>
    hilarious state of mind before, seemed surprised and interested, and
   </p>
   <p>
    became unusually talkative, telling us a great many edifying particulars
   </p>
   <p>
    about the people whose houses we passed, and who owned every wood-lot
   </p>
   <p>
    along the road. "Do you see that house over on the pi'nt?" he asked. "An
   </p>
   <p>
    old fellow lives there that's part lost his mind. He had a son who was
   </p>
   <p>
    drowned off Cod Rock fishing, much as twenty-five years ago, and he's
   </p>
   <p>
    worn a deep path out to the end of the pi'nt where he goes out every
   </p>
   <p>
    hand's turn o' the day to see if he can't see the boat coming in." And
   </p>
   <p>
    Leander looked round to see if we were not amused, and seemed puzzled
   </p>
   <p>
    because we didn't laugh. Happily, his next story was funny.
   </p>
   <p>
    We saw a sleepy little owl on the dead branch of a pine-tree; we saw a
   </p>
   <p>
    rabbit cross the road and disappear in a clump of juniper, and squirrels
   </p>
   <p>
    run up and down trees and along the stone-walls with acorns in their
   </p>
   <p>
    mouths. We passed straggling thickets of the upland sumach, leafless,
   </p>
   <p>
    and holding high their ungainly spikes of red berries; there were sturdy
   </p>
   <p>
    barberry-bushes along the lonely wayside, their unpicked fruit hanging
   </p>
   <p>
    in brilliant clusters. The blueberry-bushes made patches of dull red
   </p>
   <p>
    along the hillsides. The ferns were whitish-gray and brown at the edges
   </p>
   <p>
    of the woods, and the asters and golden-rods which had lately looked so
   </p>
   <p>
    gay in the open fields stood now in faded, frost-bitten companies. There
   </p>
   <p>
    were busy flocks of birds flitting from field to field, ready to start
   </p>
   <p>
    on their journey southward.
   </p>
   <p>
    When we reached the house, to our surprise there was no one in sight and
   </p>
   <p>
    the place looked deserted. We left the wagon, and while Leander went
   </p>
   <p>
    toward the barn, which stood at a little distance, Kate and I went to
   </p>
   <p>
    the house and knocked. I opened the door a little way and said "Hallo!"
   </p>
   <p>
    but nobody answered. The people could not have moved away, for there
   </p>
   <p>
    were some chairs standing outside the door, and as I looked in I saw the
   </p>
   <p>
    bunches of herbs hanging up, and a trace of corn, and the furniture was
   </p>
   <p>
    all there. It was a great disappointment, for we had counted upon seeing
   </p>
   <p>
    the children again. Leander said there was nobody at the barn, and that
   </p>
   <p>
    they must have gone to a funeral; he couldn't think of anything else.
   </p>
   <p>
    Just now we saw some people coming up the road, and we thought at first
   </p>
   <p>
    that they were the man and his wife coming back; but they proved to be
   </p>
   <p>
    strangers, and we eagerly asked what had become of the family.
   </p>
   <p>
    "They're dead, both on 'em. His wife she died about nine weeks ago last
   </p>
   <p>
    Sunday, and he died day before yesterday. Funeral's going to be this
   </p>
   <p>
    afternoon. Thought ye were some of her folks from up country, when we
   </p>
   <p>
    were coming along," said the man.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Guess they won't come nigh," said the woman, scornfully; "'fraid
   </p>
   <p>
    they'd have to help provide for the children. I was half-sister to him,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I've got to take the two least ones."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Did you say he was going to be buried this afternoon?" asked Kate,
   </p>
   <p>
    slowly. We were both more startled than I can tell.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes," said the man, who seemed much better-natured than his wife. She
   </p>
   <p>
    appeared like a person whose only aim in life was to have things over
   </p>
   <p>
    with. "Yes, we're going to bury at two o'clock. They had a master sight
   </p>
   <p>
    of trouble, first and last."
   </p>
   <p>
    Leander had said nothing all this time. He had known the man, and had
   </p>
   <p>
    expected to spend the day with him and to get him to go on two miles
   </p>
   <p>
    farther to help bargain for a dory. He asked, in a disappointed way,
   </p>
   <p>
    what had carried him off so sudden.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Drink," said the woman, relentlessly. "He ain't been good for nothing
   </p>
   <p>
    sence his wife died: she was took with a fever along in the first of
   </p>
   <p>
    August. I'd ha' got up from it!"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Now don't be hard on the dead, Marthy," said her husband. "I guess they
   </p>
   <p>
    done the best they could. They weren't shif'less, you know; they never
   </p>
   <p>
    had no health; 't was against wind and tide with 'em all the time." And
   </p>
   <p>
    Kate asked, "Did you say he was your brother?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes. I was half-sister to him," said the woman, promptly, with perfect
   </p>
   <p>
    unconsciousness of Kate's meaning.
   </p>
   <p>
    "And what will become of those poor children?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "I've got the two youngest over to my place to take care on, and the two
   </p>
   <p>
    next them has been put out to some folks over to the cove. I dare say
   </p>
   <p>
    like's not they'll be sent back."
   </p>
   <p>
    "They're clever child'n, I guess," said the man, who spoke as if this
   </p>
   <p>
    were the first time he had dared take their part. "Don't be ha'sh,
   </p>
   <p>
    Marthy! Who knows but they may do for us when we get to be old?" And
   </p>
   <p>
    then she turned and looked at him with utter contempt. "I can't stand it
   </p>
   <p>
    to hear men-folks talking on what they don't know nothing about," said
   </p>
   <p>
    she. "The ways of Providence is dreadful myster'ous," she went on with a
   </p>
   <p>
    whine, instead of the sharp tone of voice which we had heard before.
   </p>
   <p>
    "We've had a hard row, and we've just got our own children off our hands
   </p>
   <p>
    and able to do for themselves, and now here are these to be fetched up."
   </p>
   <p>
    "But perhaps they'll be a help to you; they seem to be good little
   </p>
   <p>
    things," said Kate. "I saw them in the summer, and they seemed to be
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasant children, and it is dreadfully hard for them to be left alone.
   </p>
   <p>
    It's not their fault, you know. We brought over something for them; will
   </p>
   <p>
    you be kind enough to take the basket when you go home?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Thank ye, I'm sure," said the aunt, relenting slightly. "You can speak
   </p>
   <p>
    to my man about it, and he'll give it to somebody that's going by. I've
   </p>
   <p>
    got to walk in the procession. They'll be obliged, I'm sure. I s'pose
   </p>
   <p>
    you're the young ladies that come here right after the Fourth o' July,
   </p>
   <p>
    ain't you? I should be pleased to have you call and see the child'n if
   </p>
   <p>
    you're over this way again. I heard 'em talk about you last time I was
   </p>
   <p>
    over. Won't ye step into the house and see him? He looks real natural,"
   </p>
   <p>
    she added. But we said, "No, thank you."
   </p>
   <p>
    Leander told us he believed he wouldn't bother about the dory that day,
   </p>
   <p>
    and he should be there at the house whenever we were ready. He evidently
   </p>
   <p>
    considered it a piece of good luck that he had happened to arrive in
   </p>
   <p>
    time for the funeral. We spoke to the man about the things we had
   </p>
   <p>
    brought for the children, which seemed to delight him, poor soul, and we
   </p>
   <p>
    felt sure he would be kind to them. His wife shouted to him from a
   </p>
   <p>
    window of the house that he'd better not loiter round, or they wouldn't
   </p>
   <p>
    be half ready when the folks began to come, and we said good by to him
   </p>
   <p>
    and went away.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was a beautiful morning, and we walked slowly along the shore to the
   </p>
   <p>
    high rocks and the pitch-pine trees which we had seen before; the air
   </p>
   <p>
    was deliciously fresh, and one could take long deep breaths of it. The
   </p>
   <p>
    tide was coming in, and the spray dashed higher and higher. We climbed
   </p>
   <p>
    about the rocks and went down in some of the deep cold clefts into which
   </p>
   <p>
    the sun could seldom shine. We gathered some wild-flowers; bits of
   </p>
   <p>
    pimpernel and one or two sprigs of fringed gentian which had bloomed
   </p>
   <p>
    late in a sheltered place, and a pale little bouquet of asters. We sat
   </p>
   <p>
    for a long time looking off to sea, and we could talk or think of almost
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing beside what we had seen and heard at the farm-house. We said how
   </p>
   <p>
    much we should like to go to that funeral, and we even made up our minds
   </p>
   <p>
    to go back in season, but we gave up the idea: we had no right there,
   </p>
   <p>
    and it would seem as if we were merely curious, and we were afraid our
   </p>
   <p>
    presence would make the people ill at ease, the minister especially. It
   </p>
   <p>
    would be an intrusion.
   </p>
   <p>
    We spoke of the children, and tried to think what could be done for
   </p>
   <p>
    them: we were afraid they would be told so many times that it was lucky
   </p>
   <p>
    they did not have to go to the poor-house, and yet we could not help
   </p>
   <p>
    pitying the hard-worked, discouraged woman whom we had seen, in spite of
   </p>
   <p>
    her bitterness. Poor soul! she looked like a person to whom nobody had
   </p>
   <p>
    ever been very kind, and for whom life had no pleasures: its sunshine
   </p>
   <p>
    had never been warm enough to thaw the ice at her heart.
   </p>
   <p>
    We remembered how we knocked at the door and called loudly, but there
   </p>
   <p>
    had been no answer, and we wondered how we should have felt if we had
   </p>
   <p>
    gone farther into the room and had found the dead man in his coffin, all
   </p>
   <p>
    alone in the house. We thought of our first visit, and what he had said
   </p>
   <p>
    to us, and we wished we had come again sooner, for we might have helped
   </p>
   <p>
    them so much more if we had only known.
   </p>
   <p>
    "What a pitiful ending it is," said Kate. "Do you realize that the
   </p>
   <p>
    family is broken up, and the children are to be half strangers to each
   </p>
   <p>
    other? Did you not notice that they seemed very fond of each other when
   </p>
   <p>
    we saw them in the summer? There was not half the roughness and apparent
   </p>
   <p>
    carelessness of one another which one so often sees in the country.
   </p>
   <p>
    Theirs was such a little world; one can understand how, when the man's
   </p>
   <p>
    wife died, he was bewildered and discouraged, utterly at a loss. The
   </p>
   <p>
    thoughts of winter, and of the little children, and of the struggles he
   </p>
   <p>
    had already come through against poverty and disappointment were
   </p>
   <p>
    terrible thoughts; and like a boat adrift at sea, the waves of his
   </p>
   <p>
    misery brought him in against the rocks, and his simple life was
   </p>
   <p>
    wrecked."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I suppose his grandest hopes and wishes would have been realized in a
   </p>
   <p>
    good farm and a thousand or two dollars in safe keeping," said I. "Do
   </p>
   <p>
    you remember that merry little song in 'As You Like It'?
   </p>
   <p>
    'Who doth ambition shun
   </p>
   <p>
    And loves to live i' the sun,
   </p>
   <p>
    Seeking the food he eats,
   </p>
   <p>
    And pleased with what he gets';
   </p>
   <p>
    and
   </p>
   <p>
    'Here shall he see
   </p>
   <p>
    No enemy
   </p>
   <p>
    But winter and rough weather.'
   </p>
   <p>
    That is all he lived for, his literal daily bread. I suppose what would
   </p>
   <p>
    be prosperity to him would be miserably insufficient for some other
   </p>
   <p>
    people. I wonder how we can help being conscious, in the midst of our
   </p>
   <p>
    comforts and pleasures, of the lives which are being starved to death in
   </p>
   <p>
    more ways than one."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I suppose one thinks more about these things as one grows older," said
   </p>
   <p>
    Kate, thoughtfully. "How seldom life in this world seems to be a
   </p>
   <p>
    success! Among rich or poor only here and there one touches
   </p>
   <p>
    satisfaction, though the one who seems to have made an utter failure may
   </p>
   <p>
    really be the greatest conqueror. And, Helen, I find that I understand
   </p>
   <p>
    better and better how unsatisfactory, how purposeless and disastrous,
   </p>
   <p>
    any life must be which is not a Christian life! It is like being always
   </p>
   <p>
    in the dark, and wandering one knows not where, if one is not learning
   </p>
   <p>
    more and more what it is to have a friendship with God."
   </p>
   <p>
    By the middle of the afternoon the sky had grown cloudy, and a wind
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed to be coming in off the sea, and we unwillingly decided that we
   </p>
   <p>
    must go home. We supposed that the funeral would be all over with, but
   </p>
   <p>
    found we had been mistaken when we reached the cove. We seated ourselves
   </p>
   <p>
    on a rock near the water; just beside us was the old boat, with its
   </p>
   <p>
    killick and painter stretched ashore, where its owner had left it.
   </p>
   <p>
    There were several men standing around the door of the house, looking
   </p>
   <p>
    solemn and important, and by and by one of them came over to us, and we
   </p>
   <p>
    found out a little more of the sad story. We liked this man, there was
   </p>
   <p>
    so much pity in his face and voice. "He was a real willin', honest man,
   </p>
   <p>
    Andrew was," said our new friend, "but he used to be sickly, and seemed
   </p>
   <p>
    to have no luck, though for a year or two he got along some better. When
   </p>
   <p>
    his wife died he was sore afflicted, and couldn't get over it, and he
   </p>
   <p>
    didn't know what to do or what was going to become of 'em with winter
   </p>
   <p>
    comin' on, and--well--I may's well tell ye; he took to drink and it
   </p>
   <p>
    killed him right off. I come over two or three times and made some
   </p>
   <p>
    gruel and fixed him up's well's I could, and the little gals done the
   </p>
   <p>
    best they could, but he faded right out, and didn't know anything the
   </p>
   <p>
    last time I see him, and he died Sunday mornin', when the tide begun to
   </p>
   <p>
    ebb. I always set a good deal by Andrew; we used to play together down
   </p>
   <p>
    to the great cove; that's where he was raised, and my folks lived there
   </p>
   <p>
    too. I've got one o' the little gals. I always knowed him and his wife."
   </p>
   <p>
    Just now we heard the people in the house singing "China," the Deephaven
   </p>
   <p>
    funeral hymn, and the tune suited well that day, with its wailing rise
   </p>
   <p>
    and fall; it was strangely plaintive. Then the funeral exercises were
   </p>
   <p>
    over, and the man with whom we had just been speaking led to the door a
   </p>
   <p>
    horse and rickety wagon, from which the seat had been taken, and when
   </p>
   <p>
    the coffin had been put in he led the horse down the road a little way,
   </p>
   <p>
    and we watched the mourners come out of the house two by two. We heard
   </p>
   <p>
    some one scold in a whisper because the wagon was twice as far off as it
   </p>
   <p>
    need have been. They evidently had a rigid funeral etiquette, and felt
   </p>
   <p>
    it important that everything should be carried out according to rule. We
   </p>
   <p>
    saw a forlorn-looking kitten, with a bit of faded braid round its neck,
   </p>
   <p>
    run across the road in terror and presently appear again on the
   </p>
   <p>
    stone-wall, where she sat looking at the people. We saw the dead man's
   </p>
   <p>
    eldest son, of whom he had told us in the summer with such pride. He had
   </p>
   <p>
    shown his respect for his father as best he could, by a black band on
   </p>
   <p>
    his hat and a pair of black cotton gloves a world too large for him. He
   </p>
   <p>
    looked so sad, and cried bitterly as he stood alone at the head of the
   </p>
   <p>
    people. His aunt was next, with a handkerchief at her eyes, fully equal
   </p>
   <p>
    to the proprieties of the occasion, though I fear her grief was not so
   </p>
   <p>
    heartfelt as her husband's, who dried his eyes on his coat-sleeve again
   </p>
   <p>
    and again. There were perhaps twenty of the mourners, and there was much
   </p>
   <p>
    whispering among those who walked last. The minister and some others
   </p>
   <p>
    fell into line, and the procession went slowly down the slope; a strange
   </p>
   <p>
    shadow had fallen over everything. It was like a November day, for the
   </p>
   <p>
    air felt cold and bleak. There were some great sea-fowl high in the air,
   </p>
   <p>
    fighting their way toward the sea against the wind, and giving now and
   </p>
   <p>
    then a wild, far-off ringing cry. We could hear the dull sound of the
   </p>
   <p>
    sea, and at a little distance from the land the waves were leaping high,
   </p>
   <p>
    and breaking in white foam over the isolated ledges.
   </p>
   <p>
    The rest of the people began to walk or drive away, but Kate and I stood
   </p>
   <p>
    watching the funeral as it crept along the narrow, crooked road. We had
   </p>
   <p>
    never seen what the people called "walking funerals" until we came to
   </p>
   <p>
    Deephaven, and there was something piteous about this; the mourners
   </p>
   <p>
    looked so few, and we could hear the rattle of the wagon-wheels. "He's
   </p>
   <p>
    gone, ain't he?" said some one near us. That was it,--gone.
   </p>
   <p>
    Before the people had entered the house, there had been, I am sure, an
   </p>
   <p>
    indifferent, business-like look, but when they came out, all that was
   </p>
   <p>
    changed; their faces were awed by the presence of death, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    indifference had given place to uncertainty. Their neighbor was
   </p>
   <p>
    immeasurably their superior now. Living, he had been a failure by their
   </p>
   <p>
    own low standards; but now, if he could come back, he would know
   </p>
   <p>
    secrets, and be wise beyond anything they could imagine, and who could
   </p>
   <p>
    know the riches of which he might have come into possession?
   </p>
   <p>
    To Kate and me there came a sudden consciousness of the mystery and
   </p>
   <p>
    inevitableness of death; it was not fear, thank God! but a thought of
   </p>
   <p>
    how certain it was that some day it would be a mystery to us no longer.
   </p>
   <p>
    And there was a thought, too, of the limitation of this present life; we
   </p>
   <p>
    were waiting there, in company with the people, the great sea, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    rocks and fields themselves, on this side the boundary. We knew just
   </p>
   <p>
    then how close to this familiar, every-day world might be the other,
   </p>
   <p>
    which at times before had seemed so far away, out of reach of even our
   </p>
   <p>
    thoughts, beyond the distant stars.
   </p>
   <p>
    We stayed awhile longer, until the little black funeral had crawled out
   </p>
   <p>
    of sight; until we had seen the last funeral guest go away and the door
   </p>
   <p>
    had been shut and fastened with a queer old padlock and some links of
   </p>
   <p>
    rusty chain. The door fitted loosely, and the man gave it a vindictive
   </p>
   <p>
    shake, as if he thought that the poor house had somehow been to blame,
   </p>
   <p>
    and that after a long desperate struggle for life under its roof and
   </p>
   <p>
    among the stony fields the family must go away defeated. It is not
   </p>
   <p>
    likely that any one else will ever go to live there. The man to whom the
   </p>
   <p>
    farm was mortgaged will add the few forlorn acres to his pasture-land,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the thistles which the man who is dead had fought so many years will
   </p>
   <p>
    march in next summer and take unmolested possession.
   </p>
   <p>
    I think to-day of that fireless, empty, forsaken house, where the winter
   </p>
   <p>
    sun shines in and creeps slowly along the floor; the bitter cold is in
   </p>
   <p>
    and around the house, and the snow has sifted in at every crack; outside
   </p>
   <p>
    it is untrodden by any living creature's footstep. The wind blows and
   </p>
   <p>
    rushes and shakes the loose window-sashes in their frames, while the
   </p>
   <p>
    padlock knocks--knocks against the door.
   </p>
   <p>
    Miss Chauncey
   </p>
   <p>
    The Deephaven people used to say sometimes complacently, that certain
   </p>
   <p>
    things or certain people were "as dull as East Parish." Kate and I grew
   </p>
   <p>
    curious to see that part of the world which was considered duller than
   </p>
   <p>
    Deephaven itself; and as upon inquiry we found that it was not out of
   </p>
   <p>
    reach, one day we went there.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was like Deephaven, only on a smaller scale. The village--though it
   </p>
   <p>
    is a question whether that is not an exaggerated term to apply--had
   </p>
   <p>
    evidently seen better days. It was on the bank of a river, and perhaps
   </p>
   <p>
    half a mile from the sea. There were a few old buildings there, some
   </p>
   <p>
    with mossy roofs and a great deal of yellow lichen on the sides of the
   </p>
   <p>
    walls next the sea; a few newer houses, belonging to fishermen; some
   </p>
   <p>
    dilapidated fish-houses; and a row of fish-flakes. Every house seemed to
   </p>
   <p>
    have a lane of its own, and all faced different ways except two
   </p>
   <p>
    fish-houses, which stood amiably side by side. There was a church, which
   </p>
   <p>
    we had been told was the oldest in the region. Through the windows we
   </p>
   <p>
    saw the high pulpit and sounding-board, and finally found the keys at a
   </p>
   <p>
    house near by; so we went in and looked around at our leisure. A rusty
   </p>
   <p>
    foot-stove stood in one of the old square pews, and in the gallery there
   </p>
   <p>
    was a majestic bass-viol with all its strings snapped but the largest,
   </p>
   <p>
    which gave out a doleful sound when we touched it.
   </p>
   <p>
    After we left the church we walked along the road a little way, and came
   </p>
   <p>
    in sight of a fine old house which had apparently fallen into ruin years
   </p>
   <p>
    before. The front entrance was a fine specimen of old-fashioned
   </p>
   <p>
    workmanship, with its columns and carvings, and the fence had been a
   </p>
   <p>
    grand affair in its day, though now it could scarcely stand alone. The
   </p>
   <p>
    long range of out-buildings were falling piece by piece; one shed had
   </p>
   <p>
    been blown down entirely by a late high wind. The large windows had many
   </p>
   <p>
    panes of glass, and the great chimneys were built of the bright red
   </p>
   <p>
    bricks which used to be brought from over-seas in the days of the
   </p>
   <p>
    colonies. We noticed the gnarled lilacs in the yard, the wrinkled
   </p>
   <p>
    cinnamon-roses, and a flourishing company of French pinks, or "bouncing
   </p>
   <p>
    Bets," as Kate called them.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Suppose we go in," said I; "the door is open a little way. There surely
   </p>
   <p>
    must be some stories about its being haunted. We will ask Miss Honora."
   </p>
   <p>
    And we climbed over the boards which were put up like pasture-bars
   </p>
   <p>
    across the wide front gateway.
   </p>
   <p>
    "We shall certainly meet a ghost," said Kate.
   </p>
   <p>
    Just as we stood on the steps the door was pulled wide open; we started
   </p>
   <p>
    back, and, well-grown young women as we are, we have confessed since
   </p>
   <p>
    that our first impulse was to run away. On the threshold there stood a
   </p>
   <p>
    stately old woman who looked surprised at first sight of us, then
   </p>
   <p>
    quickly recovered herself and stood waiting for us to speak. She was
   </p>
   <p>
    dressed in a rusty black satin gown, with scant, short skirt and huge
   </p>
   <p>
    sleeves; on her head was a great black bonnet with a high crown and a
   </p>
   <p>
    close brim, which came far out over her face. "What is your pleasure?"
   </p>
   <p>
    said she; and we felt like two awkward children. Kate partially
   </p>
   <p>
    recovered her wits, and asked which was the nearer way to Deephaven.
   </p>
   <p>
    "There is but one road, past the church and over the hill. It cannot be
   </p>
   <p>
    missed." And she bowed gravely, when we thanked her and begged her
   </p>
   <p>
    pardon, we hardly knew why, and came away.
   </p>
   <p>
    We looked back to see her still standing in the doorway. "Who in the
   </p>
   <p>
    world can she be?" said Kate. And we wondered and puzzled and talked
   </p>
   <p>
    over "the ghost" until we saw Miss Honora Carew, who told us that it was
   </p>
   <p>
    Miss Sally Chauncey.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Indeed, I know her, poor old soul!" said Miss Honora; "she has such a
   </p>
   <p>
    sad history. She is the last survivor of one of the most aristocratic
   </p>
   <p>
    old colonial families. The Chaunceys were of great renown until early in
   </p>
   <p>
    the present century, and then their fortunes changed. They had always
   </p>
   <p>
    been rich and well-educated, and I suppose nobody ever had a gayer,
   </p>
   <p>
    happier time than Miss Sally did in her girlhood, for they entertained a
   </p>
   <p>
    great deal of company and lived in fine style; but her father was
   </p>
   <p>
    unfortunate in business, and at last was utterly ruined at the time of
   </p>
   <p>
    the embargo; then he became partially insane, and died after many years
   </p>
   <p>
    of poverty. I have often heard a tradition that a sailor to whom he had
   </p>
   <p>
    broken a promise had cursed him, and that none of the family had died
   </p>
   <p>
    in their beds or had any good luck since. The East Parish people seem to
   </p>
   <p>
    believe in it, and it is certainly strange what terrible sorrow has come
   </p>
   <p>
    to the Chaunceys. One of Miss Sally's brothers, a fine young officer in
   </p>
   <p>
    the navy who was at home on leave, asked her one day if she could get on
   </p>
   <p>
    without him, and she said yes, thinking he meant to go back to sea; but
   </p>
   <p>
    in a few minutes she heard the noise of a pistol in his room, and
   </p>
   <p>
    hurried in to find him lying dead on the floor. Then there was another
   </p>
   <p>
    brother who was insane, and who became so violent that he was chained
   </p>
   <p>
    for years in one of the upper chambers, a dangerous prisoner. I have
   </p>
   <p>
    heard his horrid cries myself, when I was a young girl," said Miss
   </p>
   <p>
    Honora, with a shiver.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Miss Sally is insane, and has been for many years, and this seems to me
   </p>
   <p>
    the saddest part of the story. When she first lost her reason she was
   </p>
   <p>
    sent to a hospital, for there was no one who could take care of her. The
   </p>
   <p>
    mania was so acute that no one had the slightest thought that she would
   </p>
   <p>
    recover or even live long. Her guardian sold the furniture and pictures
   </p>
   <p>
    and china, almost everything but clothing, to pay the bills at the
   </p>
   <p>
    hospital, until the house was fairly empty; and then one spring day, I
   </p>
   <p>
    remember it well, she came home in her right mind, and, without a
   </p>
   <p>
    thought of what was awaiting her, ran eagerly into her home. It was a
   </p>
   <p>
    terrible shock, and she never has recovered from it, though after a long
   </p>
   <p>
    illness her insanity took a mild form, and she has always been perfectly
   </p>
   <p>
    harmless. She has been alone many years, and no one can persuade her to
   </p>
   <p>
    leave the old house, where she seems to be contented, and does not
   </p>
   <p>
    realize her troubles; though she lives mostly in the past, and has
   </p>
   <p>
    little idea of the present, except in her house affairs, which seem
   </p>
   <p>
    pitiful to me, for I remember the housekeeping of the Chaunceys when I
   </p>
   <p>
    was a child. I have always been to see her, and she usually knows me,
   </p>
   <p>
    though I have been but seldom of late years. She is several years older
   </p>
   <p>
    than I. The town makes her an allowance every year, and she has some
   </p>
   <p>
    friends who take care that she does not suffer, though her wants are
   </p>
   <p>
    few. She is an elegant woman still, and some day, if you like, I will
   </p>
   <p>
    give you something to carry to her, and a message, if I can think of
   </p>
   <p>
    one, and you must go to make her a call. I hope she will happen to be
   </p>
   <p>
    talkative, for I am sure you would enjoy her. For many years she did not
   </p>
   <p>
    like to see strangers, but some one has told me lately that she seems to
   </p>
   <p>
    be pleased if people go to see her."
   </p>
   <p>
    You may be sure it was not many days before Kate and I claimed the
   </p>
   <p>
    basket and the message, and went again to East Parish. We boldly lifted
   </p>
   <p>
    the great brass knocker, and were dismayed because nobody answered.
   </p>
   <p>
    While we waited, a girl came up the walk and said that Miss Sally lived
   </p>
   <p>
    up stairs, and she would speak to her if we liked. "Sometimes she don't
   </p>
   <p>
    have sense enough to know what the knocker means," we were told. There
   </p>
   <p>
    was evidently no romance about Miss Sally to our new acquaintance.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Do you think," said I, "that we might go in and look around the lower
   </p>
   <p>
    rooms? Perhaps she will refuse to see us."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes, indeed," said the girl; "only run the minute I speak; you'll have
   </p>
   <p>
    time enough, for she walks slow and is a little deaf."
   </p>
   <p>
    So we went into the great hall with its wide staircase and handsome
   </p>
   <p>
    cornices and panelling, and then into the large parlor on the right, and
   </p>
   <p>
    through it to a smaller room looking out on the garden, which sloped
   </p>
   <p>
    down to the river. Both rooms had fine carved mantels, with Dutch-tiled
   </p>
   <p>
    fireplaces, and in the cornices we saw the fastenings where pictures had
   </p>
   <p>
    hung,--old portraits, perhaps. And what had become of them? The girl did
   </p>
   <p>
    not know: the house had been the same ever since she could remember,
   </p>
   <p>
    only it would all fall through into the cellar soon. But the old lady
   </p>
   <p>
    was proud as Lucifer, and wouldn't hear of moving out.
   </p>
   <p>
    The floor in the room toward the river was so broken that it was not
   </p>
   <p>
    safe, and we came back through the hall and opened the door at the foot
   </p>
   <p>
    of the stairs. "Guess you won't want to stop long there," said the girl.
   </p>
   <p>
    Three old hens and a rooster marched toward us with great solemnity when
   </p>
   <p>
    we looked in. The cobwebs hung in the room, as they often do in old
   </p>
   <p>
    barns, in long, gray festoons; the lilacs outside grew close against the
   </p>
   <p>
    two windows where the shutters were not drawn, and the light in the room
   </p>
   <p>
    was greenish and dim.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then we took our places on the threshold, and the girl went up stairs
   </p>
   <p>
    and announced us to Miss Sally, and in a few minutes we heard her come
   </p>
   <p>
    along the hall.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Sophia," said she, "where are the gentry waiting?" And just then she
   </p>
   <p>
    came in sight round the turn of the staircase. She wore the same great
   </p>
   <p>
    black bonnet and satin gown, and looked more old-fashioned and ghostly
   </p>
   <p>
    than before. She was not tall, but very erect, in spite of her great
   </p>
   <p>
    age, and her eyes seemed to "look through you" in an uncanny way. She
   </p>
   <p>
    slowly descended the stairs and came toward us with a courteous
   </p>
   <p>
    greeting, and when we had introduced ourselves as Miss Carew's friends
   </p>
   <p>
    she gave us each her hand in a most cordial way and said she was pleased
   </p>
   <p>
    to see us. She bowed us into the parlor and brought us two rickety,
   </p>
   <p>
    straight-backed chairs, which, with an old table, were all the furniture
   </p>
   <p>
    there was in the room. "Sit ye down," said she, herself taking a place
   </p>
   <p>
    in the window-seat. I have seen few more elegant women than Miss
   </p>
   <p>
    Chauncey. Thoroughly at her ease, she had the manner of a lady of the
   </p>
   <p>
    olden times, using the quaint fashion of speech which she had been
   </p>
   <p>
    taught in her girlhood. The long words and ceremonious phrases suited
   </p>
   <p>
    her extremely well. Her hands were delicately shaped, and she folded
   </p>
   <p>
    them in her lap, as no doubt she had learned to do at boarding-school so
   </p>
   <p>
    many years before. She asked Kate and me if we knew any young ladies at
   </p>
   <p>
    that school in Boston, saying that most of her intimate friends had left
   </p>
   <p>
    when she did, but some of the younger ones were there still.
   </p>
   <p>
    She asked for the Carews and Mr. Lorimer, and when Kate told her that
   </p>
   <p>
    she was Miss Brandon's niece, and asked if she had not known her, she
   </p>
   <p>
    said, "Certainly, my dear; we were intimate friends at one time, but I
   </p>
   <p>
    have seen her little of late."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Do you not know that she is dead?" asked Kate.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Ah, they say every one is 'dead,' nowadays. I do not comprehend the
   </p>
   <p>
    silly idea!" said the old lady, impatiently. "It is an excuse, I
   </p>
   <p>
    suppose. She could come to see me if she chose, but she was always a
   </p>
   <p>
    ceremonious body, and I go abroad but seldom now; so perhaps she waits
   </p>
   <p>
    my visit. I will not speak uncourteously, and you must remember me to
   </p>
   <p>
    her kindly."
   </p>
   <p>
    Then she asked us about other old people in Deephaven, and about
   </p>
   <p>
    families in Boston whom she had known in her early days. I think every
   </p>
   <p>
    one of whom she spoke was dead, but we assured her that they were all
   </p>
   <p>
    well and prosperous, and we hoped we told the truth. She asked about the
   </p>
   <p>
    love-affairs of men and women who had died old and gray-headed within
   </p>
   <p>
    our remembrance; and finally she said we must pardon her for these
   </p>
   <p>
    tiresome questions, but it was so rarely she saw any one direct from
   </p>
   <p>
    Boston, of whom she could inquire concerning these old friends and
   </p>
   <p>
    relatives of her family.
   </p>
   <p>
    Something happened after this which touched us both inexpressibly: she
   </p>
   <p>
    sat for some time watching Kate with a bewildered look, which at last
   </p>
   <p>
    faded away, a smile coming in its place. "I think you are like my
   </p>
   <p>
    mother," she said; "did any one ever say to you that you are like my
   </p>
   <p>
    mother? Will you let me see your forehead? Yes; and your hair is only a
   </p>
   <p>
    little darker." Kate had risen when Miss Chauncey did, and they stood
   </p>
   <p>
    side by side. There was a tone in the old lady's voice which brought the
   </p>
   <p>
    tears to my eyes. She stood there some minutes looking at Kate. I wonder
   </p>
   <p>
    what her thoughts were. There was a kinship, it seemed to me, not of
   </p>
   <p>
    blood, only that they both were of the same stamp and rank: Miss
   </p>
   <p>
    Chauncey of the old generation and Kate Lancaster of the new. Miss
   </p>
   <p>
    Chauncey turned to me, saying, "Look up at the portrait and you will see
   </p>
   <p>
    the likeness too, I think." But when she turned and saw the bare
   </p>
   <p>
    wainscoting of the room, she looked puzzled, and the bright flash which
   </p>
   <p>
    had lighted up her face was gone in an instant, and she sat down again
   </p>
   <p>
    in the window-seat; but we were glad that she had forgotten. Presently
   </p>
   <p>
    she said, "Pardon me, but I forget your question."
   </p>
   <p>
    Miss Carew had told us to ask her about her school-days, as she nearly
   </p>
   <p>
    always spoke of that time to her; and, to our delight, Miss Sally told
   </p>
   <p>
    us a long story about her friends and about her "coming-out party," when
   </p>
   <p>
    boat-loads of gay young guests came down from Riverport, and all the
   </p>
   <p>
    gentry from Deephaven. The band from the fort played for the dancing,
   </p>
   <p>
    the garden was lighted, the card-tables were in this room, and a grand
   </p>
   <p>
    supper was served. She also remembered what some of her friends wore,
   </p>
   <p>
    and her own dress was a silver-gray brocade with rosebuds of three
   </p>
   <p>
    colors. She told us how she watched the boats go off up river in the
   </p>
   <p>
    middle of the summer night; how sweet the music sounded; how bright the
   </p>
   <p>
    moonlight was; how she wished we had been there at her party.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I can't believe I am an old woman. It seems only yesterday," said she,
   </p>
   <p>
    thoughtfully. And then she lost the idea, and talked about Kate's
   </p>
   <p>
    great-grandmother, whom she had known, and asked us how she had been
   </p>
   <p>
    this summer.
   </p>
   <p>
    She asked us if we would like to go up stairs where she had a fire, and
   </p>
   <p>
    we eagerly accepted, though we were not in the least cold. Ah, what a
   </p>
   <p>
    sorry place it was! She had gathered together some few pieces of her old
   </p>
   <p>
    furniture, which half filled one fine room, and here she lived. There
   </p>
   <p>
    was a tall, handsome chest of drawers, which I should have liked much to
   </p>
   <p>
    ransack. Miss Carew had told us that Miss Chauncey had large claims
   </p>
   <p>
    against the government, dating back sixty or seventy years, but nobody
   </p>
   <p>
    could ever find the papers; and I felt sure that they must be hidden
   </p>
   <p>
    away in some secret drawer. The brass handles and trimmings were
   </p>
   <p>
    blackened, and the wood looked like ebony. I wanted to climb up and look
   </p>
   <p>
    into the upper part of this antique piece of furniture, and it seemed to
   </p>
   <p>
    me I could at once put my hand on a package of "papers relating to the
   </p>
   <p>
    embargo."
   </p>
   <p>
    On a stand near the window was an old Bible, fairly worn out with
   </p>
   <p>
    constant use. Miss Chauncey was religious; in fact, it was the only
   </p>
   <p>
    subject about which she was perfectly sane. We saw almost nothing of her
   </p>
   <p>
    insanity that day, though afterward she was different. There were days
   </p>
   <p>
    when her mind seemed clear; but sometimes she was silent, and often she
   </p>
   <p>
    would confuse Kate with Miss Brandon, and talk to her of long-forgotten
   </p>
   <p>
    plans and people. She would rarely speak of anything more than a minute
   </p>
   <p>
    or two, and then would drift into an entirely foreign subject.
   </p>
   <p>
    She urged us that afternoon to stay to luncheon with her; she said she
   </p>
   <p>
    could not offer us dinner, but she would give us tea and biscuit, and no
   </p>
   <p>
    doubt we should find something in Miss Carew's basket, as she was always
   </p>
   <p>
    kind in remembering her fancies. Miss Honora had told us to decline, if
   </p>
   <p>
    she asked us to stay; but I should have liked to see her sit at the head
   </p>
   <p>
    of her table, and to be a guest at such a lunch-party.
   </p>
   <p>
    Poor creature! it was a blessed thing that her shattered reason made her
   </p>
   <p>
    unconscious of the change in her fortunes, and incapable of comparing
   </p>
   <p>
    the end of her life with its beginning. To herself she was still Miss
   </p>
   <p>
    Chauncey, a gentlewoman of high family, possessed of unusual worldly
   </p>
   <p>
    advantages. The remembrance of her cruel trials and sorrows had faded
   </p>
   <p>
    from her mind. She had no idea of the poverty of her surroundings when
   </p>
   <p>
    she paced back and forth, with stately steps, on the ruined terraces of
   </p>
   <p>
    her garden; the ranks of lilies and the conserve-roses were still in
   </p>
   <p>
    bloom for her, and the box-borders were as trimly kept as ever; and when
   </p>
   <p>
    she pointed out to us the distant steeples of Riverport, it was plain to
   </p>
   <p>
    see that it was still the Riverport of her girlhood. If the boat-landing
   </p>
   <p>
    at the foot of the garden had long ago dropped into the river and gone
   </p>
   <p>
    out with the tide; if the maids and men who used to do her bidding were
   </p>
   <p>
    all out of hearing; if there had been no dinner company that day and no
   </p>
   <p>
    guests were expected for the evening,--what did it matter? The twilight
   </p>
   <p>
    had closed around her gradually, and she was alone in her house, but she
   </p>
   <p>
    did not heed the ruin of it or the absence of her friends. On the
   </p>
   <p>
    morrow, life would again go on.
   </p>
   <p>
    We always used to ask her to read the Bible to us, after Mr. Lorimer had
   </p>
   <p>
    told us how grand and beautiful it was to listen to her. I shall never
   </p>
   <p>
    hear some of the Psalms or some chapters of Isaiah again without being
   </p>
   <p>
    reminded of her; and I remember just now, as I write, one summer
   </p>
   <p>
    afternoon when Kate and I had lingered later than usual, and we sat in
   </p>
   <p>
    the upper room looking out on the river and the shore beyond, where the
   </p>
   <p>
    light had begun to grow golden as the day drew near sunset. Miss Sally
   </p>
   <p>
    had opened the great book at random and read slowly, "In my Father's
   </p>
   <p>
    house are many mansions"; and then, looking off for a moment at a leaf
   </p>
   <p>
    which had drifted into the window-recess, she repeated it: "In my
   </p>
   <p>
    Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told
   </p>
   <p>
    you." Then she went on slowly to the end of the chapter, and with her
   </p>
   <p>
    hands clasped together on the Bible she fell into a reverie, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    tears came into our eyes as we watched her look of perfect content.
   </p>
   <p>
    Through all her clouded years the promises of God had been her only
   </p>
   <p>
    certainty.
   </p>
   <p>
    Miss Chauncey died early in the winter after we left Deephaven, and one
   </p>
   <p>
    day when I was visiting Kate in Boston Mr. Lorimer came to see us, and
   </p>
   <p>
    told us about her.
   </p>
   <p>
    It seems that after much persuasion she was induced to go to spend the
   </p>
   <p>
    winter with a neighbor, her house having become uninhabitable, and she
   </p>
   <p>
    was, beside, too feeble to live alone. But her fondness for her old home
   </p>
   <p>
    was too strong, and one day she stole away from the people who took care
   </p>
   <p>
    of her, and crept in through the cellar, where she had to wade through
   </p>
   <p>
    half-frozen water, and then went up stairs, where she seated herself at
   </p>
   <p>
    a front window and called joyfully to the people who went by, asking
   </p>
   <p>
    them to come in to see her, as she had got home again. After this she
   </p>
   <p>
    was very ill, and one day, when she was half delirious, they missed her,
   </p>
   <p>
    and found her at last sitting on her hall stairway, which she was too
   </p>
   <p>
    feeble to climb. She lived but a short time afterwards, and in her last
   </p>
   <p>
    days her mind seemed perfectly clear. She said over and over again how
   </p>
   <p>
    good God had always been to her, and she was gentle, and unwilling to be
   </p>
   <p>
    a trouble to those who had the care of her.
   </p>
   <p>
    Mr. Lorimer spoke of her simple goodness, and told us that though she
   </p>
   <p>
    had no other sense of time, and hardly knew if it were summer or winter,
   </p>
   <p>
    she was always sure when Sunday came, and always came to church when he
   </p>
   <p>
    preached at East Parish, her greatest pleasure seeming to be to give
   </p>
   <p>
    money, if there was a contribution. "She may be a lesson to us," added
   </p>
   <p>
    the old minister, reverently; "for, though bewildered in mind, bereft of
   </p>
   <p>
    riches and friends and all that makes this world dear to many of us, she
   </p>
   <p>
    was still steadfast in her simple faith, and was never heard to complain
   </p>
   <p>
    of any of the burdens which God had given her."
   </p>
   <p>
    Last Days in Deephaven
   </p>
   <p>
    When the summer was ended it was no sorrow to us, for we were even more
   </p>
   <p>
    fond of Deephaven in the glorious autumn weather than we had ever been
   </p>
   <p>
    before. Mr. Lancaster was abroad longer than he had intended to be at
   </p>
   <p>
    first, and it was late in the season before we left. We were both ready
   </p>
   <p>
    to postpone going back to town as late as possible; but at last it was
   </p>
   <p>
    time for my friend to re-establish the Boston housekeeping, and to take
   </p>
   <p>
    up the city life again. I must admit we half dreaded it: we were
   </p>
   <p>
    surprised to find how little we cared for it, and how well one can get
   </p>
   <p>
    on without many things which are thought indispensable.
   </p>
   <p>
    For the last fortnight we were in the house a good deal, because the
   </p>
   <p>
    weather was wet and dreary. At one time there was a magnificent storm,
   </p>
   <p>
    and we went every day along the shore in the wind and rain for a mile or
   </p>
   <p>
    two to see the furious great breakers come plunging in against the
   </p>
   <p>
    rocks. I never had seen such a wild, stormy sea as that; the rage of it
   </p>
   <p>
    was awful, and the whole harbor was white with foam. The wind had blown
   </p>
   <p>
    northeast steadily for days, and it seemed to me that the sea never
   </p>
   <p>
    could be quiet and smooth and blue again, with soft white clouds sailing
   </p>
   <p>
    over it in the sky. It was a treacherous sea; it was wicked; it had all
   </p>
   <p>
    the trembling land in its power, if it only dared to send its great
   </p>
   <p>
    waves far ashore. All night long the breakers roared, and the wind
   </p>
   <p>
    howled in the chimneys, and in the morning we always looked fearfully
   </p>
   <p>
    across the surf and the tossing gray water to see if the lighthouse were
   </p>
   <p>
    standing firm on its rock. It was so slender a thing to hold its own in
   </p>
   <p>
    such a wide and monstrous sea. But the sun came out at last, and not
   </p>
   <p>
    many days afterward we went out with Danny and Skipper Scudder to say
   </p>
   <p>
    good by to Mrs. Kew. I have been some voyages at sea, but I never was so
   </p>
   <p>
    danced about in a little boat as I was that day. There was nothing to
   </p>
   <p>
    fear with so careful a crew, and we only enjoyed the roughness as we
   </p>
   <p>
    went out and in, though it took much manoeuvring to land us at the
   </p>
   <p>
    island.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was very sad work to us--saying good by to our friends, and we tried
   </p>
   <p>
    to make believe that we should spend the next summer in Deephaven, and
   </p>
   <p>
    we meant at any rate to go down for a visit. We were glad when the
   </p>
   <p>
    people said they should miss us, and that they hoped we should not
   </p>
   <p>
    forget them and the old place. It touched us to find that they cared so
   </p>
   <p>
    much for us, and we said over and over again how happy we had been, and
   </p>
   <p>
    that it was such a satisfactory summer. Kate laughingly proposed one
   </p>
   <p>
    evening, as we sat talking by the fire and were particularly contented,
   </p>
   <p>
    that we should copy the Ladies of Llangollen, and remove ourselves from
   </p>
   <p>
    society and its distractions.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I have thought often, lately," said my friend, "what a good time they
   </p>
   <p>
    must have had, and I feel a sympathy and friendliness for them which I
   </p>
   <p>
    never felt before. We could have guests when we chose, as we have had
   </p>
   <p>
    this summer, and we could study and grow very wise, and what could be
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasanter? But I wonder if we should grow very lazy if we stayed here
   </p>
   <p>
    all the year round; village life is not stimulating, and there would not
   </p>
   <p>
    be much to do in winter,--though I do not believe that need be true; one
   </p>
   <p>
    may be busy and useful in any place."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I suppose if we really belonged in Deephaven we should think it a hard
   </p>
   <p>
    fate, and not enjoy it half so much as we have this summer," said I.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Our idea of happiness would be making long visits in Boston; and we
   </p>
   <p>
    should be heart-broken when we had to come away and leave our
   </p>
   <p>
    lunch-parties, and symphony concerts, and calls, and fairs, the
   </p>
   <p>
    reading-club and the childrens' hospital. We should think the people
   </p>
   <p>
    uncongenial and behind the times, and that the Ridge road was stupid and
   </p>
   <p>
    the long sands desolate; while we remembered what delightful walks we
   </p>
   <p>
    had taken out Beacon Street to the three roads, and over the Cambridge
   </p>
   <p>
    Bridge. Perhaps we should even be ashamed of the dear old church for
   </p>
   <p>
    being so out of fashion. We should have the blues dreadfully, and think
   </p>
   <p>
    there was no society here, and wonder why we had to live in such a
   </p>
   <p>
    town."
   </p>
   <p>
    "What a gloomy picture!" said Kate, laughing. "Do you know that I have
   </p>
   <p>
    understood something lately better than I ever did before,--it is that
   </p>
   <p>
    success and happiness are not things of chance with us, but of choice. I
   </p>
   <p>
    can see how we might so easily have had a dull summer here. Of course
   </p>
   <p>
    it is our own fault if the events of our lives are hindrances; it is we
   </p>
   <p>
    who make them bad or good. Sometimes it is a conscious choice, but
   </p>
   <p>
    oftener unconscious. I suppose we educate ourselves for taking the best
   </p>
   <p>
    of life or the worst, do not you?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Dear old Deephaven!" said Kate, gently, after we had been silent a
   </p>
   <p>
    little while. "It makes me think of one of its own old ladies, with its
   </p>
   <p>
    clinging to the old fashions and its respect for what used to be
   </p>
   <p>
    respectable when it was young. I cannot make fun of what was once dear
   </p>
   <p>
    to somebody, and which realized somebody's ideas of beauty or fitness. I
   </p>
   <p>
    don't dispute the usefulness of a new, bustling, manufacturing town with
   </p>
   <p>
    its progressive ideas; but there is a simple dignity in a town like
   </p>
   <p>
    Deephaven, as if it tried to be loyal to the traditions of its
   </p>
   <p>
    ancestors. It quietly accepts its altered circumstances, if it has seen
   </p>
   <p>
    better days, and has no harsh feelings toward the places which have
   </p>
   <p>
    drawn away its business, but it lives on, making its old houses and
   </p>
   <p>
    boats and clothes last as long as possible."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I think one cannot help," said I, "having a different affection for an
   </p>
   <p>
    old place like Deephaven from that which one may have for a newer town.
   </p>
   <p>
    Here--though there are no exciting historical associations and none of
   </p>
   <p>
    the veneration which one has for the very old cities and towns
   </p>
   <p>
    abroad--it is impossible not to remember how many people have walked the
   </p>
   <p>
    streets and lived in the houses. I was thinking to-day how many girls
   </p>
   <p>
    might have grown up in this house, and that their places have been ours;
   </p>
   <p>
    we have inherited their pleasures, and perhaps have carried on work
   </p>
   <p>
    which they began. We sit in somebody's favorite chair and look out of
   </p>
   <p>
    the windows at the sea, and have our wishes and our hopes and plans just
   </p>
   <p>
    as they did before us. Something of them still lingers where their lives
   </p>
   <p>
    were spent. We are often reminded of our friends who have died; why are
   </p>
   <p>
    we not reminded as surely of strangers in such a house as this,--finding
   </p>
   <p>
    some trace of the lives which were lived among the sights we see and the
   </p>
   <p>
    things we handle, as the incense of many masses lingers in some old
   </p>
   <p>
    cathedral, and one catches the spirit of longing and prayer where so
   </p>
   <p>
    many heavy hearts have brought their burdens and have gone away
   </p>
   <p>
    comforted?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "When I first came here," said Kate, "it used to seem very sad to me to
   </p>
   <p>
    find Aunt Katharine's little trinkets lying about the house. I have
   </p>
   <p>
    often thought of what you have just said. I heard Mrs. Patton say the
   </p>
   <p>
    other day that there is no pocket in a shroud, and of course it is
   </p>
   <p>
    better that we should carry nothing out of this world. Yet I can't help
   </p>
   <p>
    wishing that it were possible to keep some of my worldly goods always.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are one or two books of mine and some little things which I have
   </p>
   <p>
    had a long time, and of which I have grown very fond. It makes me so
   </p>
   <p>
    sorry to think of their being neglected and lost. I cannot believe I
   </p>
   <p>
    shall forget these earthly treasures when I am in heaven, and I wonder
   </p>
   <p>
    if I shall not miss them. Isn't it strange to think of not reading one's
   </p>
   <p>
    Bible any more? I suppose this is a very low view of heaven, don't you?"
   </p>
   <p>
    And we both smiled.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I think the next dwellers in this house ought to find a decided
   </p>
   <p>
    atmosphere of contentment," said I. "Have you ever thought that it took
   </p>
   <p>
    us some time to make it your house instead of Miss Brandon's? It used to
   </p>
   <p>
    seem to me that it was still under her management, that she was its
   </p>
   <p>
    mistress; but now it belongs to you, and if I were ever to come back
   </p>
   <p>
    without you I should find you here."
   </p>
   <p>
    *       *       *       *       *
   </p>
   <p>
    It is bewildering to know that this is the last chapter, and that it
   </p>
   <p>
    must not be long. I remember so many of our pleasures of which I have
   </p>
   <p>
    hardly said a word. There were our guests, of whom I have told you
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing, and of whom there was so much to say. Of course we asked my
   </p>
   <p>
    Aunt Mary to visit us, and Miss Margaret Tennant, and many of our
   </p>
   <p>
    girlfriends. All the people we know who have yachts made the port of
   </p>
   <p>
    Deephaven if they were cruising in the neighboring waters. Once a most
   </p>
   <p>
    cheerful party of Kate's cousins and some other young people whom we
   </p>
   <p>
    knew very well came to visit us in this way, and the yacht was kept in
   </p>
   <p>
    the harbor a week or more, while we were all as gay as bobolinks and
   </p>
   <p>
    went frisking about the country, and kept late hours in the sober old
   </p>
   <p>
    Brandon house. My Aunt Mary, who was with us, and Kate's aunt, Mrs.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thorniford, who knew the Carews, and was commander of the yacht-party,
   </p>
   <p>
    tried to keep us in order, and to make us ornaments to Deephaven society
   </p>
   <p>
    instead of reproaches and stumbling-blocks. Kate's younger brothers were
   </p>
   <p>
    with us, waiting until it was time for them to go back to college, and
   </p>
   <p>
    I think there never had been such picnics in Deephaven before, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    fear there never will be again.
   </p>
   <p>
    We are fond of reading, and we meant to do a great deal of it, as every
   </p>
   <p>
    one does who goes away for the summer; but I must confess that our grand
   </p>
   <p>
    plans were not well carried out. Our German dictionaries were on the
   </p>
   <p>
    table in the west parlor until the sight of them mortified us, and
   </p>
   <p>
    finally, to avoid their silent reproach, I put them in the closet, with
   </p>
   <p>
    the excuse that it would be as easy to get them there, and they would be
   </p>
   <p>
    out of the way. We used to have the magazines sent us from town; you
   </p>
   <p>
    would have smiled at the box of books which we carried to Deephaven, and
   </p>
   <p>
    indeed we sent two or three times for others; but I do not remember that
   </p>
   <p>
    we ever carried out that course of study which we had planned with so
   </p>
   <p>
    much interest. We were out of doors so much that there was often little
   </p>
   <p>
    time for anything else.
   </p>
   <p>
    Kate said one day that she did not care, in reading, to be always making
   </p>
   <p>
    new acquaintances, but to be seeing more of old ones; and I think it is
   </p>
   <p>
    a very wise idea. We each have our pet books; Kate carries with her a
   </p>
   <p>
    much-worn copy of "Mr. Rutherford's Children," which has been her
   </p>
   <p>
    delight ever since she can remember. Sibyl and Chryssa are dear old
   </p>
   <p>
    friends, though I suppose now it is not merely what Kate reads, but what
   </p>
   <p>
    she associates with the story. I am not often separated from Jean
   </p>
   <p>
    Ingelow's "Stories told to a Child," that charmingly wise and pleasant
   </p>
   <p>
    little book. It is always new, like Kate's favorite. It is very hard to
   </p>
   <p>
    make a list of the books one likes best, but I remember that we had "The
   </p>
   <p>
    Village on the Cliff," and "Henry Esmond," and "Tom Brown at Rugby,"
   </p>
   <p>
    with his more serious ancestor, "Sir Thomas Browne." I am sure we had
   </p>
   <p>
    "Fenelon," for we always have that; and there was "Pet Marjorie," and
   </p>
   <p>
    "Rab," and "Annals of a Parish," and "The Life of the Reverend Sydney
   </p>
   <p>
    Smith"; beside Miss Tytler's "Days of Yore," and "The Holy and Profane
   </p>
   <p>
    State," by Thomas Fuller, from which Kate gets so much entertainment and
   </p>
   <p>
    profit. We read Mr. Emerson's essays together, out of doors, and some
   </p>
   <p>
    stories which had been our dear friends at school, like "Leslie
   </p>
   <p>
    Goldthwaite." There was a very good library in the house, and we both
   </p>
   <p>
    like old books, so we enjoyed that. And we used to read the Spectator,
   </p>
   <p>
    and many old-fashioned stories and essays and sermons, with much more
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasure because they had such quaint old brown leather bindings. You
   </p>
   <p>
    will not doubt that we had some cherished volumes of poetry, or that we
   </p>
   <p>
    used to read them aloud to each other when we sat in our favorite corner
   </p>
   <p>
    of the rocks at the shore, or were in the pine woods of an afternoon.
   </p>
   <p>
    We used to go out to tea, and do a great deal of social visiting, which
   </p>
   <p>
    was very pleasant. Dinner-parties were not in fashion, though it was a
   </p>
   <p>
    great attention to be asked to spend the day, which courtesy we used to
   </p>
   <p>
    delight in extending to our friends; and we entertained company in that
   </p>
   <p>
    way often. When we first went out we were somewhat interesting on
   </p>
   <p>
    account of our clothes, which were of later pattern than had been
   </p>
   <p>
    adopted generally in Deephaven. We used to take great pleasure in
   </p>
   <p>
    arraying ourselves on high days and holidays, since when we went
   </p>
   <p>
    wandering on shore, or out sailing or rowing, we did not always dress as
   </p>
   <p>
    befitted our position in the town. Fish-scales and blackberry-briers so
   </p>
   <p>
    soon disfigure one's clothes.
   </p>
   <p>
    We became in the course of time learned in all manner of 'longshore
   </p>
   <p>
    lore, and even profitably employed ourselves one morning in going
   </p>
   <p>
    clam-digging with old Ben Horn, a most fascinating ancient mariner. We
   </p>
   <p>
    both grew so well and brown and strong, and Kate and I did not get tired
   </p>
   <p>
    of each other at all, which I think was wonderful, for few friendships
   </p>
   <p>
    would bear such a test. We were together always, and alone together a
   </p>
   <p>
    great deal; and we became wonderfully well acquainted. We are such good
   </p>
   <p>
    friends that we often were silent for a long time, when mere
   </p>
   <p>
    acquaintances would have felt compelled to talk and try to entertain
   </p>
   <p>
    each other.
   </p>
   <p>
    Before we left the leaves had fallen off all the trees except the oaks,
   </p>
   <p>
    which make in cold weather one of the dreariest sounds one ever hears: a
   </p>
   <p>
    shivering rustle, which makes one pity the tree and imagine it
   </p>
   <p>
    shelterless and forlorn. The sea had looked rough and cold for many
   </p>
   <p>
    days, and the old house itself had grown chilly,--all the world seemed
   </p>
   <p>
    waiting for the snow to come. There was nobody loitering on the wharves,
   </p>
   <p>
    and when we went down the street we walked fast, arm in arm, to keep
   </p>
   <p>
    warm. The houses were shut up as close as possible, and the old sailors
   </p>
   <p>
    did not seem cheery any longer; they looked forlorn, and it was not a
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasant prospect to be so long weather-bound in port. If they ventured
   </p>
   <p>
    out, they put on ancient great-coats, with huge flaps to the pockets and
   </p>
   <p>
    large horn buttons, and they looked contemptuously at the vane, which
   </p>
   <p>
    always pointed to the north or east. It felt like winter, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    captains rolled more than ever as they walked, as if they were on deck
   </p>
   <p>
    in a heavy sea. The rheumatism claimed many victims, and there was one
   </p>
   <p>
    day, it must be confessed, when a biting, icy fog was blown in-shore,
   </p>
   <p>
    that Kate and I were willing to admit that we could be as comfortable in
   </p>
   <p>
    town, and it was almost time for sealskin jackets.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the front yards we saw the flower-beds black with frost, except a few
   </p>
   <p>
    brave pansies which had kept green and had bloomed under the tall
   </p>
   <p>
    china-aster stalks, and one day we picked some of these little flowers
   </p>
   <p>
    to put between the leaves of a book and take away with us. I think we
   </p>
   <p>
    loved Deephaven all the more in those last days, with a bit of
   </p>
   <p>
    compassion in our tenderness for the dear old town which had so little
   </p>
   <p>
    to amuse it. So long a winter was coming, but we thought with a sigh how
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasant it would be in the spring.
   </p>
   <p>
    You would have smiled at the treasures we brought away with us. We had
   </p>
   <p>
    become so fond of even our fishing-lines; and this very day you may see
   </p>
   <p>
    in Kate's room two great bunches of Deephaven cat-o'-nine-tails. They
   </p>
   <p>
    were much in our way on the journey home, but we clung affectionately to
   </p>
   <p>
    these last sheaves of our harvest.
   </p>
   <p>
    The morning we came away our friends were all looking out from door or
   </p>
   <p>
    window to see us go by, and after we had passed the last house and there
   </p>
   <p>
    was no need to smile any longer, we were very dismal. The sun was
   </p>
   <p>
    shining again bright and warm as if the Indian summer were beginning,
   </p>
   <p>
    and we wished that it had been a rainy day.
   </p>
   <p>
    The thought of Deephaven will always bring to us our long quiet summer
   </p>
   <p>
    days, and reading aloud on the rocks by the sea, the fresh salt air, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the glory of the sunsets; the wail of the Sunday psalm-singing at
   </p>
   <p>
    church, the yellow lichen that grew over the trees, the houses, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    stone-walls; our boating and wanderings ashore; our importance as
   </p>
   <p>
    members of society, and how kind every one was to us both. By and by
   </p>
   <p>
    the Deephaven warehouses will fall and be used for firewood by the
   </p>
   <p>
    fisher-people, and the wharves will be worn away by the tides. The few
   </p>
   <p>
    old gentlefolks who still linger will be dead then; and I wonder if some
   </p>
   <p>
    day Kate Lancaster and I will go down to Deephaven for the sake of old
   </p>
   <p>
    times, and read the epitaphs in the burying-ground, look out to sea, and
   </p>
   <p>
    talk quietly about the girls who were so happy there one summer long
   </p>
   <p>
    before. I should like to walk along the beach at sunset, and watch the
   </p>
   <p>
    color of the marshes and the sea change as the light of the sky goes
   </p>
   <p>
    out. It would make the old days come back vividly. We should see the
   </p>
   <p>
    roofs and chimneys of the village, and the great Chantrey elms look
   </p>
   <p>
    black against the sky. A little later the marsh fog would show faintly
   </p>
   <p>
    white, and we should feel it deliciously cold and wet against our hands
   </p>
   <p>
    and faces; when we looked up there would be a star; the crickets would
   </p>
   <p>
    chirp loudly; perhaps some late sea-birds would fly inland. Turning, we
   </p>
   <p>
    should see the lighthouse lamp shine out over the water, and the great
   </p>
   <p>
    sea would move and speak to us lazily in its idle, high-tide sleep.

   <p>
    An Autumn Holiday
   </p>
   <p>
    I had started early in the afternoon for a long walk; it was just the
   </p>
   <p>
    weather for walking, and I went across the fields with a delighted
   </p>
   <p>
    heart. The wind came straight in from the sea, and the sky was bright
   </p>
   <p>
    blue; there was a little tinge of red still lingering on the maples, and
   </p>
   <p>
    my dress brushed over the late golden-rods, while my old dog, who seemed
   </p>
   <p>
    to have taken a new lease of youth, jumped about wildly and raced after
   </p>
   <p>
    the little birds that flew up out of the long brown grass--the constant
   </p>
   <p>
    little chickadees, that would soon sing before the coming of snow. But
   </p>
   <p>
    this day brought no thought of winter; it was one of the October days
   </p>
   <p>
    when to breathe the air is like drinking wine, and every touch of the
   </p>
   <p>
    wind against one's face is a caress: like a quick, sweet kiss, that wind
   </p>
   <p>
    is. You have a sense of companionship; it is a day that loves you.
   </p>
   <p>
    I went strolling along, with this dear idle day for company; it was a
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasure to be alive, and to go through the dry grass, and to spring
   </p>
   <p>
    over the stone walls and the shaky pasture fences. I stopped by each of
   </p>
   <p>
    the stray apple-trees that came in my way, to make friends with it, or
   </p>
   <p>
    to ask after its health, if it were an old friend. These old apple-trees
   </p>
   <p>
    make very charming bits of the world in October; the leaves cling to
   </p>
   <p>
    them later than to the other trees, and the turf keeps short and green
   </p>
   <p>
    underneath; and in this grass, which was frosty in the morning, and has
   </p>
   <p>
    not quite dried yet, you can find some cold little cider apples, with
   </p>
   <p>
    one side knurly, and one shiny bright red or yellow cheek. They are wet
   </p>
   <p>
    with dew, these little apples, and a black ant runs anxiously over them
   </p>
   <p>
    when you turn them round and round to see where the best place is to
   </p>
   <p>
    bite. There will almost always be a bird's nest in the tree, and it is
   </p>
   <p>
    most likely to be a robin's nest. The prehistoric robins must have been
   </p>
   <p>
    cave dwellers, for they still make their nests as much like cellars as
   </p>
   <p>
    they can, though they follow the new fashion and build them aloft. One
   </p>
   <p>
    always has a thought of spring at the sight of a robin's nest. It is so
   </p>
   <p>
    little while ago that it was spring, and we were so glad to have the
   </p>
   <p>
    birds come back, and the life of the new year was just showing itself;
   </p>
   <p>
    we were looking forward to so much growth and to the realization and
   </p>
   <p>
    perfection of so many things. I think the sadness of autumn, or the
   </p>
   <p>
    pathos of it, is like that of elderly people. We have seen how the
   </p>
   <p>
    flowers looked when they bloomed and have eaten the fruit when it was
   </p>
   <p>
    ripe; the questions have had their answer, the days we waited for have
   </p>
   <p>
    come and gone. Everything has stopped growing. And so the children have
   </p>
   <p>
    grown to be men and women, their lives have been lived, the autumn has
   </p>
   <p>
    come. We have seen what our lives would be like when we were older;
   </p>
   <p>
    success or disappointment, it is all over at any rate. Yet it only makes
   </p>
   <p>
    one sad to think it is autumn with the flowers or with one's own life,
   </p>
   <p>
    when one forgets that always and always there will be the spring again.
   </p>
   <p>
    I am very fond of walking between the roads. One grows so familiar with
   </p>
   <p>
    the highways themselves. But once leap the fence and there are a hundred
   </p>
   <p>
    roads that you can take, each with its own scenery and entertainment.
   </p>
   <p>
    Every walk of this kind proves itself a tour of exploration and
   </p>
   <p>
    discovery, and the fields of my own town, which I think I know so well,
   </p>
   <p>
    are always new fields. I find new ways to go, new sights to see, new
   </p>
   <p>
    friends among the things that grow, and new treasures and pleasures
   </p>
   <p>
    every summer; and later, when the frosts have come and the swamps have
   </p>
   <p>
    frozen, I can go everywhere I like all over my world.
   </p>
   <p>
    That afternoon I found something I had never seen before--a little grave
   </p>
   <p>
    alone in a wide pasture which had once been a field. The nearest house
   </p>
   <p>
    was at least two miles away, but by hunting for it I found a very old
   </p>
   <p>
    cellar, where the child's home used to be, not very far off, along the
   </p>
   <p>
    slope. It must have been a great many years ago that the house had stood
   </p>
   <p>
    there; and the small slate head-stone was worn away by the rain and
   </p>
   <p>
    wind, so there was nothing to be read, if indeed there had ever been any
   </p>
   <p>
    letters on it. It had looked many a storm in the face, and many a red
   </p>
   <p>
    sunset. I suppose the woods near by had grown and been cut, and grown
   </p>
   <p>
    again, since it was put there. There was an old sweet-brier bush growing
   </p>
   <p>
    on the short little grave, and in the grass underneath I found a
   </p>
   <p>
    ground-sparrow's nest. It was like a little neighborhood, and I have
   </p>
   <p>
    felt ever since as if I belonged to it; and I wondered then if one of
   </p>
   <p>
    the young ground-sparrows was not always sent to take the nest when the
   </p>
   <p>
    old ones were done with it, so they came back in the spring year after
   </p>
   <p>
    year to live there, and there were always the stone and the sweet-brier
   </p>
   <p>
    bush and the birds to remember the child. It was such a lonely place in
   </p>
   <p>
    that wide field under the great sky, and yet it was so comfortable too;
   </p>
   <p>
    but the sight of the little grave at first touched me strangely, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    tried to picture to myself the procession that came out from the house
   </p>
   <p>
    the day of the funeral, and I thought of the mother in the evening after
   </p>
   <p>
    all the people had gone home, and how she missed the baby, and kept
   </p>
   <p>
    seeing the new grave out here in the twilight as she went about her
   </p>
   <p>
    work. I suppose the family moved away, and so all the rest were buried
   </p>
   <p>
    elsewhere.
   </p>
   <p>
    I often think of this place, and I link it in my thoughts with something
   </p>
   <p>
    I saw once in the water when I was out at sea: a little boat that some
   </p>
   <p>
    child had lost, that had drifted down the river and out to sea; too long
   </p>
   <p>
    a voyage, for it was a sad little wreck, with even its white sail of a
   </p>
   <p>
    hand-breadth half under water, and its twine rigging trailing astern. It
   </p>
   <p>
    was a silly little boat, and no loss, except to its owner, to whom it
   </p>
   <p>
    had seemed as brave and proud a thing as any ship of the line to you and
   </p>
   <p>
    me. It was a shipwreck of his small hopes, I suppose, and I can see it
   </p>
   <p>
    now, the toy of the great winds and waves, as it floated on its way,
   </p>
   <p>
    while I sailed on mine, out of sight of land.
   </p>
   <p>
    The little grave is forgotten by everybody but me, I think: the mother
   </p>
   <p>
    must have found the child again in heaven a very long time ago: but in
   </p>
   <p>
    the winter I shall wonder if the snow has covered it well, and next year
   </p>
   <p>
    I shall go to see the sweet-brier bush when it is in bloom. God knows
   </p>
   <p>
    what use that life was, the grave is such a short one, and nobody knows
   </p>
   <p>
    whose little child it was; but perhaps a thousand people in the world
   </p>
   <p>
    to-day are better because it brought a little love into the world that
   </p>
   <p>
    was not there before.
   </p>
   <p>
    I sat so long here in the sun that the dog, after running after all the
   </p>
   <p>
    birds, and even chasing crickets, and going through a great piece of
   </p>
   <p>
    affectation in barking before an empty woodchuck's hole to kill time,
   </p>
   <p>
    came to sit patiently in front of me, as if he wished to ask when I
   </p>
   <p>
    would go on. I had never been in this part of the pasture before. It was
   </p>
   <p>
    at one side of the way I usually took, so presently I went on to find a
   </p>
   <p>
    favorite track of mine, half a mile to the right, along the bank of a
   </p>
   <p>
    brook. There had been heavy rains the week before, and I found more
   </p>
   <p>
    water than usual running, and the brook was apparently in a great hurry.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was very quiet along the shore of it; the frogs had long ago gone
   </p>
   <p>
    into winter-quarters, and there was not one to splash into the water
   </p>
   <p>
    when he saw me coming. I did not see a musk-rat either, though I knew
   </p>
   <p>
    where their holes were by the piles of fresh-water mussel shells that
   </p>
   <p>
    they had untidily thrown out at their front door. I thought it might be
   </p>
   <p>
    well to hunt for mussels myself, and crack them in search of pearls, but
   </p>
   <p>
    it was too serene and beautiful a day. I was not willing to disturb the
   </p>
   <p>
    comfort of even a shell-fish. It was one of the days when one does not
   </p>
   <p>
    think of being tired: the scent of the dry everlasting flowers, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    freshness of the wind, and the cawing of the crows, all come to me as I
   </p>
   <p>
    think of it, and I remember that I went a long way before I began to
   </p>
   <p>
    think of going home again. I knew I could not be far from a cross-road,
   </p>
   <p>
    and when I climbed a low hill I saw a house which I was glad to make the
   </p>
   <p>
    end of my walk--for a time, at any rate. It was some time since I had
   </p>
   <p>
    seen the old woman who lived there, and I liked her dearly, and was sure
   </p>
   <p>
    of a welcome. I went down through the pasture lane, and just then I saw
   </p>
   <p>
    my father drive away up the road, just too far for me to make him hear
   </p>
   <p>
    when I called. That seemed too bad at first, until I remembered that he
   </p>
   <p>
    would come back again over the same road after a while, and in the mean
   </p>
   <p>
    time I could make my call. The house was low and long and unpainted,
   </p>
   <p>
    with a great many frost-bitten flowers about it. Some hollyhocks were
   </p>
   <p>
    bowed down despairingly, and the morning-glory vines were more miserable
   </p>
   <p>
    still. Some of the smaller plants had been covered to keep them from
   </p>
   <p>
    freezing, and were braving out a few more days, but no shelter would
   </p>
   <p>
    avail them much longer. And already nobody minded whether the gate was
   </p>
   <p>
    shut or not, and part of the great flock of hens were marching proudly
   </p>
   <p>
    about among the wilted posies, which they had stretched their necks
   </p>
   <p>
    wistfully through the fence for all summer. I heard the noise of
   </p>
   <p>
    spinning in the house, and my dog scurried off after the cat as I went
   </p>
   <p>
    in the door. I saw Miss Polly Marsh and her sister, Mrs. Snow, stepping
   </p>
   <p>
    back and forward together spinning yarn at a pair of big wheels. The
   </p>
   <p>
    wheels made such a noise with their whir and creak, and my friends were
   </p>
   <p>
    talking so fast as they twisted and turned the yarn, that they did not
   </p>
   <p>
    hear my footstep, and I stood in the doorway watching them, it was such
   </p>
   <p>
    a quaint and pretty sight. They went together like a pair of horses, and
   </p>
   <p>
    kept step with each other to and fro. They were about the same size, and
   </p>
   <p>
    were cheerful old bodies, looking a good deal alike, with their checked
   </p>
   <p>
    handkerchiefs over their smooth gray hair, their dark gowns made short
   </p>
   <p>
    in the skirts, and their broad little feet in gray stockings and low
   </p>
   <p>
    leather shoes without heels. They stood straight, and though they were
   </p>
   <p>
    quick at their work they moved stiffly; they were talking busily about
   </p>
   <p>
    some one.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I could tell by the way the doctor looked that he didn't think there
   </p>
   <p>
    was much of anything the matter with her," said Miss Polly Marsh. "'You
   </p>
   <p>
    needn't tell me,' says I, the other day, when I see him at Miss
   </p>
   <p>
    Martin's. 'She'd be up and about this minute if she only had a mite o'
   </p>
   <p>
    resolution;' and says he, 'Aunt Polly, you're as near right as usual;'"
   </p>
   <p>
    and the old lady stopped to laugh a little. "I told him that wa'n't
   </p>
   <p>
    saying much," said she, with an evident consciousness of the underlying
   </p>
   <p>
    compliment and the doctor's good opinion. "I never knew one of that
   </p>
   <p>
    tribe that hadn't a queer streak and wasn't shif'less; but they're
   </p>
   <p>
    tougher than ellum roots;" and she gave the wheel an emphatic turn,
   </p>
   <p>
    while Mrs. Snow reached for more rolls of wool, and happened to see me.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Wherever did you come from?" said they, in great surprise. "Why, you
   </p>
   <p>
    wasn't anywhere in sight when I was out speaking to the doctor," said
   </p>
   <p>
    Mrs. Snow. "Oh, come over horseback, I suppose. Well, now, we're pleased
   </p>
   <p>
    to see ye."
   </p>
   <p>
    "No," said I, "I walked across the fields. It was too pleasant to stay
   </p>
   <p>
    in the house, and I haven't had a long walk for some time before." I
   </p>
   <p>
    begged them not to stop spinning, but they insisted that they should not
   </p>
   <p>
    have turned the wheels a half-dozen times more, even if I had not come,
   </p>
   <p>
    and they pushed them back to the wall before they came to sit down to
   </p>
   <p>
    talk with me over their knitting--for neither of them were ever known to
   </p>
   <p>
    be idle. Mrs. Snow was only there for a visit; she was a widow, and
   </p>
   <p>
    lived during most of the year with her son; and Aunt Polly was at home
   </p>
   <p>
    but seldom herself, as she was a famous nurse, and was often in demand
   </p>
   <p>
    all through that part of the country. I had known her all my days.
   </p>
   <p>
    Everybody was fond of the good soul, and she had been one of the most
   </p>
   <p>
    useful women in the world. One of my pleasantest memories is of a long
   </p>
   <p>
    but not very painful illness one winter, when she came to take care of
   </p>
   <p>
    me. There was no end either to her stories or her kindness. I was
   </p>
   <p>
    delighted to find her at home that afternoon, and Mrs. Snow also.
   </p>
   <p>
    Aunt Polly brought me some of her gingerbread, which she knew I liked,
   </p>
   <p>
    and a stout little pitcher of milk, and we sat there together for a
   </p>
   <p>
    while, gossiping and enjoying ourselves. I told all the village news
   </p>
   <p>
    that I could think of, and I was just tired enough to know it, and to be
   </p>
   <p>
    contented to sit still for a while in the comfortable three-cornered
   </p>
   <p>
    chair by the little front window. The October sunshine lay along the
   </p>
   <p>
    clean kitchen floor, and Aunt Polly darted from her chair occasionally
   </p>
   <p>
    to catch stray little wisps of wool which the breeze through the door
   </p>
   <p>
    blew along from the wheels. There was a gay string of red peppers
   </p>
   <p>
    hanging over the very high mantel-shelf, and the wood-work in the room
   </p>
   <p>
    had never been painted, and had grown dark brown with age and smoke and
   </p>
   <p>
    scouring. The clock ticked solemnly, as if it were a judge giving the
   </p>
   <p>
    laws of time, and felt itself to be the only thing that did not waste
   </p>
   <p>
    it. There was a bouquet of asparagus and some late sprigs of larkspur
   </p>
   <p>
    and white petunias on the table underneath, and a Leavitt's Almanac lay
   </p>
   <p>
    on the county paper, which was itself lying on the big Bible, of which
   </p>
   <p>
    Aunt Polly made a point of reading two chapters every day in course. I
   </p>
   <p>
    remember her saying, despairingly, one night, half to herself, "I don'
   </p>
   <p>
    know but I may skip the Chronicles next time," but I have never to this
   </p>
   <p>
    day believed that she did. They asked me at once to come into the best
   </p>
   <p>
    room, but I liked the old kitchen best. "Who was it that you were
   </p>
   <p>
    talking about as I came in?" said I. "You said you didn't believe there
   </p>
   <p>
    was much the matter with her." And Aunt Polly clicked her
   </p>
   <p>
    knitting-needles faster, and told me that it was Mary Susan Ash, over by
   </p>
   <p>
    Little Creek.
   </p>
   <p>
    "They're dreadful nervous, all them Ashes," said Mrs. Snow. "You know
   </p>
   <p>
    young Joe Adams's wife, over our way, is a sister to her, and she's
   </p>
   <p>
    forever a-doctorin'. Poor fellow! he's got a drag. I'm real sorry for
   </p>
   <p>
    Joe; but, land sakes alive! he might 'a known better. They said she had
   </p>
   <p>
    an old green bandbox with a gingham cover, that was stowed full o'
   </p>
   <p>
    vials, that she moved with the rest of her things when she was married,
   </p>
   <p>
    besides some she car'd in her hands. I guess she ain't in no more hurry
   </p>
   <p>
    to go than any of the rest of us. I've lost every mite of patience with
   </p>
   <p>
    her. I was over there last week one day, and she'd had a call from the
   </p>
   <p>
    new supply--you know Adams's folks is Methodists--and he was took in by
   </p>
   <p>
    her. She made out she'd got the consumption, and she told how many
   </p>
   <p>
    complaints she had, and what a sight o' medicine she took, and she
   </p>
   <p>
    groaned and sighed, and her voice was so weak you couldn't more than
   </p>
   <p>
    just hear it. I stepped right into the bedroom after he'd been prayin'
   </p>
   <p>
    with her, and was taking leave. You'd thought, by what he said, she was
   </p>
   <p>
    going right off then. She was coughing dreadful hard, and I knew she
   </p>
   <p>
    hadn't no more cough than I had. So says I, 'What's the matter, Adaline?
   </p>
   <p>
    I'll get ye a drink of water. Something in your throat, I s'pose. I hope
   </p>
   <p>
    you won't go and get cold, and have a cough.' She looked as if she could
   </p>
   <p>
    'a bit me, but I was just as pleasant 's could be. Land! to see her
   </p>
   <p>
    laying there, I suppose the poor young fellow thought she was all gone.
   </p>
   <p>
    He meant well. I wish he had seen her eating apple-dumplings for dinner.
   </p>
   <p>
    She felt better 'long in the first o' the afternoon before he come. I
   </p>
   <p>
    says to her, right before him, that I guessed them dumplings did her
   </p>
   <p>
    good, but she never made no answer. She will have these dyin' spells. I
   </p>
   <p>
    don't know's she can help it, but she needn't act as if it was a credit
   </p>
   <p>
    to anybody to be sick and laid up. Poor Joe, he come over for me last
   </p>
   <p>
    week another day, and said she'd been havin' spasms, and asked me if
   </p>
   <p>
    there wa'n't something I could think of. 'Yes,' says I; 'you just take a
   </p>
   <p>
    pail o' stone-cold water, and throw it square into her face; that'll
   </p>
   <p>
    bring her out of it;' and he looked at me a minute, and then he burst
   </p>
   <p>
    out a-laughing--he couldn't help it. He's too good to her; that's the
   </p>
   <p>
    trouble."
   </p>
   <p>
    "You never said that to her about the dumplings?" said Aunt Polly,
   </p>
   <p>
    admiringly. "Well, I shouldn't ha' dared;" and she rocked and knitted
   </p>
   <p>
    away faster than ever, while we all laughed. "Now with Mary Susan it's
   </p>
   <p>
    different. I suppose she does have the neurology, and she's a poor
   </p>
   <p>
    broken-down creature. I do feel for her more than I do for Adaline. She
   </p>
   <p>
    was always a willing girl, and she worked herself to death, and she
   </p>
   <p>
    can't help these notions, nor being an Ash neither."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I'm the last one to be hard on anybody that's sick, and in trouble,"
   </p>
   <p>
    said Mrs. Snow.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Bless you, she set up with Ad'line herself three nights in one week, to
   </p>
   <p>
    my knowledge. It's more'n I would do," said Aunt Polly, as if there were
   </p>
   <p>
    danger that I should think Mrs. Snow's kind heart to be made of flint.
   </p>
   <p>
    "It ain't what I call watching," said she, apologetically. "We both doze
   </p>
   <p>
    off, and then when the folks come in in the morning she'll tell what a
   </p>
   <p>
    sufferin' night she's had. She likes to have it said she has to have
   </p>
   <p>
    watchers."
   </p>
   <p>
    "It's strange what a queer streak there is running through the whole of
   </p>
   <p>
    'em," said Aunt Polly, presently. "It always was so, far back's you can
   </p>
   <p>
    follow 'em. Did you ever hear about that great-uncle of theirs that
   </p>
   <p>
    lived over to the other side o' Denby, over to what they call the Denby
   </p>
   <p>
    Meadows? We had a cousin o' my father's that kept house for him (he was
   </p>
   <p>
    a single man), and I spent most of a summer and fall with her once when
   </p>
   <p>
    I was growing up. She seemed to want company: it was a lonesome sort of
   </p>
   <p>
    a place."
   </p>
   <p>
    "There! I don't know when I have thought to' that," said Mrs. Snow,
   </p>
   <p>
    looking much amused. "What stories you did use to tell, after you come
   </p>
   <p>
    home, about the way he used to act! Dear sakes! she used to keep us
   </p>
   <p>
    laughing till we was tired. Do tell her about him, Polly; she'll like to
   </p>
   <p>
    hear."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Well, I've forgot a good deal about it: you see it was much as fifty
   </p>
   <p>
    years ago. I wasn't more than seventeen or eighteen years old. He was a
   </p>
   <p>
    very respectable man, old Mr. Dan'el Gunn was, and a cap'n in the
   </p>
   <p>
    militia in his day. Cap'n Gunn, they always called him. He was well off,
   </p>
   <p>
    but he got sun-struck, and never was just right in his mind afterward.
   </p>
   <p>
    When he was getting over his sickness after the stroke he was very
   </p>
   <p>
    wandering, and at last he seemed to get it into his head that he was his
   </p>
   <p>
    own sister Patience that died some five or six years before: she was
   </p>
   <p>
    single too, and she always lived with him. They said when he got so's to
   </p>
   <p>
    sit up in his arm-chair of an afternoon, when he was getting better, he
   </p>
   <p>
    fought 'em dreadfully because they fetched him his own clothes to put
   </p>
   <p>
    on; he said they was brother Dan'el's clothes. So, sure enough, they
   </p>
   <p>
    got out an old double gown, and let him put it on, and he was as
   </p>
   <p>
    peaceable as could be. The doctor told 'em to humor him, but they
   </p>
   <p>
    thought it was a fancy he took, and he would forget it; but the next day
   </p>
   <p>
    he made 'em get the double gown again, and a cap too, and there he used
   </p>
   <p>
    to set up alongside of his bed as prim as a dish. When he got round
   </p>
   <p>
    again so he could set up all day, they thought he wanted the dress; but
   </p>
   <p>
    no; he seemed to be himself, and had on his own clothes just as usual in
   </p>
   <p>
    the morning; but when he took his nap after dinner and waked up again,
   </p>
   <p>
    he was in a dreadful frame o' mind, and had the trousers and coat off in
   </p>
   <p>
    no time, and said he was Patience. He used to fuss with some
   </p>
   <p>
    knitting-work he got hold of somehow; he was good-natured as could be,
   </p>
   <p>
    and sometimes he would make 'em fetch him the cat, because Patience used
   </p>
   <p>
    to have a cat that set in her lap while she knit. I wasn't there then,
   </p>
   <p>
    you know, but they used to tell me about it. Folks used to call him Miss
   </p>
   <p>
    Dan'el Gunn.
   </p>
   <p>
    "He'd been that way some time when I went over. I'd heard about his
   </p>
   <p>
    notions, and I was scared of him at first, but I found out there wasn't
   </p>
   <p>
    no need. Don't you know I was sort o' 'fraid to go, 'Lizabeth, when
   </p>
   <p>
    Cousin Statiry sent for me after she went home from that visit she made
   </p>
   <p>
    here? She'd told us about him, but sometimes, 'long at the first of it,
   </p>
   <p>
    he used to be cross. He never was after I went there. He was a clever,
   </p>
   <p>
    kind-hearted man, if ever there was one," said Aunt Polly, with
   </p>
   <p>
    decision. "He used to go down to the corner to the store sometimes in
   </p>
   <p>
    the morning, and he would see to business. And before he got feeble
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes he would work out on the farm all the morning, stiddy as any
   </p>
   <p>
    of the men; but after he come in to dinner he would take off his coat,
   </p>
   <p>
    if he had it on, and fall asleep in his arm-chair, or on a l'unge there
   </p>
   <p>
    was in his bedroom, and when he waked up he would be sort of bewildered
   </p>
   <p>
    for a while, and then he'd step round quick's he could, and get his
   </p>
   <p>
    dress out o' the clothes-press, and the cap, and put 'em on right over
   </p>
   <p>
    the rest of his clothes. He was always small-featured and smooth-shaved,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I don' know as, to come in sudden, you would have thought he was a
   </p>
   <p>
    man, except his hair stood up short and straight all on the top of his
   </p>
   <p>
    head, as men-folks had a fashion o' combing their hair then, and I must
   </p>
   <p>
    say he did make a dreadful ordinary-looking woman. The neighbors got
   </p>
   <p>
    used to his ways, and, land! I never thought nothing of it after the
   </p>
   <p>
    first week or two.
   </p>
   <p>
    "His sister's clothes that he wore first was too small for him, and so
   </p>
   <p>
    my cousin Statiry, that kep' his house, she made him a linsey-woolsey
   </p>
   <p>
    dress with a considerable short skirt, and he was dreadful pleased with
   </p>
   <p>
    it, she said, because the other one never would button over good, and
   </p>
   <p>
    showed his wais'coat, and she and I used to make him caps; he used to
   </p>
   <p>
    wear the kind all the old women did then, with a big crown, and close
   </p>
   <p>
    round the face. I've got some laid away up-stairs now that was my
   </p>
   <p>
    mother's--she wore caps very young, mother did. His nephew that lived
   </p>
   <p>
    with him carried on the farm, and managed the business, but he always
   </p>
   <p>
    treated the cap'n as if he was head of everything there. Everybody
   </p>
   <p>
    pitied the cap'n; folks respected him; but you couldn't help laughing,
   </p>
   <p>
    to save ye. We used to try to keep him in, afternoons, but we couldn't
   </p>
   <p>
    always."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Tell her about that day he went to meeting," said Mrs. Snow.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Why, one of us always used to stay to home with him; we took turns; and
   </p>
   <p>
    somehow or 'nother he never offered to go, though by spells he would be
   </p>
   <p>
    constant to meeting in the morning. Why, bless you, you never'd think
   </p>
   <p>
    anything ailed him a good deal of the time, if you saw him before noon,
   </p>
   <p>
    though sometimes he would be freaky, and hide himself in the barn, or go
   </p>
   <p>
    over in the woods, but we always kept an eye on him. But this Sunday
   </p>
   <p>
    there was going to be a great occasion. Old Parson Croden was going to
   </p>
   <p>
    preach; he was thought more of than anybody in this region: you've heard
   </p>
   <p>
    tell of him a good many times, I s'pose. He was getting to be old, and
   </p>
   <p>
    didn't preach much. He had a colleague, they set so much by him in his
   </p>
   <p>
    parish, and I didn't know's I'd ever get another chance to hear him, so
   </p>
   <p>
    I didn't want to stay to home, and neither did Cousin Statiry; and Jacob
   </p>
   <p>
    Gunn, old Mr. Gunn's nephew, he said it might be the last time ever he'd
   </p>
   <p>
    hear Parson Croden, and he set in the seats anyway; so we talked it all
   </p>
   <p>
    over, and we got a young boy to come and set 'long of the cap'n till we
   </p>
   <p>
    got back. He hadn't offered to go anywhere of an afternoon for a long
   </p>
   <p>
    time. I s'pose he thought women ought to be stayers at home according
   </p>
   <p>
    to Scripture.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Parson Ridley--his wife was a niece to old Dr. Croden--and the old
   </p>
   <p>
    doctor they was up in the pulpit, and the choir was singing the first
   </p>
   <p>
    hymn--it was a fuguing tune, and they was doing their best: seems to me
   </p>
   <p>
    it was 'Canterbury New.' Yes, it was; I remember I thought how splendid
   </p>
   <p>
    it sounded, and Jacob Gunn he was a-leading off; and I happened to look
   </p>
   <p>
    down the aisle, and who should I see but the poor old cap'n in his cap
   </p>
   <p>
    and gown parading right into meeting before all the folks! There! I
   </p>
   <p>
    wanted to go through the floor. Everybody 'most had seen him at home,
   </p>
   <p>
    but, my goodness! to have him come into meeting!"
   </p>
   <p>
    "What did you do?" said I.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Why, nothing," said Miss Polly; "there was nothing to do. I thought I
   </p>
   <p>
    should faint away; but I called Cousin Statiry's 'tention, and she
   </p>
   <p>
    looked dreadful put to it for a minute; and then says she, 'Open the
   </p>
   <p>
    door for him; I guess he won't make no trouble,' and, poor soul, he
   </p>
   <p>
    didn't. But to see him come up the aisle! He'd fixed himself nice as he
   </p>
   <p>
    could, poor creatur; he'd raked out Miss Patience's old Navarino bonnet
   </p>
   <p>
    with green ribbons and a willow feather, and set it on right over his
   </p>
   <p>
    cap, and he had her bead bag on his arm, and her turkey-tail fan that
   </p>
   <p>
    he'd got out of the best room; and he come with little short steps up to
   </p>
   <p>
    the pew: and I s'posed he'd set by the door; but no, he made to go by
   </p>
   <p>
    us, up into the corner where she used to set, and took her place, and
   </p>
   <p>
    spread his dress out nice, and got his handkerchief out o' his bag,
   </p>
   <p>
    just's he'd seen her do. He took off his bonnet all of a sudden, as if
   </p>
   <p>
    he'd forgot it, and put it under the seat, like he did his hat--that was
   </p>
   <p>
    the only thing he did that any woman wouldn't have done--and the crown
   </p>
   <p>
    of his cap was bent some. I thought die I should. The pew was one of
   </p>
   <p>
    them up aside the pulpit, a square one, you know, right at the end of
   </p>
   <p>
    the right-hand aisle, so I could see the length of it and out of the
   </p>
   <p>
    door, and there stood that poor boy we'd left to keep the cap'n company,
   </p>
   <p>
    looking as pale as ashes. We found he'd tried every way to keep the old
   </p>
   <p>
    gentleman at home, but he said he got f'erce as could be, so he didn't
   </p>
   <p>
    dare to say no more, and Cap'n Gunn drove him back twice to the house,
   </p>
   <p>
    and that's why he got in so late. I didn't know but it was the boy that
   </p>
   <p>
    had set him on to go to meeting when I see him walk in, and I could 'a
   </p>
   <p>
    wrung his neck; but I guess I misjudged him; he was called a stiddy boy.
   </p>
   <p>
    He married a daughter of Ichabod Pinkham's over to Oak Plains, and I saw
   </p>
   <p>
    a son of his when I was taking care of Miss West last spring through
   </p>
   <p>
    that lung fever--looked like his father. I wish I'd thought to tell him
   </p>
   <p>
    about that Sunday. I heard he was waiting on that pretty Becket girl,
   </p>
   <p>
    the orphan one that lives with Nathan Becket. Her father and mother was
   </p>
   <p>
    both lost at sea, but she's got property."
   </p>
   <p>
    "What did they say in church when the captain came in, Aunt Polly?" said
   </p>
   <p>
    I.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Well, a good many of them laughed--they couldn't help it, to save them;
   </p>
   <p>
    but the cap'n he was some hard o' hearin', so he never noticed it, and
   </p>
   <p>
    he set there in the corner and fanned him, as pleased and satisfied as
   </p>
   <p>
    could be. The singers they had the worst time, but they had just come to
   </p>
   <p>
    the end of a verse, and they played on the instruments a good while in
   </p>
   <p>
    between, but I could see 'em shake, and I s'pose the tune did stray a
   </p>
   <p>
    little, though they went through it well. And after the first fun of it
   </p>
   <p>
    was over, most of the folks felt bad. You see, the cap'n had been very
   </p>
   <p>
    much looked up to, and it was his misfortune, and he set there quiet,
   </p>
   <p>
    listening to the preaching. I see some tears in some o' the old folks'
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes: they hated to see him so broke in his mind, you know. There was
   </p>
   <p>
    more than usual of 'em out that day; they knew how bad he'd feel if he
   </p>
   <p>
    realized it. A good Christian man he was, and dreadful precise, I've
   </p>
   <p>
    heard 'em say."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Did he ever go again?" said I.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I seem to forget," said Aunt Polly. "I dare say. I wasn't there but
   </p>
   <p>
    from the last of June into November, and when I went over again it
   </p>
   <p>
    wasn't for three years, and the cap'n had been dead some time. His mind
   </p>
   <p>
    failed him more and more along at the last. But I'll tell you what he
   </p>
   <p>
    did do, and it was the week after that very Sunday, too. He heard it
   </p>
   <p>
    given out from the pulpit that the Female Missionary Society would meet
   </p>
   <p>
    with Mis' William Sands the Thursday night o' that week--the sewing
   </p>
   <p>
    society, you know; and he looked round to us real knowing; and Cousin
   </p>
   <p>
    Statiry, says she to me, under her bonnet, 'You don't s'pose he'll want
   </p>
   <p>
    to go?' and I like to have laughed right out. But sure enough he did,
   </p>
   <p>
    and what do you suppose but he made us fix over a handsome black watered
   </p>
   <p>
    silk for him to wear, that had been his sister's best dress. He said
   </p>
   <p>
    he'd outgrown it dreadful quick. Cousin Statiry she wished to heaven
   </p>
   <p>
    she'd thought to put it away, for Jacob had given it to her, and she was
   </p>
   <p>
    meaning to make it over for herself; but it didn't do to cross the cap'n
   </p>
   <p>
    and Jacob Gunn gave Statiry another one--the best he could get, but it
   </p>
   <p>
    wasn't near so good a piece, she thought. He set everything by Statiry,
   </p>
   <p>
    and so did the cap'n, and well they might.
   </p>
   <p>
    "We hoped he'd forget all about it the next day; but he didn't; and I
   </p>
   <p>
    always thought well of those ladies, they treated him so handsome, and
   </p>
   <p>
    tried to make him enjoy himself. He did eat a great supper; they kep'
   </p>
   <p>
    a-piling up his plate with everything. I couldn't help wondering if some
   </p>
   <p>
    of 'em would have put themselves out much if it had been some poor
   </p>
   <p>
    flighty old woman. The cap'n he was as polite as could be, and when
   </p>
   <p>
    Jacob come to walk home with him he kissed 'em all round and asked 'em
   </p>
   <p>
    to meet at his house. But the greatest was--land! I don't know when I've
   </p>
   <p>
    thought so much about those times--one afternoon he was setting at home
   </p>
   <p>
    in the keeping-room, and Statiry was there, and Deacon Abel Pinkham
   </p>
   <p>
    stopped in to see Jacob Gunn about building some fence, and he found
   </p>
   <p>
    he'd gone to mill, so he waited a while, talking friendly, as they
   </p>
   <p>
    expected Jacob might be home; and the cap'n was as pleased as could be,
   </p>
   <p>
    and he urged the deacon to stop to tea. And when he went away, says he
   </p>
   <p>
    to Statiry, in a dreadful knowing way, 'Which of us do you consider the
   </p>
   <p>
    deacon come to see?' You see, the deacon was a widower. Bless you! when
   </p>
   <p>
    I first come home I used to set everybody laughing, but I forget most of
   </p>
   <p>
    the things now. There was one day, though"--
   </p>
   <p>
    "Here comes your father," said Mrs. Snow. "Now we mustn't let him go by
   </p>
   <p>
    or you'll have to walk 'way home." And Aunt Polly hurried out to speak
   </p>
   <p>
    to him, while I took my great bunch of golden-rod, which already drooped
   </p>
   <p>
    a little, and followed her, with Mrs. Snow, who confided to me that the
   </p>
   <p>
    captain's nephew Jacob had offered to Polly that summer she was over
   </p>
   <p>
    there, and she never could see why she didn't have him: only love goes
   </p>
   <p>
    where it is sent, and Polly wasn't one to marry for what she could get
   </p>
   <p>
    if she didn't like the man. There was plenty that would have said yes,
   </p>
   <p>
    and thank you too, sir, to Jacob Gunn.
   </p>
   <p>
    That was a pleasant afternoon. I reached home when it was growing dark
   </p>
   <p>
    and chilly, and the early autumn sunset had almost faded in the west. It
   </p>
   <p>
    was a much longer way home around by the road than by the way I had come
   </p>
   <p>
    across the fields.
   </p>
   <p>
    From a Mournful Villager
   </p>
   <p>
    Lately I have been thinking, with much sorrow, of the approaching
   </p>
   <p>
    extinction of front yards, and of the type of New England village
   </p>
   <p>
    character and civilization with which they are associated. Formerly,
   </p>
   <p>
    because I lived in an old-fashioned New England village, it would have
   </p>
   <p>
    been hard for me to imagine that there were parts of the country where
   </p>
   <p>
    the Front yard, as I knew it, was not in fashion, and that Grounds
   </p>
   <p>
    (however small) had taken its place. No matter how large a piece of land
   </p>
   <p>
    lay in front of a house in old times, it was still a front yard, in
   </p>
   <p>
    spite of noble dimension and the skill of practiced gardeners.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are still a good many examples of the old manner of out-of-door
   </p>
   <p>
    life and customs, as well as a good deal of the old-fashioned provincial
   </p>
   <p>
    society, left in the eastern parts of the New England States; but put
   </p>
   <p>
    side by side with the society that is American rather than provincial,
   </p>
   <p>
    one discovers it to be in a small minority. The representative United
   </p>
   <p>
    States citizen will be, or already is, a Westerner, and his instincts
   </p>
   <p>
    and ways of looking at things have certain characteristics of their own
   </p>
   <p>
    which are steadily growing more noticeable.
   </p>
   <p>
    For many years New England was simply a bit of Old England transplanted.
   </p>
   <p>
    We all can remember elderly people whose ideas were wholly under the
   </p>
   <p>
    influence of their English ancestry. It is hardly more than a hundred
   </p>
   <p>
    years since we were English colonies, and not independent United States,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the customs and ideas of the mother country were followed from force
   </p>
   <p>
    of habit. Now one begins to see a difference; the old traditions have
   </p>
   <p>
    had time to almost die out even in the most conservative and least
   </p>
   <p>
    changed towns, and a new element has come in. The true characteristics
   </p>
   <p>
    of American society, as I have said, are showing themselves more and
   </p>
   <p>
    more distinctly to the westward of New England, and come back to it in a
   </p>
   <p>
    tide that steadily sweeps away the old traditions. It rises over the
   </p>
   <p>
    heads of the prim and stately idols before which our grandfathers and
   </p>
   <p>
    grandmothers bowed down and worshiped, and which we ourselves were at
   </p>
   <p>
    least taught to walk softly by as they toppled on their thrones.
   </p>
   <p>
    One cannot help wondering what a lady of the old school will be like a
   </p>
   <p>
    hundred years from now! But at any rate she will not be in heart and
   </p>
   <p>
    thought and fashion of good breeding as truly an Englishwoman as if she
   </p>
   <p>
    had never stepped out of Great Britain. If one of our own elderly ladies
   </p>
   <p>
    were suddenly dropped into the midst of provincial English society, she
   </p>
   <p>
    would be quite at home; but west of her own Hudson River she is lucky if
   </p>
   <p>
    she does not find herself behind the times, and almost a stranger and a
   </p>
   <p>
    foreigner.
   </p>
   <p>
    And yet from the first there was a little difference, and the colonies
   </p>
   <p>
    were New England and not Old. In some ways more radical, yet in some
   </p>
   <p>
    ways more conservative, than the people across the water, they showed a
   </p>
   <p>
    new sort of flower when they came into bloom in this new climate and
   </p>
   <p>
    soil. In the old days there had not been time for the family ties to be
   </p>
   <p>
    broken and forgotten. Instead of the unknown English men and women who
   </p>
   <p>
    are our sixth and seventh cousins now, they had first and second cousins
   </p>
   <p>
    then; but there was little communication between one country and the
   </p>
   <p>
    other, and the mutual interest in every-day affairs had to fade out
   </p>
   <p>
    quickly. A traveler was a curiosity, and here, even between the villages
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves, there was far less intercourse than we can believe possible.
   </p>
   <p>
    People stayed on their own ground; their horizons were of small
   </p>
   <p>
    circumference, and their whole interest and thought were spent upon
   </p>
   <p>
    their own land, their own neighbors, their own affairs, while they not
   </p>
   <p>
    only were contented with this state of things but encouraged it. One has
   </p>
   <p>
    only to look at the high-walled pews of the old churches, at the high
   </p>
   <p>
    fences of the town gardens, and at even the strong fortifications around
   </p>
   <p>
    some family lots in the burying-grounds, to be sure of this. The
   </p>
   <p>
    interviewer was not besought and encouraged in those days,--he was
   </p>
   <p>
    defied. In that quarter, at least, they had the advantage of us. Their
   </p>
   <p>
    interest was as real and heartfelt in each other's affairs as ours, let
   </p>
   <p>
    us hope; but they never allowed idle curiosity to show itself in the
   </p>
   <p>
    world's market-place, shameless and unblushing.
   </p>
   <p>
    There is so much to be said in favor of our own day, and the men and
   </p>
   <p>
    women of our own time, that a plea for a recognition of the quaintness
   </p>
   <p>
    and pleasantness of village life in the old days cannot seem unwelcome,
   </p>
   <p>
    or without deference to all that has come with the later years of ease
   </p>
   <p>
    and comfort, or of discovery in the realms of mind or matter. We are
   </p>
   <p>
    beginning to cling to the elderly people who are so different from
   </p>
   <p>
    ourselves, and for this reason: we are paying them instinctively the
   </p>
   <p>
    honor that is due from us to our elders and betters; they have that
   </p>
   <p>
    grand prestige and dignity that only comes with age; they are like old
   </p>
   <p>
    wines, perhaps no better than many others when they were young, but now
   </p>
   <p>
    after many years they have come to be worth nobody knows how many
   </p>
   <p>
    dollars a dozen, and the connoisseurs make treasures of the few bottles
   </p>
   <p>
    of that vintage which are left.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was a restricted and narrowly limited life in the old days. Religion,
   </p>
   <p>
    or rather sectarianism, was apt to be simply a matter of inheritance,
   </p>
   <p>
    and there was far more bigotry in every cause and question,--a fiercer
   </p>
   <p>
    partisanship; and because there were fewer channels of activity, and
   </p>
   <p>
    those undivided into specialties, there was a whole-souled concentration
   </p>
   <p>
    of energy that was as efficient as it was sometimes narrow and
   </p>
   <p>
    short-sighted. People were more contented in the sphere of life to which
   </p>
   <p>
    it had pleased God to call them, and they do not seem to have been so
   </p>
   <p>
    often sorely tempted by the devil with a sight of the kingdoms of the
   </p>
   <p>
    world and the glory of them. We are more likely to busy ourselves with
   </p>
   <p>
    finding things to do than in doing with our might the work that is in
   </p>
   <p>
    our hands already. The disappearance of many of the village front yards
   </p>
   <p>
    may come to be typical of the altered position of woman, and mark a
   </p>
   <p>
    stronghold on her way from the much talked-of slavery and subjection to
   </p>
   <p>
    a coveted equality. She used to be shut off from the wide acres of the
   </p>
   <p>
    farm, and had no voice in the world's politics; she must stay in the
   </p>
   <p>
    house, or only hold sway out of doors in this prim corner of land where
   </p>
   <p>
    she was queen. No wonder that women clung to their rights in their
   </p>
   <p>
    flower-gardens then, and no wonder that they have grown a little
   </p>
   <p>
    careless of them now, and that lawn mowers find so ready a sale. The
   </p>
   <p>
    whole world is their front yard nowadays!
   </p>
   <p>
    *       *       *       *       *
   </p>
   <p>
    There might be written a history of front yards in New England which
   </p>
   <p>
    would be very interesting to read. It would end in a treatise upon
   </p>
   <p>
    landscape gardening and its possibilities, and wild flights of
   </p>
   <p>
    imagination about the culture of plants under glass, the application of
   </p>
   <p>
    artificial heat in forcing, and the curious mingling and development of
   </p>
   <p>
    plant life, but it would begin in the simple time of the early
   </p>
   <p>
    colonists. It must have been hard when, after being familiar with the
   </p>
   <p>
    gardens and parks of England and Holland, they found themselves
   </p>
   <p>
    restricted to front yards by way of pleasure grounds. Perhaps they
   </p>
   <p>
    thought such things were wrong, and that having a pleasant place to walk
   </p>
   <p>
    about in out of doors would encourage idle and lawless ways in the
   </p>
   <p>
    young; at any rate, for several years it was more necessary to raise
   </p>
   <p>
    corn and potatoes to keep themselves from starving than to lay out
   </p>
   <p>
    alleys and plant flowers and box borders among the rocks and stumps.
   </p>
   <p>
    There is a great pathos in the fact that in so stern and hard a life
   </p>
   <p>
    there was time or place for any gardens at all. I can picture to myself
   </p>
   <p>
    the little slips and cuttings that had been brought over in the ship,
   </p>
   <p>
    and more carefully guarded than any of the household goods; I can see
   </p>
   <p>
    the women look at them tearfully when they came into bloom, because
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing else could be a better reminder of their old home. What fears
   </p>
   <p>
    there must have been lest the first winter's cold might kill them, and
   </p>
   <p>
    with what love and care they must have been tended! I know a rose-bush,
   </p>
   <p>
    and a little while ago I knew an apple-tree, that were brought over by
   </p>
   <p>
    the first settlers; the rose still blooms, and until it was cut down the
   </p>
   <p>
    old tree bore apples. It is strange to think that civilized New England
   </p>
   <p>
    is no older than the little red roses that bloom in June on that slope
   </p>
   <p>
    above the river in Kittery. Those earliest gardens were very pathetic in
   </p>
   <p>
    the contrast of their extent and their power of suggestion and
   </p>
   <p>
    association. Every seed that came up was thanked for its kindness, and
   </p>
   <p>
    every flower that bloomed was the child of a beloved ancestry.
   </p>
   <p>
    It would be interesting to watch the growth of the gardens as life
   </p>
   <p>
    became easier and more comfortable in the colonies. As the settlements
   </p>
   <p>
    grew into villages and towns, and the Indians were less dreadful, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the houses were better and more home-like, the busy people began to find
   </p>
   <p>
    a little time now and then when they could enjoy themselves soberly.
   </p>
   <p>
    Beside the fruits of the earth they could have some flowers and a sprig
   </p>
   <p>
    of sage and southernwood and tansy, or lavender that had come from
   </p>
   <p>
    Surrey and could be dried to be put among the linen as it used to be
   </p>
   <p>
    strewn through the chests and cupboards in the old country.
   </p>
   <p>
    I like to think of the changes as they came slowly; that after a while
   </p>
   <p>
    tender plants could be kept through the winter, because the houses were
   </p>
   <p>
    better built and warmer, and were no longer rough shelters which were
   </p>
   <p>
    only meant to serve until there could be something better. Perhaps the
   </p>
   <p>
    parlor, or best room, and a special separate garden for the flowers were
   </p>
   <p>
    two luxuries of the same date, and they made a noticeable change in the
   </p>
   <p>
    manner of living,--the best room being a formal recognition of the
   </p>
   <p>
    claims of society, and the front yard an appeal for the existence of
   </p>
   <p>
    something that gave pleasure,--beside the merely useful and wholly
   </p>
   <p>
    necessary things of life. When it was thought worth while to put a fence
   </p>
   <p>
    around the flower-garden the respectability of art itself was
   </p>
   <p>
    established and made secure. Whether the house was a fine one, and its
   </p>
   <p>
    inclosure spacious, or whether it was a small house with only a narrow
   </p>
   <p>
    bit of ground in front, this yard was kept with care, and it was
   </p>
   <p>
    different from the rest of the land altogether. The children were not
   </p>
   <p>
    often allowed to play there, and the family did not use the front door
   </p>
   <p>
    except upon occasions of more or less ceremony. I think that many of the
   </p>
   <p>
    old front yards could tell stories of the lovers who found it hard to
   </p>
   <p>
    part under the stars, and lingered over the gate; and who does not
   </p>
   <p>
    remember the solemn group of men who gather there at funerals, and stand
   </p>
   <p>
    with their heads uncovered as the mourners go out and come in, two by
   </p>
   <p>
    two. I have always felt rich in the possession of an ancient York
   </p>
   <p>
    tradition of an old fellow who demanded, as he lay dying, that the grass
   </p>
   <p>
    in his front yard should be cut at once; it was no use to have it
   </p>
   <p>
    trodden down and spoilt by the folks at the funeral. I always hoped it
   </p>
   <p>
    was good hay weather; but he must have been certain of that when he
   </p>
   <p>
    spoke. Let us hope he did not confuse this world with the next, being so
   </p>
   <p>
    close upon the borders of it! It was not man-like to think of the front
   </p>
   <p>
    yard, since it was the special domain of the women,--the men of the
   </p>
   <p>
    family respected but ignored it,--they had to be teased in the spring
   </p>
   <p>
    to dig the flower beds, but it was the busiest time of the year; one
   </p>
   <p>
    should remember that.
   </p>
   <p>
    I think many people are sorry, without knowing why, to see the fences
   </p>
   <p>
    pulled down; and the disappearance of plain white palings causes almost
   </p>
   <p>
    as deep regret as that of the handsome ornamental fences and their high
   </p>
   <p>
    posts with urns or great white balls on top. A stone coping does not
   </p>
   <p>
    make up for the loss of them; it always looks a good deal like a lot in
   </p>
   <p>
    a cemetery, for one thing; and then in a small town the grass is not
   </p>
   <p>
    smooth, and looks uneven where the flower-beds were not properly
   </p>
   <p>
    smoothed down. The stray cows trample about where they never went
   </p>
   <p>
    before; the bushes and little trees that were once protected grow ragged
   </p>
   <p>
    and scraggly and out at elbows, and a few forlorn flowers come up of
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves, and try hard to grow and to bloom. The ungainly red tubs
   </p>
   <p>
    that are perched on little posts have plants in them, but the poor
   </p>
   <p>
    posies look as if they would rather be in the ground, and as if they are
   </p>
   <p>
    held too near the fire of the sun. If everything must be neglected and
   </p>
   <p>
    forlorn so much the more reason there should be a fence, if but to hide
   </p>
   <p>
    it. Americans are too fond of being stared at; they apparently feel as
   </p>
   <p>
    if it were one's duty to one's neighbor. Even if there is nothing really
   </p>
   <p>
    worth looking at about a house, it is still exposed to the gaze of the
   </p>
   <p>
    passers-by. Foreigners are far more sensible than we, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    out-of-door home life among them is something we might well try to copy.
   </p>
   <p>
    They often have their meals served out of doors, and one can enjoy an
   </p>
   <p>
    afternoon nap in a hammock, or can take one's work out into the shady
   </p>
   <p>
    garden with great satisfaction, unwatched; and even a little piece of
   </p>
   <p>
    ground can be made, if shut in and kept for the use and pleasure of the
   </p>
   <p>
    family alone, a most charming unroofed and trellised summer ante-room to
   </p>
   <p>
    the house. In a large, crowded town it would be selfish to conceal the
   </p>
   <p>
    rare bits of garden, where the sight of anything green is a godsend; but
   </p>
   <p>
    where there is the whole wide country of fields and woods within easy
   </p>
   <p>
    reach I think there should be high walls around our gardens, and that we
   </p>
   <p>
    lose a great deal in not making them entirely separate from the highway;
   </p>
   <p>
    as much as we should lose in making the walls of our parlors and
   </p>
   <p>
    dining-rooms of glass, and building the house as close to the street as
   </p>
   <p>
    possible.
   </p>
   <p>
    But to go back to the little front yards: we are sorry to miss them and
   </p>
   <p>
    their tangle or orderliness of roses and larkspur and honeysuckle,
   </p>
   <p>
    Canterbury bells and London pride, lilacs and peonies. These may all
   </p>
   <p>
    bloom better than ever in the new beds that are cut in the turf; but
   </p>
   <p>
    with the side fences that used to come from the corners of the house to
   </p>
   <p>
    the front fence, other barriers, as I have said here over and over, have
   </p>
   <p>
    been taken away, and the old-fashioned village life is becoming extinct.
   </p>
   <p>
    People do not know what they lose when they make way with the reserve,
   </p>
   <p>
    the separateness, the sanctity of the front yard of their grandmothers.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is like writing down the family secrets for any one to read; it is
   </p>
   <p>
    like having everybody call you by your first name and sitting in any pew
   </p>
   <p>
    in church, and like having your house in the middle of a road, to take
   </p>
   <p>
    away the fence which, slight as it may be, is a fortification round your
   </p>
   <p>
    home. More things than one may come in without being asked. We Americans
   </p>
   <p>
    had better build more fences than take any away from our lives. There
   </p>
   <p>
    should be gates for charity to go out and in, and kindness and sympathy
   </p>
   <p>
    too, but his life and his house are together each man's stronghold and
   </p>
   <p>
    castle, to be kept and defended.
   </p>
   <p>
    I was much amused once at thinking that the fine old solid paneled doors
   </p>
   <p>
    were being unhinged faster than ever nowadays, since so many front gates
   </p>
   <p>
    have disappeared, and the click of the latch can no longer give notice
   </p>
   <p>
    of the approach of a guest. Now the knocker sounds or the bell rings
   </p>
   <p>
    without note or warning, and the village housekeeper cannot see who is
   </p>
   <p>
    coming in until they have already reached the door. Once the guests
   </p>
   <p>
    could be seen on their way up the walk. It must be a satisfaction to
   </p>
   <p>
    look through the clear spots of the figured ground-glass in the new
   </p>
   <p>
    doors, and I believe if there is a covering inside few doors will be
   </p>
   <p>
    found unprovided with a peephole. It was better to hear the gate open
   </p>
   <p>
    and shut, and if it caught and dragged as front gates are very apt to do
   </p>
   <p>
    you could have time always for a good look out of the window at the
   </p>
   <p>
    approaching friend.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are few of us who cannot remember a front-yard garden which seemed
   </p>
   <p>
    to us a very paradise in childhood. It was like a miracle when the
   </p>
   <p>
    yellow and white daffies came into bloom in the spring, and there was a
   </p>
   <p>
    time when tiger-lilies and the taller rose-bushes were taller than we
   </p>
   <p>
    were, and we could not look over their heads as we do now. There were
   </p>
   <p>
    always a good many lady's-delights that grew under the bushes, and came
   </p>
   <p>
    up anywhere in the chinks of the walk of the door-step, and there was a
   </p>
   <p>
    little green sprig called ambrosia that was a famous stray-away. Outside
   </p>
   <p>
    the fence one was not unlikely to see a company of French pinks, which
   </p>
   <p>
    were forbidden standing-room inside as if they were tiresome poor
   </p>
   <p>
    relations of the other flowers. I always felt a sympathy for French
   </p>
   <p>
    pinks,--they have a fresh, sweet look, as if they resigned themselves to
   </p>
   <p>
    their lot in life and made the best of it, and remembered that they had
   </p>
   <p>
    the sunshine and rain, and could see what was going on in the world, if
   </p>
   <p>
    they were outlaws.
   </p>
   <p>
    I like to remember being sent on errands, and being asked to wait while
   </p>
   <p>
    the mistress of the house picked some flowers to send back to my mother.
   </p>
   <p>
    They were almost always prim, flat bouquets in those days; the larger
   </p>
   <p>
    flowers were picked first and stood at the back and looked over the
   </p>
   <p>
    heads of those that were shorter of stem and stature, and the givers
   </p>
   <p>
    always sent a message that they had not stopped to arrange them. I
   </p>
   <p>
    remember that I had even then a great dislike to lemon verbena, and that
   </p>
   <p>
    I would have waited patiently outside a gate all the afternoon if I knew
   </p>
   <p>
    that some one would kindly give me a sprig of lavender in the evening.
   </p>
   <p>
    And lilies did not seem to me overdressed, but it was easy for me to
   </p>
   <p>
    believe that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like a great
   </p>
   <p>
    yellow marigold, or even the dear little single ones that were yellow
   </p>
   <p>
    and brown, and bloomed until the snow came.
   </p>
   <p>
    I wish that I had lived for a little while in those days when lilacs
   </p>
   <p>
    were a new fashion, and it was a great distinction to have some growing
   </p>
   <p>
    in a front yard. It always seems as if lilacs and poplars belonged to
   </p>
   <p>
    the same generation with a certain kind of New English gentlemen and
   </p>
   <p>
    ladies, who were ascetic and severe in some of their fashions, while in
   </p>
   <p>
    others they were more given to pleasuring and mild revelry than either
   </p>
   <p>
    their ancestors or the people who have lived in their houses since.
   </p>
   <p>
    Fifty years ago there seems to have been a last tidal wave of Puritanism
   </p>
   <p>
    which swept over the country, and drowned for a time the sober feasting
   </p>
   <p>
    and dancing which before had been considered no impropriety in the
   </p>
   <p>
    larger villages. Whist-playing was clung to only by the most worldly
   </p>
   <p>
    citizens, and, as for dancing, it was made a sin in itself and a
   </p>
   <p>
    reproach, as if every step was taken willfully in seven-leagued boots
   </p>
   <p>
    toward a place which is to be the final destination of all the wicked.
   </p>
   <p>
    A single poplar may have a severe and uncharitable look, but a row of
   </p>
   <p>
    them suggests the antique and pleasing pomp and ceremony of their early
   </p>
   <p>
    days, before the sideboard cupboards were only used to keep the boxes of
   </p>
   <p>
    strings and nails and the duster; and the best decanters were put on a
   </p>
   <p>
    high shelf, while the plain ones were used for vinegar in the kitchen
   </p>
   <p>
    closet. There is far less social visiting from house to house than there
   </p>
   <p>
    used to be. People in the smaller towns have more acquaintances who live
   </p>
   <p>
    at a distance than was the case before the days of railroads, and there
   </p>
   <p>
    are more guests who come from a distance, which has something to do with
   </p>
   <p>
    making tea-parties and the entertainment of one's neighbors less
   </p>
   <p>
    frequent than in former times. But most of the New England towns have
   </p>
   <p>
    changed their characters in the last twenty years, since the
   </p>
   <p>
    manufactories have come in and brought together large numbers either of
   </p>
   <p>
    foreigners or of a different class of people from those who used to make
   </p>
   <p>
    the most of the population. A certain class of families is rapidly
   </p>
   <p>
    becoming extinct. There will be found in the older villages very few
   </p>
   <p>
    persons left who belong to this class, which was once far more important
   </p>
   <p>
    and powerful; the oldest churches are apt to be most thinly attended
   </p>
   <p>
    simply because a different sort of ideas, even of heavenly things,
   </p>
   <p>
    attract the newer residents. I suppose that elderly people have said,
   </p>
   <p>
    ever since the time of Shem, Ham, and Japhet's wives in the ark, that
   </p>
   <p>
    society is nothing to what it used to be, and we may expect to be always
   </p>
   <p>
    told what unworthy successors we are of our grandmothers. But the fact
   </p>
   <p>
    remains that a certain element of American society is fast dying out,
   </p>
   <p>
    giving place to the new; and with all our glory and pride in modern
   </p>
   <p>
    progress and success we cling to the old associations regretfully. There
   </p>
   <p>
    is nothing to take the place of the pleasure we have in going to see our
   </p>
   <p>
    old friends in the parlors which have changed little since our
   </p>
   <p>
    childhood. No matter how advanced in years we seem to ourselves we are
   </p>
   <p>
    children still to the gracious hostess. Thank Heaven for the friends
   </p>
   <p>
    who have always known us! They may think us unreliable and young still;
   </p>
   <p>
    they may not understand that we have become busy and more or less
   </p>
   <p>
    important people to ourselves and to the world,--we are pretty sure to
   </p>
   <p>
    be without honor in our own country, but they will never forget us, and
   </p>
   <p>
    we belong to each other and always shall.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have received many kindnesses at my friends' hands, but I do not know
   </p>
   <p>
    that I have ever felt myself to be a more fortunate or honored guest
   </p>
   <p>
    than I used years ago, when I sometimes went to call upon an elderly
   </p>
   <p>
    friend of my mother who lived in most pleasant and stately fashion. I
   </p>
   <p>
    used to put on my very best manner, and I have no doubt that my thoughts
   </p>
   <p>
    were well ordered, and my conversation as proper as I knew how to make
   </p>
   <p>
    it. I can remember that I used to sit on a tall ottoman, with nothing to
   </p>
   <p>
    lean against, and my feet were off soundings, I was so high above the
   </p>
   <p>
    floor. We used to discuss the weather, and I said that I went to school
   </p>
   <p>
    (sometimes), or that it was then vacation, as the case might be, and we
   </p>
   <p>
    tried to make ourselves agreeable to each other. Presently my lady would
   </p>
   <p>
    take her keys out of her pocket, and sometimes a maid would come to
   </p>
   <p>
    serve me, or else she herself would bring me a silver tray with some
   </p>
   <p>
    pound-cakes baked in hearts and rounds, and a small glass of wine, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    proudly felt that I was a guest, though I was such a little thing an
   </p>
   <p>
    attention was being paid me, and a thrill of satisfaction used to go
   </p>
   <p>
    over me for my consequence and importance. A handful of sugar-plums
   </p>
   <p>
    would have seemed nothing beside this entertainment. I used to be
   </p>
   <p>
    careful not to crumble the cake, and I used to eat it with my gloves on,
   </p>
   <p>
    and a pleasant fragrance would cling for some time afterward to the ends
   </p>
   <p>
    of the short Lisle-thread fingers. I have no doubt that my manners as I
   </p>
   <p>
    took leave were almost as distinguished as those of my hostess, though I
   </p>
   <p>
    might have been wild and shy all the rest of the week. It was not many
   </p>
   <p>
    years ago that I went to my old friend's funeral--and saw them carry her
   </p>
   <p>
    down the long, wide walk, between the tall box borders which were her
   </p>
   <p>
    pride; and all the air was heavy and sweet with the perfume of the early
   </p>
   <p>
    summer blossoms; the white lilacs and the flowering currants were still
   </p>
   <p>
    in bloom, and the rows of her dear Dutch tulips stood dismayed in their
   </p>
   <p>
    flaunting colors and watched her go away.
   </p>
   <p>
    My sketch of the already out-of-date or fast vanishing village fashions
   </p>
   <p>
    perhaps should be ended here, but I cannot resist a wish to add another
   </p>
   <p>
    bit of autobiography of which I have been again and again reminded in
   </p>
   <p>
    writing these pages. The front yard I knew best belonged to my
   </p>
   <p>
    grandfather's house. My grandmother was a proud and solemn woman, and
   </p>
   <p>
    she hated my mischief, and rightly thought my elder sister a much better
   </p>
   <p>
    child than I. I used to be afraid of her when I was in the house, but I
   </p>
   <p>
    shook off even her authority and forgot I was under anybody's rule when
   </p>
   <p>
    I was out of doors. I was first cousin to a caterpillar if they called
   </p>
   <p>
    me to come in, and I was own sister to a giddy-minded bobolink when I
   </p>
   <p>
    ran away across the fields, as I used to do very often. But when I was a
   </p>
   <p>
    very little child indeed my world was bounded by the fences that were
   </p>
   <p>
    around my home; there were wide green yards and tall elm-trees to shade
   </p>
   <p>
    them; there was a long line of barns and sheds, and one of these had a
   </p>
   <p>
    large room in its upper story, with an old ship's foresail spread over
   </p>
   <p>
    the floor, and made a capital play-room in wet weather. Here fruit was
   </p>
   <p>
    spread in the fall, and there were some old chests and pieces of
   </p>
   <p>
    furniture that had been discarded; it was like the garret, only much
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasanter. The children in the village now cannot possibly be so happy
   </p>
   <p>
    as I was then. I used to mount the fence next the street and watch the
   </p>
   <p>
    people go in and out of the quaint-roofed village shops that stood in a
   </p>
   <p>
    row on the other side, and looked as if they belonged to a Dutch or old
   </p>
   <p>
    English town. They were burnt down long ago, but they were charmingly
   </p>
   <p>
    picturesque; the upper stories sometimes projected over the lower, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the chimneys were sometimes clustered together and built of bright red
   </p>
   <p>
    bricks.
   </p>
   <p>
    And I was too happy when I could smuggle myself into the front yard,
   </p>
   <p>
    with its four lilac bushes and its white fences to shut it in from the
   </p>
   <p>
    rest of the world, beside other railings that went from the porch down
   </p>
   <p>
    each side of the brick walk, which was laid in a pattern, and had H.C.,
   </p>
   <p>
    1818, cut deeply into one of the bricks near the door-step. The H.C.
   </p>
   <p>
    was for Henry Currier, the mason, who had signed this choice bit of work
   </p>
   <p>
    as if it were a picture, and he had been dead so many years that I used
   </p>
   <p>
    to think of his initials as if the corner brick were a little
   </p>
   <p>
    grave-stone for him. The knocker used to be so bright that it shone at
   </p>
   <p>
    you, and caught your eye bewilderingly, as you came in from the street
   </p>
   <p>
    on a sunshiny day. There were very few flowers, for my grandmother was
   </p>
   <p>
    old and feeble when I knew her, and could not take care of them; but I
   </p>
   <p>
    remember that there were blush roses, and white roses, and cinnamon
   </p>
   <p>
    roses all in a tangle in one corner, and I used to pick the crumpled
   </p>
   <p>
    petals of those to make myself a delicious coddle with ground cinnamon
   </p>
   <p>
    and damp brown sugar. In the spring I used to find the first green grass
   </p>
   <p>
    there, for it was warm and sunny, and I used to pick the little French
   </p>
   <p>
    pinks when they dared show their heads in the cracks of the flag-stones
   </p>
   <p>
    that were laid around the house. There were small shoots of lilac, too,
   </p>
   <p>
    and their leaves were brown and had a faint, sweet fragrance, and a
   </p>
   <p>
    little later the dandelions came into bloom; the largest ones I knew
   </p>
   <p>
    grew there, and they have always been to this day my favorite flowers.
   </p>
   <p>
    I had my trials and sorrows in this paradise, however; I lost a cent
   </p>
   <p>
    there one day which I never have found yet! And one morning, there
   </p>
   <p>
    suddenly appeared in one corner a beautiful, dark-blue fleur-de-lis,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I joyfully broke its neck and carried it into the house, but
   </p>
   <p>
    everybody had seen it, and wondered that I could not have left it alone.
   </p>
   <p>
    Besides this, it befell me later to sin more gravely still; my
   </p>
   <p>
    grandmother had kept some plants through the winter on a three-cornered
   </p>
   <p>
    stand built like a flight of steps, and when the warm spring weather
   </p>
   <p>
    came this was put out of doors. She had a cherished tea-rose bush, and
   </p>
   <p>
    what should I find but a bud on it; it was opened just enough to give a
   </p>
   <p>
    hint of its color. I was very pleased; I snapped it off at once, for I
   </p>
   <p>
    had heard so many times that it was hard to make roses bloom; and I ran
   </p>
   <p>
    in through the hall and up the stairs, where I met my grandmother on the
   </p>
   <p>
    square landing. She sat down in the window-seat, and I showed her
   </p>
   <p>
    proudly what was crumpled in my warm little fist. I can see it now!--it
   </p>
   <p>
    had no stem at all, and for many days afterward I was bowed down with a
   </p>
   <p>
    sense of my guilt and shame, for I was made to understand it was an
   </p>
   <p>
    awful thing to have blighted and broken a treasured flower like that.
   </p>
   <p>
    It must have been the very next winter that my grandmother died. She had
   </p>
   <p>
    a long illness which I do not remember much about; but the night she
   </p>
   <p>
    died might have been yesterday night, it is all so fresh and clear in
   </p>
   <p>
    my mind. I did not live with her in the old house then, but in a new
   </p>
   <p>
    house close by, across the yard. All the family were at the great house,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I could see that lights were carried hurriedly from one room to
   </p>
   <p>
    another. A servant came to fetch me, but I would not go with her; my
   </p>
   <p>
    grandmother was dying, whatever that might be, and she was taking leave
   </p>
   <p>
    of every one--she was ceremonious even then. I did not dare to go with
   </p>
   <p>
    the rest; I had an intense curiosity to see what dying might be like,
   </p>
   <p>
    but I was afraid to be there with her, and I was also afraid to stay at
   </p>
   <p>
    home alone. I was only five years old. It was in December, and the sky
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed to grow darker and darker, and I went out at last to sit on a
   </p>
   <p>
    door-step and cry softly to myself, and while I was there some one came
   </p>
   <p>
    to another door next the street, and rang the bell loudly again and
   </p>
   <p>
    again. I suppose I was afraid to answer the summons--indeed, I do not
   </p>
   <p>
    know that I thought of it; all the world had been still before, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    bell sounded loud and awful through the empty house. It seemed as if the
   </p>
   <p>
    messenger from an unknown world had come to the wrong house to call my
   </p>
   <p>
    poor grandmother away; and that loud ringing is curiously linked in my
   </p>
   <p>
    mind with the knocking at the gate in "Macbeth." I never can think of
   </p>
   <p>
    one without the other, though there was no fierce Lady Macbeth to bid me
   </p>
   <p>
    not be lost so poorly in my thoughts; for when they all came back awed
   </p>
   <p>
    and tearful, and found me waiting in the cold, alone, and afraid more of
   </p>
   <p>
    this world than the next, they were very good to me. But as for the
   </p>
   <p>
    funeral, it gave me vast entertainment; it was the first grand public
   </p>
   <p>
    occasion in which I had taken any share.
   </p>
   <p>
    An October Ride
   </p>
   <p>
    It was a fine afternoon, just warm enough and just cool enough, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    started off alone on horseback, though I do not know why I should say
   </p>
   <p>
    alone when I find my horse such good company. She is called Sheila, and
   </p>
   <p>
    she not only gratifies one's sense of beauty, but is very interesting in
   </p>
   <p>
    her character, while her usefulness in this world is beyond question. I
   </p>
   <p>
    grow more fond of her every week; we have had so many capital good times
   </p>
   <p>
    together, and I am certain that she is as much pleased as I when we
   </p>
   <p>
    start out for a run.
   </p>
   <p>
    I do not say to every one that I always pronounce her name in German
   </p>
   <p>
    fashion because she occasionally shies, but that is the truth. I do not
   </p>
   <p>
    mind her shying, or a certain mysterious and apparently unprovoked jump,
   </p>
   <p>
    with which she sometimes indulges herself, and no one else rides her, so
   </p>
   <p>
    I think she does no harm, but I do not like the principle of allowing
   </p>
   <p>
    her to be wicked, unrebuked and unhindered, and some day I shall give my
   </p>
   <p>
    mind to admonishing this four-footed Princess of Thule, who seems at
   </p>
   <p>
    present to consider herself at the top of royalty in this kingdom or any
   </p>
   <p>
    other. I believe I should not like her half so well if she were tamer
   </p>
   <p>
    and entirely and stupidly reliable; I glory in her good spirits and I
   </p>
   <p>
    think she has a right to be proud and willful if she chooses. I am proud
   </p>
   <p>
    myself of her quick eye and ear, her sure foot, and her slender,
   </p>
   <p>
    handsome chestnut head. I look at her points of high breeding with
   </p>
   <p>
    admiration, and I thank her heartily for all the pleasure she has given
   </p>
   <p>
    me, and for what I am sure is a steadfast friendship between us,--and a
   </p>
   <p>
    mutual understanding that rarely knows a disappointment or a mistake.
   </p>
   <p>
    She is careful when I come home late through the shadowy, twilighted
   </p>
   <p>
    woods, and I can hardly see my way; she forgets then all her little
   </p>
   <p>
    tricks and capers, and is as steady as a clock with her tramp, tramp,
   </p>
   <p>
    over the rough, dark country roads. I feel as if I had suddenly grown a
   </p>
   <p>
    pair of wings when she fairly flies over the ground and the wind
   </p>
   <p>
    whistles in my ears. There never was a time when she could not go a
   </p>
   <p>
    little faster, but she is willing to go step by step through the close
   </p>
   <p>
    woods, pushing her way through the branches, and stopping considerately
   </p>
   <p>
    when a bough that will not bend tries to pull me off the saddle. And she
   </p>
   <p>
    never goes away and leaves me when I dismount to get some flowers or a
   </p>
   <p>
    drink of spring water, though sometimes she thinks what fun it would be.
   </p>
   <p>
    I cannot speak of all her virtues for I have not learned them yet. We
   </p>
   <p>
    are still new friends, for I have only ridden her two years and I feel
   </p>
   <p>
    all the fascination of the first meeting every time I go out with her,
   </p>
   <p>
    she is so unexpected in her ways; so amusing, so sensible, so brave, and
   </p>
   <p>
    in every way so delightful a horse.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was in October, and it was a fine day to look at, though some of the
   </p>
   <p>
    great clouds that sailed through the sky were a little too heavy-looking
   </p>
   <p>
    to promise good weather on the morrow, and over in the west (where the
   </p>
   <p>
    wind was coming from) they were packed close together and looked gray
   </p>
   <p>
    and wet. It might be cold and cloudy later, but that would not hinder my
   </p>
   <p>
    ride; it is a capital way to keep warm, to come along a smooth bit of
   </p>
   <p>
    road on the run, and I should have time at any rate to go the way I
   </p>
   <p>
    wished, so Sheila trotted quickly through the gate and out of the
   </p>
   <p>
    village. There was a flicker of color left on the oaks and maples, and
   </p>
   <p>
    though it was not Indian-summer weather it was first cousin to it. I
   </p>
   <p>
    took off my cap to let the wind blow through my hair; I had half a mind
   </p>
   <p>
    to go down to the sea, but it was too late for that; there was no moon
   </p>
   <p>
    to light me home. Sheila took the strip of smooth turf just at the side
   </p>
   <p>
    of the road for her own highway, she tossed her head again and again
   </p>
   <p>
    until I had my hand full of her thin, silky mane, and she gave quick
   </p>
   <p>
    pulls at her bit and hurried little jumps ahead as if she expected me
   </p>
   <p>
    already to pull the reins tight and steady her for a hard gallop. I
   </p>
   <p>
    patted her and whistled at her, I was so glad to see her again and to be
   </p>
   <p>
    out riding, and I gave her part of her reward to begin with, because I
   </p>
   <p>
    knew she would earn it, and then we were on better terms than ever. She
   </p>
   <p>
    has such a pretty way of turning her head to take the square lump of
   </p>
   <p>
    sugar, and she never bit my fingers or dropped the sugar in her life.
   </p>
   <p>
    Down in the lower part of the town on the edge of York, there is a long
   </p>
   <p>
    tract of woodland, covering what is called the Rocky Hills; rough, high
   </p>
   <p>
    land, that stretches along from beyond Agamenticus, near the sea, to the
   </p>
   <p>
    upper part of Eliot, near the Piscataqua River. Standing on
   </p>
   <p>
    Agamenticus, the woods seem to cover nearly the whole of the country as
   </p>
   <p>
    far as one can see, and there is hardly a clearing to break this long
   </p>
   <p>
    reach of forest of which I speak; there must be twenty miles of it in an
   </p>
   <p>
    almost unbroken line. The roads cross it here and there, and one can
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes see small and lonely farms hiding away in the heart of it. The
   </p>
   <p>
    trees are for the most part young growth of oak or pine, though I could
   </p>
   <p>
    show you yet many a noble company of great pines that once would have
   </p>
   <p>
    been marked with the king's arrow, and many a royal old oak which has
   </p>
   <p>
    been overlooked in the search for ships' knees and plank for the navy
   </p>
   <p>
    yard, and piles for the always shaky, up-hill and down, pleasant old
   </p>
   <p>
    Portsmouth bridge. The part of these woods which I know best lies on
   </p>
   <p>
    either side the already old new road to York on the Rocky Hills, and
   </p>
   <p>
    here I often ride, or even take perilous rough drives through the
   </p>
   <p>
    cart-paths, the wood roads which are busy thoroughfares in the winter,
   </p>
   <p>
    and are silent and shady, narrowed by green branches and carpeted with
   </p>
   <p>
    slender brakes, and seldom traveled over, except by me, all summer long.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was a great surprise, or a succession of surprises, one summer, when
   </p>
   <p>
    I found that every one of the old uneven tracks led to or at least led
   </p>
   <p>
    by what had once been a clearing, and in old days must have been the
   </p>
   <p>
    secluded home of some of the earliest adventurous farmers of this
   </p>
   <p>
    region. It must have taken great courage, I think, to strike the first
   </p>
   <p>
    blow of one's axe here in the woods, and it must have been a brave
   </p>
   <p>
    certainty of one's perseverance that looked forward to the smooth field
   </p>
   <p>
    which was to succeed the unfruitful wilderness. The farms were far
   </p>
   <p>
    enough apart to be very lonely, and I suppose at first the cry of fierce
   </p>
   <p>
    wild creatures in the forest was an every-day sound, and the Indians
   </p>
   <p>
    stole like snakes through the bushes and crept from tree to tree about
   </p>
   <p>
    the houses watching, begging, and plundering, over and over again. There
   </p>
   <p>
    are some of these farms still occupied, where the land seems to have
   </p>
   <p>
    become thoroughly civilized, but most of them were deserted long ago;
   </p>
   <p>
    the people gave up the fight with such a persistent willfulness and
   </p>
   <p>
    wildness of nature and went away to the village, or to find more
   </p>
   <p>
    tractable soil and kindlier neighborhoods.
   </p>
   <p>
    I do not know why it is these silent, forgotten places are so
   </p>
   <p>
    delightful to me; there is one which I always call my farm, and it was a
   </p>
   <p>
    long time after I knew it well before I could find out to whom it had
   </p>
   <p>
    once belonged. In some strange way the place has become a part of my
   </p>
   <p>
    world and to belong to my thoughts and my life.
   </p>
   <p>
    I suppose every one can say, "I have a little kingdom where I give
   </p>
   <p>
    laws." Each of us has truly a kingdom in thought, and a certain
   </p>
   <p>
    spiritual possession. There are some gardens of mine where somebody
   </p>
   <p>
    plants the seeds and pulls the weeds for me every year without my ever
   </p>
   <p>
    taking a bit of trouble. I have trees and fields and woods and seas and
   </p>
   <p>
    houses, I own a great deal of the world to think and plan and dream
   </p>
   <p>
    about. The picture belongs most to the man who loves it best and sees
   </p>
   <p>
    entirely its meaning. We can always have just as much as we can take of
   </p>
   <p>
    things, and we can lay up as much treasure as we please in the higher
   </p>
   <p>
    world of thought that can never be spoiled or hindered by moth or rust,
   </p>
   <p>
    as lower and meaner wealth can be.
   </p>
   <p>
    *       *       *       *       *
   </p>
   <p>
    As for this farm of mine, I found it one day when I was coming through
   </p>
   <p>
    the woods on horseback trying to strike a shorter way out into the main
   </p>
   <p>
    road. I was pushing through some thick underbrush, and looking ahead I
   </p>
   <p>
    noticed a good deal of clear sky as if there were an open place just
   </p>
   <p>
    beyond, and presently I found myself on the edge of a clearing. There
   </p>
   <p>
    was a straggling orchard of old apple-trees, the grass about them was
   </p>
   <p>
    close and short like the wide door-yard of an old farm-house and into
   </p>
   <p>
    this cleared space the little pines were growing on every side. The old
   </p>
   <p>
    pines stood a little way back watching their children march in upon
   </p>
   <p>
    their inheritance, as if they were ready to interfere and protect and
   </p>
   <p>
    defend, if any trouble came. I could see that it would not be many
   </p>
   <p>
    years, if they were left alone, before the green grass would be covered,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the old apple-trees would grow mossy and die for lack of room and
   </p>
   <p>
    sunlight in the midst of the young woods. It was a perfect acre of turf,
   </p>
   <p>
    only here and there I could already see a cushion of juniper, or a tuft
   </p>
   <p>
    of sweet fern or bayberry. I walked the horse about slowly, picking a
   </p>
   <p>
    hard little yellow apple here and there from the boughs over my head,
   </p>
   <p>
    and at last I found a cellar all grown over with grass, with not even a
   </p>
   <p>
    bit of a crumbling brick to be seen in the hollow of it. No doubt there
   </p>
   <p>
    were some underground. It was a very large cellar, twice as large as any
   </p>
   <p>
    I had ever found before in any of these deserted places, in the woods or
   </p>
   <p>
    out. And that told me at once that there had been a large house above
   </p>
   <p>
    it, an unusual house for those old days; the family was either a large
   </p>
   <p>
    one, or it had made for itself more than a merely sufficient covering
   </p>
   <p>
    and shelter, with no inch of unnecessary room. I knew I was on very high
   </p>
   <p>
    land, but the trees were so tall and close that I could not see beyond
   </p>
   <p>
    them. The wind blew over pleasantly and it was a curiously protected and
   </p>
   <p>
    hidden place, sheltered and quiet, with its one small crop of cider
   </p>
   <p>
    apples dropping ungathered to the ground, and unharvested there, except
   </p>
   <p>
    by hurrying black ants and sticky, witless little snails.
   </p>
   <p>
    I suppose my feeling toward this place was like that about a ruin, only
   </p>
   <p>
    this seemed older than a ruin. I could not hear my horse's foot-falls,
   </p>
   <p>
    and an apple startled me when it fell with a soft thud, and I watched it
   </p>
   <p>
    roll a foot or two and then stop, as if it knew it never would have
   </p>
   <p>
    anything more to do in the world. I remembered the Enchanted Palace and
   </p>
   <p>
    the Sleeping Beauty in the Wood, and it seemed as if I were on the way
   </p>
   <p>
    to it, and this was a corner of that palace garden. The horse listened
   </p>
   <p>
    and stood still, without a bit of restlessness, and when we heard the
   </p>
   <p>
    far cry of a bird she looked round at me, as if she wished me to notice
   </p>
   <p>
    that we were not alone in the world, after all. It was strange, to be
   </p>
   <p>
    sure, that people had lived there, and had had a home where they were
   </p>
   <p>
    busy, and where the fortunes of life had found them; that they had
   </p>
   <p>
    followed out the law of existence in its succession of growth and
   </p>
   <p>
    flourishing and failure and decay, within that steadily narrowing circle
   </p>
   <p>
    of trees.
   </p>
   <p>
    The relationship of untamed nature to what is tamed and cultivated is a
   </p>
   <p>
    very curious and subtle thing to me; I do not know if every one feels it
   </p>
   <p>
    so intensely. In the darkness of an early autumn evening I sometimes
   </p>
   <p>
    find myself whistling a queer tune that chimes in with the crickets'
   </p>
   <p>
    piping and the cries of the little creatures around me in the garden. I
   </p>
   <p>
    have no thought of the rest of the world. I wonder what I am; there is a
   </p>
   <p>
    strange self-consciousness, but I am only a part of one great existence
   </p>
   <p>
    which is called nature. The life in me is a bit of all life, and where I
   </p>
   <p>
    am happiest is where I find that which is next of kin to me, in friends,
   </p>
   <p>
    or trees, or hills, or seas, or beside a flower, when I turn back more
   </p>
   <p>
    than once to look into its face.
   </p>
   <p>
    The world goes on year after year. We can use its forces, and shape and
   </p>
   <p>
    mould them, and perfect this thing or that, but we cannot make new
   </p>
   <p>
    forces; we only use the tools we find to carve the wood we find. There
   </p>
   <p>
    is nothing new; we discover and combine and use. Here is the wild
   </p>
   <p>
    fruit,--the same fruit at heart as that with which the gardener wins his
   </p>
   <p>
    prize. The world is the same world. You find a diamond, but the diamond
   </p>
   <p>
    was there a thousand years ago; you did not make it by finding it. We
   </p>
   <p>
    grow spiritually, until we grasp some new great truth of God; but it was
   </p>
   <p>
    always true, and waited for us until we came. What is there new and
   </p>
   <p>
    strange in the world except ourselves! Our thoughts are our own; God
   </p>
   <p>
    gives our life to us moment by moment, but He gives it to be our own.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Ye on your harps must lean to hear
   </p>
   <p>
    A secret chord that mine will bear."
   </p>
   <p>
    As I looked about me that day I saw the difference that men had made
   </p>
   <p>
    slowly fading out of sight. It was like a dam in a river; when it is
   </p>
   <p>
    once swept away the river goes on the same as before. The old patient,
   </p>
   <p>
    sublime forces were there at work in their appointed way, but perhaps by
   </p>
   <p>
    and by, when the apple-trees are gone and the cellar is only a rough
   </p>
   <p>
    hollow in the woods, some one will again set aside these forces that
   </p>
   <p>
    have worked unhindered, and will bring this corner of the world into a
   </p>
   <p>
    new use and shape. What if we could stop or change forever the working
   </p>
   <p>
    of these powers! But Nature repossesses herself surely of what we boldly
   </p>
   <p>
    claim. The pyramids stand yet, it happens, but where are all those
   </p>
   <p>
    cities that used also to stand in old Egypt, proud and strong, and
   </p>
   <p>
    dating back beyond men's memories or traditions,--turned into sand again
   </p>
   <p>
    and dust that is like all the rest of the desert, and blows about in the
   </p>
   <p>
    wind? Yet there cannot be such a thing as life that is lost. The tree
   </p>
   <p>
    falls and decays, in the dampness of the woods, and is part of the earth
   </p>
   <p>
    under foot, but another tree is growing out of it; perhaps it is part of
   </p>
   <p>
    its own life that is springing again from the part of it that died. God
   </p>
   <p>
    must always be putting again to some use the life that is withdrawn; it
   </p>
   <p>
    must live, because it is Life. There can be no confusion to God in this
   </p>
   <p>
    wonderful world, the new birth of the immortal, the new forms of the
   </p>
   <p>
    life that is from everlasting to everlasting, or the new way in which it
   </p>
   <p>
    comes. But it is only God who can plan and order it all,--who is a
   </p>
   <p>
    father to his children, and cares for the least of us. I thought of his
   </p>
   <p>
    unbroken promises; the people who lived and died in that lonely place
   </p>
   <p>
    knew Him, and the chain of events was fitted to their thoughts and
   </p>
   <p>
    lives, for their development and education. The world was made for them,
   </p>
   <p>
    and God keeps them yet; somewhere in his kingdom they are in their
   </p>
   <p>
    places,--they are not lost; while the trees they left grow older, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the young trees spring up, and the fields they cleared are being covered
   </p>
   <p>
    over and turned into wild land again.

   </p>
   <p>
    I had visited this farm of mine many times since that first day, but
   </p>
   <p>
    since the last time I had been there I had found out, luckily, something
   </p>
   <p>
    about its last tenant. An old lady whom I knew in the village had told
   </p>
   <p>
    me that when she was a child she remembered another very old woman, who
   </p>
   <p>
    used to live here all alone, far from any neighbors, and that one
   </p>
   <p>
    afternoon she had come with her mother to see her. She remembered the
   </p>
   <p>
    house very well; it was larger and better than most houses in the
   </p>
   <p>
    region. Its owner was the last of her family; but why she lived alone,
   </p>
   <p>
    or what became of her at last, or of her money or her goods, or who were
   </p>
   <p>
    her relatives in the town, my friend did not know. She was a thrifty,
   </p>
   <p>
    well-to-do old soul, a famous weaver and spinner, and she used to come
   </p>
   <p>
    to the meeting-house at the Old Fields every Sunday, and sit by herself
   </p>
   <p>
    in a square pew. Since I knew this, the last owner of my farm has become
   </p>
   <p>
    very real to me, and I thought of her that day a great deal, and could
   </p>
   <p>
    almost see her as she sat alone on her door-step in the twilight of a
   </p>
   <p>
    summer evening, when the thrushes were calling in the woods; or going
   </p>
   <p>
    down the hills to church, dressed in quaint fashion, with a little
   </p>
   <p>
    sadness in her face as she thought of her lost companions and how she
   </p>
   <p>
    did not use to go to church alone. And I pictured her funeral to myself,
   </p>
   <p>
    and watched her carried away at last by the narrow road that wound
   </p>
   <p>
    among the trees; and there was nobody left in the house after the
   </p>
   <p>
    neighbors from the nearest farms had put it to rights, and had looked
   </p>
   <p>
    over her treasures to their hearts' content. She must have been a
   </p>
   <p>
    fearless woman, and one could not stay in such a place as this, year in
   </p>
   <p>
    and year out, through the long days of summer and the long nights of
   </p>
   <p>
    winter, unless she found herself good company.
   </p>
   <p>
    I do not think I could find a worse avenue than that which leads to my
   </p>
   <p>
    farm, I think sometimes there must have been an easier way out which I
   </p>
   <p>
    have yet failed to discover, but it has its advantages, for the trees
   </p>
   <p>
    are beautiful and stand close together, and I do not know such green
   </p>
   <p>
    brakes anywhere as those which grow in the shadiest places. I came into
   </p>
   <p>
    a well-trodden track after a while, which led into a small granite
   </p>
   <p>
    quarry, and then I could go faster, and at last I reached a pasture wall
   </p>
   <p>
    which was quickly left behind and I was only a little way from the main
   </p>
   <p>
    road. There were a few young cattle scattered about in the pasture, and
   </p>
   <p>
    some of them which were lying down got up in a hurry and stared at me
   </p>
   <p>
    suspiciously as I rode along. It was very uneven ground, and I passed
   </p>
   <p>
    some stiff, straight mullein stalks which stood apart together in a
   </p>
   <p>
    hollow as if they wished to be alone. They always remind me of the rigid
   </p>
   <p>
    old Scotch Covenanters, who used to gather themselves together in
   </p>
   <p>
    companies, against the law, to worship God in some secret hollow of the
   </p>
   <p>
    bleak hill-side. Even the smallest and youngest of the mulleins was a
   </p>
   <p>
    Covenanter at heart; they had all put by their yellow flowers, and they
   </p>
   <p>
    will stand there, gray and unbending, through the fall rains and winter
   </p>
   <p>
    snows, to keep their places and praise God in their own fashion, and
   </p>
   <p>
    they take great credit to themselves for doing it, I have no doubt, and
   </p>
   <p>
    think it is far better to be a stern and respectable mullein than a
   </p>
   <p>
    straying, idle clematis, that clings and wanders, and cannot bear wet
   </p>
   <p>
    weather. I saw members of the congregation scattered through the pasture
   </p>
   <p>
    and felt like telling them to hurry, for the long sermon had already
   </p>
   <p>
    begun! But one ancient worthy, very late on his way to the meeting,
   </p>
   <p>
    happened to stand in our way, and Sheila bit his dry head off, which was
   </p>
   <p>
    a great pity.
   </p>
   <p>
    After I was once on the high road it was not long before I found myself
   </p>
   <p>
    in another part of the town altogether. It is great fun to ride about
   </p>
   <p>
    the country; one rouses a great deal of interest; there seems to be
   </p>
   <p>
    something exciting in the sight of a girl on horseback, and people who
   </p>
   <p>
    pass you in wagons turn to look after you, though they never would take
   </p>
   <p>
    the trouble if you were only walking. The country horses shy if you go
   </p>
   <p>
    by them fast, and sometimes you stop to apologize. The boys will leave
   </p>
   <p>
    anything to come and throw a stone at your horse. I think Sheila would
   </p>
   <p>
    like to bite a boy, though sometimes she goes through her best paces
   </p>
   <p>
    when she hears them hooting, as if she thought they were admiring her,
   </p>
   <p>
    which I never allow myself to doubt. It is considered a much greater
   </p>
   <p>
    compliment if you make a call on horseback than if you came afoot, but
   </p>
   <p>
    carriage people are nothing in the country to what they are in the city.
   </p>
   <p>
    I was on a good road and Sheila was trotting steadily, and I did not
   </p>
   <p>
    look at the western sky behind me until I suddenly noticed that the air
   </p>
   <p>
    had grown colder and the sun had been for a long time behind a cloud;
   </p>
   <p>
    then I found there was going to be a shower, in a very little while,
   </p>
   <p>
    too. I was in a thinly settled part of the town, and at first I could
   </p>
   <p>
    not think of any shelter, until I remembered that not very far distant
   </p>
   <p>
    there was an old house, with a long, sloping roof, which had formerly
   </p>
   <p>
    been the parsonage of the north parish; there had once been a church
   </p>
   <p>
    near by, to which most of the people came who lived in this upper part
   </p>
   <p>
    of the town. It had been for many years the house of an old minister, of
   </p>
   <p>
    widespread fame in his day; I had always heard of him from the elderly
   </p>
   <p>
    people, and I had often thought I should like to go into his house, and
   </p>
   <p>
    had looked at it with great interest, but until within a year or two
   </p>
   <p>
    there had been people living there. I had even listened with pleasure to
   </p>
   <p>
    a story of its being haunted, and this was a capital chance to take a
   </p>
   <p>
    look at the old place, so I hurried toward it.
   </p>
   <p>
    As I went in at the broken gate it seemed to me as if the house might
   </p>
   <p>
    have been shut up and left to itself fifty years before, when the
   </p>
   <p>
    minister died, so soon the grass grows up after men's footsteps have
   </p>
   <p>
    worn it down, and the traces are lost of the daily touch and care of
   </p>
   <p>
    their hands. The home lot was evidently part of a pasture, and the sheep
   </p>
   <p>
    had nibbled close to the door-step, while tags of their long, spring
   </p>
   <p>
    wool, washed clean by summer rains, were caught in the rose-bushes near
   </p>
   <p>
    by.
   </p>
   <p>
    It had been a very good house in its day, and had a dignity of its own,
   </p>
   <p>
    holding its gray head high, as if it knew itself to be not merely a
   </p>
   <p>
    farm-house, but a Parsonage. The roof looked as if the next winter's
   </p>
   <p>
    weight of snow might break it in, and the window panes had been loosened
   </p>
   <p>
    so much in their shaking frames that many of them had fallen out on the
   </p>
   <p>
    north side of the house, and were lying on the long grass underneath,
   </p>
   <p>
    blurred and thin but still unbroken. That was the last letter of the
   </p>
   <p>
    house's death warrant, for now the rain could get in, and the crumbling
   </p>
   <p>
    timbers must loose their hold of each other quickly. I had found a dry
   </p>
   <p>
    corner of the old shed for the horse and left her there, looking most
   </p>
   <p>
    ruefully over her shoulder after me as I hurried away, for the rain had
   </p>
   <p>
    already begun to spatter down in earnest. I was not sorry when I found
   </p>
   <p>
    that somebody had broken a pane of glass in the sidelight of the front
   </p>
   <p>
    door, near the latch, and I was very pleased when I found that by
   </p>
   <p>
    reaching through I could unfasten a great bolt and let myself in, as
   </p>
   <p>
    perhaps some tramp in search of shelter had done before me. However, I
   </p>
   <p>
    gave the blackened brass knocker a ceremonious rap or two, and I could
   </p>
   <p>
    have told by the sound of it, if in no other way, that there was nobody
   </p>
   <p>
    at home. I looked up to see a robin's nest on the cornice overhead, and
   </p>
   <p>
    I had to push away the lilacs and a withered hop vine which were both
   </p>
   <p>
    trying to cover up the door.
   </p>
   <p>
    It gives one a strange feeling, I think, to go into an empty house so
   </p>
   <p>
    old as this. It was so still there that the noise my footsteps made
   </p>
   <p>
    startled me, and the floor creaked and cracked as if some one followed
   </p>
   <p>
    me about. There was hardly a straw left or a bit of string or paper, but
   </p>
   <p>
    the rooms were much worn, the bricks in the fire-places were burnt out,
   </p>
   <p>
    rough and crumbling, and the doors were all worn smooth and round at the
   </p>
   <p>
    edges. The best rooms were wainscoted, but up-stairs there was a long,
   </p>
   <p>
    unfinished room with a little square window at each end, under the
   </p>
   <p>
    sloping roof, and as I listened there to the rain I remembered that I
   </p>
   <p>
    had once heard an old man say wistfully, that he had slept in just such
   </p>
   <p>
    a "linter" chamber as this when he was a boy, and that he never could
   </p>
   <p>
    sleep anywhere now so well as he used there while the rain fell on the
   </p>
   <p>
    roof just over his bed.
   </p>
   <p>
    Down-stairs I found a room which I knew must have been the study. It was
   </p>
   <p>
    handsomely wainscoted, and the finish of it was even better than that of
   </p>
   <p>
    the parlor. It must have been a most comfortable place, and I fear the
   </p>
   <p>
    old parson was luxurious in his tastes and less ascetic, perhaps, than
   </p>
   <p>
    the more puritanical members of his congregation approved. There was a
   </p>
   <p>
    great fire-place with a broad hearth-stone, where I think he may have
   </p>
   <p>
    made a mug of flip sometimes, and there were several curious, narrow,
   </p>
   <p>
    little cupboards built into the wall at either side, and over the
   </p>
   <p>
    fire-place itself two doors opened and there were shelves inside,
   </p>
   <p>
    broader at the top as the chimney sloped back. I saw some writing on one
   </p>
   <p>
    of these doors and went nearer to read it. There was a date at the top,
   </p>
   <p>
    some time in 1802, and his reverence had had a good quill pen and ink
   </p>
   <p>
    which bravely stood the test of time; he must have been a tall man to
   </p>
   <p>
    have written so high. I thought it might be some record of a great storm
   </p>
   <p>
    or other notable event in his house or parish, but I was amused to find
   </p>
   <p>
    that he had written there on the unpainted wood some valuable recipes
   </p>
   <p>
    for the medical treatment of horses. "It is Useful for a Sprain--and For
   </p>
   <p>
    a Cough, Take of Elecampane"--and so on. I hope he was not a hunting
   </p>
   <p>
    parson, but one could hardly expect to find any reference to the early
   </p>
   <p>
    fathers or federal head-ship in Adam on the cupboard door. I thought of
   </p>
   <p>
    the stories I had heard of the old minister and felt very well
   </p>
   <p>
    acquainted with him, though his books had been taken down and his fire
   </p>
   <p>
    was out, and he himself had gone away. I was glad to think what a good,
   </p>
   <p>
    faithful man he was, who spoke comfortable words to his people and lived
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasantly with them in this quiet country place so many years. There
   </p>
   <p>
    are old people living who have told me that nobody preaches nowadays as
   </p>
   <p>
    he used to preach, and that he used to lift his hat to everybody; that
   </p>
   <p>
    he liked a good dinner, and always was kind to the poor.
   </p>
   <p>
    I thought as I stood in the study, how many times he must have looked
   </p>
   <p>
    out of the small-paned western windows across the fields, and how in his
   </p>
   <p>
    later days he must have had a treasure of memories of the people who had
   </p>
   <p>
    gone out of that room the better for his advice and consolation, the
   </p>
   <p>
    people whom he had helped and taught and ruled. I could not imagine
   </p>
   <p>
    that he ever angrily took his parishioners to task for their errors of
   </p>
   <p>
    doctrine; indeed, it was not of his active youth and middle age that I
   </p>
   <p>
    thought at all, but of the last of his life, when he sat here in the
   </p>
   <p>
    sunshine of a winter afternoon, and the fire flickered and snapped on
   </p>
   <p>
    the hearth, and he sat before it in his arm-chair with a brown old book
   </p>
   <p>
    which he laid on his knee while he thought and dozed, and roused himself
   </p>
   <p>
    presently to greet somebody who came in, a little awed at first, to talk
   </p>
   <p>
    with him. It was a great thing to be a country minister in those old
   </p>
   <p>
    days, and to be such a minister as he was; truly the priest and ruler of
   </p>
   <p>
    his people. The times have changed, and the temporal power certainly is
   </p>
   <p>
    taken away. The divine right of ministers is almost as little believed
   </p>
   <p>
    in as that of kings, by many people; it is not possible for the
   </p>
   <p>
    influence to be so great, the office and the man are both looked at with
   </p>
   <p>
    less reverence. It is a pity that it should be so, but the conservative
   </p>
   <p>
    people who like old-fashioned ways cannot tell where to place all the
   </p>
   <p>
    blame. And it is very odd to think that these iconoclastic and
   </p>
   <p>
    unpleasant new times of ours will, a little later, be called old times,
   </p>
   <p>
    and that the children, when they are elderly people, will sigh to have
   </p>
   <p>
    them back again.
   </p>
   <p>
    I was very glad to see the old house, and I told myself a great many
   </p>
   <p>
    stories there, as one cannot help doing in such a place. There must have
   </p>
   <p>
    been so many things happen in so many long lives which were lived there;
   </p>
   <p>
    people have come into the world and gone out of it again from those
   </p>
   <p>
    square rooms with their little windows, and I believe if there are
   </p>
   <p>
    ghosts who walk about in daylight I was only half deaf to their voices,
   </p>
   <p>
    and heard much of what they tried to tell me that day. The rooms which
   </p>
   <p>
    had looked empty at first were filled again with the old clergymen, who
   </p>
   <p>
    met together with important looks and complacent dignity, and eager talk
   </p>
   <p>
    about some minor point in theology that is yet unsettled; the awkward,
   </p>
   <p>
    smiling couples, who came to be married; the mistress of the house, who
   </p>
   <p>
    must have been a stately person in her day; the little children who,
   </p>
   <p>
    under all their shyness, remembered the sugar-plums in the old parson's
   </p>
   <p>
    pockets,--all these, and even the tall cane that must have stood in the
   </p>
   <p>
    entry, were visible to my mind's eye. And I even heard a sermon from the
   </p>
   <p>
    old preacher who died so long ago, on the beauty of a life well spent.
   </p>
   <p>
    The rain fell steadily and there was no prospect of its stopping, though
   </p>
   <p>
    I could see that the clouds were thinner and that it was only a shower.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the kitchen I found an old chair which I pulled into the study, which
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed more cheerful than the rest of the house, and then I remembered
   </p>
   <p>
    that there were some bits of board in the kitchen also, and the thought
   </p>
   <p>
    struck me that it would be good fun to make a fire in the old
   </p>
   <p>
    fire-place. Everything seemed right about the chimney. I even went up
   </p>
   <p>
    into the garret to look at it there, for I had no wish to set the
   </p>
   <p>
    parsonage on fire, and I brought down a pile of old corn husks for
   </p>
   <p>
    kindlings which I found on the garret floor. I built my fire carefully,
   </p>
   <p>
    with two bricks for andirons, and when I lit it it blazed up gayly, I
   </p>
   <p>
    poked it and it crackled, and though I was very well contented there
   </p>
   <p>
    alone I wished for some friend to keep me company, it was selfish to
   </p>
   <p>
    have so much pleasure with no one to share it. The rain came faster than
   </p>
   <p>
    ever against the windows, and the room would have been dark if it had
   </p>
   <p>
    not been for my fire, which threw out a magnificent yellow light over
   </p>
   <p>
    the old brown wood-work. I leaned back and watched the dry sticks fall
   </p>
   <p>
    apart in red coals and thought I might have to spend the night there,
   </p>
   <p>
    for if it were a storm and not a shower I was several miles from home,
   </p>
   <p>
    and a late October rain is not like a warm one in June to fall upon
   </p>
   <p>
    one's shoulders. I could hear the house leaking when it rained less
   </p>
   <p>
    heavily, and the soot dropped down the chimney and great drops of water
   </p>
   <p>
    came down, too, and spluttered in the fire. I thought what a merry thing
   </p>
   <p>
    it would be if a party of young people ever had to take refuge there,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I could almost see their faces and hear them laugh, though until
   </p>
   <p>
    that minute they had been strangers to me.
   </p>
   <p>
    But the shower was over at last, and my fire was out, and the last pale
   </p>
   <p>
    shining of the sun came into the windows, and I looked out to see the
   </p>
   <p>
    distant fields and woods all clear again in the late afternoon light. I
   </p>
   <p>
    must hurry to get home before dark, so I raked up the ashes and left my
   </p>
   <p>
    chair beside the fire-place, and shut and fastened the front door after
   </p>
   <p>
    me, and went out to see what had become of my horse, shaking the dust
   </p>
   <p>
    and cobwebs off my dress as I crossed the wet grass to the shed. The
   </p>
   <p>
    rain had come through the broken roof and poor Sheila looked anxious and
   </p>
   <p>
    hungry as if she thought I might have meant to leave her there till
   </p>
   <p>
    morning in that dismal place. I offered her my apologies, but she made
   </p>
   <p>
    even a shorter turn than usual when I had mounted, and we scurried off
   </p>
   <p>
    down the road, spattering ourselves as we went. I hope the ghosts who
   </p>
   <p>
    live in the parsonage watched me with friendly eyes, and I looked back
   </p>
   <p>
    myself, to see a thin blue whiff of smoke still coming up from the great
   </p>
   <p>
    chimney. I wondered who it was that had made the first fire there,--but
   </p>
   <p>
    I think I shall have made the last.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tom's Husband
   </p>
   <p>
    I shall not dwell long upon the circumstances that led to the marriage
   </p>
   <p>
    of my hero and heroine; though their courtship was, to them, the only
   </p>
   <p>
    one that has ever noticeably approached the ideal, it had many aspects
   </p>
   <p>
    in which it was entirely commonplace in other people's eyes. While the
   </p>
   <p>
    world in general smiles at lovers with kindly approval and sympathy, it
   </p>
   <p>
    refuses to be aware of the unprecedented delight which is amazing to the
   </p>
   <p>
    lovers themselves.
   </p>
   <p>
    But, as has been true in many other cases, when they were at last
   </p>
   <p>
    married, the most ideal of situations was found to have been changed to
   </p>
   <p>
    the most practical. Instead of having shared their original duties, and,
   </p>
   <p>
    as school-boys would say, going halves, they discovered that the cares
   </p>
   <p>
    of life had been doubled. This led to some distressing moments for both
   </p>
   <p>
    our friends; they understood suddenly that instead of dwelling in heaven
   </p>
   <p>
    they were still upon earth, and had made themselves slaves to new laws
   </p>
   <p>
    and limitations. Instead of being freer and happier than ever before,
   </p>
   <p>
    they had assumed new responsibilities; they had established a new
   </p>
   <p>
    household, and must fulfill in some way or another the obligations of
   </p>
   <p>
    it. They looked back with affection to their engagement; they had been
   </p>
   <p>
    longing to have each other to themselves, apart from the world, but it
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed that they never felt so keenly that they were still units in
   </p>
   <p>
    modern society. Since Adam and Eve were in Paradise, before the devil
   </p>
   <p>
    joined them, nobody has had a chance to imitate that unlucky couple. In
   </p>
   <p>
    some respects they told the truth when, twenty times a day, they said
   </p>
   <p>
    that life had never been so pleasant before; but there were mental
   </p>
   <p>
    reservations on either side which might have subjected them to the
   </p>
   <p>
    accusation of lying. Somehow, there was a little feeling of
   </p>
   <p>
    disappointment, and they caught themselves wondering--though they would
   </p>
   <p>
    have died sooner than confess it--whether they were quite so happy as
   </p>
   <p>
    they had expected. The truth was, they were much happier than people
   </p>
   <p>
    usually are, for they had an uncommon capacity for enjoyment. For a
   </p>
   <p>
    little while they were like a sail-boat that is beating and has to drift
   </p>
   <p>
    a few minutes before it can catch the wind and start off on the other
   </p>
   <p>
    tack. And they had the same feeling, too, that any one is likely to have
   </p>
   <p>
    who has been long pursuing some object of his ambition or desire.
   </p>
   <p>
    Whether it is a coin, or a picture, or a stray volume of some old
   </p>
   <p>
    edition of Shakespeare, or whether it is an office under government or a
   </p>
   <p>
    lover, when fairly in one's grasp there is a loss of the eagerness that
   </p>
   <p>
    was felt in pursuit. Satisfaction, even after one has dined well, is not
   </p>
   <p>
    so interesting and eager a feeling as hunger.
   </p>
   <p>
    My hero and heroine were reasonably well established to begin with: they
   </p>
   <p>
    each had some money, though Mr. Wilson had most. His father had at one
   </p>
   <p>
    time been a rich man, but with the decline, a few years before, of
   </p>
   <p>
    manufacturing interests, he had become, mostly through the fault of
   </p>
   <p>
    others, somewhat involved; and at the time of his death his affairs were
   </p>
   <p>
    in such a condition that it was still a question whether a very large
   </p>
   <p>
    sum or a moderately large one would represent his estate. Mrs. Wilson,
   </p>
   <p>
    Tom's step-mother, was somewhat of an invalid; she suffered severely at
   </p>
   <p>
    times with asthma, but she was almost entirely relieved by living in
   </p>
   <p>
    another part of the country. While her husband lived, she had accepted
   </p>
   <p>
    her illness as inevitable, and rarely left home; but during the last few
   </p>
   <p>
    years she had lived in Philadelphia with her own people, making short
   </p>
   <p>
    and wheezing visits only from time to time, and had not undergone a
   </p>
   <p>
    voluntary period of suffering since the occasion of Tom's marriage,
   </p>
   <p>
    which she had entirely approved. She had a sufficient property of her
   </p>
   <p>
    own, and she and Tom were independent of each other in that way. Her
   </p>
   <p>
    only other stepchild was a daughter, who had married a navy officer, and
   </p>
   <p>
    had at this time gone out to spend three years (or less) with her
   </p>
   <p>
    husband, who had been ordered to Japan.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is not unfrequently noticed that in many marriages one of the persons
   </p>
   <p>
    who choose each other as partners for life is said to have thrown
   </p>
   <p>
    himself or herself away, and the relatives and friends look on with
   </p>
   <p>
    dismal forebodings and ill-concealed submission. In this case it was the
   </p>
   <p>
    wife who might have done so much better, according to public opinion.
   </p>
   <p>
    She did not think so herself, luckily, either before marriage or
   </p>
   <p>
    afterward, and I do not think it occurred to her to picture to herself
   </p>
   <p>
    the sort of career which would have been her alternative. She had been
   </p>
   <p>
    an only child, and had usually taken her own way. Some one once said
   </p>
   <p>
    that it was a great pity that she had not been obliged to work for her
   </p>
   <p>
    living, for she had inherited a most uncommon business talent, and,
   </p>
   <p>
    without being disreputably keen at a bargain, her insight into the
   </p>
   <p>
    practical working of affairs was very clear and far-reaching. Her
   </p>
   <p>
    father, who had also been a manufacturer, like Tom's, had often said it
   </p>
   <p>
    had been a mistake that she was a girl instead of a boy. Such executive
   </p>
   <p>
    ability as hers is often wasted in the more contracted sphere of women,
   </p>
   <p>
    and is apt to be more a disadvantage than a help. She was too
   </p>
   <p>
    independent and self-reliant for a wife; it would seem at first thought
   </p>
   <p>
    that she needed a wife herself more than she did a husband. Most men
   </p>
   <p>
    like best the women whose natures cling and appeal to theirs for
   </p>
   <p>
    protection. But Tom Wilson, while he did not wish to be protected
   </p>
   <p>
    himself, liked these very qualities in his wife which would have
   </p>
   <p>
    displeased some other men; to tell the truth, he was very much in love
   </p>
   <p>
    with his wife just as she was. He was a successful collector of almost
   </p>
   <p>
    everything but money, and during a great part of his life he had been an
   </p>
   <p>
    invalid, and he had grown, as he laughingly confessed, very
   </p>
   <p>
    old-womanish. He had been badly lamed, when a boy, by being caught in
   </p>
   <p>
    some machinery in his father's mill, near which he was idling one
   </p>
   <p>
    afternoon, and though he had almost entirely outgrown the effect of his
   </p>
   <p>
    injury, it had not been until after many years. He had been in college,
   </p>
   <p>
    but his eyes had given out there, and he had been obliged to leave in
   </p>
   <p>
    the middle of his junior year, though he had kept up a pleasant
   </p>
   <p>
    intercourse with the members of his class, with whom he had been a great
   </p>
   <p>
    favorite. He was a good deal of an idler in the world. I do not think
   </p>
   <p>
    his ambition, except in the case of securing Mary Dunn for his wife, had
   </p>
   <p>
    ever been distinct; he seemed to make the most he could of each day as
   </p>
   <p>
    it came, without making all his days' works tend toward some grand
   </p>
   <p>
    result, and go toward the upbuilding of some grand plan and purpose. He
   </p>
   <p>
    consequently gave no promise of being either distinguished or great.
   </p>
   <p>
    When his eyes would allow, he was an indefatigable reader; and although
   </p>
   <p>
    he would have said that he read only for amusement, yet he amused
   </p>
   <p>
    himself with books that were well worth the time he spent over them.
   </p>
   <p>
    The house where he lived nominally belonged to his step-mother, but she
   </p>
   <p>
    had taken for granted that Tom would bring his wife home to it, and
   </p>
   <p>
    assured him that it should be to all intents and purposes his. Tom was
   </p>
   <p>
    deeply attached to the old place, which was altogether the pleasantest
   </p>
   <p>
    in town. He had kept bachelor's hall there most of the time since his
   </p>
   <p>
    father's death, and he had taken great pleasure, before his marriage, in
   </p>
   <p>
    refitting it to some extent, though it was already comfortable and
   </p>
   <p>
    furnished in remarkably good taste. People said of him that if it had
   </p>
   <p>
    not been for his illnesses, and if he had been a poor boy, he probably
   </p>
   <p>
    would have made something of himself. As it was, he was not very well
   </p>
   <p>
    known by the towns-people, being somewhat reserved, and not taking much
   </p>
   <p>
    interest in their every-day subjects of conversation. Nobody liked him
   </p>
   <p>
    so well as they liked his wife, yet there was no reason why he should be
   </p>
   <p>
    disliked enough to have much said about him.
   </p>
   <p>
    After our friends had been married for some time, and had outlived the
   </p>
   <p>
    first strangeness of the new order of things, and had done their duty to
   </p>
   <p>
    their neighbors with so much apparent willingness and generosity that
   </p>
   <p>
    even Tom himself was liked a great deal better than he ever had been
   </p>
   <p>
    before, they were sitting together one stormy evening in the library,
   </p>
   <p>
    before the fire. Mrs. Wilson had been reading Tom the letters which had
   </p>
   <p>
    come to him by the night's mail. There was a long one from his sister in
   </p>
   <p>
    Nagasaki, which had been written with a good deal of ill-disguised
   </p>
   <p>
    reproach. She complained of the smallness of the income of her share in
   </p>
   <p>
    her father's estate, and said that she had been assured by American
   </p>
   <p>
    friends that the smaller mills were starting up everywhere, and
   </p>
   <p>
    beginning to do well again. Since so much of their money was invested in
   </p>
   <p>
    the factory, she had been surprised and sorry to find by Tom's last
   </p>
   <p>
    letters that he had seemed to have no idea of putting in a proper person
   </p>
   <p>
    as superintendent, and going to work again. Four per cent. on her other
   </p>
   <p>
    property, which she had been told she must soon expect instead of eight,
   </p>
   <p>
    would make a great difference to her. A navy captain in a foreign port
   </p>
   <p>
    was obliged to entertain a great deal, and Tom must know that it cost
   </p>
   <p>
    them much more to live than it did him, and ought to think of their
   </p>
   <p>
    interests. She hoped he would talk over what was best to be done with
   </p>
   <p>
    their mother (who had been made executor, with Tom, of his father's
   </p>
   <p>
    will).
   </p>
   <p>
    Tom laughed a little, but looked disturbed. His wife had said something
   </p>
   <p>
    to the same effect, and his mother had spoken once or twice in her
   </p>
   <p>
    letters of the prospect of starting the mill again. He was not a bit of
   </p>
   <p>
    a business man, and he did not feel certain, with the theories which he
   </p>
   <p>
    had arrived at of the state of the country, that it was safe yet to
   </p>
   <p>
    spend the money which would have to be spent in putting the mill in
   </p>
   <p>
    order. "They think that the minute it is going again we shall be making
   </p>
   <p>
    money hand over hand, just as father did when we were children," he
   </p>
   <p>
    said. "It is going to cost us no end of money before we can make
   </p>
   <p>
    anything. Before father died he meant to put in a good deal of new
   </p>
   <p>
    machinery, I remember. I don't know anything about the business myself,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I would have sold out long ago if I had had an offer that came
   </p>
   <p>
    anywhere near the value. The larger mills are the only ones that are
   </p>
   <p>
    good for anything now, and we should have to bring a crowd of French
   </p>
   <p>
    Canadians here; the day is past for the people who live in this part of
   </p>
   <p>
    the country to go into the factory again. Even the Irish all go West
   </p>
   <p>
    when they come into the country, and don't come to places like this any
   </p>
   <p>
    more."
   </p>
   <p>
    "But there are a good many of the old work-people down in the village,"
   </p>
   <p>
    said Mrs. Wilson. "Jack Towne asked me the other day if you weren't
   </p>
   <p>
    going to start up in the spring."
   </p>
   <p>
    Tom moved uneasily in his chair. "I'll put you in for superintendent, if
   </p>
   <p>
    you like," he said, half angrily, whereupon Mary threw the newspaper at
   </p>
   <p>
    him; but by the time he had thrown it back he was in good humor again.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Do you know, Tom," she said, with amazing seriousness, "that I believe
   </p>
   <p>
    I should like nothing in the world so much as to be the head of a large
   </p>
   <p>
    business? I hate keeping house,--I always did; and I never did so much
   </p>
   <p>
    of it in all my life put together as I have since I have been married. I
   </p>
   <p>
    suppose it isn't womanly to say so, but if I could escape from the whole
   </p>
   <p>
    thing I believe I should be perfectly happy. If you get rich when the
   </p>
   <p>
    mill is going again, I shall beg for a housekeeper, and shirk
   </p>
   <p>
    everything. I give you fair warning. I don't believe I keep this house
   </p>
   <p>
    half so well as you did before I came here."
   </p>
   <p>
    Tom's eyes twinkled. "I am going to have that glory,--I don't think you
   </p>
   <p>
    do, Polly; but you can't say that I have not been forbearing. I
   </p>
   <p>
    certainly have not told you more than twice how we used to have things
   </p>
   <p>
    cooked. I'm not going to be your kitchen-colonel."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Of course it seemed the proper thing to do," said his wife,
   </p>
   <p>
    meditatively; "but I think we should have been even happier than we have
   </p>
   <p>
    if I had been spared it. I have had some days of wretchedness that I
   </p>
   <p>
    shudder to think of. I never know what to have for breakfast; and I
   </p>
   <p>
    ought not to say it, but I don't mind the sight of dust. I look upon
   </p>
   <p>
    housekeeping as my life's great discipline;" and at this pathetic
   </p>
   <p>
    confession they both laughed heartily.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I've a great mind to take it off your hands," said Tom. "I always
   </p>
   <p>
    rather liked it, to tell the truth, and I ought to be a better
   </p>
   <p>
    housekeeper,--I have been at it for five years; though housekeeping for
   </p>
   <p>
    one is different from what it is for two, and one of them a woman. You
   </p>
   <p>
    see you have brought a different element into my family. Luckily, the
   </p>
   <p>
    servants are pretty well drilled. I do think you upset them a good deal
   </p>
   <p>
    at first!"
   </p>
   <p>
    Mary Wilson smiled as if she only half heard what he was saying. She
   </p>
   <p>
    drummed with her foot on the floor and looked intently at the fire, and
   </p>
   <p>
    presently gave it a vigorous poking. "Well?" said Tom, after he had
   </p>
   <p>
    waited patiently as long as he could.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Tom! I'm going to propose something to you. I wish you would really do
   </p>
   <p>
    as you said, and take all the home affairs under your care, and let me
   </p>
   <p>
    start the mill. I am certain I could manage it. Of course I should get
   </p>
   <p>
    people who understood the thing to teach me. I believe I was made for
   </p>
   <p>
    it; I should like it above all things. And this is what I will do: I
   </p>
   <p>
    will bear the cost of starting it, myself,--I think I have money enough,
   </p>
   <p>
    or can get it; and if I have not put affairs in the right trim at the
   </p>
   <p>
    end of a year I will stop, and you may make some other arrangement. If I
   </p>
   <p>
    have, you and your mother and sister can pay me back."
   </p>
   <p>
    "So I am going to be the wife, and you the husband," said Tom, a little
   </p>
   <p>
    indignantly; "at least, that is what people will say. It's a regular
   </p>
   <p>
    Darby and Joan affair, and you think you can do more work in a day than
   </p>
   <p>
    I can do in three. Do you know that you must go to town to buy cotton?
   </p>
   <p>
    And do you know there are a thousand things about it that you don't
   </p>
   <p>
    know?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "And never will?" said Mary, with perfect good humor. "Why, Tom, I can
   </p>
   <p>
    learn as well as you, and a good deal better, for I like business, and
   </p>
   <p>
    you don't. You forget that I was always father's right-hand man after I
   </p>
   <p>
    was a dozen years old, and that you have let me invest my money and some
   </p>
   <p>
    of your own, and I haven't made a blunder yet."
   </p>
   <p>
    Tom thought that his wife had never looked so handsome or so happy. "I
   </p>
   <p>
    don't care, I should rather like the fun of knowing what people will
   </p>
   <p>
    say. It is a new departure, at any rate. Women think they can do
   </p>
   <p>
    everything better than men in these days, but I'm the first man,
   </p>
   <p>
    apparently, who has wished he were a woman."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Of course people will laugh," said Mary, "but they will say that it's
   </p>
   <p>
    just like me, and think I am fortunate to have married a man who will
   </p>
   <p>
    let me do as I choose. I don't see why it isn't sensible: you will be
   </p>
   <p>
    living exactly as you were before you married, as to home affairs; and
   </p>
   <p>
    since it was a good thing for you to know something about housekeeping
   </p>
   <p>
    then, I can't imagine why you shouldn't go on with it now, since it
   </p>
   <p>
    makes me miserable, and I am wasting a fine business talent while I do
   </p>
   <p>
    it. What do we care for people's talking about it?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "It seems to me that it is something like women's smoking: it isn't
   </p>
   <p>
    wicked, but it isn't the custom of the country. And I don't like the
   </p>
   <p>
    idea of your going among business men. Of course I should be above going
   </p>
   <p>
    with you, and having people think I must be an idiot; they would say
   </p>
   <p>
    that you married a manufacturing interest, and I was thrown in. I can
   </p>
   <p>
    foresee that my pride is going to be humbled to the dust in every way,"
   </p>
   <p>
    Tom declared in mournful tones, and began to shake with laughter. "It is
   </p>
   <p>
    one of your lovely castles in the air, dear Polly, but an old brick mill
   </p>
   <p>
    needs a better foundation than the clouds. No, I'll look around, and get
   </p>
   <p>
    an honest, experienced man for agent. I suppose it's the best thing we
   </p>
   <p>
    can do, for the machinery ought not to lie still any longer; but I mean
   </p>
   <p>
    to sell the factory as soon as I can. I devoutly wish it would take
   </p>
   <p>
    fire, for the insurance would be the best price we are likely to get.
   </p>
   <p>
    That is a famous letter from Alice! I am afraid the captain has been
   </p>
   <p>
    growling over his pay, or they have been giving too many little dinners
   </p>
   <p>
    on board ship. If we were rid of the mill, you and I might go out there
   </p>
   <p>
    this winter. It would be capital fun."
   </p>
   <p>
    Mary smiled again in an absent-minded way. Tom had an uneasy feeling
   </p>
   <p>
    that he had not heard the end of it yet, but nothing more was said for a
   </p>
   <p>
    day or two. When Mrs. Tom Wilson announced, with no apparent thought of
   </p>
   <p>
    being contradicted, that she had entirely made up her mind, and she
   </p>
   <p>
    meant to see those men who had been overseers of the different
   </p>
   <p>
    departments, who still lived in the village, and have the mill put in
   </p>
   <p>
    order at once, Tom looked disturbed, but made no opposition; and soon
   </p>
   <p>
    after breakfast his wife formally presented him with a handful of keys,
   </p>
   <p>
    and told him there was some lamb in the house for dinner; and presently
   </p>
   <p>
    he heard the wheels of her little phaeton rattling off down the road. I
   </p>
   <p>
    should be untruthful if I tried to persuade any one that he was not
   </p>
   <p>
    provoked; he thought she would at least have waited for his formal
   </p>
   <p>
    permission, and at first he meant to take another horse, and chase her,
   </p>
   <p>
    and bring her back in disgrace, and put a stop to the whole thing. But
   </p>
   <p>
    something assured him that she knew what she was about, and he
   </p>
   <p>
    determined to let her have her own way. If she failed, it might do no
   </p>
   <p>
    harm, and this was the only ungallant thought he gave her. He was sure
   </p>
   <p>
    that she would do nothing unladylike, or be unmindful of his dignity;
   </p>
   <p>
    and he believed it would be looked upon as one of her odd, independent
   </p>
   <p>
    freaks, which always had won respect in the end, however much they had
   </p>
   <p>
    been laughed at in the beginning. "Susan," said he, as that estimable
   </p>
   <p>
    person went by the door with the dust-pan, "you may tell Catherine to
   </p>
   <p>
    come to me for orders about the house, and you may do so yourself. I am
   </p>
   <p>
    going to take charge again, as I did before I was married. It is no
   </p>
   <p>
    trouble to me, and Mrs. Wilson dislikes it. Besides, she is going into
   </p>
   <p>
    business, and will have a great deal else to think of."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes, sir; very well, sir," said Susan, who was suddenly moved to ask so
   </p>
   <p>
    many questions that she was utterly silent. But her master looked very
   </p>
   <p>
    happy; there was evidently no disapproval of his wife; and she went on
   </p>
   <p>
    up the stairs, and began to sweep them down, knocking the dust-brush
   </p>
   <p>
    about excitedly, as if she were trying to kill a descending colony of
   </p>
   <p>
    insects.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tom went out to the stable and mounted his horse, which had been waiting
   </p>
   <p>
    for him to take his customary after-breakfast ride to the post-office,
   </p>
   <p>
    and he galloped down the road in quest of the phaeton. He saw Mary
   </p>
   <p>
    talking with Jack Towne, who had been an overseer and a valued workman
   </p>
   <p>
    of his father's. He was looking much surprised and pleased.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I wasn't caring so much about getting work, myself," he explained;
   </p>
   <p>
    "I've got what will carry me and my wife through; but it'll be better
   </p>
   <p>
    for the young folks about here to work near home. My nephews are wanting
   </p>
   <p>
    something to do; they were going to Lynn next week. I don't say but I
   </p>
   <p>
    should like to be to work in the old place again. I've sort of missed
   </p>
   <p>
    it, since we shut down."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I'm sorry I was so long in overtaking you," said Tom, politely, to his
   </p>
   <p>
    wife. "Well, Jack, did Mrs. Wilson tell you she's going to start the
   </p>
   <p>
    mill? You must give her all the help you can."
   </p>
   <p>
    "'Deed I will," said Mr. Towne, gallantly, without a bit of
   </p>
   <p>
    astonishment.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I don't know much about the business yet," said Mrs. Wilson, who had
   </p>
   <p>
    been a little overcome at Jack Towne's lingo of the different rooms and
   </p>
   <p>
    machinery, and who felt an overpowering sense of having a great deal
   </p>
   <p>
    before her in the next few weeks. "By the time the mill is ready, I will
   </p>
   <p>
    be ready, too," she said, taking heart a little; and Tom, who was quick
   </p>
   <p>
    to understand her moods, could not help laughing, as he rode alongside.
   </p>
   <p>
    "We want a new barrel of flour, Tom, dear," she said, by way of
   </p>
   <p>
    punishment for his untimely mirth.
   </p>
   <p>
    If she lost courage in the long delay, or was disheartened at the steady
   </p>
   <p>
    call for funds, she made no sign; and after a while the mill started up,
   </p>
   <p>
    and her cares were lightened, so that she told Tom that before next pay
   </p>
   <p>
    day she would like to go to Boston for a few days, and go to the
   </p>
   <p>
    theatre, and have a frolic and a rest. She really looked pale and thin,
   </p>
   <p>
    and she said she never worked so hard in all her life; but nobody knew
   </p>
   <p>
    how happy she was, and she was so glad she had married Tom, for some men
   </p>
   <p>
    would have laughed at it.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I laughed at it," said Tom, meekly. "All is, if I don't cry by and by,
   </p>
   <p>
    because I am a beggar, I shall be lucky." But Mary looked fearlessly
   </p>
   <p>
    serene, and said that there was no danger at present.
   </p>
   <p>
    It would have been ridiculous to expect a dividend the first year,
   </p>
   <p>
    though the Nagasaki people were pacified with difficulty. All the
   </p>
   <p>
    business letters came to Tom's address, and everybody who was not
   </p>
   <p>
    directly concerned thought that he was the motive power of the
   </p>
   <p>
    reawakened enterprise. Sometimes business people came to the mill, and
   </p>
   <p>
    were amazed at having to confer with Mrs. Wilson, but they soon had to
   </p>
   <p>
    respect her talents and her success. She was helped by the old clerk,
   </p>
   <p>
    who had been promptly recalled and reinstated, and she certainly did
   </p>
   <p>
    capitally well. She was laughed at, as she had expected to be, and
   </p>
   <p>
    people said they should think Tom would be ashamed of himself; but it
   </p>
   <p>
    soon appeared that he was not to blame, and what reproach was offered
   </p>
   <p>
    was on the score of his wife's oddity. There was nothing about the mill
   </p>
   <p>
    that she did not understand before very long, and at the end of the
   </p>
   <p>
    second year she declared a small dividend with great pride and triumph.
   </p>
   <p>
    And she was congratulated on her success, and every one thought of her
   </p>
   <p>
    project in a different way from the way they had thought of it in the
   </p>
   <p>
    beginning. She had singularly good fortune: at the end of the third year
   </p>
   <p>
    she was making money for herself and her friends faster than most people
   </p>
   <p>
    were, and approving letters began to come from Nagasaki. The Ashtons had
   </p>
   <p>
    been ordered to stay in that region, and it was evident that they were
   </p>
   <p>
    continually being obliged to entertain more instead of less. Their
   </p>
   <p>
    children were growing fast, too, and constantly becoming more expensive.
   </p>
   <p>
    The captain and his wife had already begun to congratulate themselves
   </p>
   <p>
    secretly that their two sons would in all probability come into
   </p>
   <p>
    possession, one day, of their uncle Tom's handsome property.
   </p>
   <p>
    For a good while Tom enjoyed life, and went on his quiet way serenely.
   </p>
   <p>
    He was anxious at first, for he thought that Mary was going to make
   </p>
   <p>
    ducks and drakes of his money and her own. And then he did not exactly
   </p>
   <p>
    like the looks of the thing, either; he feared that his wife was growing
   </p>
   <p>
    successful as a business person at the risk of losing her womanliness.
   </p>
   <p>
    But as time went on, and he found there was no fear of that, he
   </p>
   <p>
    accepted the situation philosophically. He gave up his collection of
   </p>
   <p>
    engravings, having become more interested in one of coins and medals,
   </p>
   <p>
    which took up most of his leisure time. He often went to the city in
   </p>
   <p>
    pursuit of such treasures, and gained much renown in certain quarters as
   </p>
   <p>
    a numismatologist of great skill and experience. But at last his house
   </p>
   <p>
    (which had almost kept itself, and had given him little to do beside
   </p>
   <p>
    ordering the dinners, while faithful old Catherine and her niece Susan
   </p>
   <p>
    were his aids) suddenly became a great care to him. Catherine, who had
   </p>
   <p>
    been the main-stay of the family for many years, died after a short
   </p>
   <p>
    illness, and Susan must needs choose that time, of all others, for being
   </p>
   <p>
    married to one of the second hands in the mill. There followed a long
   </p>
   <p>
    and dismal season of experimenting, and for a time there was a
   </p>
   <p>
    procession of incapable creatures going in at one kitchen door and out
   </p>
   <p>
    of the other. His wife would not have liked to say so, but it seemed to
   </p>
   <p>
    her that Tom was growing fussy about the house affairs, and took more
   </p>
   <p>
    notice of those minor details than he used. She wished more than once,
   </p>
   <p>
    when she was tired, that he would not talk so much about the
   </p>
   <p>
    housekeeping; he seemed sometimes to have no other thought.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the early days of Mrs. Wilson's business life, she had made it a rule
   </p>
   <p>
    to consult her husband on every subject of importance; but it had
   </p>
   <p>
    speedily proved to be a formality. Tom tried manfully to show a deep
   </p>
   <p>
    interest which he did not feel, and his wife gave up, little by little,
   </p>
   <p>
    telling him much about her affairs. She said that she liked to drop
   </p>
   <p>
    business when she came home in the evening; and at last she fell into
   </p>
   <p>
    the habit of taking a nap on the library sofa, while Tom, who could not
   </p>
   <p>
    use his eyes much by lamp-light, sat smoking or in utter idleness before
   </p>
   <p>
    the fire. When they were first married his wife had made it a rule that
   </p>
   <p>
    she should always read him the evening papers, and afterward they had
   </p>
   <p>
    always gone on with some book of history or philosophy, in which they
   </p>
   <p>
    were both interested. These evenings of their early married life had
   </p>
   <p>
    been charming to both of them, and from time to time one would say to
   </p>
   <p>
    the other that they ought to take up again the habit of reading
   </p>
   <p>
    together. Mary was so unaffectedly tired in the evening that Tom never
   </p>
   <p>
    liked to propose a walk; for, though he was not a man of peculiarly
   </p>
   <p>
    social nature, he had always been accustomed to pay an occasional
   </p>
   <p>
    evening visit to his neighbors in the village. And though he had little
   </p>
   <p>
    interest in the business world, and still less knowledge of it, after a
   </p>
   <p>
    while he wished that his wife would have more to say about what she was
   </p>
   <p>
    planning and doing, or how things were getting on. He thought that her
   </p>
   <p>
    chief aid, old Mr. Jackson, was far more in her thoughts than he. She
   </p>
   <p>
    was forever quoting Jackson's opinions. He did not like to find that she
   </p>
   <p>
    took it for granted that he was not interested in the welfare of his own
   </p>
   <p>
    property; it made him feel like a sort of pensioner and dependent,
   </p>
   <p>
    though, when they had guests at the house, which was by no means seldom,
   </p>
   <p>
    there was nothing in her manner that would imply that she thought
   </p>
   <p>
    herself in any way the head of the family. It was hard work to find
   </p>
   <p>
    fault with his wife in any way, though, to give him his due, he rarely
   </p>
   <p>
    tried.

   <p>
    But, this being a wholly unnatural state of things, the reader must
   </p>
   <p>
    expect to hear of its change at last, and the first blow from the enemy
   </p>
   <p>
    was dealt by an old woman, who lived near by, and who called to Tom one
   </p>
   <p>
    morning, as he was driving down to the village in a great hurry (to post
   </p>
   <p>
    a letter, which ordered his agent to secure a long-wished-for ancient
   </p>
   <p>
    copper coin, at any price), to ask him if they had made yeast that week,
   </p>
   <p>
    and if she could borrow a cupful, as her own had met with some
   </p>
   <p>
    misfortune. Tom was instantly in a rage, and he mentally condemned her
   </p>
   <p>
    to some undeserved fate, but told her aloud to go and see the cook. This
   </p>
   <p>
    slight delay, besides being killing to his dignity, caused him to lose
   </p>
   <p>
    the mail, and in the end his much-desired copper coin. It was a hard day
   </p>
   <p>
    for him, altogether; it was Wednesday, and the first days of the week
   </p>
   <p>
    having been stormy the washing was very late. And Mary came home to
   </p>
   <p>
    dinner provokingly good-natured. She had met an old school-mate and her
   </p>
   <p>
    husband driving home from the mountains, and had first taken them over
   </p>
   <p>
    her factory, to their great amusement and delight, and then had brought
   </p>
   <p>
    them home to dinner. Tom greeted them cordially, and manifested his
   </p>
   <p>
    usual graceful hospitality; but the minute he saw his wife alone he said
   </p>
   <p>
    in a plaintive tone of rebuke, "I should think you might have remembered
   </p>
   <p>
    that the servants are unusually busy to-day. I do wish you would take a
   </p>
   <p>
    little interest in things at home. The women have been washing, and I'm
   </p>
   <p>
    sure I don't know what sort of a dinner we can give your friends. I wish
   </p>
   <p>
    you had thought to bring home some steak. I have been busy myself, and
   </p>
   <p>
    couldn't go down to the village. I thought we would only have a lunch."
   </p>
   <p>
    Mary was hungry, but she said nothing, except that it would be all
   </p>
   <p>
    right,--she didn't mind; and perhaps they could have some canned soup.
   </p>
   <p>
    She often went to town to buy or look at cotton, or to see some
   </p>
   <p>
    improvement in machinery, and she brought home beautiful bits of
   </p>
   <p>
    furniture and new pictures for the house, and showed a touching
   </p>
   <p>
    thoughtfulness in remembering Tom's fancies; but somehow he had an
   </p>
   <p>
    uneasy suspicion that she could get along pretty well without him when
   </p>
   <p>
    it came to the deeper wishes and hopes of her life, and that her most
   </p>
   <p>
    important concerns were all matters in which he had no share. He seemed
   </p>
   <p>
    to himself to have merged his life in his wife's; he lost his interest
   </p>
   <p>
    in things outside the house and grounds; he felt himself fast growing
   </p>
   <p>
    rusty and behind the times, and to have somehow missed a good deal in
   </p>
   <p>
    life; he had a suspicion that he was a failure. One day the thought
   </p>
   <p>
    rushed over him that his had been almost exactly the experience of most
   </p>
   <p>
    women, and he wondered if it really was any more disappointing and
   </p>
   <p>
    ignominious to him than it was to women themselves. "Some of them may be
   </p>
   <p>
    contented with it," he said to himself, soberly. "People think women are
   </p>
   <p>
    designed for such careers by nature, but I don't know why I ever made
   </p>
   <p>
    such a fool of myself."
   </p>
   <p>
    Having once seen his situation in life from such a standpoint, he felt
   </p>
   <p>
    it day by day to be more degrading, and he wondered what he should do
   </p>
   <p>
    about it; and once, drawn by a new, strange sympathy, he went to the
   </p>
   <p>
    little family burying ground. It was one of the mild, dim days that come
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes in early November, when the pale sunlight is like the pathetic
   </p>
   <p>
    smile of a sad face, and he sat for a long time on the limp,
   </p>
   <p>
    frost-bitten grass beside his mother's grave.
   </p>
   <p>
    But when he went home in the twilight his step-mother, who just then was
   </p>
   <p>
    making them a little visit, mentioned that she had been looking through
   </p>
   <p>
    some boxes of hers that had been packed long before and stowed away in
   </p>
   <p>
    the garret. "Everything looks very nice up there," she said, in her
   </p>
   <p>
    wheezing voice (which, worse than usual that day, always made him
   </p>
   <p>
    nervous); and added, without any intentional slight to his feelings, "I
   </p>
   <p>
    do think you have always been a most excellent housekeeper."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I'm tired of such nonsense!" he exclaimed, with surprising indignation.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Mary, I wish you to arrange your affairs so that you can leave them for
   </p>
   <p>
    six months at least. I am going to spend this winter in Europe."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Why, Tom, dear!" said his wife, appealingly. "I couldn't leave my
   </p>
   <p>
    business any way in the"--
   </p>
   <p>
    But she caught sight of a look on his usually placid countenance that
   </p>
   <p>
    was something more than decision, and refrained from saying anything
   </p>
   <p>
    more.
   </p>
   <p>
    And three weeks from that day they sailed.
   </p>
   <p>
    Miss Debby's Neighbors
   </p>
   <p>
    There is a class of elderly New England women which is fast dying
   </p>
   <p>
    out:--those good souls who have sprung from a soil full of the true New
   </p>
   <p>
    England instincts; who were used to the old-fashioned ways, and whose
   </p>
   <p>
    minds were stored with quaint country lore and tradition. The fashions
   </p>
   <p>
    of the newer generations do not reach them; they are quite unconscious
   </p>
   <p>
    of the western spirit and enterprise, and belong to the old days, and to
   </p>
   <p>
    a fast-disappearing order of things.
   </p>
   <p>
    But a shrewder person does not exist than the spokeswoman of the
   </p>
   <p>
    following reminiscences, whose simple history can be quickly told, since
   </p>
   <p>
    she spent her early life on a lonely farm, leaving it only once for any
   </p>
   <p>
    length of time,--one winter when she learned her trade of tailoress. She
   </p>
   <p>
    afterward sewed for her neighbors, and enjoyed a famous reputation for
   </p>
   <p>
    her skill; but year by year, as she grew older, there was less to do,
   </p>
   <p>
    and at last, to use her own expression, "Everybody got into the way of
   </p>
   <p>
    buying cheap, ready-made-up clothes, just to save 'em a little trouble,"
   </p>
   <p>
    and she found herself out of business, or nearly so. After her mother's
   </p>
   <p>
    death, and that of her favorite younger brother Jonas, she left the farm
   </p>
   <p>
    and came to a little house in the village, where she lived most
   </p>
   <p>
    comfortably the rest of her life, having a small property which she used
   </p>
   <p>
    most sensibly. She was always ready to render any special service with
   </p>
   <p>
    her needle, and was a most welcome guest in any household, and a most
   </p>
   <p>
    efficient helper. To be in the same room with her for a while was sure
   </p>
   <p>
    to be profitable, and as she grew older she was delighted to recall the
   </p>
   <p>
    people and events of her earlier life, always filling her descriptions
   </p>
   <p>
    with wise reflections and much quaint humor. She always insisted, not
   </p>
   <p>
    without truth, that the railroads were making everybody look and act of
   </p>
   <p>
    a piece, and that the young folks were more alike than people of her own
   </p>
   <p>
    day. It is impossible to give the delightfulness of her talk in any
   </p>
   <p>
    written words, as well as many of its peculiarities, for her way of
   </p>
   <p>
    going round Robin Hood's barn between the beginning of her story and its
   </p>
   <p>
    end can hardly be followed at all, and certainly not in her own dear
   </p>
   <p>
    loitering footsteps.
   </p>
   <p>
    On an idle day her most devoted listener thought there was nothing
   </p>
   <p>
    better worth doing than to watch this good soul at work. A book was held
   </p>
   <p>
    open for the looks of the thing, but presently it was allowed to flutter
   </p>
   <p>
    its leaves and close, for Miss Debby began without any apparent
   </p>
   <p>
    provocation:--
   </p>
   <p>
    "They may say whatever they have a mind to, but they can't persuade me
   </p>
   <p>
    that there's no such thing as special providences," and she twitched her
   </p>
   <p>
    strong linen thread so angrily through the carpet she was sewing, that
   </p>
   <p>
    it snapped and the big needle flew into the air. It had to be found
   </p>
   <p>
    before any further remarks could be made, and the listener also knelt
   </p>
   <p>
    down to search for it. After a while it was discovered clinging to Miss
   </p>
   <p>
    Debby's own dress, and after reharnessing it she went to work again at
   </p>
   <p>
    her long seam. It was always significant of a succession of Miss Debby's
   </p>
   <p>
    opinions when she quoted and berated certain imaginary persons whom she
   </p>
   <p>
    designated as "They," who stood for the opposite side of the question,
   </p>
   <p>
    and who merited usually her deepest scorn and fullest antagonism. Her
   </p>
   <p>
    remarks to these offending parties were always prefaced with "I tell
   </p>
   <p>
    'em," and to the listener's mind "they" always stood rebuked, but not
   </p>
   <p>
    convinced, in spiritual form it may be, but most intense reality; a
   </p>
   <p>
    little group as solemn as Miss Debby herself. Once the listener ventured
   </p>
   <p>
    to ask who "they" were, in her early childhood, but she was only
   </p>
   <p>
    answered by a frown. Miss Debby knew as well as any one the difference
   </p>
   <p>
    between figurative language and a lie. Sometimes they said what was
   </p>
   <p>
    right and proper, and were treated accordingly; but very seldom, and on
   </p>
   <p>
    this occasion it seemed that they had ventured to trifle with sacred
   </p>
   <p>
    things.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I suppose you're too young to remember John Ashby's grandmother? A good
   </p>
   <p>
    woman she was, and she had a dreadful time with her family. They never
   </p>
   <p>
    could keep the peace, and there was always as many as two of them who
   </p>
   <p>
    didn't speak with each other. It seems to come down from generation to
   </p>
   <p>
    generation like a--curse!" And Miss Debby spoke the last word as if
   </p>
   <p>
    she had meant it partly for her thread, which had again knotted and
   </p>
   <p>
    caught, and she snatched the offered scissors without a word, but said
   </p>
   <p>
    peaceably, after a minute or two, that the thread wasn't what it used
   </p>
   <p>
    to be. The next needleful proved more successful, and the listener asked
   </p>
   <p>
    if the Ashbys were getting on comfortably at present.
   </p>
   <p>
    "They always behave as if they thought they needed nothing," was the
   </p>
   <p>
    response. "Not that I mean that they are any ways contented, but they
   </p>
   <p>
    never will give in that other folks holds a candle to 'em. There's one
   </p>
   <p>
    kind of pride that I do hate,--when folks is satisfied with their selves
   </p>
   <p>
    and don't see no need of improvement. I believe in self-respect, but I
   </p>
   <p>
    believe in respecting other folks's rights as much as your own; but it
   </p>
   <p>
    takes an Ashby to ride right over you. I tell 'em it's the spirit of the
   </p>
   <p>
    tyrants of old, and it's the kind of pride that goes before a fall. John
   </p>
   <p>
    Ashby's grandmother was a clever little woman as ever stepped. She came
   </p>
   <p>
    from over Hardwick way, and I think she kep' 'em kind of decent-behaved
   </p>
   <p>
    as long as she was round; but she got wore out a doin' of it, an' went
   </p>
   <p>
    down to her grave in a quick consumption. My mother set up with her the
   </p>
   <p>
    night she died. It was in May, towards the latter part, and an awful
   </p>
   <p>
    rainy night. It was the storm that always comes in apple-blossom time. I
   </p>
   <p>
    remember well that mother come crying home in the morning and told us
   </p>
   <p>
    Mis' Ashby was dead. She brought Marilly with her, that was about my own
   </p>
   <p>
    age, and was taken away within six months afterwards. She pined herself
   </p>
   <p>
    to death for her mother, and when she caught the scarlet fever she went
   </p>
   <p>
    as quick as cherry-bloom when it's just ready to fall and a wind strikes
   </p>
   <p>
    it. She wa'n't like the rest of 'em. She took after her mother's folks
   </p>
   <p>
    altogether.
   </p>
   <p>
    "You know our farm was right next to theirs,--the one Asa Hopper owns
   </p>
   <p>
    now, but he's let it all run out,--and so, as we lived some ways from
   </p>
   <p>
    the stores, we had to be neighborly, for we depended on each other for a
   </p>
   <p>
    good many things. Families in lonesome places get out of one supply and
   </p>
   <p>
    another, and have to borrow until they get a chance to send to the
   </p>
   <p>
    village; or sometimes in a busy season some of the folks would have to
   </p>
   <p>
    leave work and be gone half a day. Land, you don't know nothing about
   </p>
   <p>
    old times, and the life that used to go on about here. You can't step
   </p>
   <p>
    into a house anywheres now that there ain't the county map and they
   </p>
   <p>
    don't fetch out the photograph book; and in every district you'll find
   </p>
   <p>
    all the folks has got the same chromo picture hung up, and all sorts of
   </p>
   <p>
    luxuries and makeshifts o' splendor that would have made the folks I
   </p>
   <p>
    was fetched up by stare their eyes out o' their heads. It was all we
   </p>
   <p>
    could do to keep along then; and if anybody was called rich, it was only
   </p>
   <p>
    because he had a great sight of land,--and then it was drudge, drudge
   </p>
   <p>
    the harder to pay the taxes. There was hardly any ready money; and I
   </p>
   <p>
    recollect well that old Tommy Simms was reputed wealthy, and it was told
   </p>
   <p>
    over fifty times a year that he'd got a solid four thousand dollars in
   </p>
   <p>
    the bank. He strutted round like a turkey-cock, and thought he ought to
   </p>
   <p>
    have his first say about everything that was going.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I was talking about the Ashbys, wasn't I? I do' know's I ever told you
   </p>
   <p>
    about the fight they had after their father died about the old house.
   </p>
   <p>
    Joseph was married to a girl he met in camp-meeting time, who had a
   </p>
   <p>
    little property--two or three hundred dollars--from an old great uncle
   </p>
   <p>
    that she'd been keeping house for; and I don't know what other plans she
   </p>
   <p>
    may have had for spending of her means, but she laid most of it out in a
   </p>
   <p>
    husband; for Joseph never cared any great about her that I could see,
   </p>
   <p>
    though he always treated her well enough. She was a poor ignorant sort
   </p>
   <p>
    of thing, seven years older than he was; but she had a pleasant kind of
   </p>
   <p>
    a face, and seemed like an overgrown girl of six or eight years old. I
   </p>
   <p>
    remember just after they was married Joseph was taken down with a quinsy
   </p>
   <p>
    sore throat,--being always subject to them,--and mother was over in the
   </p>
   <p>
    forenoon, and she was one that was always giving right hand and left,
   </p>
   <p>
    and she told Susan Ellen--that was his wife--to step over in the
   </p>
   <p>
    afternoon and she would give her some blackberry preserve for him; she
   </p>
   <p>
    had some that was nice and it was very healing. So along about half-past
   </p>
   <p>
    one o'clock, just as we had got the kitchen cleared, and mother and I
   </p>
   <p>
    had got out the big wheels to spin a few rolls,--we always liked to spin
   </p>
   <p>
    together, and mother was always good company;--my brother Jonas--that
   </p>
   <p>
    was the youngest of us--looked out of the window, and says he: 'Here
   </p>
   <p>
    comes Joe Ashby's wife with a six-quart pail.'
   </p>
   <p>
    "Mother she began to shake all over with a laugh she tried to swallow
   </p>
   <p>
    down, but I didn't know what it was all about, and in come poor Susan
   </p>
   <p>
    Ellen and lit on the edge of the first chair and set the pail down
   </p>
   <p>
    beside of her. We tried to make her feel welcome, and spoke about
   </p>
   <p>
    everything we could contrive, seein' as it was the first time she'd
   </p>
   <p>
    been over; and she seemed grateful and did the best she could, and lost
   </p>
   <p>
    her strangeness with mother right away, for mother was the best hand to
   </p>
   <p>
    make folks feel to home with her that I ever come across. There ain't
   </p>
   <p>
    many like her now, nor never was, I tell 'em. But there wa'n't nothing
   </p>
   <p>
    said about the six-quart pail, and there it set on the floor, until
   </p>
   <p>
    Susan Ellen said she must be going and mentioned that there was
   </p>
   <p>
    something said about a remedy for Joseph's throat. 'Oh, yes,' says
   </p>
   <p>
    mother, and she brought out the little stone jar she kept the preserve
   </p>
   <p>
    in, and there wa'n't more than the half of it full. Susan Ellen took up
   </p>
   <p>
    the cover off the pail, and I walked off into the bedroom, for I thought
   </p>
   <p>
    I should laugh, certain. Mother put in a big spoonful, and another, and
   </p>
   <p>
    I heard 'em drop, and she went on with one or two more, and then she
   </p>
   <p>
    give up. 'I'd give you the jar and welcome,' she says, 'but I ain't very
   </p>
   <p>
    well off for preserves, and I was kind of counting on this for tea in
   </p>
   <p>
    case my brother's folks are over.' Susan Ellen thanked her, and said
   </p>
   <p>
    Joseph would be obliged, and back she went acrost the pasture. I can see
   </p>
   <p>
    that big tin pail now a-shining in the sun.
   </p>
   <p>
    "The old man was alive then, and he took a great spite against poor
   </p>
   <p>
    Susan Ellen, though he never would if he hadn't been set on by John; and
   </p>
   <p>
    whether he was mad because Joseph had stepped in to so much good money
   </p>
   <p>
    or what, I don't know,--but he twitted him about her, and at last he and
   </p>
   <p>
    the old man between 'em was too much to bear, and Joe fitted up a couple
   </p>
   <p>
    o' rooms for himself in a building he'd put up for a kind of work-shop.
   </p>
   <p>
    He used to carpenter by spells, and he clapboarded it and made it as
   </p>
   <p>
    comfortable as he could, and he ordered John out of it for good and all;
   </p>
   <p>
    but he and Susan Ellen both treated the old sir the best they knew how,
   </p>
   <p>
    and Joseph kept right on with his farm work same as ever, and meant to
   </p>
   <p>
    lay up a little more money to join with his wife's, and push off as soon
   </p>
   <p>
    as he could for the sake of peace, though if there was anybody set by
   </p>
   <p>
    the farm it was Joseph. He was to blame for some things,--I never saw an
   </p>
   <p>
    Ashby that wasn't,--and I dare say he was aggravating. They were
   </p>
   <p>
    clearing a piece of woodland that winter, and the old man was laid up in
   </p>
   <p>
    the house with the rheumatism, off and on, and that made him fractious,
   </p>
   <p>
    and he and John connived together, till one day Joseph and Susan Ellen
   </p>
   <p>
    had taken the sleigh and gone to Freeport Four Corners to get some flour
   </p>
   <p>
    and one thing and another, and to have the horse shod beside, so they
   </p>
   <p>
    was likely to be gone two or three hours. John Jacobs was going by with
   </p>
   <p>
    his oxen, and John Ashby and the old man hailed him, and said they'd
   </p>
   <p>
    give him a dollar if he'd help 'em, and they hitched the two yoke, his
   </p>
   <p>
    and their'n, to Joseph's house. There wa'n't any foundation to speak of,
   </p>
   <p>
    the sills set right on the ground, and he'd banked it up with a few old
   </p>
   <p>
    boards and some pine spills and sand and stuff, just to keep the cold
   </p>
   <p>
    out. There wa'n't but a little snow, and the roads was smooth and icy,
   </p>
   <p>
    and they slipped it along as if it had been a hand-sled, and got it down
   </p>
   <p>
    the road a half a mile or so to the fork of the roads, and left it
   </p>
   <p>
    settin' there right on the heater-piece. Jacobs told afterward that he
   </p>
   <p>
    kind of disliked to do it, but he thought as long as their minds were
   </p>
   <p>
    set, he might as well have the dollar as anybody. He said when the house
   </p>
   <p>
    give a slew on a sideling piece in the road, he heard some of the
   </p>
   <p>
    crockery-ware smash down, and a branch of an oak they passed by caught
   </p>
   <p>
    hold of the stove-pipe that come out through one of the walls, and give
   </p>
   <p>
    that a wrench, but he guessed there wa'n't no great damage. Joseph may
   </p>
   <p>
    have given 'em some provocation before he went away in the morning,--I
   </p>
   <p>
    don't know but he did, and I don't know as he did,--but
   </p>
   <p>
    at any rate when he was coming home late in the afternoon he caught
   </p>
   <p>
    sight of his house (some of our folks was right behind, and they saw
   </p>
   <p>
    him), and he stood right up in the sleigh and shook his fist, he was so
   </p>
   <p>
    mad; but afterwards he bu'st out laughin'. It did look kind of curi's;
   </p>
   <p>
    it wa'n't bigger than a front entry, and it set up so pert right there
   </p>
   <p>
    on the heater-piece, as if he was calc'latin' to farm it. The folks said
   </p>
   <p>
    Susan Ellen covered up her face in her shawl and began to cry. I s'pose
   </p>
   <p>
    the pore thing was discouraged. Joseph was awful mad,--he was kind of
   </p>
   <p>
    laughing and cryin' together. Our folks stopped and asked him if there
   </p>
   <p>
    was anything they could do, and he said no; but Susan Ellen went in to
   </p>
   <p>
    view how things were, and they made up a fire, and then Joe took the
   </p>
   <p>
    horse home, and I guess they had it hot and heavy. Nobody supposed
   </p>
   <p>
    they'd ever make up 'less there was a funeral in the family to bring 'em
   </p>
   <p>
    together, the fight had gone so far,--but 'long in the winter old Mr.
   </p>
   <p>
    Ashby, the boys' father, was taken down with a spell o' sickness, and
   </p>
   <p>
    there wa'n't anybody they could get to come and look after the house.
   </p>
   <p>
    The doctor hunted, and they all hunted, but there didn't seem to be
   </p>
   <p>
    anybody--'twa'n't so thick settled as now, and there was no spare
   </p>
   <p>
    help--so John had to eat humble pie, and go and ask Susan Ellen if she
   </p>
   <p>
    wouldn't come back and let by-gones be by-gones. She was as good-natured
   </p>
   <p>
    a creatur' as ever stepped, and did the best she knew, and she spoke up
   </p>
   <p>
    as pleasant as could be, and said she'd go right off that afternoon and
   </p>
   <p>
    help 'em through.
   </p>
   <p>
    "The old Ashby had been a hard drinker in his day and he was all broke
   </p>
   <p>
    down. Nobody ever saw him that he couldn't walk straight, but he got a
   </p>
   <p>
    crooked disposition out of it, if nothing else. I s'pose there never was
   </p>
   <p>
    a man loved sperit better. They said one year he was over to Cyrus
   </p>
   <p>
    Barker's to help with the haying, and there was a jug o' New England rum
   </p>
   <p>
    over by the spring with some gingerbread and cheese and stuff; and he
   </p>
   <p>
    went over about every half an hour to take something, and along about
   </p>
   <p>
    half-past ten he got the jug middling low, so he went to fill it up with
   </p>
   <p>
    a little water, and lost holt of it and it sunk, and they said he drunk
   </p>
   <p>
    the spring dry three times!
   </p>
   <p>
    "Joe and Susan Ellen stayed there at the old place well into the summer,
   </p>
   <p>
    and then after planting they moved down to the Four Corners where they
   </p>
   <p>
    had bought a nice little place. Joe did well there,--he carried on the
   </p>
   <p>
    carpenter trade, and got smoothed down considerable, being amongst
   </p>
   <p>
    folks. John he married a Pecker girl, and got his match too; she was the
   </p>
   <p>
    only living soul he ever was afraid of. They lived on there a spell
   </p>
   <p>
    and--why, they must have lived there all of fifteen or twenty years, now
   </p>
   <p>
    I come to think of it, for the time they moved was after the railroad
   </p>
   <p>
    was built. 'Twas along in the winter and his wife she got a notion to
   </p>
   <p>
    buy a place down to the Falls below the Corners after the mills got
   </p>
   <p>
    started and have John work in the spinning-room while she took boarders.
   </p>
   <p>
    She said 'twa'n't no use staying on the farm, they couldn't make a
   </p>
   <p>
    living off from it now they'd cut the growth. Joe's folks and she never
   </p>
   <p>
    could get along, and they said she was dreadfully riled up hearing how
   </p>
   <p>
    much Joe was getting in the machine shop.
   </p>
   <p>
    "They needn't tell me about special providences being all moonshine,"
   </p>
   <p>
    said Miss Debby for the second time, "if here wa'n't a plain one, I'll
   </p>
   <p>
    never say one word more about it. You see, that very time Joe Ashby got
   </p>
   <p>
    a splinter in his eye and they were afraid he was going to lose his
   </p>
   <p>
    sight, and he got a notion that he wanted to go back to farming. He
   </p>
   <p>
    always set everything by the old place, and he had a boy growing up that
   </p>
   <p>
    neither took to his book nor to mill work, and he wanted to farm it too.
   </p>
   <p>
    So Joe got hold of John one day when he come in with some wood, and
   </p>
   <p>
    asked him why he wouldn't take his place for a year or two, if he wanted
   </p>
   <p>
    to get to the village, and let him go out to the old place. My brother
   </p>
   <p>
    Jonas was standin' right by and heard 'em and said he never heard nobody
   </p>
   <p>
    speak civiller. But John swore and said he wa'n't going to be caught in
   </p>
   <p>
    no such a trap as that. His father left him the place and he was going
   </p>
   <p>
    to do as he'd a mind to. There'd be'n trouble about the property, for
   </p>
   <p>
    old Mr. Ashby had given Joe some money he had in the bank. Joe had got
   </p>
   <p>
    to be well off, he could have bought most any farm about here, but he
   </p>
   <p>
    wanted the old place 'count of his attachment. He set everything by his
   </p>
   <p>
    mother, spite of her being dead so long. John hadn't done very well
   </p>
   <p>
    spite of his being so sharp, but he let out the best of the farm on
   </p>
   <p>
    shares, and bought a mis'able sham-built little house down close by the
   </p>
   <p>
    mills,--and then some idea or other got into his head to fit that up to
   </p>
   <p>
    let and move it to one side of the lot, and haul down the old house from
   </p>
   <p>
    the farm to live in themselves. There wa'n't no time to lose, else the
   </p>
   <p>
    snow would be gone; so he got a gang o' men up there and put shoes
   </p>
   <p>
    underneath the sills, and then they assembled all the oxen they could
   </p>
   <p>
    call in, and started. Mother was living then, though she'd got to be
   </p>
   <p>
    very feeble, and when they come for our yoke she wouldn't have Jonas let
   </p>
   <p>
    'em go. She said the old house ought to stay in its place. Everybody had
   </p>
   <p>
    been telling John Ashby that the road was too hilly, and besides the
   </p>
   <p>
    house was too old to move, they'd rack it all to pieces dragging it so
   </p>
   <p>
    fur; but he wouldn't listen to no reason.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I never saw mother so stirred up as she was that day, and when she see
   </p>
   <p>
    the old thing a moving she burst right out crying. We could see one end
   </p>
   <p>
    of it looking over the slope of the hill in the pasture between it and
   </p>
   <p>
    our house. There was two windows that looked our way, and I know Mis'
   </p>
   <p>
    Ashby used to hang a piece o' something white out o' one of 'em when she
   </p>
   <p>
    wanted mother to step over for anything. They set a good deal by each
   </p>
   <p>
    other, and Mis' Ashby was a lame woman. I shouldn't ha' thought John
   </p>
   <p>
    would had 'em haul the house right over the little gardin she thought so
   </p>
   <p>
    much of, and broke down the laylocks and flowering currant she set
   </p>
   <p>
    everything by. I remember when she died I wasn't more'n seven or eight
   </p>
   <p>
    year old, it was all in full bloom and mother she broke off a branch and
   </p>
   <p>
    laid into the coffin. I do' know as I've ever seen any since or set in a
   </p>
   <p>
    room and had the sweetness of it blow in at the windows without
   </p>
   <p>
    remembering that day,--'twas the first funeral I ever went to, and that
   </p>
   <p>
    may be some reason. Well, the old house started off and mother watched
   </p>
   <p>
    it as long as she could see it. She was sort o' feeble herself then, as
   </p>
   <p>
    I said, and we went on with the work,--'twas a Saturday, and we was
   </p>
   <p>
    baking and churning and getting things to rights generally. Jonas had
   </p>
   <p>
    been over in the swamp getting out some wood he'd cut earlier in the
   </p>
   <p>
    winter--and along in the afternoon he come in and said he s'posed I
   </p>
   <p>
    wouldn't want to ride down to the Corners so late, and I said I did feel
   </p>
   <p>
    just like it, so we started off. We went the Birch Ridge road, because
   </p>
   <p>
    he wanted to see somebody over that way,--and when we was going home by
   </p>
   <p>
    the straight road, Jonas laughed and said we hadn't seen anything of
   </p>
   <p>
    John Ashby's moving, and he guessed he'd got stuck somewhere. He was
   </p>
   <p>
    glad he hadn't nothing to do with it. We drove along pretty quick, for
   </p>
   <p>
    we were some belated, and we didn't like to leave mother all alone after
   </p>
   <p>
    it come dark. All of a sudden Jonas stood up in the sleigh, and says he,
   </p>
   <p>
    'I don't believe but the cars is off the track;' and I looked and there
   </p>
   <p>
    did seem to be something the matter with 'em. They hadn't been running
   </p>
   <p>
    more than a couple o' years then, and we was prepared for anything.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Jonas he whipped up the horse and we got there pretty quick, and I'll
   </p>
   <p>
    be bound if the Ashby house hadn't got stuck fast right on the track,
   </p>
   <p>
    and stir it one way or another they couldn't. They'd been there since
   </p>
   <p>
    quarter-past one, pulling and hauling,--and the men was all hoarse with
   </p>
   <p>
    yelling, and the cars had come from both ways and met there,--one each
   </p>
   <p>
    side of the crossing,--and the passengers was walking about, scolding
   </p>
   <p>
    and swearing,--and somebody'd gone and lit up a gre't bonfire. You never
   </p>
   <p>
    see such a sight in all your life! I happened to look up at the old
   </p>
   <p>
    house, and there were them two top windows that used to look over to our
   </p>
   <p>
    place, and they had caught the shine of the firelight, and made the poor
   </p>
   <p>
    old thing look as if it was scared to death. The men was banging at it
   </p>
   <p>
    with axes and crowbars, and it was dreadful distressing. You pitied it
   </p>
   <p>
    as if it was a live creatur'. It come from such a quiet place, and
   </p>
   <p>
    always looked kind of comfortable, though so much war had gone on
   </p>
   <p>
    amongst the Ashbys. I tell you it was a judgment on John, for they got
   </p>
   <p>
    it shoved back after a while, and then wouldn't touch it again,--not one
   </p>
   <p>
    of the men,--nor let their oxen. The plastering was all stove, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    outside walls all wrenched apart,--and John never did anything more
   </p>
   <p>
    about it; but let it set there all summer, till it burnt down, and there
   </p>
   <p>
    was an end, one night in September. They supposed some traveling folks
   </p>
   <p>
    slept in it and set it afire, or else some boys did it for fun. I was
   </p>
   <p>
    glad it was out of the way. One day, I know, I was coming by with
   </p>
   <p>
    mother, and she said it made her feel bad to see the little strips of
   </p>
   <p>
    leather by the fore door, where Mis' Ashby had nailed up a rosebush
   </p>
   <p>
    once. There! there ain't an Ashby alive now of the old stock, except
   </p>
   <p>
    young John. Joe's son went off to sea, and I believe he was lost
   </p>
   <p>
    somewhere in the China seas, or else he died of a fever; I seem to
   </p>
   <p>
    forget. He was called a smart boy, but he never could seem to settle
   </p>
   <p>
    down to anything. Sometimes I wonder folks is as good as they be, when I
   </p>
   <p>
    consider what comes to 'em from their folks before 'em, and how they're
   </p>
   <p>
    misshaped by nature. Them Ashbys never was like other folks, and yet
   </p>
   <p>
    some good streak or other there was in every one of 'em. You can't
   </p>
   <p>
    expect much from such hindered creator's,--it's just like beratin' a
   </p>
   <p>
    black and white cat for being a poor mouser. It ain't her fault that the
   </p>
   <p>
    mice see her quicker than they can a gray one. If you get one of them
   </p>
   <p>
    masterful dispositions put with a good strong will towards the right,
   </p>
   <p>
    that's what makes the best of men; but all them Ashbys cared about was
   </p>
   <p>
    to grasp and get, and be cap'ns. They liked to see other folks put down,
   </p>
   <p>
    just as if it was going to set them up. And they didn't know nothing.
   </p>
   <p>
    They make me think of some o' them old marauders that used to hive up
   </p>
   <p>
    into their castles, in old times, and then go out a-over-setting and
   </p>
   <p>
    plundering. And I tell you that same sperit was in 'em. They was born a
   </p>
   <p>
    couple o' hundred years too late. Kind of left-over folks, as it were."
   </p>
   <p>
    And Miss Debby indulged in a quiet chuckle as she bent over her work.
   </p>
   <p>
    "John he got captured by his wife,--she carried too many guns for him. I
   </p>
   <p>
    believe he died very poor and her own son wouldn't support her, so she
   </p>
   <p>
    died over in Freeport poor-house. And Joe got along better; his wife was
   </p>
   <p>
    clever but rather slack, and it took her a good while to see through
   </p>
   <p>
    things. She married again pretty quick after he died. She had as much as
   </p>
   <p>
    seven or eight thousand dollars, and she was taken just as she stood by
   </p>
   <p>
    a roving preacher that was holding meetings here in the winter time. He
   </p>
   <p>
    sold out her place here, and they went up country somewheres that he
   </p>
   <p>
    come from. Her boy was lost before that, so there was nothing to hinder
   </p>
   <p>
    her. There, don't you think I'm always a-fault-finding! When I get hold
   </p>
   <p>
    of the real thing in folks, I stick to 'em,--but there's an awful sight
   </p>
   <p>
    of poor material walking about that ain't worth the ground it steps on.
   </p>
   <p>
    But when I look back a little ways, I can't blame some of 'em; though it
   </p>
   <p>
    does often seem as if people might do better if they only set to work
   </p>
   <p>
    and tried. I must say I always do feel pleased when I think how mad John
   </p>
   <p>
    was,--this John's father,--when he couldn't do just as he'd a mind to
   </p>
   <p>
    with the pore old house. I couldn't help thinking of Joe's mansion, that
   </p>
   <p>
    he and his father hauled down to the heater piece in the fork of the
   </p>
   <p>
    roads. Sometimes I wonder where them Ashbys all went to. They'd mistake
   </p>
   <p>
    one place for the other in the next world, for 'twould make heaven out
   </p>
   <p>
    o' hell, because they could be disagreeing with somebody, and--well, I
   </p>
   <p>
    don't know,--I'm sure they kep' a good row going while they was in this
   </p>
   <p>
    world. Only with mother;--somehow she could get along with anybody, and
   </p>
   <p>
    not always give 'em their way either."
