     CHAPTER I.
    </head>
    <p>
     IN WASHINGTON, APRIL, 1909.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alexander Leacraft was regarding with as much interest as his
    </p>
    <p>
     constitutional lassitude permitted, the progress of a distinctly
    </p>
    <p>
     audible altercation on Pennsylvania avenue, Washington, D. C. The
    </p>
    <p>
     disputants had not felt it necessary, under the relaxing influences
    </p>
    <p>
     of a premature spring, to interpose any screen of secrecy, such as a
    </p>
    <p>
     less exposed position, or subdued voices, between themselves and the
    </p>
    <p>
     news-mongering (and hungering, let it be added) proletariat of our
    </p>
    <p>
     nation’s capital.
    </p>
    <p>
     A small crowd, composed of the singular human compound always
    </p>
    <p>
     pervasive and never to be avoided in Washington, which, in that centre
    </p>
    <p>
     of political sensations, is made up of street loafers, accidental
    </p>
    <p>
     tourists, perambulating babies, “niggers,” and presumptive statesmen,
    </p>
    <p>
     enclosed this “argument”; and from his elevated station, within the
    </p>
    <p>
     front parlor of the McKinley, Mr. Leacraft was afforded a very
    </p>
    <p>
     excellent view of and an equally distinct hearing of the disagreement
    </p>
    <p>
     and its principals.
    </p>
    <p>
     The two disputants were themselves sufficiently contrasted in
    </p>
    <p>
     appearance to have allured the casual passer-by to observe their
    </p>
    <p>
     contrasted methods in debate. One--the taller--was a thin, angular
    </p>
    <p>
     man with unnaturally long arms, a peculiar swaying habit of body, an
    </p>
    <p>
     elongated visage, terminating in a short, stubby growth of whiskers,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a sharp, crackling kind of voice, with unmistakable nasal faults.
    </p>
    <p>
     He seemed to be a southern man modified by a few imitations of the
    </p>
    <p>
     northern type.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was addressing a bulky, rather disdainful man in a checquered
    </p>
    <p>
     suit of clothes, who had advanced the season’s fashion by assuming a
    </p>
    <p>
     straw hat, and whose rosy face, broad and typical features, and yet
    </p>
    <p>
     not plethoric expansion of body, strong and stalwart frame betokened
    </p>
    <p>
     much animal force, and reserved power of action. He might have been a
    </p>
    <p>
     northern man. As Alexander Leacraft looked at them, it was the southern
    </p>
    <p>
     man who was speaking, and his uplifted arm, at regular intervals, rose
    </p>
    <p>
     and fell, as the palms of both hands met in a cadence of corroborative
    </p>
    <p>
     whacks. It may interest the reader to know that the particular time of
    </p>
    <p>
     this particular incident was April, 1909.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me tell you this, Mr. Tompkins,” drawled the southerner with
    </p>
    <p>
     loquacious ease, the crackle and sharpness of his intonation appearing
    </p>
    <p>
     as his excitement increased, “the necessities of our states demand
    </p>
    <p>
     the Canal at whatever cost. It will be the avenue for an export trade
    </p>
    <p>
     to the east, which will convert our stored powers of production into
    </p>
    <p>
     gold, and it will react upon the whole country north and south in a way
    </p>
    <p>
     that will make all previous prosperity look like nothing. Our cotton
    </p>
    <p>
     mills have grown, our mineral resources have been developed; Georgia
    </p>
    <p>
     and Alabama are to-day competing with your shaft furnaces and steel
    </p>
    <p>
     mills for the trade of the railroads, and builders; and for that matter
    </p>
    <p>
     we are building ourselves. We can support a population ten times all
    </p>
    <p>
     we have to-day; our resources have been just broached, but exhaustion
    </p>
    <p>
     is a thousand years away. Our rival has been Cuba. She has robbed us
    </p>
    <p>
     of trade; she has put our sugar plantations out of business; even
    </p>
    <p>
     her iron, which I will admit is superior in quality, has scaled our
    </p>
    <p>
     profits on raw ingots, but she can’t hold us down on cotton. Open up
    </p>
    <p>
     this canal, and we will gather the riches of the Orient; our ships will
    </p>
    <p>
     fill it with unbroken processions, and in the train of that commerce
    </p>
    <p>
     in cotton, every section of the Union will furnish its contribution to
    </p>
    <p>
     swell the argosies of trade. I tell you sir” and the excited speaker,
    </p>
    <p>
     conscious of an admiring sympathy in the crowd around him, raised his
    </p>
    <p>
     voice into a musical shout, in which the crackle was quite lost, “the
    </p>
    <p>
     commerce, the mercantile integrity of these United States will be
    </p>
    <p>
     restored, and American bottoms for American goods will be no longer a
    </p>
    <p>
     vain aspiration; it will be a realized dream, an actual fact.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He paused, as if the projectile force of his words had deprived him of
    </p>
    <p>
     breath, and then at the momentary opportunity Mr. Tompkins, in a clear
    </p>
    <p>
     and metallic voice, with a punctuative force of occasional hesitation,
    </p>
    <p>
     undertook his friend’s refutation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m not contesting the fact, Mr. Snowden,” he said, “that the opening
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Canal means a good deal to your portion of the country. Does it
    </p>
    <p>
     mean as much to the rest of the country, and does it mean so much to
    </p>
    <p>
     you for a long time. You mention cotton. Do you know that the cotton
    </p>
    <p>
     cultivation of India and Egypt has increased enormously, and that it
    </p>
    <p>
     is grown with cheaper labor than you can command. You have made the
    </p>
    <p>
     negro acquainted with his value. You have raised his expectations, you
    </p>
    <p>
     have thrust him into a hundred avenues of occupation and every one of
    </p>
    <p>
     his new avocations adds a shilling a day to the worth per man of the
    </p>
    <p>
     remainder, who stick to field work and cultivate your cotton fields.
    </p>
    <p>
     The cotton of Egypt and the cotton of India, I mean its manufactured
    </p>
    <p>
     forms, will go through that canal to Asia and Japan and Polynesia just
    </p>
    <p>
     as surely as yours will, and it’ll go cheaper. It is poorer cotton, I
    </p>
    <p>
     know, but that will not effect the result.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That isn’t all. Brazil and the Argentine Republic are growing cotton,
    </p>
    <p>
     and they are doing well at it. Europe will take the raw stuff from them
    </p>
    <p>
     and keep up her present predominance in that market while she turns
    </p>
    <p>
     their cotton bolls into satinettes and ginghams for the almond-eyes
    </p>
    <p>
     of Asia. The canal, breaking down a barrier of separation between the
    </p>
    <p>
     two oceans, turns loose into the Pacific the whole frenzied, greedy
    </p>
    <p>
     and capable cohorts of European manufacture. It will make a common
    </p>
    <p>
     highway for Europe, and our unbuilt clippers and tramp steamers will
    </p>
    <p>
     stay unbuilt, or unused, to rot on their ways in the shipyards. The
    </p>
    <p>
     west coast will be sidetracked, and our trunk railroads will cut down
    </p>
    <p>
     their schedules and their dividends at the same time. Roosevelt put
    </p>
    <p>
     this canal through, and your southern votes helped to elect him against
    </p>
    <p>
     his protest, but brought to it by an overwhelming public sentiment that
    </p>
    <p>
     applauded his power to chain or sterilize trusts; and he promised last
    </p>
    <p>
     March to your southern rooters, at his inauguration, to see that before
    </p>
    <p>
     his present new term was over, before 1913, the canal would be opened,
    </p>
    <p>
     and perhaps he’ll make good.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You southerners elected Roosevelt, and you have killed the Democratic
    </p>
    <p>
     party. The new powers of growth of that party were most likely to
    </p>
    <p>
     develop among you, but you shoved aside the proffered offer of
    </p>
    <p>
     political supremacy, because you too had surrendered to the idols
    </p>
    <p>
     of Mammon, and were willing to sell your birth-right for a mess of
    </p>
    <p>
     pottage. Well! You’ve got the canal and you’ve got Roosevelt, and
    </p>
    <p>
     let me tell you Mr. Snowden,” and the restrained, almost nonchalant
    </p>
    <p>
     demeanor of Mr. Tompkins became suddenly charged with electric
    </p>
    <p>
     earnestness, “you’ll get Hell, too.”
    </p>
    <p>
     This admonitory expletive, uttered with a force that seemed to impart
    </p>
    <p>
     to it a physical objectivity, caused the increasing circle of auditors
    </p>
    <p>
     to retreat sensibly, and, without more consideration, giving a glance
    </p>
    <p>
     of mute scorn at the flushed face of the southerner, the speaker
    </p>
    <p>
     pressed his way through the little crowd, which, after a moment’s
    </p>
    <p>
     suspension of judgment, seemed reluctant to let him escape, and
    </p>
    <p>
     disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
     His opponent was distinctly chagrined. The wrinkled lines about his
    </p>
    <p>
     peculiarly pleasant eyes, indicated his strained attention, and were
    </p>
    <p>
     not altogether unrelated to a sudden muscular movement in his clenched
    </p>
    <p>
     hands. His hopes, however, for some sort of forensic gratification
    </p>
    <p>
     might have been sensibly raised as he discovered himself the sole
    </p>
    <p>
     occupant of the small vacant spot on the side walk, walled in by
    </p>
    <p>
     a human investiture, the first line of which was made up of two
    </p>
    <p>
     pickaninnies, three newsboys, one rueful cur and some impromptu mothers
    </p>
    <p>
     who had taken the family babies out for air and recreation, but,
    </p>
    <p>
     overcome by the indigenous love of debate, had forgotten their mission,
    </p>
    <p>
     and held their charges in various attitudes of somnolence or furtive
    </p>
    <p>
     rebellion against the hedge of men behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was evidently expected that the southern gentleman would relieve his
    </p>
    <p>
     feelings, and it was also evident from a few ejaculations hap-hazardly
    </p>
    <p>
     emitted from the concourse, that the majority of those present was in
    </p>
    <p>
     his favor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Snowden looked around him reflectively, and a sense of personal
    </p>
    <p>
     dignity forced its way against the almost over-powering impulse to
    </p>
    <p>
     appeal to popular approval, and convinced him that the place and the
    </p>
    <p>
     audience were inopportune for any further discussion. He could not,
    </p>
    <p>
     however, escape the demonstrated force of popular expectancy, and, with
    </p>
    <p>
     a consenting smile, a shrug of his shoulders, and with his hat raised
    </p>
    <p>
     above his head, swinging gently, he called out “Three cheers for Teddy
    </p>
    <p>
     and the Canal.”
    </p>
    <p>
     In an instant the group seized the invitation, and under the cover,
    </p>
    <p>
     if it may be so violently symbolized, of the cloud of vocality, his
    </p>
    <p>
     enthusiasm evoked, Mr. Snowden, like the fortuitous and directive
    </p>
    <p>
     deities of the epics, vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
     There remained an unsatisfied group to which more accessions were
    </p>
    <p>
     quickly made, the whole movement evidently animated by some emotion
    </p>
    <p>
     then predominant in the national capital. This group broke up into
    </p>
    <p>
     little knots of talkers, and as the day was closing, no urgency of
    </p>
    <p>
     business engagements and no immediate insistency of domestic duties
    </p>
    <p>
     interfered with the easily elicited Washingtonian tendency to settle,
    </p>
    <p>
     on the public curb, the vexed questions of state, if not to enlighten
    </p>
    <p>
     Providence on the more abstruse functions of His authority.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alexander Leacraft willingly surrendered himself to the study of this
    </p>
    <p>
     representative public _Althing_, and felt his exasperating torpor so
    </p>
    <p>
     much overcome by a new curiosity as to make him not averse to stepping
    </p>
    <p>
     out into the hall of the hotel, descending the steps into the street,
    </p>
    <p>
     and engaging himself in the capacity of a rotational listener at the
    </p>
    <p>
     various groups, sometimes not exceeding two men, who had become vocally
    </p>
    <p>
     animated, and felt themselves called upon to supply the deficiency of
    </p>
    <p>
     objurgation, so disagreeably emphasized by the sudden departure of the
    </p>
    <p>
     northern and southern disputants.
    </p>
    <p>
     The illuminative results of his ambulatory inspection, and his own
    </p>
    <p>
     expostulations or inquiry, may be thus succinctly summarized.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Theodore Roosevelt, elected in his own behalf in 1905, as president
    </p>
    <p>
     of the United States, after having served out the unexpired term of
    </p>
    <p>
     William McKinley, who was assassinated in November, 1901, and with
    </p>
    <p>
     whom he had been elected as vice president, had been again re-elected
    </p>
    <p>
     in the fall of 1908, against his emphatic rejection, at first, of
    </p>
    <p>
     a joint nomination of the Republican and Democratic parties. The
    </p>
    <p>
     campaign, if campaign it could be called, had been one of the most
    </p>
    <p>
     extraordinary ever recorded, and in its features of popular clamor,
    </p>
    <p>
     the grotesque conflict of the personal repugnance of an unwilling
    </p>
    <p>
     candidate nominated against his will, and in defiance of his own
    </p>
    <p>
     repeated inhibitions to nominate him at all, because of his solemn
    </p>
    <p>
     promise that he would defer to the unwritten law of the country, and
    </p>
    <p>
     not serve a third term, was altogether unprecedented, and to some
    </p>
    <p>
     observers ominous. He was reminded that his first term, although
    </p>
    <p>
     practically four years, was still only an accident, that there was no
    </p>
    <p>
     subversion of the unwritten law, in his serving again, as his actual
    </p>
    <p>
     election as president had occurred but once, that his popularity among
    </p>
    <p>
     the people was of such an intense, almost self-devouring ardor, that it
    </p>
    <p>
     was an act of suicidal negation, of unpatriotic desertion to shun or
    </p>
    <p>
     reject the people’s obvious need, that a war, yet unfinished, had been
    </p>
    <p>
     begun by him against corporate interests, that its logical continuance
    </p>
    <p>
     devolved upon him, that the unique occasion of a unanimous nomination
    </p>
    <p>
     to the presidency carried with it a sublime primacy of interest, that
    </p>
    <p>
     cancelled all previous conditions, promises or wishes on his part,
    </p>
    <p>
     and laid an imperious command upon its subject that deprived him of
    </p>
    <p>
     volition, and absolutely dissolved into nothingness any apparent
    </p>
    <p>
     contradiction of his words and acts. Finally, it was insisted that the
    </p>
    <p>
     Panama Canal was nearing completion, that its remarkable advance was
    </p>
    <p>
     due to Mr. Roosevelt that this fact had been prepotent in shaping the
    </p>
    <p>
     councils of southern Democrats in proposing the, otherwise unwarranted,
    </p>
    <p>
     endorsement of a Republican nomination, that a strong minority
    </p>
    <p>
     sentiment had crystallized around an angry group of capitalists who
    </p>
    <p>
     were only too anxious to get rid of Roosevelt altogether, and that in
    </p>
    <p>
     the case of his refusal, these men would so manipulate the newspapers,
    </p>
    <p>
     and inflame public apprehension, against some possible outbreak of
    </p>
    <p>
     social radicalism, financial heresy, and anarchistic violence, that
    </p>
    <p>
     a reaction begun would become unmanageable, and some tool of the
    </p>
    <p>
     reactionaries, and the railroads, would be swept into office, and with
    </p>
    <p>
     him a servile Congress, and Roosevelt’s work, so aggressively and
    </p>
    <p>
     successfully prosecuted, would be all sacrificed. Nor was this all. The
    </p>
    <p>
     return to a divided nomination, with an unmistakable intention on the
    </p>
    <p>
     part of the conservatists to repeal all disadvantageous legislation to
    </p>
    <p>
     the monopolies, corporations and trusts, would at once precipitate a
    </p>
    <p>
     conflict of classes.
    </p>
    <p>
     A radical man, possibly a demagogue, would be placed in opposition to
    </p>
    <p>
     the choice of the plutocracy. His election was also not improbable.
    </p>
    <p>
     The powers of socialism, enormously strengthened by the adhesion of an
    </p>
    <p>
     educated class, might be triumphant, and the succeeding steps in social
    </p>
    <p>
     revolution would bring chaos.
    </p>
    <p>
     This dilemma was so pertinaciously displayed, so forcibly accentuated,
    </p>
    <p>
     that Roosevelt had yielded at the last moment, not insensibly affected
    </p>
    <p>
     (as what spirited man would not be) by the magnificent assemblies (mass
    </p>
    <p>
     meetings) throughout the country, tumultuously vociferating the call of
    </p>
    <p>
     the people.
    </p>
    <p>
     The southern people, with characteristic warmth, and through the
    </p>
    <p>
     suddenly consummated attachment of Senator Tillman to Roosevelt, and
    </p>
    <p>
     under the coercion of Senator Bailey’s logic and power of argumentative
    </p>
    <p>
     persuasion, had swelled the tide of popular approval. Roosevelt
    </p>
    <p>
     became an idol--his election was almost unanimous, a handful only of
    </p>
    <p>
     contestants having gathered in a kind of moral protest around Governor
    </p>
    <p>
     Hughes as a rival candidate. Governor Hughes’ nomination was achieved
    </p>
    <p>
     through a combination of opposite political interests, as anomalous as
    </p>
    <p>
     that which chose Roosevelt, and having precisely the same quality of
    </p>
    <p>
     coherence.
    </p>
    <p>
     It represented dissatisfied Republicans, an alienable remnant of
    </p>
    <p>
     Democrats, and had drawn into it a few sporadic political elements that
    </p>
    <p>
     barely sufficed to give it numerical significance. W. J. Bryan, who
    </p>
    <p>
     would have been otherwise a candidate himself, had endorsed Roosevelt,
    </p>
    <p>
     furnishing thereby an example of political abnegation which had
    </p>
    <p>
     enormously increased his popularity, and assured him the nomination
    </p>
    <p>
     of Nationalists, as the new fusionists were called, in 1913. This was
    </p>
    <p>
     also deemed a wise forethought, as a provision against the possible
    </p>
    <p>
     success of the rampant Hearstites. Hearst would have been the socialist
    </p>
    <p>
     candidate in the last campaign, had not the principal himself, on
    </p>
    <p>
     hearing of Roosevelt’s nomination, sapiently withdrawn, fearing defeat,
    </p>
    <p>
     which would have too seriously discredited him in the next national
    </p>
    <p>
     struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Prohibitionists had, by an act of virtual self-repudiation, thrown
    </p>
    <p>
     their not inconsiderable vote to Roosevelt. The Socialists were the
    </p>
    <p>
     only important opponents of his election, and their surprising record
    </p>
    <p>
     made the prophetic warnings, which had convinced Roosevelt of the
    </p>
    <p>
     necessity of his candidacy, appear like a veritable intervention of
    </p>
    <p>
     Providence, at least this was the language commonly used with reference
    </p>
    <p>
     to it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Roosevelt had displayed remarkable self-control and consistent gravity,
    </p>
    <p>
     and had even, in a very extraordinary address at his inauguration,
    </p>
    <p>
     deprecated the unanimity of his election. He deplored the precarious
    </p>
    <p>
     dilemma of a country which found itself forced to do violence to its
    </p>
    <p>
     traditions in order to escape an imagined danger.
    </p>
    <p>
     Almost synchronous with his re-election, the announcement had been made
    </p>
    <p>
     that the Panama Canal, upon which the President in his former term, had
    </p>
    <p>
     exerted the utmost pressure of his inexhaustible enthusiasm, energy
    </p>
    <p>
     and exhortation, was advancing very rapidly, engineering difficulties
    </p>
    <p>
     unexpectedly had vanished, a system of extreme precision in the
    </p>
    <p>
     control of the work, itself largely the device of the President, had
    </p>
    <p>
     facilitated the entire operation, and a promise of still more rapid
    </p>
    <p>
     progress was made.
    </p>
    <p>
     This promise had produced a storm of southern enthusiasm. The south,
    </p>
    <p>
     completely restored in its financial autonomy, had been growing richer
    </p>
    <p>
     and richer, and their public men had not hesitated to paint, in the
    </p>
    <p>
     brightest colors, the further expansion of their prosperity with the
    </p>
    <p>
     opening of this avenue of commerce between the oceans, assuring its
    </p>
    <p>
     people the markets of Asia, and their rapid promotion to the political,
    </p>
    <p>
     social and financial primacy in the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
     Northern capitalists had not been incredulous to these predictions, and
    </p>
    <p>
     in a group of railroad magnates, whose interests seemed now seriously
    </p>
    <p>
     threatened, a sullen resentment was maintained against Roosevelt,
    </p>
    <p>
     in which the unmistakable notes of designs almost criminal had been
    </p>
    <p>
     detected. Mr. Tompkins, whose altercation with the southerner had led
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft into this voyage of interpellation and discovery, was a paid
    </p>
    <p>
     agent, in the employ of this cabal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alexander Leacraft was an Englishman, inheriting an English temperament
    </p>
    <p>
     without English prejudices; he was fortunately free from the worst
    </p>
    <p>
     faults of that insular hesitancy which imparts the curious impression
    </p>
    <p>
     of timidity, and had advanced far enough in cosmopolitan observation to
    </p>
    <p>
     get rid of the queerness of provincial ignorance. He was indeed a sane
    </p>
    <p>
     and attractive man, and provided by nature with a forcible physique,
    </p>
    <p>
     a good face, and a really fascinating proclivity to make the best of
    </p>
    <p>
     things, admire his companions, and bend unremittingly to the pressure
    </p>
    <p>
     of his environment.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had not escaped the dangers incident to youth, and his heart had
    </p>
    <p>
     become attached to a lady of Baltimore--one of the undeviatingly arch
    </p>
    <p>
     and winning American girls--to whom he had been introduced by her
    </p>
    <p>
     brother, a commercial correspondent.
    </p>
    <p>
     The nature of his affairs--he was the secretary of an English company
    </p>
    <p>
     which operated some copper mines in Arizona and Canada--had made him a
    </p>
    <p>
     frequent visitor to the shores of the New World, and he had not been
    </p>
    <p>
     unwilling to express his hope that the United States would become his
    </p>
    <p>
     final home. These sentiments were quite honest, though it might have
    </p>
    <p>
     elicited the cynical observation that the capture of his affections by
    </p>
    <p>
     Miss Garrett had done more to weaken his loyalty to the crown than
    </p>
    <p>
     any dispassionate admiration of a Republican form of government. But
    </p>
    <p>
     the imputation would have been malicious. Leacraft did feel an earnest
    </p>
    <p>
     admiration for the American people, and yielded a genial acquiescence
    </p>
    <p>
     to the claims of popular suffrage. His connexion with America had been
    </p>
    <p>
     fortunate, and he had come in contact with men and women whose natures
    </p>
    <p>
     by endowment, and whose manners and habits, conversation and tastes, by
    </p>
    <p>
     inheritance and cultivation, were elevating and engaging--men and women
    </p>
    <p>
     whose nobility of sympathy with all things human was reflected in an
    </p>
    <p>
     art of living not only always decorous and refined, but guided, too, by
    </p>
    <p>
     the principles of urbanity and justice.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Garretts of Baltimore were a widely connected, and in numbers an
    </p>
    <p>
     imposing social element, and none of the various daughters of light
    </p>
    <p>
     and loveliness who bore that name more merited consideration in the
    </p>
    <p>
     eyes of manly youth than the capricious, captivating and elusive Sally.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her graces of manner were not less delightful than her conversation
    </p>
    <p>
     was spirited and roguish, and her assumption of a demure simplicity
    </p>
    <p>
     had often driven Alexander Leacraft to the limits of his English
    </p>
    <p>
     matter-of-fact credulity in explaining to her the relations of the King
    </p>
    <p>
     to Parliament, or the municipal acreage of the old City of London.
    </p>
    <p>
     All of which information this very well read and much travelled
    </p>
    <p>
     young woman, as might be expected, was possessed of, but just for the
    </p>
    <p>
     purposes of her feminine and cruel fancy, not too well disposed towards
    </p>
    <p>
     her patient suitor, disingenuously concealed. Sally really enjoyed
    </p>
    <p>
     the painstaking gravity with which the young Englishman explained the
    </p>
    <p>
     eternal principles of English rule, and the never-to-be-forgotten
    </p>
    <p>
     superiorities of London.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Leacraft had met Sally under circumstances the most provocative of
    </p>
    <p>
     admiration. In her own home; where the sincerity of hospitality and the
    </p>
    <p>
     urgency of an American’s deference to the best instincts of courtesy,
    </p>
    <p>
     did not altogether mitigate her coquetry and mirthful affectations,
    </p>
    <p>
     and even, by the faintest gloss of repression, made them the more
    </p>
    <p>
     delicious. The Englishman was bewitched, and his infatuation declared
    </p>
    <p>
     itself so plainly that Sally--whose heart was quite untouched by his
    </p>
    <p>
     distress--tried the resources of her ingenuity to avoid meeting him
    </p>
    <p>
     alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft, on the morrow of the day, whose close had so deeply inducted
    </p>
    <p>
     him into a study of American politics, expected to make a deferred
    </p>
    <p>
     visit to the Garretts at Baltimore, and he had quite firmly resolved
    </p>
    <p>
     that he would reveal his desperate extremity to Sally, and plead his
    </p>
    <p>
     best to show her how empty life would be to him without her, and that
    </p>
    <p>
     it would be shockingly obdurate in her to decline to regard him as the
    </p>
    <p>
     goal of her marital ambitions.
    </p>
    <p>
     He felt some fear of her revolting gayety, and his fears were not
    </p>
    <p>
     assuaged by the remembrance of any particular occasion when her conduct
    </p>
    <p>
     towards him permitted him to indulge in hopes. Still the thing must
    </p>
    <p>
     be done. His unrest must be quieted. To know the worst was better
    </p>
    <p>
     than this feverish anxiety of doubt. And besides, with a prudence not
    </p>
    <p>
     altogether British, he thought he could endure repulse better now than
    </p>
    <p>
     later, and in the event of that evil alternative, he could cast about
    </p>
    <p>
     him for alleviating resources which might be more easily found now,
    </p>
    <p>
     than if he waited longer, and if he continued to expose himself to the
    </p>
    <p>
     perilous encounter of her eyes, and the tantalizing caresses of her wit.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Leacraft returned to the hotel, he found a letter waiting for him,
    </p>
    <p>
     which he saw at once was from his friend, Ned Garrett. He tore it open
    </p>
    <p>
     and discovered, to his considerable discomfiture, that it postponed the
    </p>
    <p>
     event of his momentous proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
     It read:
    </p>
    <p>
     Dear Leacraft:
    </p>
    <p>
     Aunt Sophia is very sick at Litchfield, Conn. Mother and Sally have
    </p>
    <p>
     gone on. Can you put off your visit until May, say the 28th? You will
    </p>
    <p>
     find it dull here without Sally and Mother. I shall go with them as
    </p>
    <p>
     far as New York. We all intend, if Aunt Sophy concludes to remain in
    </p>
    <p>
     this bright world a little longer, and the Dr. endorses her good
    </p>
    <p>
     intentions, to visit Gettysburg on Memorial Day (Decoration old style).
    </p>
    <p>
     The President will deliver a memorial oration. Come with us and see the
    </p>
    <p>
     great battlefield, which is a wonderful monument to the nation’s dead,
    </p>
    <p>
     a beautiful picture itself, and probably you will see and hear things
    </p>
    <p>
     worth remembering besides. Write to the house, and I will get your
    </p>
    <p>
     letter when I return in two weeks. But do come.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yours sincerely,
    </p>
    <p>
     Edward T. Garrett.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft put down the letter slowly. He was disappointed. A summons to
    </p>
    <p>
     the west, to the mines in Arizona, had reached him just the day before,
    </p>
    <p>
     and he must get out there before a week was over. He had thought to
    </p>
    <p>
     have finished this affair first, and to find in the tiresome trip
    </p>
    <p>
     distraction, if Sally was unfavorable to his appeal, or unexpected
    </p>
    <p>
     interest if he succeeded in winning her assent. Still he could readily
    </p>
    <p>
     accept the invitation. He would be back in May, and, perhaps after all
    </p>
    <p>
     the occasion might be more favorable. Sally softened into a little
    </p>
    <p>
     sympathetic humor by her visit to her sick aunt, and he strengthened
    </p>
    <p>
     by the encouraging reflexion of having successfully dissipated the
    </p>
    <p>
     little cloud of misunderstanding, or worse, at the mines, might produce
    </p>
    <p>
     conditions psychologically adequate to bring about his victory.
    </p>
    <p>
     He stepped to the window. The view from it was always pleasing, at
    </p>
    <p>
     this moment in the descending shades of the closing day and with the
    </p>
    <p>
     vanishing lights hurrying westward beyond the Potomac, it possessed
    </p>
    <p>
     an ineffable loveliness. The great white spectre of the Washington
    </p>
    <p>
     monument, immaterialized and faintly roseate against the softly flaming
    </p>
    <p>
     skies, and brooding genius-like above the trees of the Reservation was
    </p>
    <p>
     always there, and that night it assumed the strangely deceptive but
    </p>
    <p>
     fascinating vagary of an exhalation, as if built up from the emanations
    </p>
    <p>
     of the earth, and the vapors of the air, remaining immobile in the
    </p>
    <p>
     still ether as a portent or a promise. The man’s face grew clouded as
    </p>
    <p>
     the fairy obelisk faded, and with the enveloping darkness became again
    </p>
    <p>
     discernible as a dull and stony pile.
    </p>
    <p>
     That evening Leacraft felt particularly restless and detached. He
    </p>
    <p>
     felt the need of entertainment, and of entertainment of a sort that
    </p>
    <p>
     would fix his faculty of thought, awaken speculation, and immerse him
    </p>
    <p>
     in reasonings and the intricacies of argument. The few theatrical
    </p>
    <p>
     bills presented no attractions more weighty than a clever comedian
    </p>
    <p>
     in a musical farce, a sensational melodrama (“much better,” said
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft), and vaudeville. Music was shunned; there was nothing quite
    </p>
    <p>
     serious offered, and then music has so many painful influences on the
    </p>
    <p>
     apprehensive mind, and is turned to such cruel uses in the economy of
    </p>
    <p>
     nature, for making uneasy lovers more agitated. No! he didn’t wish
    </p>
    <p>
     music. Baffled for an instant, he concluded to walk. Muscular exercise,
    </p>
    <p>
     mere translation on one’s legs, is a marvellous remedy for the
    </p>
    <p>
     diabolical blues, and then it can never be told what the Unseen holds
    </p>
    <p>
     for you, if you only go out to meet It in the streets, and amongst
    </p>
    <p>
     other people, hunting, perhaps, like yourself, diversion from their own
    </p>
    <p>
     inscrutable megrims. It--the Unseen--may quite divertingly mix you up
    </p>
    <p>
     in a comedy or a tragedy, or consolingly give you a glimpse of other
    </p>
    <p>
     human miseries immeasurably greater than your own.
    </p>
    <p>
     So walk it was. He had hardly covered two blocks towards the White
    </p>
    <p>
     House, when he met Dr. M--, the most amiable and accomplished editor
    </p>
    <p>
     of the National Museum, and one of those multi-facetted gentlemen
    </p>
    <p>
     who respond to every scientific thrill around them, and hold in the
    </p>
    <p>
     myriad piled up cells of their cerebral cortex the knowledge, selected,
    </p>
    <p>
     labelled and accessible, of the world. Leacraft knew the Doctor; had
    </p>
    <p>
     indeed consulted him upon a chemical reaction, in the elimination of
    </p>
    <p>
     cadmium from zinc. The Doctor, with genial fervor, grasped his hand,
    </p>
    <p>
     persuasively put his own disengaged hand on Leacraft’s back, and
    </p>
    <p>
     dexterously turned him around with the observation: “You are going the
    </p>
    <p>
     wrong way. Binn reads a paper to-night before the Geographical Society,
    </p>
    <p>
     over at the Museum, on a live subject. It’s about earthquakes and
    </p>
    <p>
     the Panama Canal. The matter has a good deal of present interest. The
    </p>
    <p>
     President may be there. It’s worth your while. Come along.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft jumped with pleasure, if an Englishman may be said ever
    </p>
    <p>
     to respond so animatedly to a welcome alternative. This met his
    </p>
    <p>
     requirements exactly. He would, in these surroundings and under the
    </p>
    <p>
     stimulation of an intellectual effort, in listening to a lecture
    </p>
    <p>
     which he hoped might possess literary merit as well, quite forget his
    </p>
    <p>
     immediate solicitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It is curious,” resumed Dr. M--, as they directed their steps
    </p>
    <p>
     towards the umbrageous solitudes of the Reservation, “how inevitably
    </p>
    <p>
     many practical questions demand an answer at the hand of geology or
    </p>
    <p>
     physiography, which are however never consulted, and disaster follows.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the spring of 1906 a destructive outbreak of Vesuvius occurred,
    </p>
    <p>
     and much of the ensuing loss of life might have been prevented by
    </p>
    <p>
     reliance upon scientific warnings. Indeed, the loss of life on this
    </p>
    <p>
     last occasion of the volcano’s activity was greatly reduced through
    </p>
    <p>
     the premonitions of its approach by delicate instruments. For that
    </p>
    <p>
     matter, from the beginning, the vulcanologist, at least as soon as
    </p>
    <p>
     such a being was a more or less completed phenomenon in our scientific
    </p>
    <p>
     life, would have pointed out the considerable risk of living on the
    </p>
    <p>
     flanks of that querulous protuberance. But it can hardly be expected,
    </p>
    <p>
     I suppose, that large populations can effect a change in habitation as
    </p>
    <p>
     long as the dangers that threaten them occur at long intervals, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     human fatality of unreasoning trust in luck remains unchanged. Take
    </p>
    <p>
     for instance the case of the village of Torre del Greco, four and a
    </p>
    <p>
     half miles from the foot of Vesuvius. It has been overwhelmed seventeen
    </p>
    <p>
     times, but the inhabitants, the survivors, return after each extinction
    </p>
    <p>
     to renew their futile invocations for another chance.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I suppose,” queried Leacraft, “that we are to be informed to-night
    </p>
    <p>
     whether the Canal from the scientific point of view is a safe
    </p>
    <p>
     investment?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Perhaps,” doubtfully returned the doctor. “You see, it’s this way. In
    </p>
    <p>
     the spring of the year that saw the outpouring of lava that invaded
    </p>
    <p>
     the villages of southern Italy, San Francisco suffered from a serious
    </p>
    <p>
     earthquake that ruptured the public structures of the city, dislocated
    </p>
    <p>
     miles of railroad tracks, ruined the beautiful Stanford University,
    </p>
    <p>
     shook out the fronts of buildings, and precipitated a fire that all
    </p>
    <p>
     but wiped out the Queen City of the Pacific coast. It has been feared
    </p>
    <p>
     that some such seismic terror might demolish the superb structures of
    </p>
    <p>
     the canal, and we are to learn to-night whether these earth movements
    </p>
    <p>
     threaten the new waterway at the isthmus.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have reason to believe,” rejoined Leacraft, “that this canal has
    </p>
    <p>
     been itself a source of political disturbance, and that it is likely
    </p>
    <p>
     to effect convulsions in your body politic as dangerous in a social way
    </p>
    <p>
     as those which brought about the financial and physical upset at San
    </p>
    <p>
     Francisco.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t worry on that score,” replied his companion. “I can tell you
    </p>
    <p>
     that the political texture of this country is not to be worn to a
    </p>
    <p>
     frazzle by any collision of interests. Such things adjust themselves,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the way out only means a new entrance to brighter prospects and
    </p>
    <p>
     bigger undertakings. Yes, I guess someone will be hurt, but individuals
    </p>
    <p>
     don’t count if the whole people are benefited.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Still,” remonstrated Leacraft, “the people is made up of individuals,
    </p>
    <p>
     and it’s simply a fact that you can’t disturb the equilibrium of one
    </p>
    <p>
     part of society without jostling the rest.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “In a way, yes,” slowly answered the doctor. “But it is quite clear to
    </p>
    <p>
     my mind that the enormous advantages of the canal will hide from sight
    </p>
    <p>
     the losses that may be inflicted on the railroads, in the dislocation
    </p>
    <p>
     of rates, and even that will be temporary, as the new business raises
    </p>
    <p>
     our population, and their passenger traffic touches higher and higher
    </p>
    <p>
     averages.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “The canal has been an expensive enterprise,” suggested Leacraft.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It would be a great misfortune if it brought any kind of material
    </p>
    <p>
     reverses.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rubbish,” retorted the doctor; “this prating is the madness or the
    </p>
    <p>
     envy of croakers and cranks. Do you think that a connexion between the
    </p>
    <p>
     oceans that will shorten the route from one to the other by nearly
    </p>
    <p>
     6,000 miles, and bring our eastern seaboard, with all its tremendous
    </p>
    <p>
     agencies of production within reach of a continent that is slowly
    </p>
    <p>
     becoming itself occidentalized, and demanding every day the equipment
    </p>
    <p>
     of the west, is a mercantile delusion? We are all gainers. It is a
    </p>
    <p>
     scheme of mutualization on a world-wide scale, but America distributes
    </p>
    <p>
     the profits and holds the surplus.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The two friends by this time had reached the entrance of the Museum,
    </p>
    <p>
     and passing through its symbolic portals, turned to the left, and found
    </p>
    <p>
     themselves in a dull room, portentously charged with an exhaustive
    </p>
    <p>
     exhibit of the commerce of all nations. Here, on tables and shelves,
    </p>
    <p>
     was displayed a wonderful assortment of primitive and modern ships,
    </p>
    <p>
     primeval dugouts, Philippine catamarans, Mediterranean pirogues,
    </p>
    <p>
     sloops, schooners, brigs, brigantines, barques, barkentines, luggers,
    </p>
    <p>
     lighters, caravals, Dutch monstrosities, models of those extraordinary
    </p>
    <p>
     ships which Motley has described as “built up like a tower, both
    </p>
    <p>
     at stem and stern, and presenting in their broad, bulbous prows
    </p>
    <p>
     their width of beam in proportion to their length, their depression
    </p>
    <p>
     amidships, and in other sins against symmetry, as much opposition to
    </p>
    <p>
     progress over the waves as could well be imagined,” the Latin trireme
    </p>
    <p>
     and the Greek trireme, the ironclads of France used in 1855, the
    </p>
    <p>
     monitors of the Civil War, the recent wonders in battleships, torpedo
    </p>
    <p>
     boats, and destroyers, with naphtha launches, submarine wonders, the
    </p>
    <p>
     old time American cutters, and models of the stately packets that
    </p>
    <p>
     once made the trip from New York to Portsmouth in fourteen days,
    </p>
    <p>
     with a various and diversified exhibit of yachts and pleasure boats,
    </p>
    <p>
     all burnished, japanned and varnished, and now dimly lustrous in the
    </p>
    <p>
     futile illumination of the room. Above them on the walls was a prolix
    </p>
    <p>
     illustration of the hydrography of the world; charts of currents,
    </p>
    <p>
     pelagic streams, areas of calms, submarine basins, maps of rainfalls,
    </p>
    <p>
     prevalent winds, storm regions, precipitation, barometric maxima and
    </p>
    <p>
     minima, and then still higher up on the walls, that dispensed knowledge
    </p>
    <p>
     over each square inch of their dusty and dusky surfaces, Leacraft
    </p>
    <p>
     descried the tabulations of tonnage of the merchant marine of the
    </p>
    <p>
     nations of the earth, with fabulous figures of imports and exports, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the staple products of this prolific and motherly old earth, caressed
    </p>
    <p>
     into fructification by the tireless arms of her scrambling broods of
    </p>
    <p>
     children.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft was soon deserted by the doctor, who found occasion to wander
    </p>
    <p>
     among the slowly arriving scientific gentry and politely inquire after
    </p>
    <p>
     the health of the particular scientific offspring, whose tottering
    </p>
    <p>
     footsteps each one was engaged in nurturing into a more reliant
    </p>
    <p>
     attitude before the world. Leacraft found the dim room, with its
    </p>
    <p>
     preoccupied occupants vacantly settling into the seats around him, and
    </p>
    <p>
     its motley array of picturesque models strangely congenial. It soothed,
    </p>
    <p>
     by the abrupt strangeness of its contents, the subdued intellectual
    </p>
    <p>
     placidity of the audience, and by its mere physical retirement from
    </p>
    <p>
     the outer bustle of the streets, and the iterative commonplaces of
    </p>
    <p>
     the hotel corridor. The exact process of subduction would have been
    </p>
    <p>
     hard keenly to analyze, but Leacraft seemed to forget his personal
    </p>
    <p>
     disquietude, and develop into a congenital oneness with these earnest
    </p>
    <p>
     men and women around him, eager to know, and not too patient towards
    </p>
    <p>
     sophistry or pretension. He hardly cared to know who was who. It made
    </p>
    <p>
     no matter. They all seemed freed from the petty vanities of living, and
    </p>
    <p>
     now engrossed in the triumphant tasks of thought; and he felt himself
    </p>
    <p>
     elevated into a kind of mental abstraction which eagerly carried on its
    </p>
    <p>
     functions in an atmosphere of ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
     And yet how was it, that just above the little desk which was to
    </p>
    <p>
     receive the honorable burden of the lecturer’s manuscript, he suddenly
    </p>
    <p>
     distinctly saw the fair face, with its light blue eyes, its delicate
    </p>
    <p>
     blush of color, and the slightly mocking pout of the lips of Sally,
    </p>
    <p>
     the beloved. Leacraft almost rose upright in his astonishment at the
    </p>
    <p>
     impossible hallucination. He was leaning forward, half incredulous
    </p>
    <p>
     of the report of his own senses, and half subjected by a delicious
    </p>
    <p>
     whim that the apparition was an augury of success, when a commotion
    </p>
    <p>
     spreading on all sides of him roused his attention, and the vision
    </p>
    <p>
     fled. He would have willingly had it stay. People were rising in his
    </p>
    <p>
     vicinity, and soon the assembly was on its feet. Some one had entered
    </p>
    <p>
     who was the cause of this unusual excitement. “The President” came
    </p>
    <p>
     to his ears, murmured by a dozen persons near him, and he had hardly
    </p>
    <p>
     sprung to his own feet when, with many salutations, a strongly formed,
    </p>
    <p>
     rather bulky man, with a manner of almost nervous scrutiny passed
    </p>
    <p>
     by him moving down the aisle to the front. It was indeed President
    </p>
    <p>
     Roosevelt, and Leacraft, now startled into the most active interest,
    </p>
    <p>
     slipped forward a seat or two, to gain a position which might afford
    </p>
    <p>
     him a better view of this remarkable person. The audience remained
    </p>
    <p>
     standing until the President, escorted by a tall red-whiskered
    </p>
    <p>
     gentleman, whom Doctor M--, who had just turned up in search of his
    </p>
    <p>
     friend, whispered was Dr. George O. Smith, the distinguished Director
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Survey, had reached a seat reserved for him at the front of the
    </p>
    <p>
     hall.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft now observed more closely the character of the convocation,
    </p>
    <p>
     and realized its composite and representative elements. Dr. M--,
    </p>
    <p>
     always himself immersed in the study of the lives, achievements and
    </p>
    <p>
     distinctions of the prominent men of the country, was an enthusiastic
    </p>
    <p>
     verbal _cicerone_ through the maze of faces which seemed suddenly to
    </p>
    <p>
     have condensed into a really crowded audience. Here was Dr. D--, the
    </p>
    <p>
     Alaskan explorer in the early days of the nineteenth century, the
    </p>
    <p>
     world recognized authority on the tertiary fossils of the east and
    </p>
    <p>
     west coasts, and a man of erudition and delightful literary skill.
    </p>
    <p>
     Beyond him sat Dr. M--, a quiet-faced man, curator of the National
    </p>
    <p>
     Museum, author of text books, and gifted with a singularly shrewd
    </p>
    <p>
     thoughtfulness. At his side sat the sphinx-featured F--, of Chicago,
    </p>
    <p>
     a gentle-minded scholar, to whom the Heavens had entrusted the
    </p>
    <p>
     secrets of their meteoritic denizens, and who, by a more fortunate
    </p>
    <p>
     circumstance, held a pen of consummate grace. Again at his side was the
    </p>
    <p>
     Jupiter-browed Ward, an erratic over the face of the globe, possessed
    </p>
    <p>
     with a transcendant enthusiasm for the same celestial visitors that
    </p>
    <p>
     F-- described, and chasing them with the zeal of a lynx in their most
    </p>
    <p>
     inaccessible quarries; a man of immense conviviality, and controlling
    </p>
    <p>
     the smouldering fires of a temper that defied reason or resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the front of the rows of chairs, and not far from the cynosure
    </p>
    <p>
     of all eyes--the President--were two notable students of the past
    </p>
    <p>
     life of the globe, Professors O-- and S--, men whose studies in that
    </p>
    <p>
     amazing storehouse of extinct life which the West held sealed in its
    </p>
    <p>
     clays and marls, limestones and sandstones, had continued on higher
    </p>
    <p>
     and more certain levels the work of Marsh and Leidy and Cope, and who
    </p>
    <p>
     had transcribed before the whole world, in monuments of scientific
    </p>
    <p>
     precision, the most startling confessions of the fossil dead. To one
    </p>
    <p>
     side, on the same row, sat Prof. B--, known in two continents, for
    </p>
    <p>
     chemical learning, especially on that side of chemistry which mingles
    </p>
    <p>
     insensibly with the laws of matter. And whispering in his ear, with
    </p>
    <p>
     sundry emphatic nods, sat, next to him, Dr. R--, of Washington, learned
    </p>
    <p>
     in the ways of men’s digestion, and the enigmas of food and the arts of
    </p>
    <p>
     food-makers. In the row behind, the expressive head of Young, aureoled
    </p>
    <p>
     with years and honors, was seen, and at his side the face of Newcomb,
    </p>
    <p>
     who had set the seal of his genius and industry across the patterned
    </p>
    <p>
     stars. Here was A-- H--, the geologist, reticent and receptive, there
    </p>
    <p>
     C--, weighted with new responsibilities in furnishing time to the
    </p>
    <p>
     rapacious biologist, and in discovering new ways of making this old
    </p>
    <p>
     world. Behind them sat M--, wise beyond belief in bric-a-brac and
    </p>
    <p>
     brachiopods, vindictively assertive, and self-sacrificingly tender and
    </p>
    <p>
     kind. There was McG-- and I--, W--, A--, V--, and B-- W--, bringing
    </p>
    <p>
     to the speaker the homage of archæology, of petrology, of zoology,
    </p>
    <p>
     and morphology. In a group of motionless and eager attention were
    </p>
    <p>
     A--, the sage metereologist, beloved in two continents; B--, abstruse
    </p>
    <p>
     and difficult, meditative, as a man might be who kept his hand on
    </p>
    <p>
     the pulses of matter, and B--, skillful in weighing the atoms of the
    </p>
    <p>
     air, or probing the volcanoes of the moon. In one line, mingling in
    </p>
    <p>
     conversation that reached Leacraft’s ears as a strange jargon of
    </p>
    <p>
     conflicting sciences, were G--, H-- and H--k. And beyond them, mute,
    </p>
    <p>
     as if by mutual repulsion, sat F--, the agile scrutinizer of Nature’s
    </p>
    <p>
     crystals; P--, holding in his labyrinthine memory the names of half a
    </p>
    <p>
     universe of shells, and B--n, to whom each plant of the wayside bowed
    </p>
    <p>
     in recognition of a master’s knowledge of itself. Against the wall, in
    </p>
    <p>
     a triad of sympathy, was A--, the surgeon; S--, the neurologist, and
    </p>
    <p>
     R--. And alone, in an isolation that belied his intense geniality, was
    </p>
    <p>
     K--.
    </p>
    <p>
     And through all the scientific congeries, which were far more extended
    </p>
    <p>
     than Leacraft could recognize, or even Dr. M-- recall, was a more
    </p>
    <p>
     garrulous grouping of politicians, statesmen, diplomats, ministers, the
    </p>
    <p>
     well dressed circles of the rich, and the dillettantes, drawn to this
    </p>
    <p>
     unusual assemblage by the presence of the President.
    </p>
    <p>
     The quiet and dull room, faded, and with contents tiresomely drilled
    </p>
    <p>
     into the exact alignments of a museum hall, took on an almost brilliant
    </p>
    <p>
     appearance. The fancy amused itself with the thought that it too felt,
    </p>
    <p>
     in its stagnated life, the unique occasion, and shook itself into a
    </p>
    <p>
     momentary wakefulness, to note and record its distinguished guests,
    </p>
    <p>
     that its streaked walls tried to hide their unseemly rents, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     multiplied models and charts struggled to look recent and familiar and
    </p>
    <p>
     appreciative, amid such intellectual tumult.
    </p>
    <p>
     But now the audience was forgotten at that theatrical moment when
    </p>
    <p>
     the chairman and the lecturer advanced over the platform to assume
    </p>
    <p>
     the directive guidance of the evening. They did advance with that
    </p>
    <p>
     curious _gaucherie_ which somehow always disables the scientific man
    </p>
    <p>
     in his official and public utterances, and seems, by some trick of
    </p>
    <p>
     compensation, the more unredeemable as the unfortunate victim of its
    </p>
    <p>
     cynical attachment is the more distinguished and renowned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dr. S-- stepped gingerly forward, a tall, effective man with hair
    </p>
    <p>
     hardly sanguine in color, and quite conventional in arrangement, with
    </p>
    <p>
     a cerebral development, that somehow disappointingly dwarfed the lower
    </p>
    <p>
     contours of his face, domed and broad as it was, with much scholarly
    </p>
    <p>
     promise. He was followed by the speaker of the evening, Mr. Binn,
    </p>
    <p>
     who seemed half inclined to screen himself from observation behind
    </p>
    <p>
     the utterly inadequate profile of the famous Director. The two men
    </p>
    <p>
     momentarily catching the full assault of the numerous eyes, each pair
    </p>
    <p>
     among them being the visible battery of a questioning and critical mind
    </p>
    <p>
     behind it, underwent an obvious confusion of intention and movement,
    </p>
    <p>
     and became somewhat mixed up with the table and chairs, and with each
    </p>
    <p>
     other. The Director extricated himself, came forward to the edge of the
    </p>
    <p>
     platform, and in a voice of half propitiatory jocularity, introduced
    </p>
    <p>
     the subject, and the speaker. He alluded to the favorable conjunction
    </p>
    <p>
     of the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of
    </p>
    <p>
     Science and that of the National Academy of Science, which brought
    </p>
    <p>
     so many eminent thinkers and observers together, and administered an
    </p>
    <p>
     especial emphasis to the question to be considered this evening. He
    </p>
    <p>
     mentioned, with a deferential bow in the direction of the President,
    </p>
    <p>
     that they had all been deeply honored by the presence of the Chief
    </p>
    <p>
     Executive of the Nation, to whom perhaps, more than to anyone else
    </p>
    <p>
     in the brilliant audience, the grave question of the structural and
    </p>
    <p>
     geological stability of the Isthmus of Darien, was one of overshadowing
    </p>
    <p>
     interest, and he congratulated everyone that the subject was in
    </p>
    <p>
     the hand “of one whose geological fame was beyond dispute, and his
    </p>
    <p>
     carefulness of statement unimpeached,” and the Director sat down,
    </p>
    <p>
     pulling off to one side of the stage, lest his own refulgence might dim
    </p>
    <p>
     the legitimate monopoly of that article by Dr. Binn. Leacraft observed
    </p>
    <p>
     that as the lecturer unrolled his manuscript on the reading desk, the
    </p>
    <p>
     President leaned outward, adjusted his eyeglasses, and scrutinized the
    </p>
    <p>
     geologist, who, from a rather embarrassed fumbling with his sheets,
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed conscious of the inquisition. A moment later, as if satisfied
    </p>
    <p>
     with his inspection, the President leaned back, bulky and immobile, and
    </p>
    <p>
     became an absorbed listener.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Binn, well known for his lithological studies, and the possession
    </p>
    <p>
     of a good style, in the scientific sense, was a short man, evincing,
    </p>
    <p>
     under control, however, the peptic influences of years, with a face
    </p>
    <p>
     of decided legibility, in which sense and penetration seemed equally
    </p>
    <p>
     indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had provided himself with charts, which had been distended in an
    </p>
    <p>
     irregular line above his head, and to these he occasionally referred.
    </p>
    <p>
     His reading of the important pages before him was clear and audible,
    </p>
    <p>
     but totally neglectful, of the informing appliances in elocution, of
    </p>
    <p>
     melody of voice, accent and deliberation. The lecture was brilliant and
    </p>
    <p>
     distinguished, and quite comparable in its qualities to the serious
    </p>
    <p>
     people who had gathered in great intellectual force to receive its
    </p>
    <p>
     instructions.

     THE LECTURE.
    </p>
    <p>
     Note.--If the reader is too much interested in getting to
    </p>
    <p>
     the upshot of this tale, let him skip the Lecture. But it
    </p>
    <p>
     is a mistake. This Lecture was delivered by Mr. Binn on the
    </p>
    <p>
     Ninth of April, 1909, and is well worth while.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mr. President, Dr. Smith and Ladies and Gentlemen,” began the speaker;
    </p>
    <p>
     “The area of the Panama Isthmus and the West Indies has been an area
    </p>
    <p>
     of successional changes very considerable in their amount, very
    </p>
    <p>
     persistent in their frequency. It embraces a tropical area contiguous
    </p>
    <p>
     on its Pacific side to a meridional section of the earth which is very
    </p>
    <p>
     unstable, and which almost monopolizes the contemporaneous volcanic
    </p>
    <p>
     energy of the earth. It adjoins, or is limited itself on the east, in
    </p>
    <p>
     the Atlantic, by the Antillean islets, the emergent crests of submerged
    </p>
    <p>
     volcanic vents. It could be presumptively held, on these grounds, that
    </p>
    <p>
     the Isthmus itself partook of these characters of inequilibrated
    </p>
    <p>
     crustal motions. It might be affirmed, with a fair amount of precision,
    </p>
    <p>
     that its future history would continue this impression.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The West Indies, as defined by Hill, embracing the islands that with
    </p>
    <p>
     Cuba form a long convexity terminating in Trinidad, on the coast of S.
    </p>
    <p>
     America, represent to-day a disintegrated continent. They are supposed
    </p>
    <p>
     to have embodied a former geographical unity. It had terrestrial
    </p>
    <p>
     magnitude, and lay Atlantis-like between South America and North
    </p>
    <p>
     America, at a time when the present narrow neck of land upon which our
    </p>
    <p>
     eyes are now, as a nation, fixed with anxious preoccupation, was itself
    </p>
    <p>
     swept over by the confluent waters of the two oceans, and when at that
    </p>
    <p>
     point which now forms an attenuated avenue of intercourse between North
    </p>
    <p>
     and South America, the tides of a broad water way alternated in their
    </p>
    <p>
     allegiance to the East or West coasts of the separated continents; and
    </p>
    <p>
     possibly a precarious and fluctuating contribution from the warm Gulf
    </p>
    <p>
     Stream found its way into the Pacific.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The discussion of this question opens up for our consideration the
    </p>
    <p>
     examination of the geological structure of these oscillating terranes,
    </p>
    <p>
     as to what these are made up of, and it is evident that we must reach
    </p>
    <p>
     some general conclusion as to the succession of the strata composing
    </p>
    <p>
     them, and their relative positions to each other, as whether they are,
    </p>
    <p>
     in the language of stratigraphy, conformable or unconformable. The
    </p>
    <p>
     inference and argument are simple. If we find that the rocks composing
    </p>
    <p>
     these sections are crystalline, ancient, and deeply bedded formations,
    </p>
    <p>
     presumably coexistent, so to speak, with the original or very early
    </p>
    <p>
     formative beds of the world, and referable to its beginnings, we are
    </p>
    <p>
     permitted, by all the analogies of induction and deduction, to assume
    </p>
    <p>
     that these rocks have at least a relative stability. On the other hand
    </p>
    <p>
     if our examination reveals the fact that they are recent deposits, more
    </p>
    <p>
     or less unconsolidated, easily disturbed in their positions, easily
    </p>
    <p>
     readjusted in their molecular or physical structure, then by the most
    </p>
    <p>
     unexceptional and matter-of-fact observation, we shall regard them as
    </p>
    <p>
     questionably permanent, indeed as unmistakably non-resistant to the
    </p>
    <p>
     subterranean forces of terrestrial mutation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Again it is clear that a pile of bricks, or of any other superimposed
    </p>
    <p>
     building blocks is the more secure, in its equilibrium, if the
    </p>
    <p>
     component parts overlie each other, along the broadest surfaces, and
    </p>
    <p>
     come in contact, or _fit_, as we say, in parallel position. If these
    </p>
    <p>
     bricks succeed each other in lines of brick that are flat, and then
    </p>
    <p>
     in lines that are vertical, or placed on their thinnest and narrowest
    </p>
    <p>
     edges, and these two contrasted positions alternate, or are irregularly
    </p>
    <p>
     disposed with reference to each other in the same wall, such a
    </p>
    <p>
     construction implies, involves, elements of weakness, and under the
    </p>
    <p>
     shock of any incident force would succumb in ruin more quickly, and
    </p>
    <p>
     more irretrievably than the former. If further, the latter building
    </p>
    <p>
     style had suffered ruptures and dislocations and the gaps or openings
    </p>
    <p>
     and broken surfaces of contact between its parts had been invaded
    </p>
    <p>
     or replaced by an irregular or incongruous assortment of ‘filling,’
    </p>
    <p>
     differing from the original bricks in substance, texture and hardness,
    </p>
    <p>
     then we have a third pattern of composition that again is weaker than
    </p>
    <p>
     either of its predecessors. But further. If this least massive and
    </p>
    <p>
     most vulnerable type of structure has been subjected to repeated and
    </p>
    <p>
     considerable strains of elevation and depression, and strains recurrent
    </p>
    <p>
     at short intervals, then, without inspection, we know that its interior
    </p>
    <p>
     coherence has been much shattered, and that it has undergone a
    </p>
    <p>
     progressive dilapidation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But I am constrained to go one step farther in this hypothetical
    </p>
    <p>
     picture of structural defectiveness. To return to our wall of brick. It
    </p>
    <p>
     can be made up of bricks laid upon each other in consecutive tiers; it
    </p>
    <p>
     can be made up of tilted tiers of bricks, bricks laid on each other,
    </p>
    <p>
     but inclined to a horizontal plane, and finally it is conceivable that
    </p>
    <p>
     the bricks may be so arranged as to be inverted in their relations
    </p>
    <p>
     to the horizontal plane. The diagrams make clear these contrasted
    </p>
    <p>
     positions.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now of all these types of structures the last obviously best meets
    </p>
    <p>
     the requirements of a type which will prove the least susceptible
    </p>
    <p>
     to dislocation. I think that can be apprehended almost without
    </p>
    <p>
     explanation. A moment’s reflexion will make it conspicuous.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The bricks tilted up in inclined tiers or beds, upon disturbance, if
    </p>
    <p>
     the cohesion between them is seriously impaired, tend to fall away
    </p>
    <p>
     from each other, and gravity increases the effects of the initial
    </p>
    <p>
     displacement. If the bricks lie flat they do not fall apart, upon the
    </p>
    <p>
     cessation of any push or upheaval, but remain disordered, falling back
    </p>
    <p>
     into some _quasi_-position of rest. If the bricks are inverted and form
    </p>
    <p>
     in section a series of lines converging to the base of the wall, their
    </p>
    <p>
     disarrangement is largely rectified by their own gravity, bringing them
    </p>
    <p>
     back into their first positions.
    </p>
    <p>
     “In Geology strata overlying each other, in succession, as the bricks
    </p>
    <p>
     do when on their flat faces are called _conformable_, if they succeed,
    </p>
    <p>
     one over the other, with the edges or summits of the lower, abutting
    </p>
    <p>
     against the horizontal surfaces of the next, as do the bricks when they
    </p>
    <p>
     are placed in flat and vertical positions, in alternating strips, that
    </p>
    <p>
     is _unconformability_.
    </p>
    <p>
     “If the strata are usually horizontal like the evenly piled series of
    </p>
    <p>
     bricks, they are called _undisturbed_; if inclined against each other,
    </p>
    <p>
     they are _inclined_, and they may make _monoclinals_, having one
    </p>
    <p>
     slope, or _anti-clinals_ when they lean up against each other like the
    </p>
    <p>
     opposite sides of a peaked roof; _or synclinal_ when inclined towards
    </p>
    <p>
     each other in an inverted position like the same roof overturned, with
    </p>
    <p>
     its ridge pole on the ground, and its inclined sides lifted into the
    </p>
    <p>
     air, or like the bricks in the last pattern of structure described.
    </p>
    <p>
     “When we carry these similes into nature, we have all kinds of rocks,
    </p>
    <p>
     and we have them in mountains, in planes, and all the familiar
    </p>
    <p>
     configuration of the earth’s surface.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now we find that those portions of the earth immediately beneath
    </p>
    <p>
     our feet, extending for a mile or so into the surface of the earth,
    </p>
    <p>
     are variously made up of layers, strata, beds, formations, lying on
    </p>
    <p>
     one another, and _conformable_ or _unconformable_, _undisturbed_ or
    </p>
    <p>
     thrown into anticlinal or synclinal folds; that the material in its
    </p>
    <p>
     general mineral character, is limestone, marls, or sands and sandstone,
    </p>
    <p>
     slates, clays, metamorphic rocks like gneiss and quartzite, etc., and
    </p>
    <p>
     associated with them are granites which may have been melted lava-like
    </p>
    <p>
     rock before it cooled and crystallized, while there is plentiful
    </p>
    <p>
     evidence of abundant outflows of igneous, melted or viscid rocks;
    </p>
    <p>
     evidences of lines of eruption, of foci, or craters of eruption. Thus,
    </p>
    <p>
     as in the brick structure, where unrelated and later material has been
    </p>
    <p>
     introduced in fissures, gaps, openings, holes, etc., of the walls,
    </p>
    <p>
     we have some of the architecture of the earth, an original bedded
    </p>
    <p>
     structure invaded by very contrasted substances, and which give to that
    </p>
    <p>
     architecture, as in the brick wall of our homely illustration, lack of
    </p>
    <p>
     homogeneity, and lack of strength.
    </p>
    <p>
     “In the West Indies and on the Isthmus of Panama we have the states of
    </p>
    <p>
     instability which we have signalized, viz., secondary deposits of a
    </p>
    <p>
     somewhat loose and unconsolidated material, and wanting in the deeply
    </p>
    <p>
     bedded crystalline rocks which in New England, in the Adirondacks, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the Piedmont or higher regions abutting on the coastal plain in the
    </p>
    <p>
     northern United States, furnish a solid, and probably fundamentally
    </p>
    <p>
     deep seated pediment of resistance to shock. Again in the West Indies
    </p>
    <p>
     and in the Isthmus, we have the beds _unconformable_ over each
    </p>
    <p>
     other, which you will recall in our symbol of the brick wall, was a
    </p>
    <p>
     feature of weakness; also these unconformable beds are inclined in
    </p>
    <p>
     _anti-clinals_, a further aspect of structural insolvency; and further
    </p>
    <p>
     these beds have been widely, pervasively, in places, infiltrated and
    </p>
    <p>
     ruptured by subsequent introductions of volcanic substance, ashes,
    </p>
    <p>
     lavas and intrusive magmas. Thus the geological aggregates present the
    </p>
    <p>
     previously illustrated condition of fragility, and the absence of the
    </p>
    <p>
     so-called tectonic elements of rigidity. But still one step more in our
    </p>
    <p>
     disheartening study of this equatorial problem.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I, a few moments past, called your attention to the fact that ‘if this
    </p>
    <p>
     least massive and most vulnerable type of structure has been subjected
    </p>
    <p>
     to repeated and considerable strains of elevation and depression, and
    </p>
    <p>
     strains recurrent at short intervals, then, without inspection, we know
    </p>
    <p>
     that its interior has been much shattered, and that it has undergone a
    </p>
    <p>
     progressive dilapidation.’
    </p>
    <p>
     “Precisely such catastrophes are discovered in the history of the
    </p>
    <p>
     geological region now before us. The islands of the West Indies
    </p>
    <p>
     have been subjected to great changes of elevation. They have risen
    </p>
    <p>
     and fallen during the last geological age--the Tertiary--perhaps
    </p>
    <p>
     four times. In their rise they have gathered to themselves marginal
    </p>
    <p>
     extensions of land, now hidden beneath the ocean at comparatively
    </p>
    <p>
     slight depths, while they have at the same time doubtless become
    </p>
    <p>
     blended and unified into a great Antillean continent. This continent
    </p>
    <p>
     was dominated by volcanic protuberances whose growth upward, over
    </p>
    <p>
     accumulations of ashes, has been again symptomatic of undermining
    </p>
    <p>
     operations threatening later subsidence and submergence.
    </p>
    <p>
     “In our day we have been called on to deplore the ravages caused by the
    </p>
    <p>
     eruptions of Mt. Pelee and La Soufriere, on the Islands of Martinique
    </p>
    <p>
     and St. Vincent, and it is natural to insist that regions which have
    </p>
    <p>
     a precarious autonomy, in which such volcanoes can exist, must be
    </p>
    <p>
     regarded with diffidence, as permanent geographical areas.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It was pointed out by Prof. Robert T. Hill that the current, and
    </p>
    <p>
     formerly undisputed, conception that the Rocky Mountains of North
    </p>
    <p>
     America and the Andes of South America were not only analogous
    </p>
    <p>
     physiographically, but univalent in fact; that the continuous elevation
    </p>
    <p>
     of Central America brought them into an oblique alignment; and that
    </p>
    <p>
     their mutual prolongations met in the Isthmus of Panama, was erroneous.
    </p>
    <p>
     It involved a complete misconception. It was a geographical fallacy,
    </p>
    <p>
     and leads to misleading conclusions as to the permanency of this
    </p>
    <p>
     intermedian region, itself pre-eminently individualized and liberated
    </p>
    <p>
     from the circumstances and implications of either the Rocky Mountain
    </p>
    <p>
     Continent or the Andean Continent. This area has a different geological
    </p>
    <p>
     ancestry. To-day it invokes an especial treatment, and possibly expects
    </p>
    <p>
     a future, contrasted with that of the two great Continents whose
    </p>
    <p>
     longitudinal extension it contravenes by its east and west lines, by
    </p>
    <p>
     the prerogatives of a separate origin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The Rocky Mountains terminate in the plateau of Mexico, ‘a little
    </p>
    <p>
     south,’ says Hill, ‘of the capital of that republic; and that the
    </p>
    <p>
     mountains have no orographic continuity, or other features in common
    </p>
    <p>
     with those of the Central American region.’
    </p>
    <p>
     “And the same authority, describing the terminus of the Andes,
    </p>
    <p>
     says, ‘The northern end of the Andean System lies entirely east of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Central American region, and is separated from it by the Rio
    </p>
    <p>
     Atrato--the most western of the great Rivers of Columbia. In fact, the
    </p>
    <p>
     deeply eroded drainage valley of this stream nearly severs the Pacific
    </p>
    <p>
     coast from the republic of Columbia, and the isthmian region, from the
    </p>
    <p>
     South American continent.’
    </p>
    <p>
     “The Central American volcanoes belong to the type that is repeated
    </p>
    <p>
     along the Caribbean shores of Colombia and Venezuela, and those in the
    </p>
    <p>
     Isthmus of Panama, and those of the great Antilles. The genesis of this
    </p>
    <p>
     American Mediterranean land-aggregate was in an independent geological
    </p>
    <p>
     impulse, and the land aggregate itself impinged by intersection upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the dominant land surfaces of North and South America. To bring
    </p>
    <p>
     together North and South America as a simultaneous geological phenomena
    </p>
    <p>
     is wrong, to make them other than an accidental geographical continuity
    </p>
    <p>
     questionable. It is this intermediate zone--the Antillean continent
    </p>
    <p>
     with lateral elongations, grasping within its continental solidarity
    </p>
    <p>
     the parallel zones of Central America and the Isthmus, that gives them
    </p>
    <p>
     terrestrial unity. Extend the axis of the Rocky Mountains, and it
    </p>
    <p>
     passes almost two thousand miles west of the coast of South America;
    </p>
    <p>
     extend the axis of the Andes and it bisects the western extremity of
    </p>
    <p>
     Cuba, and passes along the seaboard of the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
     “There is no exact geological identity here, although there is the
    </p>
    <p>
     strictest geographical homology. Each is the backbone of a continent,
    </p>
    <p>
     each upheaved and variously modified, igneously invaded sediments,
    </p>
    <p>
     derived from some pre-existent continent. They may be brought into a
    </p>
    <p>
     just comparison, but they are not strictly parts of one phenomenon.
    </p>
    <p>
     They are, however, more closely related to each other, than the
    </p>
    <p>
     Antillean areas are to either. This Antillean area, I shall here call
    </p>
    <p>
     the Columbian Continent, as the great discoverer landed at its two east
    </p>
    <p>
     and west extremities--the land-fall on San Salvador in the Bermudas,
    </p>
    <p>
     and on the coast of Honduras in Central America, as well as at Cuba,
    </p>
    <p>
     and at the mouths of the Orinoco--and his bones rested for a long
    </p>
    <p>
     time in the soil of San Domingo. It--this Columbean Continent--is a
    </p>
    <p>
     significant intercalation. It unites North and South America, but it
    </p>
    <p>
     unites them subject to the phases of its own generation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let us understand this. There is a system of growth, a law, if I may
    </p>
    <p>
     so term it, of geomorphic sameness in the development of large, or
    </p>
    <p>
     for that matter, small geological territories. The familiar story of
    </p>
    <p>
     the growth of our North American continent has been often told. It is
    </p>
    <p>
     a commonplace of text books. The wide, triangular Archæan nucleus to
    </p>
    <p>
     the north, the oldest rocks--outlines and outliers down the east,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the same in the west--drew the framing limits of the continent at
    </p>
    <p>
     the first, to be filled in, up and out, by the momentous additions
    </p>
    <p>
     through the ages of advancing time. In Europe less well or simply
    </p>
    <p>
     defined boundaries, the growth together rather of divided islands,
    </p>
    <p>
     prevailed, and the picture of development was quite varied, from the
    </p>
    <p>
     picture in this western world. Again in Africa, with edges of uplift
    </p>
    <p>
     and centres of depression another geological tale with its incidents
    </p>
    <p>
     and accessories infinitely modified, comes into view. And in this
    </p>
    <p>
     prevalence of structural style, we, geologically speaking, find a
    </p>
    <p>
     prevalence of certain geological phases or conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What were these in the growth and disappearance of this Columbian
    </p>
    <p>
     continent? What they have been, we can, with rational probability,
    </p>
    <p>
     assume they will be.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The Columbian continent, I have called a dismembered, a fractionized
    </p>
    <p>
     continent. If from Cuba through Haiti, Porto Rico, and the lesser
    </p>
    <p>
     Antilles one land surface obtained, and the now submerged and
    </p>
    <p>
     radiating gorges, found only as submarine canyons, were above the
    </p>
    <p>
     ocean, becoming, as Prof. Spencer has laboriously proven, sub-aerial
    </p>
    <p>
     river valleys, we should have one presumable phase of this continent,
    </p>
    <p>
     the phase of its maximum cohesion and extension. And such a phase is
    </p>
    <p>
     measurably or, for purposes of argumentative inference, sensibly
    </p>
    <p>
     established. It is said with careful premeditation by Hill that ‘the
    </p>
    <p>
     numerous islets of its eastern border, the Bahamas and Windward chain,
    </p>
    <p>
     which extend from Florida to the mouth of the Orinoco, are merely the
    </p>
    <p>
     summits of steep submarine ridges, which divide the depths of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Atlantic from those of the Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean sea; were
    </p>
    <p>
     their waters a few feet lower, these ridges would completely landlock
    </p>
    <p>
     the seas from the ocean.’
    </p>
    <p>
     “When thus constituted, it afforded a display of physical features of
    </p>
    <p>
     astonishing contrasts, and its mere scenic resources were doubtless of
    </p>
    <p>
     unparalleled splendor, and, as to-day, it was involved in the luxuriant
    </p>
    <p>
     productivity of the tropics. Its mountains measuring now as high as
    </p>
    <p>
     eleven thousand feet above the sea level, were then thrust upward
    </p>
    <p>
     into stupendous peaks, by the addition of the sloping miles which are
    </p>
    <p>
     now below the ocean. We can imagine the extreme wonderfulness of this
    </p>
    <p>
     continent, uniting in an unbroken but marvellously varied expression
    </p>
    <p>
     of physical and vegetable contrast, the plains, valleys, and mountains
    </p>
    <p>
     of Cuba, the towering and draped peaks of Jamaica, the confusion of
    </p>
    <p>
     the gloomy vales and ranges of Hayti and San Domingo, the levels and
    </p>
    <p>
     coastal ranges of Porto Rico, and the manifold picturesque charms
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Lesser Antilles, lifting high into the ceaseless currents
    </p>
    <p>
     of the trade winds the smoking summits of a chain of disturbed
    </p>
    <p>
     volcanoes. All, in the boundless abundance of its natural endowment
    </p>
    <p>
     of loveliness, and productivity, formed an unique and extravagantly
    </p>
    <p>
     ornamented landscape, an area whose highest elevations contemplated
    </p>
    <p>
     the remote waters of the shrunk Atlantic, from pinnacles raised ten
    </p>
    <p>
     to twenty thousand feet above its azure waves. Nor is this all. This
    </p>
    <p>
     hypothetical--the Columbian--continent, may have had connexions with
    </p>
    <p>
     Central America through projecting and peninsulated capes, reaching
    </p>
    <p>
     through Jamaica to Yucatan or Honduras, and wide intervals of dividing
    </p>
    <p>
     gulfs of water, in all probability sundered it from North or South
    </p>
    <p>
     America, and it remained, as I here emphatically insist, it remains
    </p>
    <p>
     to-day, a geographical and geological phenomenon, unrelated to the
    </p>
    <p>
     great continents, to which through their preponderating value, the mind
    </p>
    <p>
     almost unpremeditatingly assigns it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But at the period of this greatest elevation, when this tropical
    </p>
    <p>
     region assumed individual independence, and embodied a geognostic
    </p>
    <p>
     importance comparable to the vast continents it lay between--at this
    </p>
    <p>
     time--the Isthmus of Panama did not exist, and through a wide water-way
    </p>
    <p>
     the Atlantic mingled its tides with those of the Pacific.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We are thus led to believe that as between the West Indian terranes
    </p>
    <p>
     and the neck of land now embraced in the Isthmus of Panama, we have a
    </p>
    <p>
     relation of _Isostacy_.’”
    </p>
    <p>
     The speaker, armed with this formidable verbal equipment of attack upon
    </p>
    <p>
     his audience, had walked to the front of the platform, and, harboring
    </p>
    <p>
     some unusual confidence in his powers, had deserted his manuscript.
    </p>
    <p>
     _Isostacy_, he had realized, possessed probably unqualified novelty,
    </p>
    <p>
     and by way of assurance, lest its terrors might empty the hall, he
    </p>
    <p>
     assumed a colloquial relation to his dazed hearers, and offered an
    </p>
    <p>
     explanation of this unexpected mystery. “Isostacy,” he resumed, “is
    </p>
    <p>
     simply this: Equilibrium. It is the maintenance of average level--as
    </p>
    <p>
     if one part of the earth’s surface was pushed up, above a mean level,
    </p>
    <p>
     then the requirements of Isostacy would depress another part, below
    </p>
    <p>
     it. We can also call it the adjustment of a changing load, as if
    </p>
    <p>
     through depression, from the dumping upon the floor of the ocean of a
    </p>
    <p>
     great amount of sediment, derived from the land surface of the earth,
    </p>
    <p>
     neighboring areas of the land of the oceanic floors were raised. Two
    </p>
    <p>
     contiguous regions _might_--and,” the lecturer turned directly toward
    </p>
    <p>
     the President, who in his own earnestness of attention had elbowed
    </p>
    <p>
     himself round into a direct line with Mr. Binn, “in the case of the
    </p>
    <p>
     West Indian continent and the Isthmus of Panama, _have_ maintained
    </p>
    <p>
     between them, an up and down reciprocity of movement, as, when one was
    </p>
    <p>
     up, the other was down, and vice versa.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Binn looked introspectively at the walls and ceilings of the room,
    </p>
    <p>
     as if engaged in a mental rehearsal and review of his staggering
    </p>
    <p>
     statement, and returned to his desk and manuscript, satisfied that
    </p>
    <p>
     he had thrown the assembly into an uneasy apprehension of danger. He
    </p>
    <p>
     again began his reading: “It is true, if I understand Mr. Spencer
    </p>
    <p>
     correctly, that the Atlantic ocean was cut off by the elevation of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Columbian Continent from even the interior basins of the Caribbean Sea
    </p>
    <p>
     and the Gulf of Mexico, at least in early pliocene times; that these
    </p>
    <p>
     depressions were then broad plains receiving in part the drainage of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Antillean highlands; this again emptying into the Pacific ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
     But this is not a proven theory, and it involves an extravagant
    </p>
    <p>
     readjustment of the physical features of a region that to my mind more
    </p>
    <p>
     expressively can be considered immemorially permanent, in their general
    </p>
    <p>
     aspects, at least. I reiterate the reciprocity of movement between
    </p>
    <p>
     the Antillean Continent and the Isthmus of Panama. The cause I have
    </p>
    <p>
     suggested may be untenable--but there seems strong geological proof of
    </p>
    <p>
     some such alternating relation between the west and east sides of this
    </p>
    <p>
     inter-related region, the Great Antilles on one side, the Isthmus of
    </p>
    <p>
     Central America on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Our survey of the question produces one impression, and that very
    </p>
    <p>
     forcibly, viz.: that this narrow ridge of separation is ephemeral,
    </p>
    <p>
     that it is perishable, that under the tests or against the shocks of
    </p>
    <p>
     earth strains, it will succumb, and”--the lecturer raised his voice,
    </p>
    <p>
     half turned deferentially to the chairman, Dr. Smith, who accepted the
    </p>
    <p>
     attention with an assenting nod--“again the waters of the two oceans
    </p>
    <p>
     will unite, and the impetuous violence of the rushing oceanic river,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Gulf Stream, that now races and boils through the Caribbean Sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     will fling its torrential waves across this divide into the Pacific.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The audience that with manifest absorption had thus far followed the
    </p>
    <p>
     speaker, was disturbed. A movement of chairs, a half audible protest of
    </p>
    <p>
     whispered incredulity, and a sensible emanation around him, of mental
    </p>
    <p>
     repugnance to such a catastrophe, made Leacraft momentarily turn his
    </p>
    <p>
     eyes from Mr. Binn to the frowning countenances at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But,” the speaker raised his voice with reassuring quickness, as if
    </p>
    <p>
     to stay the emotional resistance he had aroused, “we have no reason to
    </p>
    <p>
     believe that in our lifetime, or the lifetimes of many generations yet
    </p>
    <p>
     to come, so strange a reversal of present conditions should occur. And
    </p>
    <p>
     again, that in this matter, we may be calmly judicial, we have reason
    </p>
    <p>
     at least for a moderate fear. Whatever state of unstable equilibrium,
    </p>
    <p>
     of unadjusted balance is implied, or actually is resident in this
    </p>
    <p>
     section of our earth, a section that has undergone the extremes of
    </p>
    <p>
     hypsometrical displacement, we may conceive that like the explosive
    </p>
    <p>
     cap, or the compressed spring, or the bent bow, it will win instant
    </p>
    <p>
     relief upon the impact of any force, deep-seated enough, and powerful
    </p>
    <p>
     enough, to liberate its tectonic strain.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am thus brought to consider that world-wide source of terrestrial
    </p>
    <p>
     deformation--earthquakes; but I should forget the indulgence of your
    </p>
    <p>
     patience up to this point, if I should now undertake any partial review
    </p>
    <p>
     of these astonishing and alarming occurrences. I am deeply impressed,
    </p>
    <p>
     however, with an aspect of the subject that demands attention, that
    </p>
    <p>
     throws into sharp relief the prophecies of disaster, with which,
    </p>
    <p>
     willingly or unwillingly, we have all become familiar.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The lecturer here rolled forward to the front of the platform, a
    </p>
    <p>
     blackboard on which in colored chalks the earth, looking somewhat
    </p>
    <p>
     like a shortened egg, with its north and south poles situated on the
    </p>
    <p>
     long, flattened sides, was depicted; while a black line or axis drawn
    </p>
    <p>
     through it terminated in the Sahara Desert on one side, and near the
    </p>
    <p>
     Society Islands on the other. Two ominous circles in vermillion were
    </p>
    <p>
     described on it, concentric respectively with the ends of the black
    </p>
    <p>
     line, one sweeping along the western coast of North and South America,
    </p>
    <p>
     and crossing the Isthmus of Panama, the other encircling the coasts
    </p>
    <p>
     of Africa and gathering in their fatal course the Azores, Canaries,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the Cape Verde Islands. And on both these terrifying curves, in
    </p>
    <p>
     black letters, was printed the hypnotic intimation “Belt of Weakness
    </p>
    <p>
     or Earthquake Ring.” The effect on the audience was sufficiently
    </p>
    <p>
     impressive. The staring rude drawing around which a cyclone of blue
    </p>
    <p>
     scratches, purporting to be clouds, was expressively raging, intensely
    </p>
    <p>
     steeped the observers in a spell of wonder and trepidation. Even
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft, by the contagion of a common obsession, craned his neck, and
    </p>
    <p>
     fixed his eyes with a stupid absorption upon the crazy and paradoxical
    </p>
    <p>
     diagram.
    </p>
    <p>
     The speaker continued, noticing with undisguised satisfaction the
    </p>
    <p>
     ocular concentration produced by his obnoxious figure, with its
    </p>
    <p>
     anomalous portents: “It is well known that we have in the boundaries,
    </p>
    <p>
     or shore lines of the Pacific, a surprisingly larger number of
    </p>
    <p>
     earthquakes recorded, than anywhere else in the world, and this seems
    </p>
    <p>
     in some way coincident with the prevalence of active volcanoes in the
    </p>
    <p>
     same region. Prof. Haughton has enumerated for the world 407 volcanoes,
    </p>
    <p>
     225 of which are active. Of these latter, 172 are on the margin of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Pacific. Prof. Milne, who lived a long time in Japan, for the
    </p>
    <p>
     express purpose of studying the earthquake problem of those islands,
    </p>
    <p>
     has observed the surprising frequency of their earthquakes, and it
    </p>
    <p>
     is a volcanic zone they occupy. We have in contradistinction to this
    </p>
    <p>
     area about the Pacific a reversed circle which envelopes the western
    </p>
    <p>
     coast of Africa, and by this chart,” here the lecturer pushed back
    </p>
    <p>
     the blackboard, and, standing alongside of it, began, with a pointer
    </p>
    <p>
     of elucidation, a direct allocution to that subject of confusion, “we
    </p>
    <p>
     are made immediately cognizant of the opposite and yet symmetrical
    </p>
    <p>
     disposition of these zones. This should have from its simplicity and a
    </p>
    <p>
     quasi-permanency, in its phenomena--its earthquake phenomena--a general
    </p>
    <p>
     explanation. The explanation is not reassuring; it is not proven, but
    </p>
    <p>
     it is accepted by many, and has, for me, a very reasonable probability.
    </p>
    <p>
     Let us at least not recoil from its consideration.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Under the encouragement of this exhortation, the audience seemed to
    </p>
    <p>
     slide forward in their seats a few inches, with the impetus of a
    </p>
    <p>
     renewed hope.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This chart,” said the speaker, “presents to you the structural
    </p>
    <p>
     conception of Professors Jeans and Sollas, of the form of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is the shape more or less familiar to you, commonly known as a
    </p>
    <p>
     pear-shaped earth, the tip carrying the Sahara Desert on its bulging
    </p>
    <p>
     top, and its broader and inferior extremity holding the disturbed
    </p>
    <p>
     Pacific basin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now it makes a very practical difference what the shape of the
    </p>
    <p>
     earth is, because the shape affects the stability, has an important
    </p>
    <p>
     influence upon the fluctuating strains under its surface. Observe that
    </p>
    <p>
     the chart has developed, upon two circles of instability, these lines
    </p>
    <p>
     of weakness,” and the lecturer swept his pointer over the contrasted
    </p>
    <p>
     belts, one around Africa, and the other inflicting the west coast of
    </p>
    <p>
     North America with its ominous intersection. The pointer paused on
    </p>
    <p>
     the latter circle, stopping near the position of San Francisco. “You
    </p>
    <p>
     recall,” the speaker continued, “the terrifying affliction of this
    </p>
    <p>
     great city in 1906, and the pall of discouragement and gloom which
    </p>
    <p>
     it cast over the region in which the city naturally held the sway of
    </p>
    <p>
     mercantile supremacy. Now it was shown by Prof. H. H. Turner, the
    </p>
    <p>
     English astronomer, that San Francisco lies on one of the two great
    </p>
    <p>
     earthquake rings, which surround the end of the pear, as in this chart,
    </p>
    <p>
     like wrinkles produced by the crowding down of the protuberances under
    </p>
    <p>
     the force of gravitation. And, according to this view, such rings,
    </p>
    <p>
     marking lines of weakness and yielding in the rocks would not exist,
    </p>
    <p>
     if the earth was, in its shape, what we most usually assume to be its
    </p>
    <p>
     figure, an oblate spheroid, with the present north and south poles at
    </p>
    <p>
     the ends of its axis of rotation, to which axis of rotation the rest of
    </p>
    <p>
     the earth was symmetrically disposed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The existence of these earthquake and volcanic rings was known before
    </p>
    <p>
     the pear theory had been defined, but then of course their relation
    </p>
    <p>
     with any peculiar form of the earth was not understood. The ring
    </p>
    <p>
     surrounding the Pacific, or butt end of the pear includes a large part
    </p>
    <p>
     of the shores of the Pacific Ocean, running from Alaska down to the
    </p>
    <p>
     western coast of South America, then across to the East Indies, and
    </p>
    <p>
     back, around the other side, through Japan. The other ring is somewhat
    </p>
    <p>
     smaller in diameter, including the earthquake regions of West Africa
    </p>
    <p>
     and the Atlantic Islands. Now the point of interest is this, as Garrett
    </p>
    <p>
     P. Serviss has significantly said, ‘If the pear hypothesis is accepted,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the two great earthquake rings are found to be definitely connected
    </p>
    <p>
     with the strains to which the planet is subjected in its effort to
    </p>
    <p>
     attain a state of equilibrium, under the forces of its own gravitation
    </p>
    <p>
     and rotation, which tend to compel it into spheroidal shape, then we
    </p>
    <p>
     have a perfectly rational explanation of the existence of certain
    </p>
    <p>
     places where earthquakes are sure to occur more or less frequently, and
    </p>
    <p>
     of other places, like eastern America, where they are very rare and
    </p>
    <p>
     never of maximum violence.’
    </p>
    <p>
     “Every one present this evening,” and the lecturer gave an embracing
    </p>
    <p>
     wave of his hand, “knows of the singular aberrancy in the rotational
    </p>
    <p>
     motion of the earth, which has been often geographically described
    </p>
    <p>
     as the ‘wobbling of the poles.’ Astronomers have proven a real
    </p>
    <p>
     tipping of the poles alternately to one side, and then to the other,
    </p>
    <p>
     a swaying of the poles like the recurrent oscillations of a top as
    </p>
    <p>
     it ‘goes to sleep.’ But this swaying in the earth’s case is periodic
    </p>
    <p>
     and unchanging. It is sometimes rather abrupt, and at other times
    </p>
    <p>
     the tipping is regulated and progressive; but it is established, and
    </p>
    <p>
     has had a generally accepted explanation, in the attraction of the
    </p>
    <p>
     swelling equatorial prominence of the earth by the sun and moon, while
    </p>
    <p>
     suggestions have also been made that it was due to internal shiftings
    </p>
    <p>
     of mass, or to changes of exterior weightings, through the alternate
    </p>
    <p>
     and variable formation and melting of polar snows.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But it has in the light of the present theory of the pear-shaped earth
    </p>
    <p>
     a new and rather startling explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We are, however, this evening, not so much concerned with the broader
    </p>
    <p>
     cosmic aspects of this state of affairs, as with the immediate
    </p>
    <p>
     consequences to the permanence of our land surfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The mechanics of this condition and its possible effectiveness in
    </p>
    <p>
     developing contrary placed zones of rupture can be easily conceived.
    </p>
    <p>
     This awkwardly conditioned sphere, revolving upon a shorter
    </p>
    <p>
     diameter--revolving also with astonishing velocity--and bearing at
    </p>
    <p>
     either extremity of its longer axis unequal masses, is obviously in a
    </p>
    <p>
     state of peripheral strain, that is, it is in strain at such distances
    </p>
    <p>
     from either of the disproportioned ends, the one in the south seas,
    </p>
    <p>
     the other in the desert of Sahara, as would represent the more or less
    </p>
    <p>
     sharply sloping surface from its average rotundity, towards these
    </p>
    <p>
     oblique extremities.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Gentlemen,” the speaker seemed excitedly rushing into danger, but
    </p>
    <p>
     with a fixed expression, aimed somewhere at the blank and uninfluential
    </p>
    <p>
     physiognomies at the back of the hall; like that of an engineer who
    </p>
    <p>
     can neither restrain nor reverse the speed which may either carry him
    </p>
    <p>
     safely over a tottering support or plunge his train to the bottom of
    </p>
    <p>
     the gulch; “Gentlemen, the Isthmus of Panama is in this zone; _the
    </p>
    <p>
     Canal is there_!” this last reminder uttered with no very reasonable
    </p>
    <p>
     deliberation, “and it is to my mind an absolutely established
    </p>
    <p>
     certainty, that the secular instability of that region, shown by
    </p>
    <p>
     geological investigation, will again become apparent; and”--he raised
    </p>
    <p>
     his voice with a kind of exhalation of defiance, as if he spurned
    </p>
    <p>
     equivocation and invited denial--“and, it will become apparent with
    </p>
    <p>
     increased violence.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This conclusion is unwelcome; it may seem destructive to those
    </p>
    <p>
     natural hopes which the approaching completion of this wonderful
    </p>
    <p>
     enterprise--the Panama Canal--have so freely and inevitably fostered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Science in the last resource to her councils must be austerely
    </p>
    <p>
     judicial. She cannot take cognizance of man’s projects or respect his
    </p>
    <p>
     hopes. The Panama Canal as part of the Isthmus of Panama participates
    </p>
    <p>
     in all the vicissitudes of the latter, and we know that those
    </p>
    <p>
     vicissitudes mean dislocation and subsidence. When such frightful
    </p>
    <p>
     results will happen, _it is impossible to say_; that they must happen,
    </p>
    <p>
     _we can positively assert_.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The lecture was over. The lecturer retreated, and again repeated his
    </p>
    <p>
     deferential nod to the chairman, Dr. Smith, as if importuning his
    </p>
    <p>
     assistance in corroboration of his mournful vaticination. The audience
    </p>
    <p>
     still remained immobile, coagulated into a sort of mental prostration
    </p>
    <p>
     by this dismal prophecy, and yet again as if contemplating, like a
    </p>
    <p>
     cat’s stagnation, preparatory to its murderous spring, some outward and
    </p>
    <p>
     physical resentment. And the spring came.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the middle of the hall arose a tall and alert figure, perhaps
    </p>
    <p>
     noticeably bent, as if from the effort of attention, or perchance from
    </p>
    <p>
     forensic habits; for the man, as Dr. M-- quickly informed Leacraft, was
    </p>
    <p>
     Senator Tillman, of South Carolina. The face of this sudden expostulant
    </p>
    <p>
     was handsome in the extreme, and the features, strongly marked, were
    </p>
    <p>
     blended together in an expression of youthfulness that seemed to win a
    </p>
    <p>
     strange charm from their association with the white hair, and the just
    </p>
    <p>
     beginning wrinkles of advancing years.
    </p>
    <p>
     Senator Tillman lost no time. His interruption was decisively
    </p>
    <p>
     intentional. It was part of an impulsive impassioned nature. Shaking
    </p>
    <p>
     his index finger, which, from long practice, pointed undeviatingly
    </p>
    <p>
     at the object of his remarks, the Senator, in a voice harsh and
    </p>
    <p>
     penetrating, began: “My dear sir, we are indebted to you for
    </p>
    <p>
     information. But we stop there. We are not required to credit you with
    </p>
    <p>
     prediction. This scientific discussion will not alter our confidence
    </p>
    <p>
     nor stop the work on the Canal. It can’t. I’m not inclined to think
    </p>
    <p>
     that this nation will be stultified by the oracles of geology; it is a
    </p>
    <p>
     matter of simple determination that science makes mistakes--and I would
    </p>
    <p>
     advise no one in this room within the hearing of your voice, and no one
    </p>
    <p>
     outside of it, to whose eyes your reported views will appear, to allow
    </p>
    <p>
     them a scintilla of serious import.
    </p>
    <p>
     “In 1906, Mark Smith, a voteless delegate to Congress from Arizona,
    </p>
    <p>
     told this story: ‘Once,’ commented Smith, ‘a couple of my friends were
    </p>
    <p>
     riding through a desolate bit of country in Arizona near the Mexican
    </p>
    <p>
     border. Presently they came upon a man who was hanging by the neck from
    </p>
    <p>
     the limb of a tree. A couple of buzzards were roosting above him, but
    </p>
    <p>
     they made no attack upon him. My friends drove away the buzzards and
    </p>
    <p>
     discovered on the breast of the dead man a placard bearing these words:
    </p>
    <p>
     “_This was a very bad man in some respects and a damn sight worse in
    </p>
    <p>
     others._“
    </p>
    <p>
     “‘My friends accounted for the moderation of the buzzards on the theory
    </p>
    <p>
     that they had read the placard.’
    </p>
    <p>
     “That was all Smith had to say, but it was assumed that he agreed with
    </p>
    <p>
     the opinion of the other men about the subject of their discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, I beg to say of science that it is very bad in some respects,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a damn sight worse in others, and its present conclusion in regard
    </p>
    <p>
     to the Isthmus of Panama is one of the latter.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The audience, long before this denoument to the Senator’s retort was
    </p>
    <p>
     reached, had arisen; the President had arisen also, and stood with
    </p>
    <p>
     his back to the stage, facing the Senator, steadily growing more
    </p>
    <p>
     unrestrained and angry. Leacraft and Dr. M-- were half standing,
    </p>
    <p>
     their hands supporting them on the backs of the chairs of the men
    </p>
    <p>
     in front of them. The scene was interesting, and the first movement
    </p>
    <p>
     toward repression of the Senator succumbed to curiosity, and in all
    </p>
    <p>
     directions, the intelligent faces about them were variously disturbed
    </p>
    <p>
     by symptoms of vexation or amusement. It was uncommonly entertaining.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Binn and Dr. Smith, with becoming smiles of moderation, were drawn
    </p>
    <p>
     to the front of the platform, and no one, after the Senator had swung
    </p>
    <p>
     into the torrential flow of his remonstrance, thought of anything else
    </p>
    <p>
     but to catch, almost breathlessly, his words. When he concluded, a wave
    </p>
    <p>
     of laughter, genuine, but a little nervous, went through the assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then the President stepped to the aisle, turned a moment to shake the
    </p>
    <p>
     hand of the lecturer, and offer him his congratulations, and bowed to
    </p>
    <p>
     Dr. Smith. In an instant the aisle way was clear. The President moved
    </p>
    <p>
     on between the applauding people, and as he came opposite Senator
    </p>
    <p>
     Tillman, who had himself pressed toward the egress, as if to intercept
    </p>
    <p>
     him he stopped. There was a quick, instinctive restraint. Everyone
    </p>
    <p>
     waited for his word. “Senator Tillman,” the President spoke with sharp
    </p>
    <p>
     emphasis, “I thank you for restoring our spirits. I remember Mark
    </p>
    <p>
     Smith. I remember he took my advice in accepting the Statehood Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
     You may have misapplied his story, but you have at least furnished us
    </p>
    <p>
     with a novel reason for encouragement.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Again the applause broke out, and the President disappeared, the
    </p>
    <p>
     audience decorously dispersed and followed him, and Leacraft and Dr.
    </p>
    <p>
     M-- soon found themselves on Pennsylvania avenue, walking rapidly and
    </p>
    <p>
     silently.

     CHAPTER III.
    </head>
    <p>
     BALTIMORE, MAY 29, 1909.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft finished his task in the west. The disputes were smoothed
    </p>
    <p>
     out, the differences adjudicated, and a problem or so which had mixed
    </p>
    <p>
     up the overseer and the Mining Superintendent at the mines in an acute
    </p>
    <p>
     wrangle, disposed of. He was back to Washington on his way to Baltimore
    </p>
    <p>
     and Sally Garrett. The invitation from Ned Garrett to visit Baltimore
    </p>
    <p>
     and go with Sally and himself to Gettysburg on the twentieth of May,
    </p>
    <p>
     had been accepted, and every movement he had made, each step he had
    </p>
    <p>
     taken, since that memorable ninth of April when he first learned of the
    </p>
    <p>
     complexion of political affairs in the United States, and had heard Mr.
    </p>
    <p>
     Binn’s remarkable lecture, had been thoughtfully adjusted to getting
    </p>
    <p>
     back in time for the pleasure and the opportunity of seeing Sally.
    </p>
    <p>
     His own earnest desire to possess her for himself, to compel her
    </p>
    <p>
     wayward and tantalizing spirit to acknowledge his mastery had
    </p>
    <p>
     increased, and like most young men in similar relations to the unknown
    </p>
    <p>
     quantity of susceptibility in a popular young woman’s heart his anxiety
    </p>
    <p>
     grew with every lessening minute between the present and the moment
    </p>
    <p>
     of confession. But at any rate Leacraft felt no indecision. Come what
    </p>
    <p>
     might he had no misgivings about his own feelings, and lingered, with
    </p>
    <p>
     no trepidation, over the thought of asking Miss Garrett to marry him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Defeat was preferable to the hardship of doubt. He would be less
    </p>
    <p>
     miserable after rejection, if rejection it was, than he was now;
    </p>
    <p>
     tormented with an immeasurable uncertainty. And his English heaviness,
    </p>
    <p>
     that semi-sepulchral seriousness which by some amusing compensation
    </p>
    <p>
     in the gifts of Nature is mingled with the very substantial merits of
    </p>
    <p>
     these people, induced a rather grim sadness in his mind, and he reached
    </p>
    <p>
     the door of 72 Monument Square, Baltimore, with no actual palpitation,
    </p>
    <p>
     but with a strained sense of the importance of his own fate which made
    </p>
    <p>
     him grave.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft had many personal merits. He had an excellent mind, a
    </p>
    <p>
     reasonably fearless heart, a sense of justice, itself the best gift of
    </p>
    <p>
     God to man, and a face, which if not distinguished by remarkable beauty
    </p>
    <p>
     became, under the excitement of feeling, and in the more propitious
    </p>
    <p>
     circumstances of good health, attractive, from a manly comeliness, not
    </p>
    <p>
     handsome perhaps, but certainly not commonplace. And he had physique.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was tall and strong, and his strength acknowledged obedience to an
    </p>
    <p>
     intelligence which made it formidable.
    </p>
    <p>
     The door of the quiet house before which he stood, opened and
    </p>
    <p>
     there--Leacraft almost stumbled into unconsciousness--_as if expecting
    </p>
    <p>
     him_, as if flying on the wings of--if not Love, something else
    </p>
    <p>
     uncommonly pleasant--as if impatient to cross the laggard moments which
    </p>
    <p>
     separated them--was Sally Garrett.
    </p>
    <p>
     It would be difficult to reproduce in words this difficult and puzzling
    </p>
    <p>
     young lady; difficult to impart by any means less effective than
    </p>
    <p>
     painting or have proven ineffective, unless somehow helped out by
    </p>
    <p>
     personal acquaintanceship--the impression which gave both to her active
    </p>
    <p>
     admirers, and to those who, for reasons best known to themselves,
    </p>
    <p>
     had tried to forget her charms. Sally was decidedly pretty, she
    </p>
    <p>
     readily, under the phases of excitement and gayety moved upward into
    </p>
    <p>
     the realms of beauty. She was fair, not large, delicately modelled,
    </p>
    <p>
     with perniciously accomplished eyes that looked out from beneath the
    </p>
    <p>
     pencilled eye-brows, and under their long lashes, with all kinds of
    </p>
    <p>
     provocative invitations, that were no sooner accepted than their
    </p>
    <p>
     desperate little giver revoked them with derision and anger.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her lips, of course met the most scrupulous requirements of the
    </p>
    <p>
     critic, and her teeth were as fatally perfect. In coloring she
    </p>
    <p>
     furnished an example of protean adaptibility. The emblems of fury were
    </p>
    <p>
     seen in her flushed cheeks, and the tokens of contrition in the same
    </p>
    <p>
     when they grew pale with grief. This was the secret of her compelling
    </p>
    <p>
     art. She bowed to all emotions, and as they controlled her they set
    </p>
    <p>
     upon her face the evidence of their presence, refined by the resistance
    </p>
    <p>
     of a nature which abhorred wrong feelings, improved by the welcome of a
    </p>
    <p>
     spirit which was magnanimous and sympathetic. No wonder that Leacraft
    </p>
    <p>
     loved her. No wonder that a bewildered lot of other young men were in a
    </p>
    <p>
     similar predicament.
    </p>
    <p>
     I presume at this point I owe some deference to feminine importunity.
    </p>
    <p>
     How was Sally dressed? Well; Sally had good taste, perhaps a trifle
    </p>
    <p>
     insubordinate by nature, but a rigorous subjection to good social
    </p>
    <p>
     usage had made it fairly unimpeachable. At that particular moment
    </p>
    <p>
     in the afternoon of May 27th, 1909, after his extrication from
    </p>
    <p>
     the subterranean embraces of the Baltimore and Ohio tunnel, and
    </p>
    <p>
     an uninspired walk along Charles street, Sally to Leacraft’s eyes
    </p>
    <p>
     presented the acme of sartorial perfection. She wore a white lisseree
    </p>
    <p>
     gown in which were inwoven threads of gray which gave it “atmosphere,”
    </p>
    <p>
     a kind of filmyness quite indescribable, but very inviting--above
    </p>
    <p>
     that, a waist of almost the same color, without the gray threads,
    </p>
    <p>
     and fitting tightly at the wrists with faintly voluminous sleeves--a
    </p>
    <p>
     stock of daffodill yellow encircled by an aqua-marine necklace, and in
    </p>
    <p>
     her clustering golden brown cascades of hair, rushed up into a chaste
    </p>
    <p>
     confinement between pearl-starred combs--she had thrust an amethyst
    </p>
    <p>
     aigrette. It was a willful thought, a vagary of sheer carelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it looked well, and--Leacraft might have danced a jig (if he knew
    </p>
    <p>
     how) of pure ecstacy; and if his impurturbable nature would have
    </p>
    <p>
     permitted so gross a jest--it was one Leacraft had himself given her
    </p>
    <p>
     only last Christmas. You can see or infer ladies that your attractive
    </p>
    <p>
     sister, given, as I have tried to do, her natural adaptibility for
    </p>
    <p>
     embellishment, must have looked more than pleasing, that to a young
    </p>
    <p>
     man approaching her with idolatry in his heart and prayers on his lips
    </p>
    <p>
     she must have looked very nearly like the embodyment of the feminine
    </p>
    <p>
     ideal, like that inscrutable loveliness which first wins from a man his
    </p>
    <p>
     careless notice, and the next moment has him chained to its feet in
    </p>
    <p>
     servitude.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well; such were the circumstances, and Leacraft hastily removing his
    </p>
    <p>
     hat looked with all his eyes at the fair vision, and found himself
    </p>
    <p>
     embarrassed in speaking his formal salutation:
    </p>
    <p>
     “How do you do, Miss Garrett?” “Why, Mr. Leacraft,” replied the arch
    </p>
    <p>
     tormenter; “I thought it was Ned. He has just gone to get our tickets
    </p>
    <p>
     for to-morrow. And you, Mr. Leacraft, go with us? You will see our
    </p>
    <p>
     great battle field and hear our President. I’m sure you will find both
    </p>
    <p>
     wonderful. But come in, Mr. Leacraft.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The vision with intoxicating grace swung back the door and preceded the
    </p>
    <p>
     tongue-tied suitor to the parlor. Mr. Leacraft left his hat and valise
    </p>
    <p>
     in the hall, and followed. Another instant, they were both seated in
    </p>
    <p>
     the deep room from whose walls the portraits of ancient and meagre,
    </p>
    <p>
     or stately and peptic Garretts, looked down upon them, and in looking
    </p>
    <p>
     were amused or distressed, according to their nature, at the display of
    </p>
    <p>
     modern elegance, helped out by a tasteful condescension to antiquities
    </p>
    <p>
     and heirlooms.
    </p>
    <p>
     The next moment was successfully engaged in greeting Mrs. Garrett,
    </p>
    <p>
     the mother of the vision, a dignified and well preserved lady, who
    </p>
    <p>
     honored all her children’s friends with motherly hospitality, but
    </p>
    <p>
     resented mentally all masculine strategy, whose ulterior aims were
    </p>
    <p>
     the destruction of her daughter’s peace of mind. Her devotion to her
    </p>
    <p>
     daughter was itself part of a devotion which made every thing which
    </p>
    <p>
     bore the Garrett name sacred in her eyes, and which reflected a family
    </p>
    <p>
     pride, unmitigating in its self-exaction, unrelenting in its engrossing
    </p>
    <p>
     enmity to all that offended it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ned will be glad to find you here Mr. Leacraft. It was only last
    </p>
    <p>
     night that Ned said he wondered if you had got rid of the business
    </p>
    <p>
     engagements that took you out west, and expressed himself willing
    </p>
    <p>
     to believe that if you had, you would not forget his invitation for
    </p>
    <p>
     Decoration Day at Gettysburg.” It was the voice of Mrs. Garrett,
    </p>
    <p>
     a little somnolent in quality, with a subdued melodiousness, and
    </p>
    <p>
     monotonously even in tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Indeed, Mrs. Garrett, few things could have less readily escaped my
    </p>
    <p>
     mind. It has been an alleviation to think of it when I got bored with
    </p>
    <p>
     quarrelsome miners. Whatever good luck I have had in settling the
    </p>
    <p>
     mine troubles came from my own eagerness to get back to Baltimore,”
    </p>
    <p>
     and Leacraft turned with, actually, a very grave face towards the
    </p>
    <p>
     meditative Sally.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, Mr. Leacraft,” said that unconscionable woman, “we have Ned’s old
    </p>
    <p>
     classmate, Brig Barry, to go with us to Gettysburg. He is in the army,
    </p>
    <p>
     a lieutenant, who has fought Indians on the reservations, has lots
    </p>
    <p>
     of medals for bravery and is just the best thing in the way of a man
    </p>
    <p>
     you ever saw. I half think your English prejudices will be a little
    </p>
    <p>
     discouraged when you see him, or else you will love him as well as we
    </p>
    <p>
     do,” and this merciless compound of mischief and bewitching beauty
    </p>
    <p>
     looked out of her blue gray eyes with an absurd intimation of solitude
    </p>
    <p>
     which half made Leacraft forget manners.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes,” acquiesced Mrs. Garrett, “Mr. Barry is a great favorite. I
    </p>
    <p>
     almost fear that Mr. Leacraft will find him unreasonably popular.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am sure,” replied that rapidly aspiring sycophant, “that I ought to
    </p>
    <p>
     feel no inclination to impugn Miss Garrett’s good taste.”
    </p>
    <p>
     This was so evident an affectation to shield a too obvious chagrin
    </p>
    <p>
     that the wicked object of the inuendo simply laughed outright and was
    </p>
    <p>
     vicious enough to reply that “she had never felt it necessary for her
    </p>
    <p>
     own comfort to have her own personal opinions endorsed by any one,” a
    </p>
    <p>
     cruel barb that lacerated the tender Englishman feelings immensely.
    </p>
    <p>
     The next instant the front door opened with a rough shake, and a
    </p>
    <p>
     commotion of hurrying feet announced the arrival of Ned Garrett. Ned
    </p>
    <p>
     Garrett was a typical American of the best breed, and with the most
    </p>
    <p>
     unmistakable marks of that American suavity, sweetness and splendid
    </p>
    <p>
     confidence, not a whit tainted with assumption or vanity, which makes
    </p>
    <p>
     the American man the best type of man the world over. He, too, was tall
    </p>
    <p>
     and fair, with fascinating aplomb, and a frank surrender to the claim
    </p>
    <p>
     of friendship, without a too credulous endorsement of all social paper
    </p>
    <p>
     not readily negotiable. As he saw Leacraft he ran to him with a glad
    </p>
    <p>
     welcome of surprise and pleasure. “Good, Burney; I am right glad to see
    </p>
    <p>
     you. I knew you would not forget us, and you will have great reason
    </p>
    <p>
     to be satisfied with yourself for coming. The affair at Gettysburg
    </p>
    <p>
     to-morrow will be splendid. The President will give us something
    </p>
    <p>
     characteristic, the day will be the Nation’s, and the reunion of the
    </p>
    <p>
     veterans of both sides--you know this country once tried to strangle
    </p>
    <p>
     itself with its own hands--will be honored by a tremendous turn-out
    </p>
    <p>
     of people. I know,”--with a laugh,--“that you Englishmen hate crowds,
    </p>
    <p>
     unless they are turned to good account in celebrating the Lord Mayor’s
    </p>
    <p>
     day, or the jubilee of a king, or something swell and uninteresting,
    </p>
    <p>
     but it won’t hurt you to see the meaning of a great land’s reverence
    </p>
    <p>
     for its fallen dead,” and the big fellow full of enthusiasm, his
    </p>
    <p>
     handsome countenance dilated with pride, shook Leacraft’s hand, who was
    </p>
    <p>
     quite as delighted to greet his friend, whom he appreciated on his own
    </p>
    <p>
     account, without considering his influential relations to the desirable
    </p>
    <p>
     Sally.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sally and her mother were now standing and, with, from the former a
    </p>
    <p>
     smile of approval and from the latter a gesture of satisfaction the two
    </p>
    <p>
     ladies departed, a servant appeared, and the young men ascended the
    </p>
    <p>
     stairs to prepare for dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
     A variety of intentions had been coursing through Leacraft’s mind,
    </p>
    <p>
     and while ostensibly he was engaged in the commonplaces of address
    </p>
    <p>
     an interior agitation of plans and designs, all indubitably pointed
    </p>
    <p>
     towards the denouement of his visit, were tingling through his cerebral
    </p>
    <p>
     cortex with various success. He felt a sudden pressure of prudence
    </p>
    <p>
     assert itself, as if by some sort of psychological premonition he was
    </p>
    <p>
     made aware of the danger of temerity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Left by Ned Garrett to assume the conventional apparel for dinner,
    </p>
    <p>
     and lingering with a delighted inspection of the details of his
    </p>
    <p>
     bedroom which he thought just reflected, to the nice point of a modest
    </p>
    <p>
     assertion of feminine adroitness, a really exquisite taste, he ran
    </p>
    <p>
     over the possible and best programme for the short campaign he felt it
    </p>
    <p>
     necessary to devise for the capture of the gentle and ethereal enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
     As he gazed, with increasing uneasiness, and poorly repressed envy
    </p>
    <p>
     at Henry’s piquant and picturesque colored sketches of “A Virginia
    </p>
    <p>
     Wedding,” and “The Departure of the Bride,” which offered themselves so
    </p>
    <p>
     suggestively between the white curtains on the saffron tinted paper,
    </p>
    <p>
     he came to this conclusion. He would that evening, if the occasion
    </p>
    <p>
     presented itself for a really favorable interview, let Sally know how
    </p>
    <p>
     much he thought of her, and how hopelessly unhappy he must become, if
    </p>
    <p>
     she could furnish him with no encouragement. That would do just now;
    </p>
    <p>
     but when they got to Gettysburg he might expect to find a convenient
    </p>
    <p>
     moment to be more explicit, indeed to urge her to the critical
    </p>
    <p>
     extremity of telling him what he might hope for.
    </p>
    <p>
     This progressive method he fancied promised the best results, and, his
    </p>
    <p>
     thoughts still recalling with infatuation the uncalled for insertion
    </p>
    <p>
     of his aigrette in her hair on the very day when he was expected, he
    </p>
    <p>
     imagined if there was not absolute surrender on Sally’s part now, there
    </p>
    <p>
     might be compromising negotiations for surrender later.
    </p>
    <p>
     With complacency, he looked at himself in the glass, walked to the
    </p>
    <p>
     hallway and descended. He had reached the broad stairway which entered
    </p>
    <p>
     the centre of the first floor of this sumptuous home, descending on the
    </p>
    <p>
     two sides in a series of separate steps, and then uniting into a wide
    </p>
    <p>
     terrace of steps, expanding upon the hall at the bottom, and guarded by
    </p>
    <p>
     a balustrade, which ended in two newel posts of surprising proportions,
    </p>
    <p>
     each carrying an enormous Rokewood vase, from which sprang a mingled
    </p>
    <p>
     white and red exuberance of sweet alyssum and geranium. As Leacraft
    </p>
    <p>
     stood at the top of the terrace of steps, he commanded a full view of
    </p>
    <p>
     the lower hall. And right beneath him, at the foot of the terrace,
    </p>
    <p>
     under the Rokewood vases, he saw Sally Garrett--the girl whom a moment
    </p>
    <p>
     ago he had with some unction and self-flattery ventured to think was
    </p>
    <p>
     not averse to his attentions--pinning on the lapel of the evening
    </p>
    <p>
     suit of a most offensively good looking young man, a _boutonniere_ of
    </p>
    <p>
     geranium and alyssum, filched (the theft was evident) from the great
    </p>
    <p>
     vase above their heads, and to accomplish which, it seemed to the
    </p>
    <p>
     maddened observation of Leacraft, that the young man must have lifted
    </p>
    <p>
     the young lady. This was a conjunction of agencies too terrible to
    </p>
    <p>
     dwell on with equanimity, and in pure fright Leacraft stopped a moment,
    </p>
    <p>
     and became an involuntary spy upon proceedings evidently not intended
    </p>
    <p>
     for an inspection so inimical as his.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was Sally’s voice: “Well, Brig, I must confess that as an accomplice
    </p>
    <p>
     in crime you are shockingly cool. It was quite unnecessary for you to
    </p>
    <p>
     expect more than the flowers; and yet”--Leacraft seemed to hit the
    </p>
    <p>
     balustrade with his foot. The interruption was perhaps involuntary. In
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft’s condition, human nature could not stand a more excruciating
    </p>
    <p>
     strain. Sally looked up. So did the young man. “Oh, Mr. Leacraft, this
    </p>
    <p>
     is fortunate. I want you and Mr. Barry to be excellent friends. Mr.
    </p>
    <p>
     Barry is wonderfully strong, and you are so wise. With his agility,
    </p>
    <p>
     and your advice, I will have two escorts to-morrow that will save me
    </p>
    <p>
     from any exertion of mind or body. Mr. Barry will help me over the
    </p>
    <p>
     hard places, and you will explain things. Pardon,” with a coquettish
    </p>
    <p>
     glance at her companion and a demure courtesy to Leacraft; “you must go
    </p>
    <p>
     through the usual introductions. My cousin, Mr. Barry, Mr. Leacraft.
    </p>
    <p>
     Remember, I rely upon both of you, and you must be as amicable as
    </p>
    <p>
     doves,” and with that equivocal enforcement of neutrality, this
    </p>
    <p>
     impossible beauty vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ned Garrett appeared, and saved the situation, or at least diminished
    </p>
    <p>
     an insufferable embarrassment. The three men were the next instant
    </p>
    <p>
     summoned to dinner. They were met at the door of the dining-room by
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Garrett, a tall gentleman, still giving evidence of an athletic
    </p>
    <p>
     youth. Mr. Garrett was a man somewhat tormented with impatience, but
    </p>
    <p>
     genial withal, and possessing a singular power of rapid utterance,
    </p>
    <p>
     conjoined also with the power of business-like demonstration. He shook
    </p>
    <p>
     hands with Leacraft cordially, and addressed a salutation of flattering
    </p>
    <p>
     familiarity to Mr. Barry.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft had suffered a very staggering blow, as he recalled the affair
    </p>
    <p>
     of the stairway, and he fell back, with only a half-satisfied security,
    </p>
    <p>
     upon Sally’s intimation that this unwelcome intruder--the Brig Barry of
    </p>
    <p>
     her previous encomiums--was a cousin. And the plague of it all was that
    </p>
    <p>
     he (Leacraft) was overpoweringly conscious of this same Brig Barry’s
    </p>
    <p>
     indisputable charms. Mr. Brig was a type of physical perfection. He
    </p>
    <p>
     carried on straight, but not too broad, shoulders, a finely shaped
    </p>
    <p>
     head, such which, at their best, are only seen in America; a head which
    </p>
    <p>
     announced to the world its intelligent emotions through the medium
    </p>
    <p>
     of an expressive face, wherein brown eyes, dark, straight eyebrows,
    </p>
    <p>
     a strong, large mouth, an aquiline nose, and blue veined temples,
    </p>
    <p>
     overhung by short, curled hair, combining their mutually enhancing
    </p>
    <p>
     details in making their young owner the target of feminine admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
     Cousins are by no means denied the privileges of marital union, and
    </p>
    <p>
     as there are all kinds of cousins, and the privilege is less and less
    </p>
    <p>
     questionable according to the numerical distance between them, it
    </p>
    <p>
     became a matter of preliminary importance for Leacraft to find out what
    </p>
    <p>
     kind of a cousin Brig Barry was to Sally Garrett.
    </p>
    <p>
     In pondering sadly over this uncertainty his well formed plans, so
    </p>
    <p>
     agreeably outlined during his toilet, fell into disorder, and, as it
    </p>
    <p>
     were, evaporated. His agony of heart was not relieved when he observed
    </p>
    <p>
     the cruel object of his misgivings. Sally was placed at his side at
    </p>
    <p>
     the dinner table; opposite them sat Mr. Barry and Ned Garrett, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     ends of the table commodiously accommodated Mr. and Mrs. Garrett. Sally
    </p>
    <p>
     was radiant; she was well dressed, and--Leacraft’s eyes first sought
    </p>
    <p>
     its place--the aigrette was gone, and he noticed, acutely conscious of
    </p>
    <p>
     all telltale signals of interference by others with his own designs,
    </p>
    <p>
     a solitaire diamond ring on her right hand. His discomfiture was
    </p>
    <p>
     complete. It was a sad discovery, and Sally, gleaming with a light of
    </p>
    <p>
     happiness it was not his good luck to dispense, relentlessly added
    </p>
    <p>
     to his distress by showering the loathed Brig Barry with glances of
    </p>
    <p>
     commendation and approval.
    </p>
    <p>
     But when could this engagement--he shuddered at the word--have been
    </p>
    <p>
     made? Leacraft, solicitous from the moment he entered the Baltimore
    </p>
    <p>
     house in the afternoon, had scanned that same hand with a jealous
    </p>
    <p>
     scrutiny, about two hours before, and it was guiltless of rings--quite
    </p>
    <p>
     free--he could have sworn to that. Was it possible that he had
    </p>
    <p>
     witnessed the closing rites of their pre-conjugal union from the top of
    </p>
    <p>
     the stairway? It was most likely. For a moment the unhappy man felt a
    </p>
    <p>
     swinging sensation, a kind of revolting nausea that put an actual pain
    </p>
    <p>
     in his heart, and a sudden impulse almost straightened him upon his
    </p>
    <p>
     legs, and would have sent him flying from the house, seized him, which
    </p>
    <p>
     only an indomitable Spartan furor of resistance, in his English soul,
    </p>
    <p>
     could have conquered.
    </p>
    <p>
     The next instant he, too, was smiling, even observing with pleasant
    </p>
    <p>
     alacrity that when Brig Barry raised his wine glass to his lips, his
    </p>
    <p>
     eyes fell invitingly upon Sally, and that flattered fairy responded by
    </p>
    <p>
     sipping from her own, not, indeed, that such telegraphy of signals was
    </p>
    <p>
     obvious or unmannerly; no! it required the jealous eyes of an irritable
    </p>
    <p>
     rival to have seen it at all. It certainly was a cruel ordeal. It
    </p>
    <p>
     certainly taxed Leacraft’s self-possession. It was so fathomless
    </p>
    <p>
     and unexpected. Not a word from Ned about it, and Sally had always
    </p>
    <p>
     before appeared austerely impartial. Perhaps it was a sudden fancy, an
    </p>
    <p>
     illusion, hopeless on her part, because she could never marry her own
    </p>
    <p>
     cousin. The Englishman rummaged painfully in his stock of conservative
    </p>
    <p>
     teachings to prove conclusively that so abhorrent a social impropriety
    </p>
    <p>
     could never be permitted. But there was the ring! Well, a ring; what
    </p>
    <p>
     of it? A common gift; nothing more. It was madness for him to jump at
    </p>
    <p>
     conclusions so recklessly. Two cousins admiring each other--yes, loving
    </p>
    <p>
     each other, in a beautiful, domestic family way--and separated for a
    </p>
    <p>
     long time, were naturally rejoicing in reunion. Stupid to attribute
    </p>
    <p>
     so much as he had done, under so slight provocation, to their mutual
    </p>
    <p>
     affection, the affection, doubtless, of a brother and sister; keener
    </p>
    <p>
     indeed, as why not?
    </p>
    <p>
     Ruminating thus propitiously, and only half conscious that he was
    </p>
    <p>
     going through the formalities of a course dinner, and was but poorly
    </p>
    <p>
     assisting the conversation, which consciously he thought had not yet
    </p>
    <p>
     developed into any consecutive line of talk, he suddenly seemed to come
    </p>
    <p>
     back to his senses, as these words proceeded with celerous distinctness
    </p>
    <p>
     from the lips of the older Garrett:
    </p>
    <p>
     “A despatch was received in the office this afternoon, about an hour
    </p>
    <p>
     ago, from Colon, which startled us a good deal. Three earthquake shocks
    </p>
    <p>
     have been felt in Colon, and an enormous tidal wave swept over Limon
    </p>
    <p>
     Bay, in the direction of Mindi. There was loss of life at Colon. The
    </p>
    <p>
     coast towards the _embouchure_ of the Chagres river has sunk sensibly,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a rumor prevailed at Colon, at the time the despatch was sent,
    </p>
    <p>
     that the walls of the great Culebra Cut had collapsed. This is bad
    </p>
    <p>
     news, if it is true, bad news for the President, bad news for the
    </p>
    <p>
     country. So enormous a disaster will be known at once, if it to be
    </p>
    <p>
     known at all. The fact that no press accounts have been given out makes
    </p>
    <p>
     me hope that our despatch is a mistake, a canard, perhaps.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh! the poor President!” exclaimed the sympathetic Sally; “he will
    </p>
    <p>
     need his courage now. It can’t be so horrible. They surely can’t mean,
    </p>
    <p>
     papa, that the canal is destroyed. That would be too shameful.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “The operations of Nature,” said Ned Garrett, “are not generally
    </p>
    <p>
     susceptible to shame. Nature is about the most shameless thing on the
    </p>
    <p>
     face of the earth,” and they all smiled at the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes,” said Mr. Barry--and Leacraft watched him with eager eyes, and
    </p>
    <p>
     listened with critical ears--“Nature has a happy way of discriminating
    </p>
    <p>
     between shame and compassion. She tries to make up for her cruelties by
    </p>
    <p>
     some new blessing, but she never tells anybody that her cruelties ever
    </p>
    <p>
     made her blush. If this news is a portent of worse; if the canal should
    </p>
    <p>
     be destroyed, if the isthmus is invaded by the oceans, a canal without
    </p>
    <p>
     locks will be given to us free of charge.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And we have spent one hundred and thirty million dollars already. As a
    </p>
    <p>
     financial proposition, it is hard to see why we have not paid as much
    </p>
    <p>
     for one as for the other,” dryly commented Mr. Garrett. Leacraft felt
    </p>
    <p>
     it incumbent upon him to say something, and his fatal over-valuation
    </p>
    <p>
     of seriousness allured his tongue into a statement statistical and
    </p>
    <p>
     scientific, something which might impress Sally--but which only
    </p>
    <p>
     afflicted that young degenerate person with an immoderate preference
    </p>
    <p>
     for the way her cousin, Brig Barry, might have said the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am rather curiously reminded,” began Leacraft, “of a lecture which
    </p>
    <p>
     I heard in Washington last April, in which the lecturer, Mr. Binn,
    </p>
    <p>
     ventured to offer a very alarming prediction as to the instability
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Central American zone, and especially the portions of it
    </p>
    <p>
     embraced in the isthmus. He was rebuked at the time in open meeting by
    </p>
    <p>
     a Senator, but if your information turns out to be correct, perhaps
    </p>
    <p>
     he is about to receive a stunning corroboration. It would be of some
    </p>
    <p>
     psychological interest to know whether Mr. Binn in that case preferred
    </p>
    <p>
     his own reputation to his country’s welfare.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I heard of Binn’s talk,” remarked Brig Barry. “I was near the Mexican
    </p>
    <p>
     line, and we had had a brush with some greasers which were kicking at
    </p>
    <p>
     Uncle Sam’s tariff. A Washington paper turned up in camp, and there was
    </p>
    <p>
     Binn’s Jeremiad. I think the paper had it ‘Science Butting In,’” and,
    </p>
    <p>
     to Leacraft’s surprise, Sally laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
     But a moment later she turned to Leacraft with unaffected interest, and
    </p>
    <p>
     said, “But, Mr. Leacraft, do you think Mr. Binn knew?” and her voice
    </p>
    <p>
     was plaintive and concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It is reserved for astronomy,” said Mr. Garrett, “to have prospective
    </p>
    <p>
     knowledge, to know the future exactly, with a calendar in one hand,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a watch in the other. I think it is not an imputation on the
    </p>
    <p>
     credibility of science to say that in other departments its knowledge
    </p>
    <p>
     of the future is speculative.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mr. Binn,” began Leacraft, “was not at all didactic, as regards
    </p>
    <p>
     time, but he was emphatic in the general scope of his predictions.
    </p>
    <p>
     He regarded the Isthmus and the Central American area as belonging
    </p>
    <p>
     in their geological habits to the West Indies, and he had a very
    </p>
    <p>
     poor opinion of the fidelity of the latter to implied obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
     He regarded it as capricious and wayward, unsubstantial in its
    </p>
    <p>
     composition, and a bit fickle in its attachments.” It was almost
    </p>
    <p>
     impossible not to think that the speaker was not putting a little
    </p>
    <p>
     bit of something more than science in his words. He continued: “His
    </p>
    <p>
     views also involved a curious reference to a rather topsy turvy theory
    </p>
    <p>
     that the earth was pear-shaped, and that the belt of earthquakes and
    </p>
    <p>
     crustal disorders along the borders of the Pacific resulted from this
    </p>
    <p>
     hypothetically crooked figure of the earth.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Brig Barry was listening with intense attention, and a whimsical
    </p>
    <p>
     glimmer of a smile turned the ends of his lips, while his eyes very
    </p>
    <p>
     gravely, with a slight contraction of their eyelids, watched Leacraft,
    </p>
    <p>
     with half inquisitorial perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think,” he broke in, “that the West Indies will manage to take care
    </p>
    <p>
     of themselves. At least, present indications go to prove, that instead
    </p>
    <p>
     of disappearing, they are on their way to bigger things. Commander
    </p>
    <p>
     Beecham, who has just come from the Isle of Pines, told me yesterday,
    </p>
    <p>
     that the island was rising, that in a short time it might become part
    </p>
    <p>
     of Cuba. The question might then be asked, as we own the Isle of Pines,
    </p>
    <p>
     whether we had not annexed Cuba.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have heard of the Isle of Pines,” said Mrs. Garrett, “but hardly
    </p>
    <p>
     understand what it is. Perhaps a little enlightenment on the subject
    </p>
    <p>
     would not be unwelcome to the rest of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do, Brig,” pleaded Sally, “in the role of instructor you may be as
    </p>
    <p>
     successful in geography as in other subjects,” and Leacraft flushed and
    </p>
    <p>
     sat back hard, to resist the harsh blow of this subtle reminder of his
    </p>
    <p>
     worst suspicions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Barry looked around, as if to secure the suffrages of the
    </p>
    <p>
     company, and found every eye fixed upon him in expectation. It was
    </p>
    <p>
     his turn to impress Sally. He last looked at her, and as he did, he
    </p>
    <p>
     laughingly began: “I shall have no compunctions in being a trifle
    </p>
    <p>
     the schoolmaster. The Isle of Pines, Mrs. Garrett, lies in a deep
    </p>
    <p>
     bight or bay near the south coast of the western part of Cuba. There
    </p>
    <p>
     are some six hundred and thirty thousand acres in it, and it is but
    </p>
    <p>
     ninety-nine square miles less in extent than our little State of Rhode
    </p>
    <p>
     Island. This island bears a sort of filial relation to Cuba. It is part
    </p>
    <p>
     of the general chain of the insular mainlands of the Antilles. It is
    </p>
    <p>
     not a coral key or a mangrove swamp. It forms a plateau from fifty to
    </p>
    <p>
     one hundred feet above sea level, broken by ridges of hills or cliffs
    </p>
    <p>
     that start out over its surface like the bones on the back of a thin
    </p>
    <p>
     cow.” Sally’s deferential attention to Mr. Barry’s learning was here
    </p>
    <p>
     interrupted by a very audible titter.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I beg to remonstrate against any levity in my class, and I think, Miss
    </p>
    <p>
     Garrett, you owe me an apology for attempting to disturb my recital.”
    </p>
    <p>
     This mock rebuke completed Sally’s disorder. Her eyes, wet with tears
    </p>
    <p>
     of merriment, looked at Brig Barry, who had assumed himself the amusing
    </p>
    <p>
     expression of offended dignity, and she murmured, “Excuse me, sir,”
    </p>
    <p>
     with such a delicious mockery of piteous appeal that her father laughed
    </p>
    <p>
     aloud, but Leacraft maintained his stern reserve, with eyes uplifted
    </p>
    <p>
     from the face of his rival.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Small as this island is, it offers room for two mountain ridges at
    </p>
    <p>
     its northern end, which reach the respectable elevation of fifteen
    </p>
    <p>
     hundred feet, and are composed of limestones. There are other ridges
    </p>
    <p>
     in the island, lower and less steep. The whole island is surrounded by
    </p>
    <p>
     swamps, except towards the south, where it is rocky. Commander Beecham
    </p>
    <p>
     says that in the last month strange uplifts have been noticed, almost
    </p>
    <p>
     unaccompanied by any serious seismic--this last word, Miss Garrett, may
    </p>
    <p>
     affect you unpleasantly; it means earthquake,--disturbance and shoals
    </p>
    <p>
     and reefs are now bristling out of the sea, like the teeth on a comb.
    </p>
    <p>
     And another singular circumstance can be mentioned. The island abounds
    </p>
    <p>
     in warm springs, curative--for your benefit, Miss Garrett, I may say
    </p>
    <p>
     that the word means healing--for rheumatism and throat affections,
    </p>
    <p>
     and these springs are sinking; the water seems to recede within the
    </p>
    <p>
     recesses of the earth, while in other cases the subterranean channels
    </p>
    <p>
     have either crushed together, or have become filled up; the springs
    </p>
    <p>
     are simply not there; they have vanished; the Commander has made
    </p>
    <p>
     observations on the coast lines, and it seemed to him that they were
    </p>
    <p>
     all rising. The Cuban coast is rising, too. He came through Havana,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the shipways in the harbor have become so shallow that there was
    </p>
    <p>
     a gloomy prospect that the city would be cut off from the sea. I only
    </p>
    <p>
     heard all this strange news an hour ago, and I fear the excitement
    </p>
    <p>
     caused by meeting Miss Garrett is to be held responsible for my
    </p>
    <p>
     forgetting to mention it before.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The allusion was noticed by only Leacraft; the next voice was that of
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Garrett, whose face had darkened with apprehension. “Extraordinary!
    </p>
    <p>
     It may be that our despatch is correct. It may be that there is a sort
    </p>
    <p>
     of see-saw here, that as the West Indies rise, the Central American
    </p>
    <p>
     coast sinks. But why not a whisper of such occurrences in the papers?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “The see-saw fancy,” said Leacraft, now thoroughly aroused, and
    </p>
    <p>
     forgetting his immediate disappointment in the face of a formidable
    </p>
    <p>
     physical phenomenon, “was Mr. Binn’s. He gave me the feeling that he
    </p>
    <p>
     thought that, like an inflated surface, where the higher elevation of
    </p>
    <p>
     one part meant the lowering of another part, so the access of height
    </p>
    <p>
     in the West Indies meant the loss of height in the isthmus. And the
    </p>
    <p>
     provocation to any change would be earthquakes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “As to the papers not publishing anything,” explained Barry, “there are
    </p>
    <p>
     no newspaper correspondents in the Isle of Pines, and I recall now that
    </p>
    <p>
     Beecham told me that the authorities at Havana were so frightened over
    </p>
    <p>
     the reports of the harbor masters, that that they had prohibited their
    </p>
    <p>
     circulation. The thing may prove grave enough.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let us hope,” said Ned Garrett, “that such rumors do not get abroad
    </p>
    <p>
     before to-morrow. They are only half-proven assertions, based upon some
    </p>
    <p>
     accidental and momentary circumstance. In a few days the Isle of Pines
    </p>
    <p>
     may be the same as it was, with the salt springs thrown in, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     harbor of Havana back again to its old position without so much as a
    </p>
    <p>
     jolt. The sea serpent is now advancing towards our shores at the summer
    </p>
    <p>
     resorts, why not a few nightmares from the tropics? A truce to ghosts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Let us drink to the President and the Canal.” The glasses were raised,
    </p>
    <p>
     their lips, before they touched the sparkling lymphs, offering, as if
    </p>
    <p>
     in silent prayer, to the consecration of the beaded wine, unuttered
    </p>
    <p>
     hopes for the country’s great head, and its great enterprise, had but
    </p>
    <p>
     felt the amber current flowing from the engraved chalices, musical with
    </p>
    <p>
     the tinkling of bits of ice, when,--a sharp cry of voices, a babel of
    </p>
    <p>
     tumultuous and precipitated outcries smote upon their ears, entering
    </p>
    <p>
     the open windows like an execrable assault. It was the shouting,
    </p>
    <p>
     thrilling with an unusual impetus of omen, of the newsboys, as if
    </p>
    <p>
     they had forgotten their mercantile relations to the news, which,
    </p>
    <p>
     whether of joy or grief, they commonly announce in the shrill yells of
    </p>
    <p>
     indifference and gloating expectation. Now their multitudinous voices
    </p>
    <p>
     mingled in a monstrous hoarseness, as if constrained by a personal and
    </p>
    <p>
     immediate sorrow and horror. Even ejaculations from men in the streets
    </p>
    <p>
     buying the papers from the hawkers, entered the room, and brought
    </p>
    <p>
     pallor to the cheeks of the mute company. Ned Garrett pushed back his
    </p>
    <p>
     chair and sprang to the door, followed by Brig Barry, and the rest
    </p>
    <p>
     stayed, immobile, like a stricken throng, waiting the next minute for
    </p>
    <p>
     an impending immolation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Scarcely thirty seconds had elapsed when the two men came back with
    </p>
    <p>
     the papers of the street, one having the _Baltimore Times_, the other
    </p>
    <p>
     holding in his hands the _Southern Herald_. The faces of both men were
    </p>
    <p>
     pale, and on the cheeks of Ned Garrett shone a trace of tears. Barry
    </p>
    <p>
     was the first to enter the room, and as Mr. Garrett, now standing at
    </p>
    <p>
     the head of the table, his body half turned towards the door, his face
    </p>
    <p>
     suffused with unchecked emotion--as Mr. Garrett said, “Well, what is
    </p>
    <p>
     it?” he faltered, and dropping the paper to his side, he faced the
    </p>
    <p>
     convulsed merchant, and was silent. It was Ned Garrett who cried out,
    </p>
    <p>
     “The Isthmus is crumbling to pieces and the Canal is doomed.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The order of events as we hear any sudden stroke of affliction, as we
    </p>
    <p>
     suddenly confront the inevitable bereavement, as we feel the sharp
    </p>
    <p>
     thrust of calamity penetrate our hearts, varies with temperaments
    </p>
    <p>
     and sex; but for the most part it reflects the order of events under
    </p>
    <p>
     physical attack, the stunned senses, and the reaction. It is in the
    </p>
    <p>
     reaction that the difference among men most visibly appears. Slowly
    </p>
    <p>
     Mrs. Garrett arose and left the room, and Sally, after a pause, during
    </p>
    <p>
     which she had stolen to the side of Brig Barry, and lifted the paper
    </p>
    <p>
     from his side, where it had fallen in his unnerved hands, followed her.
    </p>
    <p>
     The four men were left behind, and of them only Leacraft was seated.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was Leacraft who first spoke: “This is awful, but the Nation is
    </p>
    <p>
     far greater than any misfortune that can befall it.” The other three
    </p>
    <p>
     turned to him with one accord, as if saved from their own wretchedness,
    </p>
    <p>
     and moved in his direction as if to embrace him. It was the right
    </p>
    <p>
     word. It brought relief, and to one at least as he turned his back to
    </p>
    <p>
     the speaker it brought tears. Mr. Garrett the elder looked intensely
    </p>
    <p>
     at Leacraft, his eyes almost glittering with the sudden joy of
    </p>
    <p>
     consolation, and said, “Thank you, Mr. Leacraft, for that true word. It
    </p>
    <p>
     is the one we need. You are an Englishman, and your confidence in us is
    </p>
    <p>
     part of your own Anglo-Saxon strength, and part of your best knowledge
    </p>
    <p>
     that we are nourished by the same blood. Let us sit down, and you,
    </p>
    <p>
     Brig,” (Ned Garret’s back was still turned to them) “read the papers to
    </p>
    <p>
     us. The first reports may be much exaggerated.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Some servants had by this time collected in the room at the side of the
    </p>
    <p>
     butler’s pantry and waited there irresolute. Mrs. Garrett and Sally
    </p>
    <p>
     also softly returned, and took their places at the table; with them,
    </p>
    <p>
     as with Ned Garrett, the thought of the President’s misery unnerved
    </p>
    <p>
     them. Barry had spread the paper before him. The dark head lines swept
    </p>
    <p>
     across the sheet in ominous relief. They read:
    </p>
    <p>
     THE NATION’S LOSS.
    </p>
    <p>
     EARTHQUAKES AND LAND SUBSIDENCE ENGULF
    </p>
    <p>
     THE ISTHMUS AND THE CANAL.
    </p>
    <p>
     THE AWFUL CATACLYSM OF NATURE.
    </p>
    <p>
     THE PRESIDENT DEEPLY AFFECTED.
    </p>
    <p>
     THE MOST TERRIBLE CATASTROPHE IN MODERN TIMES.
    </p>
    <p>
     News from Aspinwall of the most appalling character has been received
    </p>
    <p>
     in Washington, and though an initial effort to conceal or suppress the
    </p>
    <p>
     despatches was made, wiser councils prevailed and the country will
    </p>
    <p>
     know the worst. America must now vindicate her courage and maintain
    </p>
    <p>
     the reputation she justly holds among the nations of the world for
    </p>
    <p>
     self-reliance and self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
     A long telegram received at the executive mansion in Washington
    </p>
    <p>
     to-day was given to the country by the orders of the President,
    </p>
    <p>
     after unavailing remonstrances from the members of the cabinet, who
    </p>
    <p>
     wanted the news withheld until confirmatory despatches were received.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is believed that these _were_ received, and that the President
    </p>
    <p>
     ordered the distribution of the news. In a word it announces the
    </p>
    <p>
     destruction of the Canal, and the submergence of the Canal zone,
    </p>
    <p>
     through a series of progressive changes in the earth’s surface at that
    </p>
    <p>
     section, accompanied by severe earthquake phenomena. The confluent
    </p>
    <p>
     waters of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans will mingle over the buried
    </p>
    <p>
     structures of the Canal, and one hundred and fifty millions of dollars,
    </p>
    <p>
     representing the labor of three years, and nearly fifty thousand
    </p>
    <p>
     men, with an enormous accumulation of material, will have been spent
    </p>
    <p>
     in vain. The Nation’s credit remains unimpeached and unimpeachable,
    </p>
    <p>
     but the moral effects of this stupendous calamity can scarcely be
    </p>
    <p>
     over-estimated.
    </p>
    <p>
     THE STORY IN DETAIL.
    </p>
    <p>
     A series of quickly succeeding earthquakes shook the City of Panama
    </p>
    <p>
     on the evening of May 27th. They were slight in character, though
    </p>
    <p>
     distinguished by peculiar rotatory effects, turning natural objects
    </p>
    <p>
     half way round, and producing curious effects upon pedestrians who
    </p>
    <p>
     became dizzy under their influence. These seemed to have passed inland
    </p>
    <p>
     and to have accumulated in one severe shock at Miraflores, just as
    </p>
    <p>
     a number of waves in water, chasing each other, may combine to form
    </p>
    <p>
     a resultant wave higher than its components, and generally, if the
    </p>
    <p>
     confluence takes place in the right phase, of a height which is the sum
    </p>
    <p>
     of the heights of the smaller elements.
    </p>
    <p>
     At any rate, a most violent disturbance occurred at the latter place,
    </p>
    <p>
     throwing down houses, and opening hillsides, which was followed by an
    </p>
    <p>
     alarming sinking of the ground. The railroad track disappeared, part of
    </p>
    <p>
     the canal walls were swallowed up, an immense influx of water from La
    </p>
    <p>
     Boca poured in, and the former site of the village became a lake-like
    </p>
    <p>
     expanse. No further shocks were felt, although doubtless considerable
    </p>
    <p>
     dislocation farther west had taken place, and the locks on the Canal
    </p>
    <p>
     beyond the Culebra Cut, in the direction of Gamboa, San Pablo, and
    </p>
    <p>
     Tavernilla were perhaps impaired. As if the hidden energies of the
    </p>
    <p>
     earth had become reinforced, and the subterranean fires had renewed
    </p>
    <p>
     their devastating fury, on the morning of the 28th a sharp upheaval of
    </p>
    <p>
     the ground at Tavernilla, in the old delta plane of the Chagres river,
    </p>
    <p>
     took place, almost immediately succeeded by as rapid a collapse and
    </p>
    <p>
     depression. This alarming operation of the ground was repeated, upon
    </p>
    <p>
     a titanic scale in the submerged delta plane between Pena Blanca and
    </p>
    <p>
     Gatun. It was reported that at first small monticules of rock, mud, and
    </p>
    <p>
     sand, appeared in the vicinity of Agua Clara, but these proved to be
    </p>
    <p>
     ephemeral elevations, subsiding foot by foot, until with one monstrous
    </p>
    <p>
     convulsion the whole ridge of hills between Limon Bay, to the west
    </p>
    <p>
     on the Canal line, and Barrage at the old French dam, slipped bodily
    </p>
    <p>
     into the sea, with unutterable sounds, the rocks as it were exploding
    </p>
    <p>
     with immeasurable violence. The discharge of the mountain mass into
    </p>
    <p>
     the oceanic depths caused terrific tidal waves to rush outward, and
    </p>
    <p>
     north and south, in colossal walls of water. One of these swept upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the panic-stricken inhabitants of Colon, its solid phalanx suddenly
    </p>
    <p>
     approaching from the sea, and in conjunction with earthquakes that
    </p>
    <p>
     had emptied the houses of the horrified occupants, bringing them all
    </p>
    <p>
     to the verge of madness, from sheer fear. The skies, as if engaged in
    </p>
    <p>
     some hideous conspiracy of destruction, with the moving earth, suddenly
    </p>
    <p>
     darkened. Deluges of water poured from the ebony and swollen clouds,
    </p>
    <p>
     lightning in incessant lines of quivering brilliancy shot from their
    </p>
    <p>
     lurid depths, and thunders intensified by a thousand reverberations,
    </p>
    <p>
     shook the recesses of the trembling hills.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was not surprising that the spectators of these monstrous
    </p>
    <p>
     happenings, with their earth vanishing beneath their feet, the
    </p>
    <p>
     overcharged skies emptying the arsenals of their electric fires upon
    </p>
    <p>
     them, and the irresistible floods of the ocean, rising like avengers
    </p>
    <p>
     to overwhelm them, should have cast reason to the winds, and dumb with
    </p>
    <p>
     amazement, and insane almost with horror, should have sunk upon their
    </p>
    <p>
     knees, and waited for the engulfment, which was to them part of this
    </p>
    <p>
     preternatural ending of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     Few were strong enough to resist the frightful strain, and the woods
    </p>
    <p>
     and hills near Colon were filled with men and women in all states of
    </p>
    <p>
     frenzy. Some with cowering limbs and bowed heads awaited the summons of
    </p>
    <p>
     death or the call of Judgment, while others, lost alike to reason and
    </p>
    <p>
     moderation, nakedly execrated Heaven, or, stark mad, plunged weapons of
    </p>
    <p>
     defence into the bodies of prostrate women.
    </p>
    <p>
     A few engineers at Colon had hastily constructed a camp on the higher
    </p>
    <p>
     hills towards the north, in which they were imitated by engineers at
    </p>
    <p>
     other points. These had communicated with the equipment at Colon, and
    </p>
    <p>
     it was from the latter city, which had at last accounts suffered little
    </p>
    <p>
     else than shocks of varying violence, but not destructive, that the
    </p>
    <p>
     first news had been sent.
    </p>
    <p>
     LATER ADVICES.
    </p>
    <p>
     From Allia Juela at an old dam station to the north of Gamboa, in the
    </p>
    <p>
     hills, and on the water tributaries of the Chagres, news has been
    </p>
    <p>
     just received that the pertubations continue, and that the areas
    </p>
    <p>
     about Aspinwall (Colon) are becoming progressively invaded by the
    </p>
    <p>
     sudden sinking movements, and the worst fears are entertained for the
    </p>
    <p>
     permanence of all sections of the Canal. A telegram received from
    </p>
    <p>
     Graytown, Nicaragua, announces the awakening of the volcanoes of Costa
    </p>
    <p>
     Rica, especially Poas and Irazu; steam and smoke are arising from other
    </p>
    <p>
     previously dormant peaks, and ashes have fallen in large amounts in the
    </p>
    <p>
     streets of Greytown. In an interview with Mr. F. C. Nicholas, the well
    </p>
    <p>
     known industrial prospector of Central America, that authority says
    </p>
    <p>
     the zone of possible disturbance may extend quite far, north and south
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Canal strip, though in his opinion the more disastrous results
    </p>
    <p>
     may be expected in the mountainous and volcanic chains along the old
    </p>
    <p>
     proposed route of the Nicaragua inter-oceanic canal. He has himself
    </p>
    <p>
     felt the tremors of the earth there and here ten or more years ago his
    </p>
    <p>
     ear caught, so slight however that it might have been only fancy, the
    </p>
    <p>
     faint rumbling of the mountains as if in travail, which at the time was
    </p>
    <p>
     interpreted by the guides as a premonition of storm. Mr. Nicholas added
    </p>
    <p>
     at the close of his interview that “when I left Colon after my visit to
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicaragua common report had it that in Nicaragua there was a valley of
    </p>
    <p>
     fire surrounded with blazing volcanoes, and that I had seen it--a good
    </p>
    <p>
     example of Spanish-American exaggeration. It may indeed now happen,
    </p>
    <p>
     that this fanciful picture might, in even a more extravagant and
    </p>
    <p>
     dreadful way, be realized, and the long pent up forces of the earth,
    </p>
    <p>
     slumbering through ages, become reawakened, with the most disastrous
    </p>
    <p>
     consequences to the whole Central American domain, through a contagious
    </p>
    <p>
     outbreak of volcanic forces and terrestrial subsidences.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Barry paused, and his eye travelled down the page of the paper. He
    </p>
    <p>
     stopped and exclaimed: “They’ve got wind of the things Beecham told
    </p>
    <p>
     me about. Listen. ‘The Isle of Pines is rising, and in the opinion of
    </p>
    <p>
     local authorities, the shoals at low water between it and Cuba will
    </p>
    <p>
     afford an almost unbroken transit to the greater island. The Windward
    </p>
    <p>
     Passage between Cuba and Hayti has been invaded by new reefs, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     Monas Passage between San Domingo and Porto Rico is also reported
    </p>
    <p>
     by sailing vessels recently arriving at Havana, to present unusual
    </p>
    <p>
     and uncharted features, as if the floor of the ocean was also there
    </p>
    <p>
     undergoing elevation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “‘These marvellous modifications of the earth’s surface seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     connected with renewed activity in the volcanic islands of the Lesser
    </p>
    <p>
     Antilles. Mt. Pelee is again reported to be in eruption on the island
    </p>
    <p>
     of Martinique, while La Soufriere, on St. Vincent, is in active
    </p>
    <p>
     eruption, and Dominica, Santa Lucia and the Barbados have been visited
    </p>
    <p>
     by unprecedented tides, which have been regarded as evidence of the
    </p>
    <p>
     subsidence of the foundations of the islands themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
     “‘We stand aghast before these incomprehensible phenomena; our minds
    </p>
    <p>
     recoil before the awful powers of the natural world; we stumble in
    </p>
    <p>
     darkness at the meaning of this inscrutable visitation; truly, we may
    </p>
    <p>
     recall the words of the psalmists: _Then the channels of the waters
    </p>
    <p>
     were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy
    </p>
    <p>
     rebuke, O Lord, at the blast of the breath of Thy nostrils._’”
    </p>
    <p>
     Barry ceased reading. He had read all the paper contained. He turned
    </p>
    <p>
     mechanically to the sheet Ned Garrett had laid on the table, and
    </p>
    <p>
     glanced over it, remarking--“it is the same”--and then there was
    </p>
    <p>
     complete silence. It was Leacraft again who helped to restore their
    </p>
    <p>
     composure; “I think,” he said, “that in any event the water connexion
    </p>
    <p>
     between the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans is assured. Suppose the
    </p>
    <p>
     canal structure, as it was supposed to be finally at its completion,
    </p>
    <p>
     is all swept away or rendered impossible, an obviously easier access
    </p>
    <p>
     from one ocean to the other is created. If a complete change in the
    </p>
    <p>
     relations of land to water surfaces is now in progress, if Mr. Binn’s
    </p>
    <p>
     disagreeable predictions are now about to be realized, a good many
    </p>
    <p>
     remarkable and not altogether regrettable conditions may supervene.
    </p>
    <p>
     The water-way may become a veritable strait, providing easy, unbroken
    </p>
    <p>
     and capacious connexions between the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific
    </p>
    <p>
     ocean--the islands of the West Indies may slowly converge into one
    </p>
    <p>
     land surface, and a new continent invite populations and industries,
    </p>
    <p>
     which the wild, slothful or decadent peoples of Central America, with
    </p>
    <p>
     their hot, fever laden and deleterious climates, could not encourage or
    </p>
    <p>
     support. We may be entering upon a new chapter in the history of the
    </p>
    <p>
     world, and in the history of nations. Who can tell upon what strange
    </p>
    <p>
     threshold we are standing? Let us wait and see. Man is subordinate
    </p>
    <p>
     to and the victim of circumstances. Circumstance also gives him his
    </p>
    <p>
     opportunities. What wonders may not the hand of God work in this
    </p>
    <p>
     marvellous reconstruction of land and water? And if two hundred
    </p>
    <p>
     millions of dollars, as representing the final cost of the Canal,
    </p>
    <p>
     seems to have been swallowed up, what of it? A nation whose annual
    </p>
    <p>
     appropriations--as I only read yesterday--are on the scale of six
    </p>
    <p>
     hundred millions a year, should regard with comparative complacence a
    </p>
    <p>
     loss of one-third of that amount, when it arises from a permanent and
    </p>
    <p>
     desirable change in physical, perhaps human, conditions.”
    </p>
    <p>
     As Leacraft was speaking, the little group of his auditors remained
    </p>
    <p>
     motionless, with--it did not escape Leacraft’s jealous notice--Sally
    </p>
    <p>
     and Brig at its centre, in a sort of mutually consoling contact, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the servants a little behind, in a scrutinizing attitude, anxious
    </p>
    <p>
     through a sense of sympathy with the evident distress of the household.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Garrett spoke, and Leacraft rose to his feet. “We have indeed
    </p>
    <p>
     suffered a harsh blow, but it has its after thoughts of alleviating
    </p>
    <p>
     hope, and you have shown us that our alarm is more emotional than
    </p>
    <p>
     substantial. The country has been fed upon the proud anticipations of
    </p>
    <p>
     the accomplishment of this Canal. It has become a political question.
    </p>
    <p>
     It has colored the utterances of our public men. It has been the
    </p>
    <p>
     dream of the President, as the crowning work of a pre-eminent list
    </p>
    <p>
     of services to the nation. His energy has pushed it to the verge of
    </p>
    <p>
     completion, and in its prosecution the Nation and the President have
    </p>
    <p>
     become united in positive endorsement. It may all be right yet. Let us
    </p>
    <p>
     hope and pray so.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Flushed with real feeling, Mr. Garrett shook the hand of Leacraft, and
    </p>
    <p>
     in a sort of review, the rest imitated his example, and left the room,
    </p>
    <p>
     leaving Ned and Leacraft behind.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was then that Leacraft turned to Ned Garrett and said: “I thought I
    </p>
    <p>
     saw an engagement ring on the hand of your sister.” The statement was
    </p>
    <p>
     a question. Ned Garrett looked at his friend with singular intensity
    </p>
    <p>
     of interest and sympathy. He realized the anguish of the man who,
    </p>
    <p>
     loving his sister beyond all earthly price, forgot a country’s peril in
    </p>
    <p>
     the eagerness of his hope that perhaps his heart-breaking fears were
    </p>
    <p>
     unjustified. The two men were standing. Ned Garrett took Leacraft’s
    </p>
    <p>
     hand and placed his other hand upon his shoulder, and his earnest face
    </p>
    <p>
     uttered its inviolable commiseration: “Yes, Burney; Sally is engaged to
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Barry.” They turned and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     That night it was not the convulsions of nature breaking down the
    </p>
    <p>
     barriers of two words, and bringing into action new forces and new
    </p>
    <p>
     vicissitudes among the peoples of the earth, that marred the sleep of
    </p>
    <p>
     the restless Englishman. No; it was the face of Sally Garrett smiling
    </p>
    <p>
     into the bending face of Brig Barry, and touching his lips.

     CHAPTER IV.
    </head>
    <p>
     GETTYSBURG, MAY 30TH, 1909.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Garrett party reached Gettysburg at mid-day, May 30th, 1909, having
    </p>
    <p>
     passed through, in the train from Baltimore, the delightfully rural
    </p>
    <p>
     scenes of western Maryland and southern Pennsylvania. Recent rains had
    </p>
    <p>
     swelled the brooks and expanded the ponds. The wide undulations of
    </p>
    <p>
     hills and vales were radiant in verdure, responding with the alacrity
    </p>
    <p>
     of new vegetation to the encouragement of the skies, that now in a
    </p>
    <p>
     broad arch of fleckless blue, seemed to bend over them in pride and
    </p>
    <p>
     emulation. A thousand pictures of loveliness, of homely domestic
    </p>
    <p>
     bliss, of agricultural plenty, of bucolic thrift and retirement, met
    </p>
    <p>
     their eyes, and Leacraft himself found a solace to his grieved soul
    </p>
    <p>
     in resting his eyes upon spots of soft and uninjured beauty, wherein
    </p>
    <p>
     nature and the gentle craft of pastoral life combined their artless
    </p>
    <p>
     charms to make the landscape serene and inviting to the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was almost with regret that they left the train at Gettysburg.
    </p>
    <p>
     The noise or motion of the cars, and the uninterrupted succession of
    </p>
    <p>
     pleasant views from their windows had prevented conversation, in which
    </p>
    <p>
     none of them, from preoccupation, or from anxiety, from, in one person
    </p>
    <p>
     at least, sadness, or from, in this case to be exact, two persons,
    </p>
    <p>
     extreme happiness, cared to enter. And when Gettysburg was itself
    </p>
    <p>
     finally encountered, they found it in the last spasms of inordinate
    </p>
    <p>
     repletion. The most exorbitant greed of guide and hackman, guide-book
    </p>
    <p>
     man, publican and popcorn or peanut vendor, was abashed before a
    </p>
    <p>
     popular consumption that threatened to drive them into a confession
    </p>
    <p>
     of impotency. Everything that had cubic capacity, whether it moved or
    </p>
    <p>
     stood still, whether it was a vehicle or a house, was aching under
    </p>
    <p>
     the intolerable pressure of its human contents. Everywhere clouds of
    </p>
    <p>
     flags decorated the air. The houses were beribboned and beflagged,
    </p>
    <p>
     and innumerable lines crossing the streets in a web of suspensory
    </p>
    <p>
     confusion, carried pennants and pictures to the last limits of their
    </p>
    <p>
     carrying capacity, and to the bewilderment unutterable and admiration
    </p>
    <p>
     unrepressed of the crowds beneath them. These crowds had become almost
    </p>
    <p>
     stagnant because of the crowds in front of them, and these in turn
    </p>
    <p>
     by reason of other crowds in front of them, until the successional
    </p>
    <p>
     torpor seemed to reach out of sight, and presumably ended in some
    </p>
    <p>
     greater peripheral crowd, which, having attained its appointed place by
    </p>
    <p>
     choice or selection, refused to budge. To make their way, was almost
    </p>
    <p>
     impossible to the visitors, whether they besought the services of a
    </p>
    <p>
     driver, or tried the painful expedient of threading the human mass on
    </p>
    <p>
     foot. In this extremity they simply remained where they were at first
    </p>
    <p>
     arriving, hoping either the slow motion of the democratic assemblage
    </p>
    <p>
     would afford them some sort of escape, or at some critical moment
    </p>
    <p>
     the vast throng would resolve itself into dispersion, and under the
    </p>
    <p>
     influence of direction or force, get itself better adjusted to the
    </p>
    <p>
     requirements of its individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, it was understood by all the published programmes of that day’s
    </p>
    <p>
     exercises that the address of the President was to be delivered at
    </p>
    <p>
     that historic spot known as the High Water Mark, which marks the
    </p>
    <p>
     uprushing tide, the foaming crest and insurmountable limit of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Rebellion, which thereafter receded in wavering surges to the south.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the great reservation, devoted as a monument to the battle which
    </p>
    <p>
     saved the Union, this spot is central, and the acres stretched about it
    </p>
    <p>
     would accommodate an army. It was quite inexplicable why this annoying
    </p>
    <p>
     interference and congestion prevailed. It turned out to be a military
    </p>
    <p>
     precaution. The President was to be installed safely at the speaker’s
    </p>
    <p>
     stand, escorted by veterans of the north and south, before the people
    </p>
    <p>
     should be permitted to assemble around him, and a cordon of military
    </p>
    <p>
     enclosed the little village, keeping confined within it the straining
    </p>
    <p>
     and impatient visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
     The village of Gettysburg, which was used in the great battle as
    </p>
    <p>
     a hospital, and which entirely escaped injury in the three days’
    </p>
    <p>
     conflict, was more than a mile away from the place chosen for the
    </p>
    <p>
     ceremonies of the day. When the dam was removed it was seen there would
    </p>
    <p>
     be a dangerous stampede for position. Music, too, swept exhilaratingly
    </p>
    <p>
     over the throngs from the distant scene of the festivities, and its
    </p>
    <p>
     martial notes awakened to desperation the disappointed and vexed
    </p>
    <p>
     multitude. The large numbers twisted and irksomely tied up within the
    </p>
    <p>
     narrow streets, and turbulently mixed up on the little square of the
    </p>
    <p>
     village, groaned aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
     Voices suddenly rose high in altercation and abuse. A farmer whose
    </p>
    <p>
     rickety wagon, laden with his sons and daughters, had got packed
    </p>
    <p>
     between a curb and a particularly dense fragment of the crowd, made up
    </p>
    <p>
     of vituperative young men, and was in almost certain danger of being
    </p>
    <p>
     upset, was engaged in a lusty expostulation not unassisted by the quick
    </p>
    <p>
     and sharp lashes of his whip, over the heads of the dodging group. The
    </p>
    <p>
     latter, not averse to some retaliatory measures that might serve the
    </p>
    <p>
     purpose of freeing their general resentment at their imprisonment,
    </p>
    <p>
     attacked the irate proprietor of the wagon and pushed his shivering
    </p>
    <p>
     vehicle over, spilling its screaming and swearing occupants upon the
    </p>
    <p>
     heads of the bystanders, who were utterly unable to escape, and added
    </p>
    <p>
     their din to the commotion.
    </p>
    <p>
     This diversion, attended with laughter, shouts and cries of pain,
    </p>
    <p>
     had nearly subsided, when a new and more alarming disorder arose in
    </p>
    <p>
     the neighborhood of the Garrett party, who had betaken themselves
    </p>
    <p>
     to the porch of one of the souvenir shops. A wandering and aimless
    </p>
    <p>
     dog, suffering from kicks and repulses, had turned on some of its
    </p>
    <p>
     persecutors, and, yelping and snapping with inflamed and frightened
    </p>
    <p>
     eyes, had suddenly been diagnosed, by an inconsiderate observer,
    </p>
    <p>
     as “_mad_.” This information, as usually, proclaimed in a loud,
    </p>
    <p>
     denunciatory tone, raised in a second an indescribable hubbub. Room to
    </p>
    <p>
     run from the bewildered canine was not to be found, and the only thing
    </p>
    <p>
     to do for those in the vicinity, was to squeeze more violently against
    </p>
    <p>
     their companions, leaving a slender and irregular space in which the
    </p>
    <p>
     dog gyrated, biting at friend and foe alike. The undulous area of
    </p>
    <p>
     movement thus formed swayed to and fro, with the distracted struggles
    </p>
    <p>
     of the dog, and soon swung violently towards the Garretts, who became
    </p>
    <p>
     rudely jolted and pressed by frantic men and women, in whose legs
    </p>
    <p>
     apprehension of the dog’s teeth seemed to have produced extraordinary
    </p>
    <p>
     motions, for they shuffled and kicked and scrambled in a way very
    </p>
    <p>
     undignified and ridiculous. The upshot of it was to drive a frenzied
    </p>
    <p>
     pack of people towards the souvenir shop, in the hope of entering the
    </p>
    <p>
     shop, and evading the wretched canine somewhere beneath their skirts
    </p>
    <p>
     and trousers--an absurd design, as the shop itself was solid with
    </p>
    <p>
     condensed humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Brig Barry saw the danger, and quickly hustling Sally and Mrs. Garrett
    </p>
    <p>
     between the men of his party, told all to stand firmly, after knitting
    </p>
    <p>
     their arms within each other, forming an elastic and impenetrable wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     As it was, the colliding tides around them sent them on an unexpected
    </p>
    <p>
     orbit of translation, and a few minutes later they found themselves
    </p>
    <p>
     pushed towards the trolley tracks, not far from the dishevelled and
    </p>
    <p>
     malign looking local hotel, but in a less exposed and stormy quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
     And now a marvellous change took place. The barriers were down; the
    </p>
    <p>
     rolled up soldiers opened the avenues of approach; the President,
    </p>
    <p>
     members of his Cabinet, the Commissioners of the Reservation, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     veterans of the North and the South, were in place, and the delayed
    </p>
    <p>
     populace, released from its confinement, with instantaneous expansion,
    </p>
    <p>
     hurried over the roads and fields to the station of the High Water
    </p>
    <p>
     Mark on Cemetery Ridge. It was a picturesque spectacle. When the
    </p>
    <p>
     condensation was removed, it became apparent in how much splendor the
    </p>
    <p>
     girls and women of the country and the near and distant towns had
    </p>
    <p>
     been arrayed. They came from Harrisburg, from Emittsburg, along the
    </p>
    <p>
     fatal road that Longstreet’s rangers followed, from Taneytown, from
    </p>
    <p>
     Hagerstown, where Lee’s army had its rendezvous before the battle
    </p>
    <p>
     of Seminary Ridge; from Chambersburg, which Ewell had dragooned;
    </p>
    <p>
     from Wrightsville, where Early was balked by the burning of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Susquehanna Bridge, on the 29th of June; from Newville, from Hanover,
    </p>
    <p>
     from Fairfield, the belles and beaux had gathered, and with them no
    </p>
    <p>
     indifferent number of their fathers and mothers. They wore their best
    </p>
    <p>
     ginghams, and calicoes, and silks; the ancient trouseaus, refitted and
    </p>
    <p>
     remade, still imparted the aspect of richness to their wearers, who,
    </p>
    <p>
     ensconced beside their furrowed and tanned husbands, also refurbished,
    </p>
    <p>
     so to speak, with store clothes and a rainbow neck-tie, felt the
    </p>
    <p>
     novelty of life return, and something of the freshness of the glad
    </p>
    <p>
     morning of existence. The girls were most happy and the boys voluble
    </p>
    <p>
     and attentive. The caravan of vehicles would have tasked the vocabulary
    </p>
    <p>
     of Tattersalls, though it was not altogether so remarkable for the
    </p>
    <p>
     variety of its contents as the indefinite suggestion of varied ages in
    </p>
    <p>
     its parts. And here and there some time-worn carryall creaking under
    </p>
    <p>
     the infliction of an unusual load, and drawn by some Rosinante, whose
    </p>
    <p>
     feeble gait and frequent halts betokened a sad contemporaneity with the
    </p>
    <p>
     vehicle itself, offered a pathetic note in the hurrying splendor of the
    </p>
    <p>
     congregated regalia of the barn and stable and garage.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Garretts, once extricated from their embarrassed position, armed
    </p>
    <p>
     with passports, one in the hands of Brig Barry, and a special card in
    </p>
    <p>
     the possession of Mr. Garrett, as guest of the Chamber of Commerce of
    </p>
    <p>
     Baltimore, had little difficulty in securing the essential indulgences
    </p>
    <p>
     for a delightful day. In a three-seated coach wagon, with a splendid
    </p>
    <p>
     team of horses, they bowled along as far as the beginning of Hancock
    </p>
    <p>
     avenue, which leads from the National Cemetery to the Round Tops. Here
    </p>
    <p>
     they alighted and surveyed the wondrous scene. It was resplendent. A
    </p>
    <p>
     sun burning with the soft brilliancy of June bathed the grand distances
    </p>
    <p>
     towards the Blue Hills in light, while the Blue Hills themselves
    </p>
    <p>
     receded with artistic forbearance behind an atmosphere that veiled
    </p>
    <p>
     them in an evanescent purple and yet seemed to magnify their height.
    </p>
    <p>
     The slopes of Cemetery Ridge were covered by people, and the lower
    </p>
    <p>
     levels where the Codori farm buildings stood; the Peach Orchard, where
    </p>
    <p>
     Sickles and Longstreet met for the mastery; the grain field beyond,
    </p>
    <p>
     over whose long stretches Pickett’s charge was made, were filled with
    </p>
    <p>
     moving groups. The distant woods, the nearer groves, the grassy
    </p>
    <p>
     fields, Little and Big Round Top, all were transfigured in the golden
    </p>
    <p>
     blaze, and the innumerable monuments that gave the park-like Ridge a
    </p>
    <p>
     sort of scenic artifice, seemed to become accordant, in the vastness
    </p>
    <p>
     of the panorama, with its natural and simple features. The farm lands,
    </p>
    <p>
     the white houses, dotting fields, or emerging with human interest
    </p>
    <p>
     from lines of shadowing trees, the peace of the distant perspective,
    </p>
    <p>
     accorded a welcome contrast to the foreground of the picture, immersed
    </p>
    <p>
     in the waves of a popular assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Automobiles flying like clouds rushed along the far away roads,
    </p>
    <p>
     bicycles in undulating and streaming lines, grew large with rapid
    </p>
    <p>
     approach; the gathering spots of people merged together and became
    </p>
    <p>
     irregular squares, the squares united and became tracts, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     tracts, by an incessant accretion, coincided along their edges until
    </p>
    <p>
     Cemetery Ridge, the slopes towards Little Round Top and the field below
    </p>
    <p>
     the “angle,” where Cushing and Armistead died, were unbrokenly covered
    </p>
    <p>
     with the vast congregation, pulsating ceaselessly by an interior
    </p>
    <p>
     agitation everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
     The heterogeneous assortment of conveyances were halted near the
    </p>
    <p>
     National Cemetery, and the people made their way to the enclosure,
    </p>
    <p>
     where the President was to address them, along the triumphal
    </p>
    <p>
     monument-enfiladed boulevard of Hancock avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Garrett party had noticed the earnestness and apparent
    </p>
    <p>
     preoccupation of the people. The news of the previous night had spread
    </p>
    <p>
     its sinister announcements through the papers of the country, carried
    </p>
    <p>
     to every village on the myriad fingered currents of the telegraph. It
    </p>
    <p>
     had left its impress in the serious, sombre and sometimes dully frowned
    </p>
    <p>
     faces of the men. “I feel sorry for the President,” said Sally. “The
    </p>
    <p>
     Canal seemed almost himself, and the people thought of it and him
    </p>
    <p>
     together. What will he do?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “The President,” answered Ned Garrett, “will not flinch. Ever since he
    </p>
    <p>
     went down to the Isthmus in 1906, and made the dirt fly, he has watched
    </p>
    <p>
     the Canal with his whole heart in it. He knew what it meant for the
    </p>
    <p>
     country, for the world, and now”--the speaker hesitated--“he will know
    </p>
    <p>
     what to say and do. How I believe in that man!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But I can’t see,” continued Brig Barry, “that the idea of the Canal is
    </p>
    <p>
     lost. Let us suppose there is a shifting and readjustment down there.
    </p>
    <p>
     The two oceans are left behind, not much different, and if the isthmus
    </p>
    <p>
     breaks down, splits up, and goes to thunder, there’s water enough to
    </p>
    <p>
     cover the remains, and we have the Canal anyway.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But it isn’t our Canal any more,” ejaculated Sally. “It seems,” said
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Garrett, “as if our grief had been premature. There is enough to
    </p>
    <p>
     worry over in this frightful catastrophe, and its limits no one to-day
    </p>
    <p>
     can correctly estimate, but as Brig says, the Canal idea is saved,
    </p>
    <p>
     or at least it seems reasonable to believe that it may be. If Nature
    </p>
    <p>
     makes a bigger canal, if she changes the face of the earth enough, as
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft told us last night, to unite the oceans and make a strait, the
    </p>
    <p>
     commercial union of the western and eastern continents is secured on a
    </p>
    <p>
     larger scale. Perhaps our national pride must suffer some, but the fact
    </p>
    <p>
     remains, though, it would have saved our exchequer a handsome outlay,
    </p>
    <p>
     if nature, consulting our financial happiness, had done her work a
    </p>
    <p>
     little earlier.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “If we’d only waited,” sighed Mrs. Garrett, ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
     They had reached the edges of the throngs who stood in the sun,
    </p>
    <p>
     engrossing every coigne of vantage, and an orderly, examining their
    </p>
    <p>
     tickets, conducted them through a narrow lane of envious gazers to
    </p>
    <p>
     a stand of seats to the south of the President’s rostrum. From this
    </p>
    <p>
     position their eyes fell directly upon the amazing outpouring of the
    </p>
    <p>
     people, an ocean of individuals, hopelessly cancelled from any chance
    </p>
    <p>
     to hear the President’s voice, yet extending outward in a solemn
    </p>
    <p>
     silence, and but furtively invaded by those busy concomitants of such
    </p>
    <p>
     public gatherings--button men and popcorn merchants. For the most part
    </p>
    <p>
     such annoyances were inordinately thrust aside, but scurrying over the
    </p>
    <p>
     most distant outposts of the mammoth audience, their eager shapes
    </p>
    <p>
     were seen, and inconstantly, borne inward by the breeze, the shrill
    </p>
    <p>
     invitation of their voices was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft fixed his eyes upon the President, and he was near enough to
    </p>
    <p>
     him to note his expression. President Roosevelt sat squarely facing
    </p>
    <p>
     the people--now crushing in with an irresistible impulse from the
    </p>
    <p>
     distributed masses before him. He seemed serious, at moments almost
    </p>
    <p>
     solemnly so, at others he turned to his companions with alacrity, and
    </p>
    <p>
     his face even smiled at some allusion or whispered comment. Again his
    </p>
    <p>
     eyes wandered dreamily--Leacraft thought sadly--to his notes, and then
    </p>
    <p>
     he moved restlessly and leaned forward, and even half rose, eagerly
    </p>
    <p>
     scanning the expectant faces. A jumping up of half a dozen men at the
    </p>
    <p>
     rear of the platform, a signal of a waved handkerchief, followed, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the band, stationed somewhere behind the distinguished occupants of the
    </p>
    <p>
     platform, began the Star Spangled Banner. Everyone not already standing
    </p>
    <p>
     rose, heads even uncovered, and the spirited strains seized by the
    </p>
    <p>
     concourse, were flung back in a torrent of vocality, that sounded like
    </p>
    <p>
     the far and near thunder of the ocean’s surges. It was overwhelming.
    </p>
    <p>
     As if before the spirit of the Nation, the living and the dead;
    </p>
    <p>
     those whose discarnate beings might seem rushing in upon them from
    </p>
    <p>
     the viewless depths of space, summoned again to the fields of their
    </p>
    <p>
     endeavor by the marshall air, hats were doffed in all directions,
    </p>
    <p>
     until scarcely a covered head among the men remained, and many eyes
    </p>
    <p>
     streamed with irrepressible tears. The note of a requiem, the prouder
    </p>
    <p>
     challenge of defiance, the lofty questioning of Hope, the loving
    </p>
    <p>
     clasp of fraternal patriotism, the aspirations of a race, solving
    </p>
    <p>
     “in the foremost files of time” the problem of the world’s political
    </p>
    <p>
     creed, seemed blended together, in the avalanche of sound. And it was
    </p>
    <p>
     maintained to the end, even the verses of the national anthem were well
    </p>
    <p>
     remembered, and that trying and unattainable high note, like the scream
    </p>
    <p>
     of the eagle, which closes the lips of most singers in dubious apathy,
    </p>
    <p>
     was now sustained. The President sang lustily, and then he stopped, his
    </p>
    <p>
     head bowed; he might have been in prayer. It was noticed by all and it
    </p>
    <p>
     almost seemed as if the music quailed and sank before the mystery of a
    </p>
    <p>
     man’s outpoured petition to his God.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was over. The music ceased, the frail voice of the chairman sounded
    </p>
    <p>
     its quavering invitation to prayer, and a clergyman arose and droned an
    </p>
    <p>
     invocation. The President was introduced and stood forward. He was well
    </p>
    <p>
     in view. One hand grasped the railing before him, the other clutched
    </p>
    <p>
     some separated papers, he looked well and the man’s vitality, his
    </p>
    <p>
     zealous unmitigated self exaction were realized. As he was seen, the
    </p>
    <p>
     tumult rose to a tremendous climax, cheers rolled forward and backward
    </p>
    <p>
     like the fluctuating billows of a sea; they receded to the outer
    </p>
    <p>
     margins far toward the Hagerstown road, where they vanished in murmurs,
    </p>
    <p>
     they crashed inward in volleying thunders, and the President stood
    </p>
    <p>
     erect, nerved to a steel-like rigidity; the air was swept with flags,
    </p>
    <p>
     the intoxication of the emotion increased, women palled before it, and
    </p>
    <p>
     men grew pale with the delirium of sudden enthusiasm. It seemed as if
    </p>
    <p>
     music alone could lead them back into the resignation of attention. It
    </p>
    <p>
     was a stupendous tribute. The man to whom it was given, had no reason
    </p>
    <p>
     for misgiving, no retributive judgments for his actions, to dread.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly, very slowly the cheering and cries died away, and then ensued a
    </p>
    <p>
     silence as remarkable and as impressive. The two contrasted states of
    </p>
    <p>
     the multitude might have been interpreted as a generous invitation to
    </p>
    <p>
     the man to speak, and as a judicial reservation of mind as to its own
    </p>
    <p>
     verdict when he had spoken. It almost seemed so, and the quick heart of
    </p>
    <p>
     the President might again have felt the palpitation of a doubt, whether
    </p>
    <p>
     he stood approved, or a critical people withdrew into the refuge of
    </p>
    <p>
     an impartial scrutiny. Leacraft felt all this, and he could not help
    </p>
    <p>
     also feeling a curious interest in the purely psychological enigma it
    </p>
    <p>
     presented.
    </p>
    <p>
     The President was speaking; his voice reached Leacraft thin and sharp:
    </p>
    <p>
     “My friends,” he began, “To-day we celebrate again the brave deaths
    </p>
    <p>
     of brave men, and the sacrifices they made for the maintenance of our
    </p>
    <p>
     common country. And we are gathered together on the battlefield which
    </p>
    <p>
     more than any other battlefield in that historic war, represented the
    </p>
    <p>
     culminating energies of both sides, the last vital contention for
    </p>
    <p>
     the mastery. These men left behind them the inestimable example of
    </p>
    <p>
     fortitude. And after the battle of Gettysburg it was more difficult
    </p>
    <p>
     for the southern man to continue the fight, in the face of disaster,
    </p>
    <p>
     with a depleted country behind him, and a foe flushed with victory,
    </p>
    <p>
     and drawing upon almost illimitable resources, than for his northern
    </p>
    <p>
     brother, for whom at last the tide of war seemed to have turned. We
    </p>
    <p>
     to-day need the lesson of this fortitude of the man in gray.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My friends, a disaster has overtaken us,”--the crowd before the
    </p>
    <p>
     President seemed to compress itself in a further effort to get closer
    </p>
    <p>
     to him, “and it is our duty to remain firm and unfalteringly confident.
    </p>
    <p>
     I can scarcely doubt that you all have heard that nature has destroyed
    </p>
    <p>
     the Nation’s work. The face of the earth at the Isthmus of Panama is
    </p>
    <p>
     altered. Our work, our expenditures, the lives of thousands of hard
    </p>
    <p>
     working men have been sacrificed, and we stand aghast before a natural
    </p>
    <p>
     revolution unequaled in our day, unparalled perhaps in all the annals
    </p>
    <p>
     of history; something which in its wide devastating power, crushes our
    </p>
    <p>
     pride, and for a moment makes us cease to think, to plan, to build. I
    </p>
    <p>
     come to you this morning with strange tidings--tidings so unspeakably
    </p>
    <p>
     great in their influence upon our knowledge, that I almost hesitate to
    </p>
    <p>
     pronounce them, lest I might find myself the victim of some horrible
    </p>
    <p>
     and wicked hoax. The Isthmus of Panama, from Quibo Island in Montijo
    </p>
    <p>
     Bay, on the west, to the confines of the valley of the Atrato River
    </p>
    <p>
     at the edge of the Columbia, on the east, is deviously, here with a
    </p>
    <p>
     regular movement of depression, in another place with violent shock,
    </p>
    <p>
     sinking beneath the waters of the opposite encroaching oceans that
    </p>
    <p>
     swings backward and forward on either side in awful tidal deluges.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The latest news confirms all the previous reports. Slowly, surely,
    </p>
    <p>
     even with hastening steps, the narrow neck of Panama, with its
    </p>
    <p>
     shallow shores, its long exposure of swamp and mud flats, with its
    </p>
    <p>
     crumbling hills, covered with tropical life will be engulfed, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     two continents of North and South America will return to a pristine
    </p>
    <p>
     condition of geographical autonomy. It is hard to believe. I cannot
    </p>
    <p>
     recount to you the wonderful pictures, terror-inspiring, and yet
    </p>
    <p>
     majestic with the majesty of Nature’s awful deeds, which have been sent
    </p>
    <p>
     to us. The loss of life has been considerable, but not proportionate
    </p>
    <p>
     to the stupendous agencies involved. After the first earthquake
    </p>
    <p>
     upheavals, the quickly succeeding disappearance of the solid ground
    </p>
    <p>
     furnished an adequate warning, and the populations along the canal-way
    </p>
    <p>
     at the villages and camps, and at Aspinwall and Panama, retreated to
    </p>
    <p>
     the hills, and with them the animal life, in a singular copartnership
    </p>
    <p>
     of fear. It is now regarded as certain, that we are about to see the
    </p>
    <p>
     last vestiges of the canal itself, the work of these last four years
    </p>
    <p>
     disappearing in the folding in and submergence of the rock strata.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The President then told the story of the catastrophe as it had been
    </p>
    <p>
     narrated in the despatches received at the White House. He painted in
    </p>
    <p>
     graphic words the shaking down of the hills, the dislodged blankets
    </p>
    <p>
     slipping from the hill sides like a shawl from a shuddering woman,
    </p>
    <p>
     carrying with them the crashing trees, the jungle growth, the entwined
    </p>
    <p>
     tendrilous creepers and vines, while above the trees, swaying toward
    </p>
    <p>
     each other and then outward as if following the crests and troughs
    </p>
    <p>
     of hidden waves, above these tottering trees, the birds in screaming
    </p>
    <p>
     volleys rose and fell. The bared rocks showed rents, and tremendous
    </p>
    <p>
     explosions sent their shattered fragments into the air, while long
    </p>
    <p>
     weird groans issued from the ground as if the buried foundations of the
    </p>
    <p>
     hills were undergoing the tortures of mutilation. In other places it
    </p>
    <p>
     had been quite different. The ground slowly seemed to melt away, and
    </p>
    <p>
     with a sort of shuddering succession of chills the land disappears.
    </p>
    <p>
     How long, how much further this swallowing up of the land will go no
    </p>
    <p>
     one can tell. But it has seemed to those who have some knowledge of
    </p>
    <p>
     the region that it may embrace the S shaped Isthmus only, and that the
    </p>
    <p>
     tapering ends of the bulwarks of elevation in the Rocky Mountain chain
    </p>
    <p>
     on the north, and the Andes on the south will resist this degradation,
    </p>
    <p>
     that Costa Rica on the north and Columbia on the south will rudely
    </p>
    <p>
     define the north and south edges of the new avenue or gateway of unions
    </p>
    <p>
     between the oceans, that the new canal in this way, reconstructed
    </p>
    <p>
     by the titanic convulsions of nature, will become a wide and useful
    </p>
    <p>
     passage for commerce.
    </p>
    <p>
     The President indulged the evident curiosity of his popular audience
    </p>
    <p>
     in a scientific discourse. His own interest was evident. He discussed
    </p>
    <p>
     earthquakes; he plunged into an essay on volcanoes; he spread
    </p>
    <p>
     luminously before the people the theories of the pear-shaped earth,
    </p>
    <p>
     the slipping of faults, the loading of the earth’s crust, the original
    </p>
    <p>
     formation of the deep creases in the earth’s surface, which now held
    </p>
    <p>
     its gathered waters. The President made a model expositor. He was clear
    </p>
    <p>
     and interesting. His style, his illustrative similes were attractive
    </p>
    <p>
     and deliberately helpful. It was almost amusing to note the contrasted
    </p>
    <p>
     effect of this improvised academic demonstration upon the people and
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the political sages of the platform. The former were attentive and
    </p>
    <p>
     absorbed. Their faces lit up with the quiet pleasure of intelligent
    </p>
    <p>
     appreciation, frequently at some pungent expression that pictured to
    </p>
    <p>
     them in stirring forcible photographic phrase the stifling struggle of
    </p>
    <p>
     land and water, the fierce unrest far down there in the tropics, which
    </p>
    <p>
     was unsettling the foundations of the earth, and slowly establishing a
    </p>
    <p>
     new order of things, pregnant with revolution in the day and fate of
    </p>
    <p>
     nations, carrying in its geological material insensate womb of meaning
    </p>
    <p>
     the dissolution of states, the upset and consternation of rulers,
    </p>
    <p>
     a menace to civilization, the ruthless unwavering threat to human
    </p>
    <p>
     accidents and institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
     To all this the political magnates listened with bored indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
     They expected a party appeal, some appetizing bid for popular suffrage,
    </p>
    <p>
     a shot at the South, a resounding puff for the Republican candidates,
    </p>
    <p>
     a public acknowledgement of their personal industry in securing the
    </p>
    <p>
     re-election of himself, new projects of expenditure, and a programme
    </p>
    <p>
     of national expansion. They turned and twisted, and some deliberately
    </p>
    <p>
     slept or engaged in low conversations with an expressive irony of
    </p>
    <p>
     shrugs and smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
     The President paused, his hands came together, and he leaned far
    </p>
    <p>
     forward, and a moment’s hesitancy marked the termination of his
    </p>
    <p>
     scientific periods. He continued, with sudden earnestness and vigour,
    </p>
    <p>
     with almost self-surrender to the impetus of his thought: “My friends,
    </p>
    <p>
     these are the facts, and no lamentations can change them. We must
    </p>
    <p>
     learn from the courage and devotion of the men who left this field
    </p>
    <p>
     defeated, to face this new predicament, not with resignation, simply,
    </p>
    <p>
     but with the constructive determination to seize this new turn in
    </p>
    <p>
     events and force it into our service, to make it only a more complete
    </p>
    <p>
     realization of our first designs. This is the triumph of Opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus shall we wrest from the confusion of chance its empire of the
    </p>
    <p>
     fitting moment, and drive its scattered impulses into the straight, the
    </p>
    <p>
     narrow path of our strictest needs. The canal as a commercial necessity
    </p>
    <p>
     cannot be eclipsed or abandoned. The original project is replaced.
    </p>
    <p>
     Replaced by something greater, more permanent, more cosmopolitan. It
    </p>
    <p>
     becomes no longer a provincial fact, a national asset simply. It is a
    </p>
    <p>
     feature of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What exactly has happened, how complete is the transformation no one
    </p>
    <p>
     exactly knows, but if the assistance of engineering is still to be
    </p>
    <p>
     invoked it can only be in a way of a help to nature. The facts remain.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And now my friends a stranger possibility confronts us, nay it lifts
    </p>
    <p>
     up a sinister and awful, an ominous portent for the leading nations of
    </p>
    <p>
     the world. It seems likely that this physical alteration may mean a
    </p>
    <p>
     change in the climate of the older portion of the earth.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Again the President launched into a scientific lecture and he was
    </p>
    <p>
     fortunate, as at first, as alertly careful, as broadly popular, as
    </p>
    <p>
     adroitly technical, without obscurity. It was well received. And its
    </p>
    <p>
     conclusion was altogether wonderful. Leacraft had good reason to listen
    </p>
    <p>
     with all his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
     The President described the contrasted temperatures of similar
    </p>
    <p>
     latitudes in Europe and America, how England on the latitude of
    </p>
    <p>
     Labrador was warmer than New York which found its Adirondack
    </p>
    <p>
     mountains--chilled in the depth of winter to almost forty degrees
    </p>
    <p>
     below zero--on the same degree as southern France; itself the type
    </p>
    <p>
     and synonym of warmth. He made it clear how the thermal flood of warm
    </p>
    <p>
     waters upon the shores of Europe--heating the drifting airs above it
    </p>
    <p>
     till, laden with moisture, they too added their gifts of rain and
    </p>
    <p>
     warmth to Great Britain, and the shores of Scandinavia; how this Gulf
    </p>
    <p>
     Stream, a wayward impressionable wandering river pushing past Florida
    </p>
    <p>
     with a cubic capacity of seven hundred thousand cubic feet of water in
    </p>
    <p>
     half a second of time, and, held in its fluctuating course by the laws
    </p>
    <p>
     of gravity, how this marvellous oceanic flood, controlled the material
    </p>
    <p>
     conditions of England’s greatness; grasped, as it were, in the filmy
    </p>
    <p>
     fingers of its webbed and spreading tides, its wealth, its maritime
    </p>
    <p>
     supremacy, its intellectual distinction, its domestic thrift, and sunny
    </p>
    <p>
     sweetness. And then the President ended, and Leacraft bent forward,
    </p>
    <p>
     gripped the railing before him with sudden fierceness, a knell
    </p>
    <p>
     strangely appalling sounded in his ears, a portent widely distracting
    </p>
    <p>
     and unreasonable drove the color from his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
     The President ended with these words: “The Gulf Stream whipped into
    </p>
    <p>
     violent activity by the south east trade winds beats impetuously upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the islands of the West Indies, washes the beaches of Central America,
    </p>
    <p>
     and whirls its spinning tides within the Gulf of Mexico, and then,
    </p>
    <p>
     repulsed by the continuous shore lines of North America, returns to
    </p>
    <p>
     Europe bearing its mantle of verdure to be thrown over the hills, the
    </p>
    <p>
     capes, the valleys the western edges and islands of the Old World.
    </p>
    <p>
     But now the barrier is gone. The Gulf Stream before the strong and
    </p>
    <p>
     rapacious winds is no longer turned aside by impossible walls of land
    </p>
    <p>
     but triumphantly sweeps into the Pacific, and with it vanishes the
    </p>
    <p>
     glory of England. For ourselves it means singular disaster though it
    </p>
    <p>
     may bring compensating changes. If England disappears as a world power
    </p>
    <p>
     we are robbed of a friend, we have lost a market. What words shall
    </p>
    <p>
     measure the moral meaning of the first, what revenues express the
    </p>
    <p>
     yearly increasing value of the latter. We stand on the threshold of a
    </p>
    <p>
     New Era.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The termination of this remarkable address was its most momentous
    </p>
    <p>
     and unexpected announcement. As the President sat down, there was
    </p>
    <p>
     no applause, just a ripple of clapping hands as a half-hearted
    </p>
    <p>
     recognition of an invariable habit. The speech had been utterly
    </p>
    <p>
     robbed of political significance, despoiled of rhetorical or personal
    </p>
    <p>
     emphasis, it failed entirely as the usual thing in public oratory,
    </p>
    <p>
     and it left behind it an oppressive sense of impending changes.
    </p>
    <p>
     The President seemed depressed by his own vaticinations, and those
    </p>
    <p>
     around him, chilled into anxious forebodings, sat stiffly silent and
    </p>
    <p>
     unresponsive. The moment was saved from intolerable embarrassment by
    </p>
    <p>
     the band.
    </p>
    <p>
     The leader stepped forward, waved his baton and the solemn strains
    </p>
    <p>
     of America--the transplanted hymn of England--rose plaintively,
    </p>
    <p>
     like a prayer; to Leacraft it sounded like encouragement, like
    </p>
    <p>
     sympathy. Someone began to sing--hats came off, the guests rose, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the multitude sang. If the Star Spangled Banner had been exultant
    </p>
    <p>
     and triumphant, thronged with the memories of achievement and
    </p>
    <p>
     victory--America throbbed with supplication, and underneath the
    </p>
    <p>
     supplication, the fervor of allegiance, sacrifice and love. The
    </p>
    <p>
     peculiar awkwardness of an unusual, an unique predicament, was removed.
    </p>
    <p>
     The speakers following the President made no allusion to the Canal,
    </p>
    <p>
     and all the marvellous happenings far away in Central America. They
    </p>
    <p>
     led the people’s thought back again to the soil they stood upon, to
    </p>
    <p>
     the memories of a glorious past, to the hopes of the future, the
    </p>
    <p>
     realization of the present tasks, the reiteration of the nation’s
    </p>
    <p>
     wealth and happiness, its strength under misfortune, its illimitable
    </p>
    <p>
     resources. They were successful. The pall of misgivings which the
    </p>
    <p>
     President had invoked was lifted. The band broke out again with
    </p>
    <p>
     reassuring liveliness, and good humour and holiday satisfaction revived.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then came a procession through the Reservation to Big Round Top and
    </p>
    <p>
     back again on the lower ground past the Devil’s Den, and over the
    </p>
    <p>
     Emmetsburg road to Gettysburg, and in the clamorous excitement,
    </p>
    <p>
     the parade of uniforms, the brilliant atmosphere, congratulations
    </p>
    <p>
     and convivial indulgence, all the President’s words became clouded
    </p>
    <p>
     and unreal. And if the Isthmus was covered by water, if the Gulf
    </p>
    <p>
     Stream was deflected, if it meant blight for England, what of it?
    </p>
    <p>
     The United States would only become greater--its magnification would
    </p>
    <p>
     be unquestioned, boundless; the stars in their courses worked for
    </p>
    <p>
     them, and the mutations of the earth’s surface only brought to them
    </p>
    <p>
     unrivalled aptitudes for new chances, for new power.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was said a good many times by a good many kinds of men, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     intangible something it suggested, by repetition, assumed the force
    </p>
    <p>
     of demonstration. There was a distinguishable forgetfulness of the
    </p>
    <p>
     disasters that had come, and a listless thought of those that were
    </p>
    <p>
     threatened. A few observant and reflecting minds brooded over the
    </p>
    <p>
     strange catastrophe, and yielded an attention to their implications.
    </p>
    <p>
     This attitude sprang from knowledge, and in the case of Leacraft from
    </p>
    <p>
     a personal interest in the singular sequence of events which the
    </p>
    <p>
     President portrayed, and which even the placidity of an Englishman’s
    </p>
    <p>
     confidence in his destiny failed to contemplate as injurious fiction.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a thing to be reflected upon, at least, and added its sombre
    </p>
    <p>
     influence to deepen the gloom of Leacraft’s disappointment. But it
    </p>
    <p>
     also gradually developed for him a remedial efficacy, not simply as
    </p>
    <p>
     a spurious employment for his thoughts, but through a substantial
    </p>
    <p>
     relevancy to his emotional needs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft’s mental inclinations carried him towards speculative
    </p>
    <p>
     forecasts. He had cultivated his predilections along all sorts of
    </p>
    <p>
     scientific horoscopes, and had enjoyed the indulgence of his fancy
    </p>
    <p>
     in studying nations and inventions, with a view to composing a plan
    </p>
    <p>
     or description of their future condition, phase and expression. He
    </p>
    <p>
     had arrived at some curious results, but they represented solely
    </p>
    <p>
     the changed surface of society, in its industrial, civic or social
    </p>
    <p>
     states, or else, in their more immaterial flights, pictured the
    </p>
    <p>
     enduring alterations of religious or philosophic systems. In all
    </p>
    <p>
     these speculations he had quite neglected the physical constants of
    </p>
    <p>
     the world, its climate and topography. His thought engaged itself
    </p>
    <p>
     with the mechanical structure of civilization, as affected by new
    </p>
    <p>
     discoveries, allied with an increasing utilitarianism, in which the
    </p>
    <p>
     individual vanishes before the imperious supervention of the State, the
    </p>
    <p>
     incorporated multitude, the abstract Wisdom of the most knowing minds,
    </p>
    <p>
     influenced by a solicitous paternalism for the Whole.
    </p>
    <p>
     But now he found himself confronted by a new exigency, the geological
    </p>
    <p>
     interferences of Nature, and it piqued his curiosity, it assailed his
    </p>
    <p>
     fancy with indubitable fascination. By reason of his intellectual
    </p>
    <p>
     proneness to these questions, which quite deeply occupied his mind, he
    </p>
    <p>
     felt at this moment that the tremendous and supreme chance of his own
    </p>
    <p>
     mighty nation, succumbing to the accidents of a tidal caprice might
    </p>
    <p>
     offer him an alternative refuge of interest which would help to dull
    </p>
    <p>
     the pain of his misfortune. So convulsing a spectacle as the pitiless
    </p>
    <p>
     war of nature upon the embedded bulwarks of a great commercial nation’s
    </p>
    <p>
     prosperity, terrified him as a possible historical fact. Above all, it
    </p>
    <p>
     terrified him as a British subject. It became so overwhelming in the
    </p>
    <p>
     magnitude of its effects that he shudderingly admitted to himself that
    </p>
    <p>
     his love for Sally suffered a relieving diminution, as though in such
    </p>
    <p>
     events the End of the World seemed precipitated, and all human ties
    </p>
    <p>
     became obliterated, were dissolved.
    </p>
    <p>
     The day closed in resplendent beauty. The sun curtained in a haze,
    </p>
    <p>
     shed a diffused glory through the upper sky, and sank at last in a
    </p>
    <p>
     grating of narrow bars of cloud, that lay across the west like reefs
    </p>
    <p>
     of gold, slowly transmuted into a purple nimbus upon the faintly
    </p>
    <p>
     turquoised ether. The great crowds dispersed, the troops escorted the
    </p>
    <p>
     President away, and music from near and far seemed to mingle dreamily
    </p>
    <p>
     with the mute harmonies of the sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Garretts, with Mr. Leacraft and Brig Barry, returned that night by
    </p>
    <p>
     train to Baltimore. The night proved a sleepless and excited one for
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft. He felt ill at ease. There was much reason for uneasiness
    </p>
    <p>
     and heartache, and the hours passed in a dull series of mournful
    </p>
    <p>
     reflections upon his own trouble, and the immodest threat of nature at
    </p>
    <p>
     the prestige of his people.
    </p>
    <p>
     The next morning he entered the library and found Miss Garrett bending
    </p>
    <p>
     over the morning paper. She looked up as he appeared in the doorway,
    </p>
    <p>
     and there was for both a moment’s hesitation, before the morning’s
    </p>
    <p>
     greeting passed their lips. It was Sally who first spoke, and her voice
    </p>
    <p>
     was eager with alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mr. Leacraft, the President’s lecture--surely, it was nothing else--is
    </p>
    <p>
     all here. And there is more news from the Isthmus. The land is sinking,
    </p>
    <p>
     all sinking, and”--she turned to the paper--“almost all the canal has
    </p>
    <p>
     now disappeared beneath the assault of the waves, and a stormy waste of
    </p>
    <p>
     waters sweeps across the Isthmus of Panama. Isn’t it simply fearful?
    </p>
    <p>
     And nothing can be done.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Miss Garrett,” answered Leacraft slowly, his eyes sadly resting upon
    </p>
    <p>
     her face, grown more beautiful, he thought, by the dwelling of a tender
    </p>
    <p>
     fearfulness in her eyes, “it is a fearful thing; an occurrence such as
    </p>
    <p>
     this is a pretty sharp shock to our sense of security. I can’t forget
    </p>
    <p>
     the President’s words. As an Englishman I really contemplate coming
    </p>
    <p>
     events with a positive terror. But there is something else, Miss Sally,
    </p>
    <p>
     I beg to speak about, another sorrow for me, though I must not permit
    </p>
    <p>
     my selfish regret to cloud your happiness.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Sally Garrett came quite close to Leacraft. She had a true estimate
    </p>
    <p>
     of his strong and dignified nature; she yielded the just homage
    </p>
    <p>
     of affectionate regard, but her heart had never been moved by the
    </p>
    <p>
     Englishman’s impressive seriousness. Leacraft was about to speak
    </p>
    <p>
     again when voices were heard approaching, and among them the vigorous
    </p>
    <p>
     intonations of Brig Barry. Leacraft stopped, and a shadow of suffering
    </p>
    <p>
     crossed his pale face. Sally understood too clearly. She put out her
    </p>
    <p>
     hand and seized his, and pressed it kindly, and Leacraft understood her
    </p>
    <p>
     sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Brig and Ned Garrett came into the room, and soon the discussion of the
    </p>
    <p>
     strange events taking place at the Isthmus occupied the group, to which
    </p>
    <p>
     in a few minutes Mr. and Mrs. Garrett were added.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft shortened his visit under the pretext of an engagement in New
    </p>
    <p>
     York, and it was years after that he again saw Miss Sally Garrett--then
    </p>
    <p>
     become Mrs. Brig Barry--after the stupendous facts on the following
    </p>
    <p>
     pages had made the Kingdom of Great Britain part of the Frozen North.

     CHAPTER V.
    </head>
    <p>
     THE EVICTION OF SCOTLAND.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alexander Leacraft was standing at a window in the upper story of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Caledonia Railroad station in Edinburgh, November 28th, 1909, and
    </p>
    <p>
     was gazing with fixed and tormented eyes upon an unusual scene. The
    </p>
    <p>
     sky beyond Carlton Hill was leaden grey with the blear dullness of a
    </p>
    <p>
     snow-laden atmosphere, and a singular and menacing bar of half-eclipsed
    </p>
    <p>
     red light, like a cooling bar of incandescent iron, shone with
    </p>
    <p>
     irregular palpitations through the descending sheets of snow. It was
    </p>
    <p>
     a strange and appalling picture. Already a week’s precipitation had
    </p>
    <p>
     filled up the deep moat of the Princes’ street gardens, choked up the
    </p>
    <p>
     tracks of the North British Railroad, mounded the ragged edges and
    </p>
    <p>
     wandering parapets of the Citadel, until its outlines were effaced in
    </p>
    <p>
     a colossal accumulation, like a titanic snowball, and a long incline
    </p>
    <p>
     of spotless snow sloped to St. Cuthbert’s Church, itself half buried
    </p>
    <p>
     in the powdery blanket. The blurred lineaments of Calton Hill, so
    </p>
    <p>
     familiar and so beloved by Scotchmen, were uncertainly descried, the
    </p>
    <p>
     Nelson monument, the unfinished peristyle, the mediaeval ranges of the
    </p>
    <p>
     penitentiary, the cheese box summit of the observatory (already the
    </p>
    <p>
     large group of buildings on the Pentland Hills had disappeared from
    </p>
    <p>
     sight), and the classic sombreness of the college fascade. Had Leacraft
    </p>
    <p>
     been near at hand, he would have seen that the monument to Scott--the
    </p>
    <p>
     tribute to one fame by the aspiring genius of another, dead before fame
    </p>
    <p>
     had quite enrolled him in her categories--was deeply buried, and that
    </p>
    <p>
     the inclined head of the Wizard was quickly vanishing under the piled
    </p>
    <p>
     up pillows of billowy snow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alexander held a field-glass in his hand; the window at which he stood
    </p>
    <p>
     was open, and the snow blowing in upon it had raised a mound about
    </p>
    <p>
     his feet. The observer was, however, oblivious to this invasion; he
    </p>
    <p>
     leaned far out, and turned his inspection from point to point with
    </p>
    <p>
     rapid movements and obvious anxiety. A curious thing was happening
    </p>
    <p>
     immediately below him, and astonished him. In the leafless branches
    </p>
    <p>
     of the churchyard trees had gathered a vast concourse of crows, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the black-feathered congress was being momentarily augmented by new
    </p>
    <p>
     arrivals streaming in from all quarters, too evidently dislodged from
    </p>
    <p>
     more natural and habitual resorts. Their discordant cries seemed a
    </p>
    <p>
     melancholy symbol of doom. An awful silence otherwise possessed the
    </p>
    <p>
     Athens of the North. It was practically a deserted city, and its
    </p>
    <p>
     desertion was only part of a widespread calamity which now had begun
    </p>
    <p>
     the shocking chapter of national eviction.
    </p>
    <p>
     The usual hum and bustle of the streets had gone; the tramcars no
    </p>
    <p>
     longer trundled through its streets, and a half-hearted effort to make
    </p>
    <p>
     a path along the centre of Princes street accommodated a few distracted
    </p>
    <p>
     pedestrians and official retainers, yet unwilling to join the army of
    </p>
    <p>
     migration which had slowly moved away from a city, that the pitiless
    </p>
    <p>
     rigor of a new dispensation in climate had doomed to a wintry burial.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alexander Leacraft himself awaited reluctantly the departure of a train
    </p>
    <p>
     of emergency which was expected to carry away the last remnants of
    </p>
    <p>
     Edinburgh’s population. He had come to the unfortunate city freighted
    </p>
    <p>
     with misgivings, when the news reached London--itself experiencing
    </p>
    <p>
     peculiar vicissitudes--of the terrifying severity and earliness of the
    </p>
    <p>
     winter in Scotland. He recalled his forebodings, which the President’s
    </p>
    <p>
     speech had awakened, though the later reports of the complete reversal
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Gulf Stream into the Pacific, and the accomplished destruction
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Central American Neck of land had already stirred the scientific
    </p>
    <p>
     minds of England to the utterance of half-hearted warnings.
    </p>
    <p>
     The matter had now suddenly loomed up into a frightful reality, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     devastating storms sweeping out of the black heart of the north, had
    </p>
    <p>
     brought Scotland, the Faroe Islands and Iceland into a common fate of
    </p>
    <p>
     extinction. The sheltering power of the Gulf Stream was removed from
    </p>
    <p>
     Great Britain, and the frost of the Arctic world, so long repulsed,
    </p>
    <p>
     but now no longer compressed within the Arctic circle, expanded with
    </p>
    <p>
     instantaneous certainty, spreading the shroud of its killing cold over
    </p>
    <p>
     the same latitudes in Europe that for ages had slept beneath its spell
    </p>
    <p>
     in America.
    </p>
    <p>
     The population in part of the north of Scotland had escaped by means
    </p>
    <p>
     of ships to other countries or to southern England. Many villages,
    </p>
    <p>
     isolated houses, and remote districts had suffered cruel hardships,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the entombed bodies of thousands of families waited for a recovery
    </p>
    <p>
     which perhaps only in ages “yet unborn” could come to them. The white
    </p>
    <p>
     burden of snow mantled the valleys and hillsides of Scotland, the
    </p>
    <p>
     higher hills of the Trossachs, and the Grampians, the defiant crest
    </p>
    <p>
     of Goat Fells in Arran, and the twin peaks of the Island of the Holy
    </p>
    <p>
     Mount. Enormous drifts had risen in white waves almost to the summit
    </p>
    <p>
     of Bruce’s monument at Sterling, and the old Abbey of Cambuskenneth
    </p>
    <p>
     had disappeared. Ice of great thickness prevailed in the Clyde, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the movement of the tides had forced it up in threatening hummocks
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the drab stone cottages and villas of Greenock and Gourock. From
    </p>
    <p>
     Aberdeen to Leith the cities had been slowly deserted, after desperate
    </p>
    <p>
     efforts to free them from their entombment. The trains going south
    </p>
    <p>
     to England were loaded with the rich contents of mansions and summer
    </p>
    <p>
     castles; agonizing scenes had been witnessed at a thousand points where
    </p>
    <p>
     the heart-broken people sadly turned their backs upon all they had,
    </p>
    <p>
     and all they loved and knew. Heroic rescues were as numerous as the
    </p>
    <p>
     occasions demanding courage and inflexible daring had been frequent.
    </p>
    <p>
     Throughout Great Britain the trembling soul of the nation shrunk upon
    </p>
    <p>
     itself with a nameless dread, as it suddenly found its existence
    </p>
    <p>
     confronted with the inexorable processes of nature, when the appalling
    </p>
    <p>
     and relentless squadrons of the Ice King, with vengeful speed, issued
    </p>
    <p>
     in all the fierce panoply of wind and hideous life-killing cold, from
    </p>
    <p>
     the last tenements of their abode, to slay a prosperous and proud
    </p>
    <p>
     people.
    </p>
    <p>
     Europe felt a sickening doubt as to the permanence of its life and
    </p>
    <p>
     works, and the autumn brought the shrewd and eager fingers of the cold
    </p>
    <p>
     into the streets and houses of Hamburg, Berlin, Cologne, Antwerp,
    </p>
    <p>
     Amsterdam, Ostend, Havre and even Paris. Attention to the vaticinations
    </p>
    <p>
     of science was mingled with the prophetic denunciations of religious
    </p>
    <p>
     frenzy. Pallor marked the features of the rulers of the people, and
    </p>
    <p>
     speechless stupor had seized the common people, who looked to the
    </p>
    <p>
     skies in pitiful confidence that their misery and desolation would
    </p>
    <p>
     touch the heart of that inscrutable Providence, who, reigning beyond
    </p>
    <p>
     the stars, held the reins of the winds and the bit of the frost in his
    </p>
    <p>
     multitudinous omniscience.
    </p>
    <p>
     But in England, and especially in Scotland, at the opening of the
    </p>
    <p>
     dreadful winter, the precipitation of snow had attained monstrous
    </p>
    <p>
     proportions. For four weeks the vault of the skies had been thick with
    </p>
    <p>
     falling clouds of snow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft left the window and descended the solitary halls, no longer
    </p>
    <p>
     swept by groups of tourists, to the street. A broken crease in the
    </p>
    <p>
     snow banks offered him a precarious access to Princes’ street. It
    </p>
    <p>
     appeared almost obliterated in places, at others it seemed a narrow
    </p>
    <p>
     slit between threatening walls of snow, that almost toppled over it,
    </p>
    <p>
     while blinding storms of fine particles, hissing over the undulous
    </p>
    <p>
     surface above, at times poured into the compressed chasm, filling it up
    </p>
    <p>
     many feet in a second of time. Abandoned cars, stalled one behind each
    </p>
    <p>
     other, for a block, both on Princes’ street and under the Castle, in
    </p>
    <p>
     the Lothian road, had become the refuge of the workers, and some were
    </p>
    <p>
     made into improvised hospitals and camps. A few relics, half-starved,
    </p>
    <p>
     and fainting with fatigue and exposure, were being treated with rough
    </p>
    <p>
     consideration in these accidental retreats, which, buried under snow,
    </p>
    <p>
     resembled caves, the feeble light of oil lamps and candles yielding a
    </p>
    <p>
     flickering illumination through the dull chill gloom within them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft made his way with difficulty to Princes’ street, and groped
    </p>
    <p>
     along the aisle that cut the street in two. Here he discovered a
    </p>
    <p>
     phalanx of men with sledges and mallets, who, by dint of passing to
    </p>
    <p>
     and fro, without clearing away the snow, were compressing it into a
    </p>
    <p>
     sort of solidity that gave a firm footing. With the continuous fall of
    </p>
    <p>
     snow, and the abrupt windfalls of snow drifting into the cut this path
    </p>
    <p>
     was rapidly rising, and was also most irregular in its outlines. At
    </p>
    <p>
     some points it rose high enough to permit anyone walking on it to see
    </p>
    <p>
     above the adjoining banks of snow. One of these elevations was directly
    </p>
    <p>
     opposite Hanover street, along which formerly ran the cars to the
    </p>
    <p>
     Botanic gardens. Leacraft had reached this spot and stood an instant
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the commanding back of pounded snow, looking with amazement upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the silent waste around him, the sunken gardens to the south marked
    </p>
    <p>
     by a wide superficial depression, with their terraces on either side
    </p>
    <p>
     outlined in shoulders of white. To the north, up the low hill that
    </p>
    <p>
     culminated in George street, he saw the houses on either side buried
    </p>
    <p>
     as high as their second stories in the snow, from which their attic
    </p>
    <p>
     stories emerged like titanic gravestones. The statue of George IV. had
    </p>
    <p>
     become the centre of a rotating whirl of snow that kept the nether
    </p>
    <p>
     limbs of that potentate from the encroaching crystals, but had carved
    </p>
    <p>
     out an inverted cone in the packs around him, whose curling edges hung
    </p>
    <p>
     over like cornices about the strangely excavated bowl. It was at this
    </p>
    <p>
     point that Leacraft’s ears caught a distant sound of mingled cries--a
    </p>
    <p>
     piteous union of a woman’s voice, quickly succeeded by the more robust
    </p>
    <p>
     shout of a man. The sounds seemed to rise and fall. They were at times
    </p>
    <p>
     almost lost in the rising roar of the wind, or reduced to ghost-like
    </p>
    <p>
     semblances of sound, and again they came with the clearest impact on
    </p>
    <p>
     his ears, the shrill scream, the longer resonant “Hallo,” or “Help.” It
    </p>
    <p>
     was impossible for him to determine whether the cries were answering
    </p>
    <p>
     each other, or whether they indicated a mutual and consentaneous peril.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was not alone in their detection. A number of figures--those of the
    </p>
    <p>
     men engaged in keeping the paths open--all sheeted like ghosts with a
    </p>
    <p>
     pellicle of icy snow, had slowly gathered about him, drawn together
    </p>
    <p>
     by this weird summons. A distinct horror possessed them. There was
    </p>
    <p>
     somewhere in the immobile and voiceless streets before them at least
    </p>
    <p>
     two perishing lives. Could they be found? Could they be extricated from
    </p>
    <p>
     their rising tomb of snow? At times the voices grew fainter, as if
    </p>
    <p>
     their subjects were surrendering their vitality to cold and exhaustion,
    </p>
    <p>
     and then again they sounded in the approaching darkness--there were
    </p>
    <p>
     now no lights at night in the doomed city--more appealingly clear as
    </p>
    <p>
     if by a despairing struggle of strength they hoped to prolong their
    </p>
    <p>
     fruitless invocation. No one spoke. Leacraft broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We must save them,” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s nae canny wark to do,” muttered one of the shapes nearest to him.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But it’s a grewsome matter to let them dee that wa,” urged a second.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Weel, weel, they’re nae the farst. The country side is as fu’ o
    </p>
    <p>
     corpses as a crow’s gizzard o’ oats,” admonished a third.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft had been listening. He felt sure that the sounds proceeded
    </p>
    <p>
     from somewhere on George street, a little to the eastward of its
    </p>
    <p>
     intersection with Hanover. He suspected that the fugitives had taken
    </p>
    <p>
     refuge in St. Andrew’s Church. He turned to look at the muffled forms
    </p>
    <p>
     about him. “If two of you will help me, with snow-shoes we can reach
    </p>
    <p>
     them.”
    </p>
    <p>
     There was at first no response, only a protesting shrug, and a
    </p>
    <p>
     disposition to avoid any direct refusal by moving away. Leacraft
    </p>
    <p>
     spoke again. “The snow packs easily; we can get there on snow-shoes
    </p>
    <p>
     in a short time. There can be no danger. These unfortunate people are
    </p>
    <p>
     imprisoned in the church, I think; there’s a woman there; the man needs
    </p>
    <p>
     help to get her out; he probably could break his way over here, but he
    </p>
    <p>
     can’t drag her with him, and he won’t leave her. It’s murder to turn
    </p>
    <p>
     our backs on them.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft was alone, save for the presence of the second speaker. The
    </p>
    <p>
     rest had disappeared, and the thud of their mallets and the rattle of
    </p>
    <p>
     the sledges acquainted him with their distant operations.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Meester, I’ll gie ye a haud. There’s snaw-shoes down the track in a
    </p>
    <p>
     tram; I’ll hae them here in a jiffy.” He vanished down the long cut.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft called after him: “Bring two bottles of whiskey. You can use
    </p>
    <p>
     my name for them at the hotel.”
    </p>
    <p>
     While he waited for the man’s return, Leacraft outlined a possible
    </p>
    <p>
     avenue of approach to the imprisoned couple, if couple it was. He could
    </p>
    <p>
     indistinctly see--the day was waning--that on the west side of Hanover
    </p>
    <p>
     street, by reason of the north-westerly direction of the storm, the
    </p>
    <p>
     housetops had formed a partial protection to the street below, and
    </p>
    <p>
     that the heavy ridged hill of snow occupied the centre of the street,
    </p>
    <p>
     lurching over against the west. Up the short slope this partial shelter
    </p>
    <p>
     continued, but in George street, beyond, the storm drove scurrying
    </p>
    <p>
     blasts of wind that whirled the snow upward in fantastic pirouetting
    </p>
    <p>
     volleys, and, doubtless, with wicked intent, had piled the drifts up
    </p>
    <p>
     in insurmountable entrenchments against the doors of the buildings on
    </p>
    <p>
     that street. The prospect of progress there was discouraging. Still
    </p>
    <p>
     there would be ways; the renewed calls nerved him to desperation.
    </p>
    <p>
     The volunteer returned with the snow-shoes, a pair for both of them,
    </p>
    <p>
     and an extra pair for the imprisoned man, and the bulging bulk of three
    </p>
    <p>
     bottles of whiskey. He explained the latter excess: “They gied me the
    </p>
    <p>
     thraw, and I had no heart to haud the ither back. Let well eneugh
    </p>
    <p>
     alone, I say.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now, my brave friend, we must know each other’s name, though we shall
    </p>
    <p>
     not be separated, as we must be tied together. But men working in peril
    </p>
    <p>
     become close companions,” said Leacraft to the man.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Weel, sir, it mak’s sma’ difference what name we go by, but, an’ you
    </p>
    <p>
     like it, just ca’ me Jim.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft opened one of the bottles of whiskey, and handed it to his
    </p>
    <p>
     companion, who eagerly accepted the invitation, and took so hearty a
    </p>
    <p>
     draught that Leacraft felt some misgivings over his usefulness. The man
    </p>
    <p>
     explained: “Ut’s no dram habit I have, sir, but the cauld ha’ gone to
    </p>
    <p>
     mee bains, an’ the wee drap pits fire in my sperit. It’s bonny stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s nae mickle harm to keep the fires burning in a blast like this.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tak’ my advice and do the same yoursel’, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft was indeed not unwilling to follow this example, and thus
    </p>
    <p>
     reinforced, the two men plunged into the snow banks that with
    </p>
    <p>
     irregular surfaces of hills and valleys spread before them. They
    </p>
    <p>
     floundered desperately forward, finding that the snow-shoes were
    </p>
    <p>
     indispensable, and the precaution of being tied together most helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
     The calling voices, with intermittent pauses, were still heard, and
    </p>
    <p>
     both Leacraft and his companion exerted themselves to return the calls
    </p>
    <p>
     with reassurance. It was evident that they had, at least at times,
    </p>
    <p>
     been heard, for the distant shouts became timed to their own, and this
    </p>
    <p>
     indication of recognition served to strengthen and increase their
    </p>
    <p>
     efforts. The work was difficult, and with recurrent accesses of the
    </p>
    <p>
     storm’s fury, the snowy wreaths, detached from the cornices of the
    </p>
    <p>
     houses, or whirled from off the edges of the tumultuous drifts, blinded
    </p>
    <p>
     and overwhelmed them. Fortunately, the wind came in gusts, and it was
    </p>
    <p>
     this circumstance that permitted Leacraft first to hear the voices.
    </p>
    <p>
     Between the wintry assaults of the wind, in the pauses of its fury,
    </p>
    <p>
     they stumbled on, forcing their way under the shelter of the western
    </p>
    <p>
     houses, and, at the corner of George street, struck boldly out towards
    </p>
    <p>
     the monument, where Leacraft had discerned the inverted cone of snow.
    </p>
    <p>
     The cause of this formation was now apparent, and rendered their
    </p>
    <p>
     further progress more precarious. The wind surged down George street,
    </p>
    <p>
     and by a slight deflection in its course from the axis of the street
    </p>
    <p>
     itself, was thrown into a vertical motion at the corners of Hanover
    </p>
    <p>
     street, and became a cyclone, whose towering and fiercely moving walls
    </p>
    <p>
     were materialized to the eye in the successive shells of snow raised
    </p>
    <p>
     in oscillating spires above the tops of the houses, where it again
    </p>
    <p>
     was seized by the direct wind and sent in dusky masses skywards. The
    </p>
    <p>
     picture of George street at this point was appalling enough. The snow
    </p>
    <p>
     lay deeply piled in the street, forming a high central ridge, and
    </p>
    <p>
     crossing this obliquely were traverse drifts which had a slow motion
    </p>
    <p>
     down the street towards the Melvill memorial; these even at times
    </p>
    <p>
     coalesced, assuming the aspect of a big comber at sea, and advancing
    </p>
    <p>
     with similar menace. When these snow billows flowed into the depression
    </p>
    <p>
     about the statue, they filled it, and then the revolving winds, like a
    </p>
    <p>
     gigantic and invisible augur, excavated it again, tossing the snow out
    </p>
    <p>
     in spurts resembling the geyser-like bursts in front of a snow-plough.
    </p>
    <p>
     At such moments it would have been almost impossible to have crossed
    </p>
    <p>
     the spot, with the buffeting wind shaking with flagitious fury the
    </p>
    <p>
     folds of snow about the traveller and entombing him also in their
    </p>
    <p>
     rising sheets.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft and Jim had just reached the eastern edge of the hollow
    </p>
    <p>
     described above, when one of the travelling billows of snow poured
    </p>
    <p>
     into the pit on its western margin, and the impetuous blasts began to
    </p>
    <p>
     dislodge the inrushing tide with incredible velocity. The shocks of
    </p>
    <p>
     snow overwhelmed the rescuers, and for a moment it seemed as if the
    </p>
    <p>
     contest between them and the fury of nature was too unequal a struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
     The support of the snow-shoes held them fairly well above the snow,
    </p>
    <p>
     but this onslaught knocked them down, and once down, the industrious
    </p>
    <p>
     drifts hastily began their entombment. To speak was impossible, and
    </p>
    <p>
     all Leacraft could do was to jerk the rope which connected them, as
    </p>
    <p>
     a summons for Jim to reach him. His purpose was obvious. Together,
    </p>
    <p>
     one or the other might make such a purchase of his companion as to
    </p>
    <p>
     extricate himself, and then assist his friend to rise. Jim understood
    </p>
    <p>
     the suggestion of the pull, and groped his way forward, and touched
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft, whom he found prostrate. His body offered a flooring for
    </p>
    <p>
     him to rise upon, and in this way he regained the surface, his head
    </p>
    <p>
     emerging into the blustering air. He quickly established himself and
    </p>
    <p>
     hauled Leacraft upward, who expected the movement, and had drawn his
    </p>
    <p>
     knees upward to help him regain his feet. The two men were now again
    </p>
    <p>
     upright and in action, but terribly exhausted and half immersed in the
    </p>
    <p>
     snow. The wave had passed and reformed partially after its disruption,
    </p>
    <p>
     while its north and south wings, which had escaped the passage of the
    </p>
    <p>
     pit, like white breakers, moved on before it.
    </p>
    <p>
     A simultaneous motion with both, which had something almost comic
    </p>
    <p>
     in it, and would not have, under different circumstances, escaped
    </p>
    <p>
     receiving its tribute of merriment, brought from the pockets of each
    </p>
    <p>
     the whisky bottles, that quickly contributed some of their contents
    </p>
    <p>
     to the renewal of their ebbing strength. As they carefully replaced
    </p>
    <p>
     the helpful vials, they heard again, but now more clearly, the renewed
    </p>
    <p>
     shouts of the imprisoned captives, and Jim, putting his hands to his
    </p>
    <p>
     mouth, screamed with all the force he could put into the effort,
    </p>
    <p>
     “Coming.” It carried, and something articulate returned, which to
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft sounded like “Come quick!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Their strength renewed, the two men began again their brave combat
    </p>
    <p>
     with the elements, and forced their way across the snow fields towards
    </p>
    <p>
     the houses on the north side of George street, which furnished a
    </p>
    <p>
     slight shield against the ferocity of the storm. A helpful lull in the
    </p>
    <p>
     blast enabled them to make their way more quickly. The walls of St.
    </p>
    <p>
     Andrew’s Church were near at hand, and all doubts as to the position
    </p>
    <p>
     of the voices were removed. The calls came very clearly to their ears.
    </p>
    <p>
     Creeping along the edges of the houses, they succeeded in reaching the
    </p>
    <p>
     church, and found that, on the back of the drifts, they were then at
    </p>
    <p>
     the level of its upper windows. The men peered into the darkness beyond
    </p>
    <p>
     the panes of glass and knocked vociferously. Voices and steps answered
    </p>
    <p>
     them. The next moment a man’s figure could be discerned advancing, and
    </p>
    <p>
     then the window opened. Leacraft entered first, followed by Jim, and
    </p>
    <p>
     both turned to the yet silent figure beside them. His silence lasted
    </p>
    <p>
     scarcely an instant. “God!” he exclaimed. “You have come none too soon!
    </p>
    <p>
     We should have died here! There is a young girl downstairs, a friend
    </p>
    <p>
     of mine. We started for the train, and just in front of the church she
    </p>
    <p>
     fainted. I drew her in here, as the door was open. A chill followed; I
    </p>
    <p>
     could not carry her away in this storm, and we were caught. It was our
    </p>
    <p>
     last chance. I can’t explain now the reason for our remaining so long
    </p>
    <p>
     behind the rest of the people who have left Edinburgh. We are here.
    </p>
    <p>
     Can you get us out? I can shift for myself, but Ethel--you see it is
    </p>
    <p>
     impossible. What--what--”
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft interrupted. “Explanations are not needed. We must all get out
    </p>
    <p>
     of this at once. We must take her between us, and fight our way back.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Already he had begun to move towards the flight of stairs near to them,
    </p>
    <p>
     to descend to the man’s companion, when the man seized him by the
    </p>
    <p>
     arm, passed him, calling to them to follow. They descended rapidly,
    </p>
    <p>
     and saw on the ground floor of the church, lying in a pew, with a
    </p>
    <p>
     flickering gas jet burning feebly above it, the figure of the woman
    </p>
    <p>
     the man had mentioned. She had propped herself on her hand and elbow,
    </p>
    <p>
     and gazed at the three faces looking down on her, with a frightened,
    </p>
    <p>
     still expression, in which relief and confidence, however, were not
    </p>
    <p>
     altogether absent. Jim had already brought out the whisky bottle, and,
    </p>
    <p>
     with unpractised directness, offered it to the girl. “Here, my leddy;
    </p>
    <p>
     tak’ a sip of this, and let it be a good one. An’, gentlemen,” turning
    </p>
    <p>
     to Leacraft and the stranger, “it’s awa’ with a’ o’ us, or the deil
    </p>
    <p>
     will mak’ our shrouds.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft turned to the man. “Have you snow-shoes?” he asked. “Yes,”
    </p>
    <p>
     answered the stranger. “Then,” continued Leacraft, “we will start. Out
    </p>
    <p>
     of the window upstairs. Jim, you go ahead, and I and the gentleman will
    </p>
    <p>
     carry the lady. Madame,” to the lady, “this is a forlorn trip, but it
    </p>
    <p>
     will soon be over, and I feel we can trust you to help us.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, yes,” came the rapid reply. The girl started to rise, and her
    </p>
    <p>
     companion helped her quickly to her feet. The party was ready, and
    </p>
    <p>
     without further words the four ascended the steps, made their way to
    </p>
    <p>
     the window, and after one glance at the raging weather outside, another
    </p>
    <p>
     reassurance for all from the indispensable bottles, the plunge was made.
    </p>
    <p>
     The two fugitives, if such was a proper designation for them, were well
    </p>
    <p>
     clothed, and the risk of exposure was avoided. It now was a question of
    </p>
    <p>
     physical endurance only, and partly, too, of some possible leniency in
    </p>
    <p>
     the weather. Already their previous steps were thickly buried in the
    </p>
    <p>
     flowing tides of snow, and Leacraft and Jim noted with apprehension
    </p>
    <p>
     that the wind seemed fiercer, and the way back towards Hanover street
    </p>
    <p>
     blacker and more obscure, with volleys of snow dust thrown upward in
    </p>
    <p>
     increasing clouds. For a moment the party hesitated, and Leacraft and
    </p>
    <p>
     Jim both seemed over-awed and perplexed. Almost at the same moment they
    </p>
    <p>
     cast their eyes towards the corner of George and St. David streets, and
    </p>
    <p>
     saw to their wonder and delight that the front of the Commercial Bank
    </p>
    <p>
     building was relatively clear of snow, and the intimation furnished by
    </p>
    <p>
     its appearance was that the way was more open on St. David street and
    </p>
    <p>
     that in that direction egress and safety lay.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This way,” was the laconic order from Leacraft, and they turned
    </p>
    <p>
     eastward. Leacraft and the stranger, who had given his name as Thomsen,
    </p>
    <p>
     supported the woman between them, and she was directed to throw her
    </p>
    <p>
     arms around their necks, and the sense of support to this frail girl,
    </p>
    <p>
     whose face, terrified and pale from weakness, yet had revealed to
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft a winning prettiness, made both men alert and strenuous. An
    </p>
    <p>
     obstacle of some seriousness stood before them; two heaped up mounds
    </p>
    <p>
     occupied the centre of the street. It was between these mimic hills
    </p>
    <p>
     that they made the fortunate discovery of the comparative freedom of
    </p>
    <p>
     the opposite corner, as it was in a measure the interposition of these
    </p>
    <p>
     very barriers that kept it so. But the passage--the cleft--between
    </p>
    <p>
     these mounds, that somehow seemed rigid points, underwent startling
    </p>
    <p>
     alterations. It was filled up with avalanches of snow, which at almost
    </p>
    <p>
     regular intervals were driven out by the massive wind pressure, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the dislodged bodies of snow were seen to spread out toward the south
    </p>
    <p>
     on the opposite side of the mounds from the observers’ position, in
    </p>
    <p>
     geyser-like spouts. It was necessary to thread this pass, but it would
    </p>
    <p>
     be inevitable danger if they were caught in one of the recurrent
    </p>
    <p>
     avalanches. Sinister as the chance seemed, it must be taken. And
    </p>
    <p>
     towards this triangular cut they slowly moved. Jim was in front of the
    </p>
    <p>
     little group, which, sheeted with snow, with bent heads and in silence,
    </p>
    <p>
     resembled Arctic explorers, as they are pictured bringing in some dying
    </p>
    <p>
     or exhausted companion.
    </p>
    <p>
     The wind was somewhat behind them, though in the collision of the
    </p>
    <p>
     reflected waves from the houses on the south side, the vexed air shot
    </p>
    <p>
     about them in a hundred contradictory directions, and held them in a
    </p>
    <p>
     tempest of draughts. And now they were at the northern slope of the
    </p>
    <p>
     mounds; the cut was open; it had been cleared a minute before. Through
    </p>
    <p>
     it they saw more plainly that the bank steps and the corner of St.
    </p>
    <p>
     David street presented more favorable conditions; a dash and they
    </p>
    <p>
     would effect their escape. Leacraft had not failed to notice that the
    </p>
    <p>
     intervals between the inexplicable down-rushes of snow into the gap,
    </p>
    <p>
     were about three minutes, and that something more than that time
    </p>
    <p>
     elapsed before their expulsion. He whispered to Thomsen, whose fatigue
    </p>
    <p>
     was becoming too evident, “Keep up, sir. Once through this hole, and we
    </p>
    <p>
     are safe.”
    </p>
    <p>
     During all this time since their entrance through the window of the
    </p>
    <p>
     church, Leacraft and Jim had remained tied together, and the strong,
    </p>
    <p>
     steady haul of the workman upon the rope now greatly assisted Leacraft,
    </p>
    <p>
     who was quite sensible that he must largely depend on his strength
    </p>
    <p>
     at this critical moment for their preservation. It was certainly no
    </p>
    <p>
     exaggeration to say that as they entered that rather inconspicuous
    </p>
    <p>
     gateway, between two snow drifts in George street, Edinburgh, in
    </p>
    <p>
     November 1909, they stood on that metropolitan thoroughfare, in the
    </p>
    <p>
     Jaws of Death. The simile may sound and look shockingly untrue. It is
    </p>
    <p>
     the exact truth. The white inclines rose on each side of them, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the width of the wintry embrasure was about twenty feet; in less than
    </p>
    <p>
     a minute even with their lagging steps they would have crossed it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly Leacraft felt himself pulled sideways; only the rope stretched
    </p>
    <p>
     tightly between himself and Jim saved him from falling, if falling
    </p>
    <p>
     it could be called, where they were so immersed in snow. Thomsen had
    </p>
    <p>
     dropped in his tracks and with a low cry of fear the woman’s arm
    </p>
    <p>
     slipped from his neck and she clung convulsively to Leacraft. It was
    </p>
    <p>
     critical. In a little more than two minutes they would probably be
    </p>
    <p>
     buried--which at this stage of exhaustion meant death. Leacraft tugged
    </p>
    <p>
     savagely at the rope, and the surprised Jim, almost thrown on his back,
    </p>
    <p>
     returned. A glance told him everything. Leacraft, without speaking,
    </p>
    <p>
     nodded to the motionless figure, beginning by reason of the icy chill
    </p>
    <p>
     smiting his face from the snow, to stir, and seizing the girl, passed
    </p>
    <p>
     on. Jim managed to jerk Thomsen to his feet, and half holding, half
    </p>
    <p>
     pushing him, hastened, lest Leacraft should feel his weight on the
    </p>
    <p>
     rope, and be hampered in his own struggles. It was slow work, the
    </p>
    <p>
     snow-shoes, so essential for their safety, could only be painfully
    </p>
    <p>
     shoved forwards beneath the snow. It was like wading in deep water but
    </p>
    <p>
     it was a likeness enormously enlarged in difficulty and strain.
    </p>
    <p>
     They had not pushed through the miniature defile when symptomatic
    </p>
    <p>
     showers of snow drifted in upon them in blinding columns. The avalanche
    </p>
    <p>
     was coming. The terror stricken Alpine climber, who, behind some serac
    </p>
    <p>
     on the lofty glacier, has his ears assaulted with the roar of the
    </p>
    <p>
     descending avalanche, in no literal sense has greater reason for fear
    </p>
    <p>
     than did those men in the streets of Edinburgh at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft shouted, “On! On! On! One second and we are lost!” This
    </p>
    <p>
     despairing cry was not ill calculated to spur their efforts. The very
    </p>
    <p>
     agony of fright it summoned in the two men behind him gave them the
    </p>
    <p>
     strength of desperation. For one instant the spent muscles became
    </p>
    <p>
     steel. They floundered forward, and fell together almost in one heap
    </p>
    <p>
     beyond the portal of the two mounds as the swirling snow in torrents
    </p>
    <p>
     obliterated their outlines in new envelopes. Their fall toppled
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft over on his side. The confused objects, looking like some
    </p>
    <p>
     assortment of discarded bundles lay quiet, the darting cold had brought
    </p>
    <p>
     with it the treacherous drowsiness into their eyes, and had already
    </p>
    <p>
     begun to lock the keyholes of their senses. It was Jim who had roused
    </p>
    <p>
     himself to action. He struck Leacraft across the face with his gloved
    </p>
    <p>
     hand, and did the same to Thomsen, whom he again lifted to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     The smart of the stinging blow startled Leacraft on his legs; his nose
    </p>
    <p>
     bled, and he could feel the woman still stiffly clinging to him. It was
    </p>
    <p>
     Jim who now uttered the warning, “Get out o’ this. I hae the lugger
    </p>
    <p>
     all right. Get down to the bank.” Leacraft looked quickly. The bank
    </p>
    <p>
     steps were beneath them, and the vagaries of the storm alternately
    </p>
    <p>
     covered and cleared them of snow. Half rolling, he pitched down the
    </p>
    <p>
     slope, following Jim, who had his arm around Thomsen’s waist, and who,
    </p>
    <p>
     supporting himself on Jim’s shoulder, was manfully helping his rescuer.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a few minutes, with staggering steps and frequent falls, the four
    </p>
    <p>
     gained the protection of the bank. This refuge acted favorably. Their
    </p>
    <p>
     spirits revived, and the whisky flasks assisted. Their attitude toward
    </p>
    <p>
     the storm became a little defiant. “We can do it now. It’s only a step
    </p>
    <p>
     around to Princes street. Ethel, how do you feel?” It was the young
    </p>
    <p>
     Scotchman who spoke, and the young woman even smiled as she answered
    </p>
    <p>
     “O! Ned, we shall be saved! How can we thank this gentleman?” “Excuse
    </p>
    <p>
     me” blurted out Leacraft, “we won’t waste time just now in an exchange
    </p>
    <p>
     of civilities. The opportunity for that formality will come when we are
    </p>
    <p>
     all out of this.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He stepped almost impatiently to the edge of the building and found
    </p>
    <p>
     that a narrow crevice intervened between the drifts and the walls of
    </p>
    <p>
     the houses, and a further inspection revealed the utterly unexpected
    </p>
    <p>
     good luck, that this peculiar chimney way extended along the west side
    </p>
    <p>
     of St. David street to Princes street. Their safety seemed secured.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a few minutes after this welcome discovery, with careful steps,
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft insisting upon the Scotchman and himself lifting the young
    </p>
    <p>
     woman together, with Jim leading, the party slowly crept out and along
    </p>
    <p>
     the buildings on St. David street, and in a short time had reached
    </p>
    <p>
     Princes street, where more arms, vigorous legs, and robust bodies
    </p>
    <p>
     helped them through the shooting drifts into the open rift, that the
    </p>
    <p>
     men and sledges were still precariously maintaining.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft hurried Thomsen and his charge to the hotel; he turned to Jim,
    </p>
    <p>
     and grasped his hand fervently, “You’ve been a true man, Jim. I shan’t
    </p>
    <p>
     forget this. Every one leaves Edinburgh to-night by the train. I want
    </p>
    <p>
     you in my compartment. This young woman and her friends will be with
    </p>
    <p>
     me. I’ll find you at the hotel before the train leaves. Watch for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     As he spoke, and before the expostulation on Jim’s lips was uttered, a
    </p>
    <p>
     long hoarse whistle like a wail came to their ears. It was the warning
    </p>
    <p>
     of the trainmen fearful to delay longer their departure from the doomed
    </p>
    <p>
     city--and with it, hurrying steps, shouts and injunctions along the
    </p>
    <p>
     cut, indicated its recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come with me,” cried Leacraft, and together the men ran forwards,
    </p>
    <p>
     towards the Lothian road, finding themselves as they advanced in a
    </p>
    <p>
     jostling crowd, animated by but one hope, escape from the buried
    </p>
    <p>
     capital.
    </p>
    <p>
     The condition indicated in the foregoing narrative, may now be more
    </p>
    <p>
     explicitly reviewed. The dislocations and subsidences in the Caribbean
    </p>
    <p>
     and Central American areas had developed along constructional lines,
    </p>
    <p>
     and had swept away the lesser Antilles and the Isthmus.
    </p>
    <p>
     These formerly elevated points were simply projections upon two
    </p>
    <p>
     orogenic blocks of the earth’s crust, one extending from South America
    </p>
    <p>
     to Porto Rico, the other the narrower coastal shelf forming the
    </p>
    <p>
     isthmus. More plainly, these remarkable strips, curved in outline,
    </p>
    <p>
     and with a varying length of four hundred to five hundred miles,
    </p>
    <p>
     maintained a precarious stability with references to the adjoining
    </p>
    <p>
     edges against which they abutted, and when a shock, violent enough to
    </p>
    <p>
     rupture or release those edges, supervened they fell _out_ and _down_
    </p>
    <p>
     like a brick or stone from an arch. When the more eastern of these
    </p>
    <p>
     blocks, that on which the lesser Antilles stood, dropped, the oceanic
    </p>
    <p>
     heated currents of the equatorial belt of the Atlantic rushed into the
    </p>
    <p>
     Caribbean basin as usual, but with a perceptible acceleration. The
    </p>
    <p>
     currents did not meet the frictional resistance of an archipelago of
    </p>
    <p>
     small islands. Their progress westward continued, through the almost
    </p>
    <p>
     simultaneously created outlet into the Pacific, by the submergence
    </p>
    <p>
     of the isthmus. Upon the first report of President Roosevelt’s
    </p>
    <p>
     apprehensions that this catastrophe would involve a disastrous
    </p>
    <p>
     diversion of the Gulf Stream, European geographers had contemptuously
    </p>
    <p>
     treated it as impossible, and stigmatized it as “an amusing futility
    </p>
    <p>
     of envy.” They dwelt upon this fact, that the Gulf Stream did not
    </p>
    <p>
     invade the bent arm of water forming the eastern water boundary of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Isthmus of Panama, but shot across this somewhat withdrawn angle,
    </p>
    <p>
     passing with undiminished volume in a straight path beyond Honduras,
    </p>
    <p>
     into the capacious pocket of the Gulf of Mexico. “Let it be conceded,”
    </p>
    <p>
     began an authoritative refutation in the _London Times_, “that the
    </p>
    <p>
     structural impediment to the mixture of the waters of the Atlantic
    </p>
    <p>
     and Pacific existing in the Isthmus of Panama is removed. Does
    </p>
    <p>
     mixture follow? By no means, that is in no way subversive of present
    </p>
    <p>
     hydrographic conditions. There will be a marginal intermixture, of
    </p>
    <p>
     course, where there is actual contact, but it is presumptuous and
    </p>
    <p>
     opposed to experience to say that two enormous bodies of water will
    </p>
    <p>
     promiscuously exchange their contents through an opening, relatively
    </p>
    <p>
     to their volume and extent, what a pinhole would be to the juxtaposed
    </p>
    <p>
     masses of two great reservoirs. Further, this _disinclination_, as a
    </p>
    <p>
     physical impossibility, of the waters of the two contiguous bodies of
    </p>
    <p>
     practically equal density to diffuse into each other, is increased
    </p>
    <p>
     by the strength and velocity of the Gulf Stream itself, which rushes
    </p>
    <p>
     past the isthmus deflection, and instead of being turned aside into
    </p>
    <p>
     that narrow aperture, would exert a suctorial influence upon the tides
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Pacific, actually (though this is in no way insisted upon)
    </p>
    <p>
     reinforcing its own volume and momentum by their contributions.
    </p>
    <p>
     “There can be no valid reasons for anxiety in regard to the future of
    </p>
    <p>
     the kingdom so far--and that is very far indeed--as its prosperity and
    </p>
    <p>
     happiness depend upon a continuance of the supply of warm waters from
    </p>
    <p>
     the west.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The writer of this article in the _London Times_ had not realized, or
    </p>
    <p>
     had not heard of, the elevation of Cuba and the emergence of the broken
    </p>
    <p>
     range of keys between Cape Gracias de Dios and Jamaica, nor had he
    </p>
    <p>
     considered the “suctorial influence” of the Mexican current in the
    </p>
    <p>
     Pacific, southward on the west coast of Mexico and Central America upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the Atlantic areas, nor had he suspected the quantitative effect of a
    </p>
    <p>
     higher barometric pressure in the Atlantic over the pressure resident
    </p>
    <p>
     above the surface of the Pacific, a difference practically amounting to
    </p>
    <p>
     a push upon the surface distensions of the Atlantic in the direction
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Pacific, the very moment a _sensible_ union between them took
    </p>
    <p>
     place. And it was a _sensible_ union. His comparison of it to a pinhole
    </p>
    <p>
     was utterly misleading. Above a certain minimum, no matter what the
    </p>
    <p>
     size of the major bodies of water were, relatively, connection between
    </p>
    <p>
     them meant, under the circumstances, mixture, and a hole four hundred
    </p>
    <p>
     miles wide was much above that minimum. At the very moment when he
    </p>
    <p>
     penned this astute demonstration, the Gulf Stream had begun to throw
    </p>
    <p>
     its seething waters across the sunken isthmus. And the effects followed
    </p>
    <p>
     with startling rapidity. The author of the consoling reflections
    </p>
    <p>
     quoted, perhaps had hardly had time to have forgotten the obsequious
    </p>
    <p>
     reception his words received, when his admiring listeners were brought
    </p>
    <p>
     face to face with the worst consequences he had considered absurdly
    </p>
    <p>
     impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
     The summer in Great Britain had been noticeably colder, and with the
    </p>
    <p>
     passage of the autumnal equinox, the winds increased in strength,
    </p>
    <p>
     and brought with them a terrifying cold. All records were broken, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the sinking thermometers withdrawing their silver threads into the
    </p>
    <p>
     diminutive bulbs, became suddenly the chief subjects of conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
     The corridor of the Houses of Parliament, the state room of Windsor,
    </p>
    <p>
     the clubs of Pall Mall and the parlors of the West End, no less than
    </p>
    <p>
     the alcoves of London Bridge, the shops in White Friars, or the
    </p>
    <p>
     auction stalls of the Ghetto, buzzed with the endless comparison of
    </p>
    <p>
     observations made on these hitherto unnoticed instruments of precision,
    </p>
    <p>
     and their slightest variations took precedence in the daily prints,
    </p>
    <p>
     over the aphorisms of the prime minister or the nullities of the king.
    </p>
    <p>
     An enormously increased sale of thermometers accompanied the sinister
    </p>
    <p>
     records of the deepening cold; importations of them from the United
    </p>
    <p>
     States spread an unprecedented wonder throughout the world as to the
    </p>
    <p>
     meaning of this change in climate, and the range of temperature, as the
    </p>
    <p>
     season advanced, was as much an object of solicitude as the growing
    </p>
    <p>
     expenditures of London, and more talked about than the fancied rupture
    </p>
    <p>
     between Spain and France. Meteorological journals were besieged with
    </p>
    <p>
     subscribers; Abbe, Loomis, Ferrel were as much in demand at the book
    </p>
    <p>
     stores as Glaisher or Thomson; Flammarion was as popular as Tyndal,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the lectures delivered at the British Museum had such suffocating
    </p>
    <p>
     success that the Red Cross Societies of London conceived the idea
    </p>
    <p>
     of public instructions for a tuppenny, to replenish their forgotten
    </p>
    <p>
     treasuries. The pedestrian and the chance acquaintance of the tramway
    </p>
    <p>
     would interview each other on the prevalent topic of alarm, and quote
    </p>
    <p>
     Wells, and Boussingault, and Daniel, and Quetelet, Forbes, Helmersen,
    </p>
    <p>
     Kamtz and Kupffer with more unction and accuracy than he did the
    </p>
    <p>
     current prices of wool or barley.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fright began in the north, in Scotland. News first arrived from
    </p>
    <p>
     the Hebrides, of desolating cold and overwhelming snow storms; then
    </p>
    <p>
     the story was picked up by the Shetlands and Aberdeen, and then the
    </p>
    <p>
     really tragic fate of Iceland was recounted. The cable between Scotland
    </p>
    <p>
     and Iceland, completed in 1906, brought the tale. And a freezing
    </p>
    <p>
     tale it was. Iceland had become a snow heap; its interior valleys
    </p>
    <p>
     were filled up, from Heckla to Skaldbreid; from Skaldbreid to Esja
    </p>
    <p>
     one portentous blanket of snow had levelled all inequalities of the
    </p>
    <p>
     surface. The terror stricken inhabitants deserted their farms and
    </p>
    <p>
     fought their way to Reykjavik, leaving all they possessed of sheep,
    </p>
    <p>
     cattle and horses to be destroyed by the pitiless tooth of the Ice
    </p>
    <p>
     King. Reykjavik had been deserted; its people fleeing to ships and
    </p>
    <p>
     steamers as the remorseless winds piled up the white shrouds of its
    </p>
    <p>
     Arctic burial. The cable summoned assistance for those yet fighting for
    </p>
    <p>
     life on the water’s edge, where the sea air helped them to maintain a
    </p>
    <p>
     margin of cleared ground. Over ten feet had accumulated, and ceaseless
    </p>
    <p>
     blizzards, unchecked, and even increasing in fury, with a tireless and
    </p>
    <p>
     killing cold, had renewed the ice age within that boreal republic. The
    </p>
    <p>
     panic spread. From confidence and scorn the people of Scotland and
    </p>
    <p>
     England and Ireland plunged into the clamor of despair and maniacal
    </p>
    <p>
     forebodings. Religious fraternities of “Frigidists” were organized,
    </p>
    <p>
     whose exegesis made the prophecy of the End of the World a menace
    </p>
    <p>
     of destruction by ice. Geikie’s _Ice Age_, and Croll’s _Climate and
    </p>
    <p>
     Time_ were read by earl and bellboy, and in the midst of the general
    </p>
    <p>
     consternation, the publishers of these books, in cheap form, doubled
    </p>
    <p>
     their business capacity and their fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then came the sudden visitation of Edinburgh, with the scenes just
    </p>
    <p>
     recounted. The transference of these immense swarms of people, the
    </p>
    <p>
     evicted tenants of the north (poor creatures who had never owned
    </p>
    <p>
     the land they lived on except by the sufferance of some landlord
    </p>
    <p>
     duke or “gentleman,”) southward, was a task of difficulty. Sir
    </p>
    <p>
     John C--, was provost marshal of the city at the time (his father
    </p>
    <p>
     before him had held the same office), and had devised a scheme of
    </p>
    <p>
     goodly proportions and efficacy. He appointed wardens, who, with
    </p>
    <p>
     assistants selected by themselves, visited the families in the several
    </p>
    <p>
     bailiwicks in Edinburgh, and prepared them for the departure, and
    </p>
    <p>
     who also apportioned to the different wards of the town the streaming
    </p>
    <p>
     populations from all the neighboring villages, towns and the country
    </p>
    <p>
     sides. The railroads were seized by the government, and systematic
    </p>
    <p>
     transportation, begun and carried on night and day. They were taken
    </p>
    <p>
     to the larger seaports of England, and of course to London. Already
    </p>
    <p>
     secret misgivings that chilled the marrow of their bones, and made the
    </p>
    <p>
     blood circling in their hearts freeze with horror, were entertained
    </p>
    <p>
     by public men, that perchance this was not all, nor indeed the worst.
    </p>
    <p>
     Was the power of the Kingdom of Great Britain to be made the jest of
    </p>
    <p>
     the snowflake and the ice-cicle? The thought made reason totter, but
    </p>
    <p>
     new gleams of anticipation seemed suddenly to place upon that very
    </p>
    <p>
     thought the consecration of joy. They should be driven from their
    </p>
    <p>
     hearthstone to bring the English culture in other English lands, and
    </p>
    <p>
     emancipated men--men of the new type, like H. G. Wells--said that that
    </p>
    <p>
     culture, torn from the swaddling bands of a conventional tradition,
    </p>
    <p>
     the silly materialism of forms and dresses, of titles and classes, of
    </p>
    <p>
     imperialistic gew-gaws, and the impediments of habit, would expand
    </p>
    <p>
     into a modern civilization, which, carrying forward all the strains
    </p>
    <p>
     of strength, and imaginative and ideal aims, it had before, might
    </p>
    <p>
     incorporate in them the new procreative life of a liberal social state.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well! there was some consolation in that, but a consolation robbed of
    </p>
    <p>
     much positive consistency when all around them they saw the loss of
    </p>
    <p>
     trade, the paralysis of hope, the desertion of homes, and the rising
    </p>
    <p>
     threats of that inexorable and deaf deity--Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft had watched and waited. Every new development, each changing
    </p>
    <p>
     report, the wearily studied logs of the ships and steamers, the
    </p>
    <p>
     daily averages of temperature and rainfall, the swelling disorder in
    </p>
    <p>
     the climate of the United States, and confirmed rumors of the hot
    </p>
    <p>
     current--which might be the Gulf Stream--pouring, pouring northward,
    </p>
    <p>
     and hugging the shores of California and Washington and Oregon, and
    </p>
    <p>
     even repelling the cold from Alaska, supplying a stove to its shores,
    </p>
    <p>
     which, it was promptly surmised, would make of it a northern paradise,
    </p>
    <p>
     all, in a cumulative way, pointed to one result--the evacuation of
    </p>
    <p>
     England. His speculative mind hurried on to the picturing of the
    </p>
    <p>
     changed aspects of the national life, and he felt that for once
    </p>
    <p>
     Science, embodied in the laws of Nature, was about to put to flight the
    </p>
    <p>
     mentality of men, and pour the vials of its confusion over the proud,
    </p>
    <p>
     the boasting defiance of their thin optimism. And yet--what might not
    </p>
    <p>
     Opportunity perform? Perhaps the old receptacles of civilization needed
    </p>
    <p>
     emptying; their garnered seeds to be more quickly cast upon the winds
    </p>
    <p>
     of chance to germinate and flower again in the waste places of the
    </p>
    <p>
     world. And Leacraft hurried to and fro--a small inherited competency
    </p>
    <p>
     had dissolved his business bonds--a lonely, sad man, excited by the
    </p>
    <p>
     thoughts of the world’s trembling position on a new threshold of
    </p>
    <p>
     events, and thus forgetting the gnawing pains of his own disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
     During September he had been at the far north of Scotland, and
    </p>
    <p>
     retreated day by day with the invading cold, fleeing with its fleeing
    </p>
    <p>
     people, southward. On the memorable evening whose events have been
    </p>
    <p>
     rehearsed, he had found Edinburgh practically voided, and left to its
    </p>
    <p>
     entombment. The work of getting the people away, of convincing the
    </p>
    <p>
     incredulous, of providing for the needy, of deporting the treasures
    </p>
    <p>
     of this great depository, had been hastily and imperfectly done. In
    </p>
    <p>
     spite of Sir John C--’s useful plans, it could not be different.
    </p>
    <p>
     Disorder, recriminations, riot and clashes were inevitable at a moment
    </p>
    <p>
     of such sudden penetrating terror. Blocks after blocks of private
    </p>
    <p>
     homes remained with little or nothing of their rich contents removed.
    </p>
    <p>
     This condition was understood, and predatory bands of desperate men
    </p>
    <p>
     broke into them, encamped in them and defied expulsion. They laughed
    </p>
    <p>
     at warnings, and after filling their improvised camps with coal and
    </p>
    <p>
     stores, prepared with exultation to enjoy this novel debauch. Furniture
    </p>
    <p>
     and household effects had been dumped or deserted in the streets, and
    </p>
    <p>
     almost any extemporaneous digging in the drifts would uncover books,
    </p>
    <p>
     clothing and utensils. A grotesque hogarthian aspect had been produced
    </p>
    <p>
     by the retreat of the cats to the houses, and their mingled swarms at
    </p>
    <p>
     windows and on sills, whither they were strangely followed by hordes of
    </p>
    <p>
     mice and rats, expelled from the country and filtering into the city
    </p>
    <p>
     in scampering lines before the weather had reached the height of its
    </p>
    <p>
     tempestuous inclemency.
    </p>
    <p>
     The documentary archives of the city had been locked up in great safes
    </p>
    <p>
     and left for more propitious days--in summer? This example had been
    </p>
    <p>
     imitated in thousands of the better class houses, as the professional,
    </p>
    <p>
     the _official_ opinion, still hesitated to contemplate the monstrous
    </p>
    <p>
     alternative of a permanent sepulture of their beautiful home.
    </p>
    <p>
     One thing had been accomplished, and it was well done. The people,
    </p>
    <p>
     those who would leave, had been gotten away. When on the tenth of
    </p>
    <p>
     September the first storm of snow began, and the mercury sunk to
    </p>
    <p>
     a few degrees below zero Fah., the suffering became intense. Soon
    </p>
    <p>
     the railroads were blocked. Enlightened opinion had received its
    </p>
    <p>
     instructions. The return of Scotland to the bondage of snow and ice was
    </p>
    <p>
     published, and the publications carried conviction to a great many.
    </p>
    <p>
     The loss of the Gulf Stream was at length acknowledged. The impetus
    </p>
    <p>
     of the discovery made the worst prophecies credible. The intensity of
    </p>
    <p>
     this acquiescence was astounding. It became a matter of faith that the
    </p>
    <p>
     population should vacate their own city, and they obeyed instructions
    </p>
    <p>
     unanimously with a touching self-surrender to fate. Great numbers
    </p>
    <p>
     left Leith by boats and steamers summoned from London. The railroads
    </p>
    <p>
     responded with promptitude, though, by reason of a sudden access of
    </p>
    <p>
     energy in the government, nothing less would have been tolerated,
    </p>
    <p>
     longer than was necessary to confiscate their property and franchises.
    </p>
    <p>
     The phenomenal desertion of the city by three hundred thousand souls
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed as fore-ordained, as obligatory in the regime of events, as the
    </p>
    <p>
     setting of the sun, or the return of the seasons.
    </p>
    <p>
     But no activity of all the available means of transportation would
    </p>
    <p>
     have sufficed to take a population of more than three hundred thousand
    </p>
    <p>
     men and women in less than two months away from the city, unless it
    </p>
    <p>
     had been supplemented by other means. And a strange and most effective
    </p>
    <p>
     movement accomplished completely what more recondite or artificial
    </p>
    <p>
     methods would have failed to secure. The “Frigidists,” the group of
    </p>
    <p>
     fanatical preachers and their followers, who found in the present
    </p>
    <p>
     calamity an opportunity for a religious propaganda, or, through the
    </p>
    <p>
     fermentation and clouded expectations of their own zeal, believed it to
    </p>
    <p>
     be the expression of a supernatural agency, had begun a street crusade
    </p>
    <p>
     (always in Edinburgh popular and familiar) to accomplish the removal
    </p>
    <p>
     of the people. These singular fanatics served a most benevolent end,
    </p>
    <p>
     and their strange hallucinations wisely aided the anxious efforts of
    </p>
    <p>
     the authorities. They arrayed themselves in white, and went bareheaded
    </p>
    <p>
     through the streets of the city, exhorting all who would listen to
    </p>
    <p>
     accept their interpretations of the approaching judgment. They wove
    </p>
    <p>
     their texts of prophecy with denunciations of sin, and with the
    </p>
    <p>
     crowding evidences of some astounding climatic change, repeated with
    </p>
    <p>
     accelerated eagerness in paper, pulpit and forum, they acquired a
    </p>
    <p>
     tyrannous control over the emotions of the populace.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then they quickly, and with excellent discernment, organized the
    </p>
    <p>
     people into small regiments, distributed to them white cockades and
    </p>
    <p>
     white rosettes and marched them out of the city, southward, over
    </p>
    <p>
     the frozen and snow-lined roads. This evacuation began scarcely
    </p>
    <p>
     soon enough for the best results. But it gave relief. These moving
    </p>
    <p>
     companies, accompanied with vans and horse carts, and vehicles of every
    </p>
    <p>
     description, gathering numbers along their way, grew in picturesque
    </p>
    <p>
     confusion, as flocks of sheep and herds of cattle were united to them,
    </p>
    <p>
     or the miners from the coal pits, and the artisans from the factories
    </p>
    <p>
     joined in the vast, singing army.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like the inexorable morality of the French mobs in the French
    </p>
    <p>
     Revolution, who scornfully resisted the temptations of their
    </p>
    <p>
     own hunger in a fierce zeal to protect private property, so an
    </p>
    <p>
     overmastering enthusiasm permeated those rough Scottish nomads, and
    </p>
    <p>
     they marched through the country rigorously just and honest. There
    </p>
    <p>
     was suffering and death among them, and nothing could have been
    </p>
    <p>
     more sublimely pathetic than the improvised services of burial that
    </p>
    <p>
     were held from time to time along the roads they crossed. Those who
    </p>
    <p>
     heard its vibrant and powerful melody will remember the eclipsing
    </p>
    <p>
     magnificence of the hymn, sung to the air of _Adestes Fideles_, which
    </p>
    <p>
     began with the words:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Firm, faithful and tried,
    </p>
    <p>
     With endless glory crowned.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The success of these “Frigidists” was phenomenal, but it also clearly
    </p>
    <p>
     arose from the awful portents of change which made the stoutest men
    </p>
    <p>
     quail, and not inaptly tested the scepticism of the boldest scoffers.
    </p>
    <p>
     The revolution in Nature had not only affected Scotland; its dire
    </p>
    <p>
     effects were felt in the whole of the Scandinavian area, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     more southern parts of Europe, which had owed some measure of their
    </p>
    <p>
     favorable winters to the direct or intermediate influence of the Gulf
    </p>
    <p>
     Stream, were now made to feel their sudden penury in its removal.
    </p>
    <p>
     A frightful stagnation invaded the European markets; a panic of doubt
    </p>
    <p>
     spread confusion everywhere, and those who controlled the sources of
    </p>
    <p>
     money, very soon checked its use in the avenues of trade, while of
    </p>
    <p>
     necessity speculation and the desire for speculation simultaneously
    </p>
    <p>
     vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the last train intending to leave Edinburgh that, on November
    </p>
    <p>
     28th, waited for the Provost Marshal, and the little army of workers,
    </p>
    <p>
     and which Leacraft also expected to take. The tracks southward had
    </p>
    <p>
     been patrolled by trains of cars or locomotives for every five miles,
    </p>
    <p>
     and these had kept the way cleared, while they reinforced each other
    </p>
    <p>
     at critical junctures. When this last connection between the muffled
    </p>
    <p>
     city and the south should be broken, then practically Scotland
    </p>
    <p>
     returned, over the sweep of sixty thousand years, to a geological phase
    </p>
    <p>
     _resembling_ that which Geikie, Scotland’s own great historian of
    </p>
    <p>
     nature, had described in these words: “All northern Europe and northern
    </p>
    <p>
     America disappeared beneath a thick crust of ice and snow, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     glaciers of such regions as Switzerland assumed gigantic proportions.
    </p>
    <p>
     This great sheet of land-ice levelled up the valleys of Britain, and
    </p>
    <p>
     stretched across our mountains and hills, down to the low latitudes
    </p>
    <p>
     of England, being only one connected or confluent series of mighty
    </p>
    <p>
     glaciers, the ice crept ever downwards, and onwards from the mountains,
    </p>
    <p>
     following the direction of the principal valleys, and pushing far out
    </p>
    <p>
     to sea, where it terminated at last in deep water, many miles away from
    </p>
    <p>
     what now forms the coast-line of our country. This sea of ice was of
    </p>
    <p>
     such extent that the glaciers of Scandinavia coalesced with those of
    </p>
    <p>
     Scotland, upon what is now the floor of the shallow North Sea, while
    </p>
    <p>
     a mighty stream of ice flowing outwards from the western seaboard
    </p>
    <p>
     obliterated the Hebrides, and sent its icebergs adrift in the deep
    </p>
    <p>
     waters of the Atlantic.”

    <p>
     THE TERROR OF IT.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft and Jim reached the hotel at the Caledonian station, in a
    </p>
    <p>
     crowd of breathless men, all anxious to escape to more reassuring
    </p>
    <p>
     neighborhoods. Thomsen and the young lady so opportunely rescued had
    </p>
    <p>
     availed themselves of the restorative resources of the hotel, and had
    </p>
    <p>
     largely recovered from the exposure and scare of their experience.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft met Sir John C-- standing at the entrance of the hotel, his
    </p>
    <p>
     face clouded with grief and anxiety. Strained to the last limit of
    </p>
    <p>
     endurance by his unwearied exertion to secure the safety of the people,
    </p>
    <p>
     and almost prostrated by the desolating sorrow of deserting the great
    </p>
    <p>
     city, the distinguished publisher expressed in his looks his intense
    </p>
    <p>
     misery of mind. Leacraft expressed a few words of condolence, which
    </p>
    <p>
     were hardly noticed, and then hurried to the former writing room of
    </p>
    <p>
     the hotel, where he found a fire burning, and a hastily prepared
    </p>
    <p>
     luncheon, around which a dense crowd of men were collected, filling the
    </p>
    <p>
     room almost to suffocation, greedily devouring the welcome repast, and
    </p>
    <p>
     muttering doubts of their eventually escaping at all if they remained
    </p>
    <p>
     any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sir John hates to get away,” commented one. “He just can’t make up
    </p>
    <p>
     his mind to go. His heart is broke. But what’s the use? We can’t stay
    </p>
    <p>
     here and be buried alive. The trainmen say it’s a hard job now to get
    </p>
    <p>
     through, and all the way to Glenarken is full of big drifts. I say we
    </p>
    <p>
     must shake this, and it’s nobody’s right to run our heads into danger
    </p>
    <p>
     for the whim of a little love for the old town. Sure, we are all hard
    </p>
    <p>
     enough up, and it’s we that has not got a roof to our heads, nor a bite
    </p>
    <p>
     to our stomachs that has the worst to fear. It’s a cruel sufferin’ to
    </p>
    <p>
     think of it at all; but so it is, and it’s no use fashing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Weel, weel,” said another, “it’s an awfu’ plight, and naebody can say
    </p>
    <p>
     what’s next. We maun better be dead than to pit our heads in a pother
    </p>
    <p>
     of snaw and wait for next simmer to melt us out.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Simmer, man, is it!” exclaimed a rough cart-man with a huge ham
    </p>
    <p>
     sandwich in each hand, and his jaws working on the remnants of their
    </p>
    <p>
     predecessor. “Simmer! It’s all up with the simmers frae now to the end
    </p>
    <p>
     o’ the warld. It’s bonny Scotland good-bye, and mind you, man, you’ll
    </p>
    <p>
     never see gorze again on the Queen’s Drive, I’m thinking, and you’ll
    </p>
    <p>
     never tak’ your bonnet aff on Arthur’s seat, nor pluck the daisy on
    </p>
    <p>
     Holy Rood mead. You’ll never canter to the Pentlands, nor hear the sang
    </p>
    <p>
     of praise go up frae the Roslin chapel, and you’ll nae hear the bell
    </p>
    <p>
     toll frae Grey Friars kirk, nor mark time wi’ the Hielanders in St.
    </p>
    <p>
     Giles’, and you’ll never bide the chance when you can see old Hay’s
    </p>
    <p>
     shop in High street, nor watch the middlings stare their een out at
    </p>
    <p>
     John Knox’s hame. It’s ower by naw,” and the good fellow turned away
    </p>
    <p>
     in a choking effort to repress his own tears, and swallow the generous
    </p>
    <p>
     morsels he had bitten from his overloaded hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft pressed by these disturbed groups, and found, after he
    </p>
    <p>
     had inducted Jim to the hospitalities of the various tables, his
    </p>
    <p>
     own strength and composure deserting him. He sank into a chair and
    </p>
    <p>
     covered his face with his hands. It seemed as if he had lived through
    </p>
    <p>
     some dreadful nightmare, and the weird and sickening sense of yet
    </p>
    <p>
     more miseries, rising thick and fast, covering with gloom a nation’s
    </p>
    <p>
     happiness, stunned him.
    </p>
    <p>
     A soft voice awoke him. He looked up hastily and saw the lady whose
    </p>
    <p>
     arms, half an hour before, had clung unresistingly around his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was unquestionably very pretty, and the returning flush upon her
    </p>
    <p>
     cheeks gave the alabaster clearness of her brow a singular effrontery
    </p>
    <p>
     of beauty. Elsewhere, or under different circumstances, it would have
    </p>
    <p>
     produced in Leacraft a momentary suspicion of artifice. As it was, it
    </p>
    <p>
     held his attention long enough for him to notice that the hair covering
    </p>
    <p>
     her head luxuriantly was a raven black, and was gathered beneath the
    </p>
    <p>
     hood of a soft brown sealskin fur, which clothed her form, while two
    </p>
    <p>
     wonderful opal bracelets, relieved with ruby jewels, in alternating
    </p>
    <p>
     links, most incongruously graced her wrists, the gloves on her fingers
    </p>
    <p>
     were evidently distended by rings, and a superb necklace of diamonds
    </p>
    <p>
     and peridots encircled closely her neck, seen through the half-opened
    </p>
    <p>
     cape. Leacraft rose mechanically to his feet, still conscious of
    </p>
    <p>
     effort, and looked wonderingly at the young face, and at that of her
    </p>
    <p>
     companion, Mr. Thomsen, the Scotchman.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My cousin and I”--the voice was exquisitely gentle and
    </p>
    <p>
     expressive--“can never repay you. It is a slight thing to say to you
    </p>
    <p>
     how much we thank you, but it is not impossible that we can both yet
    </p>
    <p>
     show you our gratitude in some manner that will mean more than words,
    </p>
    <p>
     mean as much for you as your sacrifice meant for us. Is not that so,
    </p>
    <p>
     Ned?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She turned to Mr. Thomsen, who advanced and accosted Leacraft with
    </p>
    <p>
     courteous alacrity. “I am sure, sir, you appreciate our sense of
    </p>
    <p>
     devotion to yourself. You extricated my cousin and myself from a
    </p>
    <p>
     certain and dangerous imprisonment. It might have been something more
    </p>
    <p>
     dreadful. And perhaps,” with a reluctant gaze at the young woman, and
    </p>
    <p>
     a smile of understanding for Leacraft, “you may wish to understand
    </p>
    <p>
     better how the perilous predicament you found us in occurred. It was
    </p>
    <p>
     very simple. This lady, Miss Ethel Tobit,” Leacraft bowed, “was left
    </p>
    <p>
     with myself, her cousin, at the home of her father and mother, on Pitt
    </p>
    <p>
     street, to complete the packing of a quantity of valuables which were
    </p>
    <p>
     at the last moment to be placed in a safe and left there for recovery
    </p>
    <p>
     later; it does now seem as if that word was a poor mask for Never. We
    </p>
    <p>
     had brought food for the house, and felt no fears of escaping before
    </p>
    <p>
     the streets became impassable. Then this last storm broke, and this
    </p>
    <p>
     afternoon, late in the day, we started out--but we had waited too long.
    </p>
    <p>
     My cousin sank under the exertion; I was disabled by a fall, in which
    </p>
    <p>
     my side was seriously bruised. We took refuge in St. Andrew’s Church,
    </p>
    <p>
     whose doors stood providently unclosed, though to swing them out I
    </p>
    <p>
     had to dig with my hands a crevice for their movement, in the rising
    </p>
    <p>
     snow banks forcing them constantly back. Our vigil began. The city in
    </p>
    <p>
     all directions around us was deserted. We could hear the workers on
    </p>
    <p>
     Princes street occasionally, in the lulls of the hurricane, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     whistle from the station sent thrills of anguish through us, as we felt
    </p>
    <p>
     we should soon be alone in an empty city. It was as impossible for
    </p>
    <p>
     us in our crippled state to return to the house in Pitt street as to
    </p>
    <p>
     reach Princes street. We then began calling, and it was you, sir, who
    </p>
    <p>
     responded. I think hunger and thirst would have made it impossible,
    </p>
    <p>
     even in the day, for us to have left our retreat, and only the--”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t, Ned,” cried the quivering girl; “don’t don’t! It’s too awful
    </p>
    <p>
     to think of. We need all our best spirits as it is--but to think--Oh!
    </p>
    <p>
     it’s too horrible!” And she hid her face against her cousin’s breast,
    </p>
    <p>
     and broke into sobs. Leacraft felt the embarrassment, and was ill at
    </p>
    <p>
     ease, though somehow at that mournful moment the sight of a beautiful
    </p>
    <p>
     woman seemed a compensation, and in this case, as she lifted her
    </p>
    <p>
     tearful face to Leacraft, piteously struggling to smile, it awoke in
    </p>
    <p>
     him a kind of ardor to be always near her. He looked almost tenderly
    </p>
    <p>
     at her and said: “I think I have every reason to thank my good fortune
    </p>
    <p>
     and this remarkable weather for a very pleasant adventure. Well, No!”
    </p>
    <p>
     he continued, as he caught the reproachful and grieving glance of Miss
    </p>
    <p>
     Tobit, “that is too cynical. Heaven knows we are all broken-hearted
    </p>
    <p>
     enough to-night to relinquish any false gayety, or even the appearance
    </p>
    <p>
     of it, but certainly, Miss Tobit, I hope this chance acquaintance will
    </p>
    <p>
     establish a friendship between us. It will be the only compensation for
    </p>
    <p>
     this night of agony, and perhaps for all the other nights of agony that
    </p>
    <p>
     still await us. You will not refuse it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Miss Tobit turned instinctively to her friend, and Leacraft, betrayed
    </p>
    <p>
     into an earnestness perhaps somewhat out of place, had a fleeting
    </p>
    <p>
     glance of an evanescent smile, and then the words, even more sweetly
    </p>
    <p>
     spoken than at first, came to his ears:
    </p>
    <p>
     “It would be all your own fault if we fail to be friends. I am sure I
    </p>
    <p>
     can keep my side of the contract.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Thomsen watched this brief exchange of promises not altogether with
    </p>
    <p>
     approval, if the faintly forming frown on his face meant anything,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the evident inclination to take Miss Tobit away from Leacraft’s
    </p>
    <p>
     proximity. But he was entirely courteous, and with a half-whispered
    </p>
    <p>
     comment that, “It would not do now to tire their benefactor any more,”
    </p>
    <p>
     he moved off and drew the lady with him. And then the summons came from
    </p>
    <p>
     the other end of the room that all was in readiness, that Sir John was
    </p>
    <p>
     on the train, and that the attempt to reach the south was to be made.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was much confusion and some indecent precipitation to gain the
    </p>
    <p>
     door, and in the rush Leacraft lost sight of his newly made friends,
    </p>
    <p>
     but found, to his great satisfaction, Jim at his side, for Jim had
    </p>
    <p>
     turned out to be that sort of a fellow that meets predicaments with
    </p>
    <p>
     coolness, and quietly, without words, instills confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft was a little nettled over his seriousness with Miss Tobit,
    </p>
    <p>
     because it revealed again to himself that prosaic stiffness of language
    </p>
    <p>
     which he consciously recognized as having formed an element of failure
    </p>
    <p>
     with Miss Garrett, whose plastic wit found in it a source of amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
     He walked towards the door, wondering bitterly why women placed so much
    </p>
    <p>
     value on a turn of speech, or the accent of a compliment, when his
    </p>
    <p>
     musing discontent was interrupted by a hand laid on his arm. He turned
    </p>
    <p>
     around and saw a member of the Common Council of the city, associated
    </p>
    <p>
     with Sir John C-- in the last days of the city’s government. The
    </p>
    <p>
     stranger accosted him. “Mr. Leacraft, the Provost Marshal wishes you to
    </p>
    <p>
     share his compartment. He has a great desire to speak with you on the
    </p>
    <p>
     affairs of the city, and the dreadful things which seem to be before
    </p>
    <p>
     us. This way, sir,” and he motioned to a large parlor coach in the
    </p>
    <p>
     centre of the train.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft retained him. Placing his hand on Jim’s shoulder, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
     “This man goes with me.” The councilman for a moment looked puzzled,
    </p>
    <p>
     but almost instantly rejoined, “Certainly, sir; your personal
    </p>
    <p>
     attendants are welcome.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft laughed and exclaimed, “No, sir, this is no personal attendant
    </p>
    <p>
     of mine. This is only a brave man, whom I am proud to call my friend,”
    </p>
    <p>
     and as he turned to Jim the latter gave him a glance of the sincerest
    </p>
    <p>
     gratitude and pride.
    </p>
    <p>
     The councilman waived the privilege of questions and nodding
    </p>
    <p>
     vigorously his assent, led Leacraft and Jim to the car of Sir John.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a car of an American type, and comfortably provided with couches
    </p>
    <p>
     and seats, tables and easy chairs. A number of men were already in
    </p>
    <p>
     it, and some refreshments, with the circulation of bottles of Scotch
    </p>
    <p>
     whiskey, showed Leacraft the unappeasible claims of man’s appetite,
    </p>
    <p>
     even in the ruins of his own fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sir John occupied a chair at a round table in a further corner of the
    </p>
    <p>
     compartment, and as Leacraft made his way towards him, the eyes of the
    </p>
    <p>
     city’s chief gazed at him in return with inexpressible weariness and
    </p>
    <p>
     sadness. Leacraft motioned Jim to a seat, and took the proffered hand
    </p>
    <p>
     of Sir John, who let his arm fall heavily on the table, and still kept
    </p>
    <p>
     his eyes fixed on Leacraft, motionless and silent. It was Leacraft who
    </p>
    <p>
     first spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think, Sir John, that it was a few years ago that I secured your
    </p>
    <p>
     intervention for a poor fellow who was condemned offhand, and you were
    </p>
    <p>
     willing to help me turn the law back in its course, that it might have
    </p>
    <p>
     an opportunity to find out what it was made for--murder or justice.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, I do recall it, and, Mr. Leacraft, do you know,” replied Sir
    </p>
    <p>
     John, “that that day seems unmercifully far away. It seems as if you
    </p>
    <p>
     and I lived then in another world, and as if we perhaps had died, and
    </p>
    <p>
     were living in quite a different one now, and one very much worse,
    </p>
    <p>
     however bad the old one was. I am too dazed with all this. I feel as
    </p>
    <p>
     if I must wake up and find it all a horrible nightmare. But there can
    </p>
    <p>
     be no excuse for self-deception with me. I have studied this question.
    </p>
    <p>
     I am one of the most convinced that Scotland is doomed. Yes,” and the
    </p>
    <p>
     speaker straightened himself with a movement of exhaustion, “that
    </p>
    <p>
     England is doomed, too, that we are about to see primal conditions
    </p>
    <p>
     returning which are normal physiographic states, but which will destroy
    </p>
    <p>
     our civilization. Listen,” and as Leacraft sank into a chair near
    </p>
    <p>
     him, he leaned again upon the table and spoke with a sort of eager
    </p>
    <p>
     impatience at his own logic, as if he invited and expected and hoped
    </p>
    <p>
     for contradiction. “Listen. The isothermals as they existed before
    </p>
    <p>
     this calamity were a travesty on the map; they were an outrage upon
    </p>
    <p>
     meteorological symmetry. See here,” and Sir John drew out a portfolio
    </p>
    <p>
     which he opened on the table before him; he opened it and displayed a
    </p>
    <p>
     Mercator projection of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was about to continue when a shout, which had mingled with it
    </p>
    <p>
     a throb of grief, like a loud wail, entered their ears--Leacraft
    </p>
    <p>
     noticed at the moment that the train was moving; it had been moving
    </p>
    <p>
     for some time. He looked out of the compartment window. “We are
    </p>
    <p>
     leaving Edinburgh,” his voice sank to a sympathetic whisper, as Sir
    </p>
    <p>
     C-- suddenly turned to gaze, too, along with all the rest, upon the
    </p>
    <p>
     shrouded city.
    </p>
    <p>
     The snow was falling from a leaden sky, and the mantled city, with its
    </p>
    <p>
     higher buildings, here a spire, there a monument, like an irregular
    </p>
    <p>
     mound hiding a burial, was indistinctly, very partially, seen. The men
    </p>
    <p>
     and one woman--the Scotch girl saved that afternoon from the tomb of
    </p>
    <p>
     snow--were standing in the coaches, leaning out of the open windows, to
    </p>
    <p>
     fathom the dull, mottling obscurity of the air, to catch--to be forever
    </p>
    <p>
     remembered--some recognized feature of the great, beautiful habitation
    </p>
    <p>
     now left in the on-coming night time, to be buried in the whirling
    </p>
    <p>
     wreaths. Hidden between its hills, imperishable but unseen, and waiting
    </p>
    <p>
     for its resurrection again into the joy of life and usefulness--a
    </p>
    <p>
     dead city, save for those brigands who, like wolves or ghouls, dared
    </p>
    <p>
     death to fatten on abandoned riches, amid its solemn, terrifying
    </p>
    <p>
     loneliness! Strange vicissitude! and as Leacraft descried, in a blurred
    </p>
    <p>
     exaggeration of its natural size, the dome of St. George’s Church,
    </p>
    <p>
     opposite the Albert Memorial, a voice somewhere among the tearful and
    </p>
    <p>
     dumb gazers repeated this verse from Burns’ invocation to the honored
    </p>
    <p>
     and historic site:
    </p>
    <p>
     With awe-struck thought and pitying tears,
    </p>
    <p>
     I view that noble, stately dome
    </p>
    <p>
     Where Scotia’s kings of other years,
    </p>
    <p>
     Fam’d heroes, had their royal home.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alas! how changed the times to come!
    </p>
    <p>
     Their royal name low in the dust!
    </p>
    <p>
     Their hapless race wild-wandering roam,
    </p>
    <p>
     Tho’ rigid law cries out,’twas just!
    </p>
    <p>
     Though the train made a toilsome way and interrupted progress, with
    </p>
    <p>
     steam sweepers ahead of it, the city soon faded away. The eye could
    </p>
    <p>
     not long pierce that forest of descending veils of snow, the sepulchre
    </p>
    <p>
     would soon be accomplished, and the spectators shuddered at the thought
    </p>
    <p>
     of those voluntarily immured and hapless wretches, who had seized this
    </p>
    <p>
     chance for a few hours’ reckless pleasure, and then--their own death,
    </p>
    <p>
     murdered by each other’s hand in the furious combat for survival, or
    </p>
    <p>
     choked with the many fingers of the frost at their necks. And Leacraft
    </p>
    <p>
     remained at the window still looking, while Sir John patiently waited,
    </p>
    <p>
     staring at his map, or raising his eyes expectantly to Leacraft, to
    </p>
    <p>
     resume his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     A bitter thought passed through Leacraft’s mind. Edinburgh had been
    </p>
    <p>
     faithless. Dressed in beauty, rich in reputation, nurtured in elegance
    </p>
    <p>
     and culture, she had been wickedly selfish. Her streets were filled
    </p>
    <p>
     with embruted men and women, with the vassals of drink and depravity;
    </p>
    <p>
     her picturesque quarters hid misery and vulgar need, unsanitary and
    </p>
    <p>
     simply mean corners of wretchedness, filled with creatures to whom life
    </p>
    <p>
     was an uneasy mixture of sleep and drunkenness. She had done nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     for these. Her life was part of the life of the whole kingdom, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     word of that life was selfishness, the stupid adhesion to conventional
    </p>
    <p>
     usage which kept the land from the people, which loaded taxes and
    </p>
    <p>
     rents upon a slaving many, for the perpetuation of an indulgent and
    </p>
    <p>
     luxurious life to the few. The upper surfaces of society, brilliant
    </p>
    <p>
     and dazzlingly sleek with pride, and puffed up with the vanity of
    </p>
    <p>
     knowledge, cushioned upon a contemptuous forgetfulness of duty, of
    </p>
    <p>
     sympathy, conceitedly viewing their reflections in Burke’s Peerage, or
    </p>
    <p>
     Chalmer’s Landed Gentry, begrudging every concession to modern sense
    </p>
    <p>
     of justice, denying the equality of men, fostering the silly homage of
    </p>
    <p>
     their inferiors, and rankly gathering around the idiocy of a futile
    </p>
    <p>
     monarchy. It was a class life, a class gospel, a class cultus, the
    </p>
    <p>
     arrogance of a classification of the humans of society, which made the
    </p>
    <p>
     joy of the world the prerogative of those who by birth or fortune found
    </p>
    <p>
     themselves foreordained to possess it, and who now--God willing--would
    </p>
    <p>
     fight every inch of their vantage ground to keep that advantage,
    </p>
    <p>
     believing that a fine suavity of demeanor, a generous support of
    </p>
    <p>
     fashion, a supercilious deference to education as an aristocratic
    </p>
    <p>
     embellishment, a pretentious clemency of judgement and an unfailing
    </p>
    <p>
     church attendance, would save them before any supernatural tribunal--if
    </p>
    <p>
     indeed such a tribunal existed--of particular blame. Those among them
    </p>
    <p>
     yet endowed with the pulses of human feeling, gentle in spirit and
    </p>
    <p>
     blessed with the better sentimentalities of religion, visited the
    </p>
    <p>
     poor, and dropped lunch baskets at their doors, and assumed the fine
    </p>
    <p>
     benison of stooping angels--a shallow thoughtlessness which did nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     for the regeneration of permanent social outrages. The unemployed
    </p>
    <p>
     might clamor, the poor might continue to multiply, and the young and
    </p>
    <p>
     ambitious might sail away on white wings to the new life of America,
    </p>
    <p>
     but the lord and landlord must still remain, because in the sight of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Lord God Almighty the lord and the landlord are part and parcel
    </p>
    <p>
     of the eternal order of things, an appanage of His eternal throne
    </p>
    <p>
     and a reflection of the rule of Heaven. And beneath all this was the
    </p>
    <p>
     sickly obsequiousness and snuffling adoration of ordinary men, which of
    </p>
    <p>
     course the lord and ladies despised, but which after all was helpful in
    </p>
    <p>
     keeping up the distinguished humbug.
    </p>
    <p>
     This on its best side, but there was a worse side. There was moral
    </p>
    <p>
     depravity; there was ruthless wickedness; there was a set so smart
    </p>
    <p>
     that they defied decency and rectitude, and travelled on the currents
    </p>
    <p>
     of their passions to all the maelstroms of moral rottenness. The King
    </p>
    <p>
     himself had violated the measures of sobriety and faithfulness. And
    </p>
    <p>
     this imposing and historical structure, must now totter to its fall
    </p>
    <p>
     before the drifting snowflake. Truly the simple shall confound the
    </p>
    <p>
     wise. Leacraft turned from his melancholy thoughts to the friendly face
    </p>
    <p>
     of Sir John, who, catching his eye, resumed his conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This map will make it quite plain that the position of our nation
    </p>
    <p>
     as a commercial, as a political fabric, is a geographical absurdity,
    </p>
    <p>
     a necessary paradox. Look!” and Sir John pinned down the map on the
    </p>
    <p>
     table, and drew Leacraft down towards its attentive examination. “Here!
    </p>
    <p>
     is an occular demonstration of our false position, a charted proof that
    </p>
    <p>
     we are in a wrong place, a spot of possible change, that will reverse
    </p>
    <p>
     all previous experiences if the right conditions supervene. The change
    </p>
    <p>
     has come, and Scotland returns to its appointed allegiance. It belongs
    </p>
    <p>
     to the Kings of the Ice. See,” and he leaned over the map in a kind of
    </p>
    <p>
     ecstacy of despair, speaking rapidly as his fingers traced the lines
    </p>
    <p>
     he indicated. “See! consider these enormities. Land’s End and the
    </p>
    <p>
     Scilly Islands, where palms grow, are on the degree of 50 degree north
    </p>
    <p>
     latitude, which is the same as Notre Dame Bay in New Foundland, the
    </p>
    <p>
     same as Manitoba, the same as the most northern Kurile Islands. Do you
    </p>
    <p>
     know what the temperature of these places are? I will tell you. The
    </p>
    <p>
     average winter temperature of northern New Foundland is 10 degrees,
    </p>
    <p>
     that of Manitoba 9 degrees, and that of the Kurile Islands, 12 degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The average temperature of Land’s End is 40 degrees. Well, that
    </p>
    <p>
     may not strike you as a contrast so sharp as to warrant my dire
    </p>
    <p>
     prediction, but you must learn to see in average temperatures much
    </p>
    <p>
     more than is simply indicated in the mere differences in degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
     Averages are utterly misleading, so far as they mean habitable
    </p>
    <p>
     conditions. A temperature of 0 for six months, and a temperature of 80
    </p>
    <p>
     degrees, for the remaining six months furnishes the harmless average
    </p>
    <p>
     of 40 degrees, but a land suffering from the affliction of a climate
    </p>
    <p>
     such as that, would be useless for the larger purposes of a civilized
    </p>
    <p>
     community. Averages produce an impression of uniformity, whereas they
    </p>
    <p>
     conceal the most obstreperous changes--and a small difference, such as
    </p>
    <p>
     you observe between the temperature of the Scilly islands, and these
    </p>
    <p>
     inclement and impossible districts of Canada or Kamtchatka, means that
    </p>
    <p>
     though all are on the same latitude, they are as diversely adapted
    </p>
    <p>
     for modern life as the tropics and the north pole. Why are the Scilly
    </p>
    <p>
     islands adapted for tulips and spring peas, when Manitoba yet sleeps in
    </p>
    <p>
     snow?
    </p>
    <p>
     “From the point of view of a primary instruction in temperature,
    </p>
    <p>
     hottest at the equator, coldest at the pole, and graded all the
    </p>
    <p>
     way between; it is a preposterous caprice. It is a caprice. And a
    </p>
    <p>
     civilization flourishing under the auspices of a caprice, will come
    </p>
    <p>
     to grief. Climate is a symbol of vagaries, contradictions and sudden
    </p>
    <p>
     affinities. It is the atmospheric expression for the feminine and the
    </p>
    <p>
     poetic in men. As a matter of fact contingencies of interfering land
    </p>
    <p>
     surfaces, of changing barometric pressure, of oceanic tides, of air
    </p>
    <p>
     currents, of solar radiation, combine into a labyrinth of possibilities
    </p>
    <p>
     to make places that ought to be cold, hot, and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But they are evanescent possibilities, and the founders of empires
    </p>
    <p>
     who rely on them will some day be brought back with stunning, abject
    </p>
    <p>
     terror, as we now are, to the realization of first principles, that
    </p>
    <p>
     latitudes are invincible barriers to the diffusion of the race, and
    </p>
    <p>
     that the nations neglecting their plain meaning court disaster. Well;
    </p>
    <p>
     you know the explanation of all these whims of nature. The old story;
    </p>
    <p>
     the Gulf Stream with its millions of units of heat forced northward
    </p>
    <p>
     by wind pressure, and accelerated eastward by the equatorial velocity
    </p>
    <p>
     it starts out with, our insular position bathed in oceanic waters,
    </p>
    <p>
     holding immense deposits of the sun’s heat; the open seas north of
    </p>
    <p>
     us; the great furnace stores of heat in Africa, like a nearby factory
    </p>
    <p>
     heating our thin coasts. That is common knowledge--but these accidents
    </p>
    <p>
     of position, these migratory tides are holding in check invincible
    </p>
    <p>
     tendencies. Like a child’s push against an evenly balanced boulder
    </p>
    <p>
     they keep off the descent of disaster, but like another child’s push
    </p>
    <p>
     in the opposite direction, a sudden alteration of coast lines reduces
    </p>
    <p>
     our boasted exemption to a shadow, and London, Edinburgh, Liverpool,
    </p>
    <p>
     Glasgow, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, Hamburgh--the great cities of the
    </p>
    <p>
     world--pay at last the penalty of an infringement of nature’s Common
    </p>
    <p>
     Law.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Heat is life, and cold is death, and no blank optimism may hope for
    </p>
    <p>
     national achievement in the frosts of winter. Our civilization, the
    </p>
    <p>
     civilization of northern Europe, has overstepped the limits of climatic
    </p>
    <p>
     permission, as this globe is made. We are the victims of a deception.
    </p>
    <p>
     Primary conditions of temperature are returning, a meteorological hoax
    </p>
    <p>
     is exploded, and 50 degrees north latitude will mean in Europe what
    </p>
    <p>
     it has always meant elsewhere. But look at Edinburgh, look at these
    </p>
    <p>
     isothermals on the map, attributing to her the temperature of far
    </p>
    <p>
     southern latitudes. Too obvious an absurdity to last. True enough. Yes,
    </p>
    <p>
     but fugitive; an episode only. So flat a contradiction of the economy
    </p>
    <p>
     of this round earth should never have misled us. And we have had
    </p>
    <p>
     warnings--”
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. C-- stopped; his agitation fairly choked him. Leacraft sympathized
    </p>
    <p>
     with the gentleman’s distress. His bitterness of heart had created a
    </p>
    <p>
     mental hallucination, an unbalanced affectation of epigram. Leacraft
    </p>
    <p>
     interposed: “Well, Sir John, the empire of Great Britain has no
    </p>
    <p>
     reason to regret its existence, even if it is based on a climatic
    </p>
    <p>
     fallacy. There have been some things done in it which no change in
    </p>
    <p>
     temperature will obliterate, unless the Ice Age is returning and we
    </p>
    <p>
     all decline into extinction north and south, and the Earth is again
    </p>
    <p>
     without form and void. You speak of caprices. How can you tell this
    </p>
    <p>
     is not a caprice, too, a monstrous subterfuge of Nature to teach us
    </p>
    <p>
     a lesson, letting us come back again when we are better, when we can
    </p>
    <p>
     feel and keep grateful to Her for letting us live at all. You err in
    </p>
    <p>
     deduction Sir John. A round Earth exposed to the sun’s heat with a
    </p>
    <p>
     zenith movement from 23,28 north latitude to 23,28 south latitude, must
    </p>
    <p>
     exhibit water currents flowing north, and bringing with them equatorial
    </p>
    <p>
     temperatures. Such a fact is as normal as that the same earth must be
    </p>
    <p>
     colder at the poles than at the equator. You are involved in a sophism,
    </p>
    <p>
     because you assume a principle which is imaginary, so far as its
    </p>
    <p>
     invariable truth is concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And what warnings have we ever had?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Warnings!” said Sir John, after a moment’s silence during which he
    </p>
    <p>
     regarded Leacraft with a guarded hopefulness, “Warnings! Many.” And he
    </p>
    <p>
     took out a note book from which he read. “The winters of 1544, 1608,
    </p>
    <p>
     1709, were terrific--the thermometer at Paris in 1709, sank to nine
    </p>
    <p>
     degrees below zero Fah. In 1788–1789, the river Seine froze over in
    </p>
    <p>
     November. Then there was 1794–5, 1798–9, when the rivers of Europe
    </p>
    <p>
     were frozen over. In 1795, the mercury in Paris registered ten degrees
    </p>
    <p>
     below zero, although at the same time in London the temperature was
    </p>
    <p>
     nearly seven degrees above zero. And then we have 1812–3 when Napoleon
    </p>
    <p>
     failed, defeated by the cold rather than the Russians. In 1819–20, in
    </p>
    <p>
     1829–30, in 1840–41, in 1853–4, 1870–71, during the Franco-German war,
    </p>
    <p>
     with the cold greater at the south than in the north of France, and
    </p>
    <p>
     when--this is worth noting--the Gulf Stream was driven backward by a
    </p>
    <p>
     north wind, and banked up, as it were, at Spain and Portugal; in all
    </p>
    <p>
     these years there were intensely cold winters, which if continued, and
    </p>
    <p>
     reinforced by storms, and increased by the disappearance of some of the
    </p>
    <p>
     helpful agencies that now keeps up our supply of caloric, would mean,
    </p>
    <p>
     could only mean our extinction.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now as for degrees of cold--I quote from Flammarion--‘the greatest
    </p>
    <p>
     cold yet experienced has been twenty-four degrees below zero in France,
    </p>
    <p>
     five degrees below in England, twelve below in Belgium and Holland,
    </p>
    <p>
     sixty-seven degrees in Denmark, Sweden and Norway, forty-six in Russia,
    </p>
    <p>
     thirty-two in Germany, ten degrees below in Spain and Portugal.’ These
    </p>
    <p>
     are Fahrenheit records. These severities tell us our danger.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It seems to me,” rejoined Leacraft, “that they tell us nothing of the
    </p>
    <p>
     sort. It is a mild madness to misconstrue them so completely. These
    </p>
    <p>
     extremes of temperatures are far lower than any we have observed, and
    </p>
    <p>
     yet we have been expelled from Scotland. It is the snow. These endless
    </p>
    <p>
     heaping torrents from the skies that have driven us out, and they--I
    </p>
    <p>
     do believe it--will continue; but it has no parallel. Nothing warned us
    </p>
    <p>
     of this--and as to our climatic safety, it was as fixed as the change
    </p>
    <p>
     of day to night when, without warning, without precedent, a bridge
    </p>
    <p>
     of mountains tumbles into a hole in the sea, another bridge rises as
    </p>
    <p>
     a dam, and either occurrence seemed about as likely as that the moon
    </p>
    <p>
     would fall into the sun. I think indeed the advantage of a guess might
    </p>
    <p>
     have lain with the latter supposition.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well. The snow; you say it will continue,” said Sir John with a sudden
    </p>
    <p>
     reflex action of revolt. “Why will it continue?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I estimate the probability for that in this way,” answered Leacraft.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The atmosphere is a system of balances never at rest, unless in
    </p>
    <p>
     equilibrium, and never in equilibrium except at rare intervals, and
    </p>
    <p>
     then in limited and favored spots. This state of inequilibrium causes
    </p>
    <p>
     constant motion, currents, storms, winds and precipitation, whether
    </p>
    <p>
     of rain or snow, depending on temperature and position. Now the motor
    </p>
    <p>
     power of the movement in all this atmospheric mass is difference of
    </p>
    <p>
     temperature, the hot air rising and flowing to the poles, and the cold
    </p>
    <p>
     air of the poles descending and flowing to the equator. That is the
    </p>
    <p>
     A. B. C. of meteorological physics. But the revolution of the earth
    </p>
    <p>
     causes the cold polar winds to blow from the northeast and the warm
    </p>
    <p>
     equatorial winds to blow from the southwest, that is with reference
    </p>
    <p>
     to our position in the northern hemisphere. Now if we are undergoing
    </p>
    <p>
     a progressive refrigeration, the contrast in temperatures between our
    </p>
    <p>
     latitude and the temperature of the equator increases, and because
    </p>
    <p>
     of that, the velocity of the wind blowing from the latter increases
    </p>
    <p>
     too, and the moisture that these winds would have dropped over the
    </p>
    <p>
     equatorial zones is carried further north, and our annual precipitation
    </p>
    <p>
     is thereby increased--our snow falls become more continuous and
    </p>
    <p>
     thicker. Think what the removal of the Gulf Stream means. Croll has
    </p>
    <p>
     clearly shown that the heat bearing capacity of the Gulf Stream is
    </p>
    <p>
     enormous. It seems incredible. I recall some of his statements. He
    </p>
    <p>
     says that the Gulf Stream conveys as much heat as is received from the
    </p>
    <p>
     sun by over one million and a half square miles at the equator, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the amount thus conveyed is equal to all the heat which falls upon the
    </p>
    <p>
     globe within thirty-two miles on each side of the equator; further
    </p>
    <p>
     that the quantity of heat conveyed by the Gulf Stream in one year is
    </p>
    <p>
     equal to the heat which falls, on an average, on three millions and a
    </p>
    <p>
     half square miles of the arctic regions, and that there is actually
    </p>
    <p>
     therefore nearly one-half as much heat transferred from tropical
    </p>
    <p>
     regions by the Gulf Stream as is received from the sun by the entire
    </p>
    <p>
     Arctic regions, the quantity conveyed from the tropics by the stream to
    </p>
    <p>
     that received from the sun by the Arctic regions being nearly as two
    </p>
    <p>
     to five. And it is this fact of the tremendous drain that the Gulf
    </p>
    <p>
     Stream makes on the equatorial regions, those immense manufactories of
    </p>
    <p>
     heat, that its removal--meaning the sudden abstraction of this heat
    </p>
    <p>
     or much of it from our latitude--produces a more forceful interchange
    </p>
    <p>
     in the airs of the north and the south. It produces winds of a higher
    </p>
    <p>
     velocity, and because of this, the wind coming to us from the Equator
    </p>
    <p>
     does not so quickly free itself of its contained moisture. Croll has
    </p>
    <p>
     shown in his splendid work of theory and proof, that the winds warmed
    </p>
    <p>
     by the Gulf stream are the true causes for our unusual and exceptional
    </p>
    <p>
     heat above corresponding positions on the western side of the Atlantic
    </p>
    <p>
     basin. The Gulf Stream gone, these warming winds will bring us heat no
    </p>
    <p>
     longer. But they will bring us moisture, and in larger quantities, and
    </p>
    <p>
     then the process of refrigeration over our chilled coasts will turn
    </p>
    <p>
     that into snow. The snows will be deeper, and they will last longer. In
    </p>
    <p>
     this way, Croll, defending himself against the criticism of Findlay,
    </p>
    <p>
     shows that the winds--the anti-trades blowing from the south to replace
    </p>
    <p>
     the atmospheric emptiness--I suppose we might say vacuum--left by the
    </p>
    <p>
     descent of the cold winds from the poles, parted with the most of
    </p>
    <p>
     their moisture in the equatorial belt. Now by reason of their greater
    </p>
    <p>
     velocity they will not do that; they will reach us much less despoiled
    </p>
    <p>
     of their watery burdens.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Our highlands and our coast position make us natural condensers.
    </p>
    <p>
     To-day we have a rainfall in the year of about thirty inches. That may
    </p>
    <p>
     now be doubled. The southwest winds are our most general winds. Out of
    </p>
    <p>
     a thousand as a maximum, during the year, two hundred and twenty-five
    </p>
    <p>
     are from the southwest. These are wet winds. And in the same total
    </p>
    <p>
     there are one hundred and eleven south winds which also carry moisture,
    </p>
    <p>
     making a possible percentage of one third of all the winds that blow
    </p>
    <p>
     over us as rain winds, or now by reason of our altered state as snow
    </p>
    <p>
     makers. But this relative frequency will now be increased. There will
    </p>
    <p>
     be a longer continuation of the west winds, because as I have suggested
    </p>
    <p>
     they will be stronger. They are to-day most intense in the winter
    </p>
    <p>
     months. Our south and southwest winds gather moisture from a wide
    </p>
    <p>
     expanse of sea, the same expanse from which they formerly gathered heat
    </p>
    <p>
     from the Gulf Stream was widely diffused over the north Atlantic, both
    </p>
    <p>
     north and south, for as Croll shows, by reason of a high barometric
    </p>
    <p>
     pressure somewhere off the west of Maderia and a low pressure north of
    </p>
    <p>
     Iceland, the tendency of the air south of the English Isles at that
    </p>
    <p>
     point is to flow north. But these winds are no longer heat carriers.
    </p>
    <p>
     They bring moisture only. They bear to us through the air the winding
    </p>
    <p>
     sheets of our burial.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The two men looked at each other, and it was a look of anguish. The
    </p>
    <p>
     sudden cruel dreadfulness, the hideous mutation which might send the
    </p>
    <p>
     English people out of their land on the strange quest for a new home
    </p>
    <p>
     crushed them into an emotional inanition. They did not seem to exist.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their lips lost their color, and only the paralysis of stupor saved
    </p>
    <p>
     them from breaking down into sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a few moments later that Leacraft spoke. He asked, “And the
    </p>
    <p>
     people of Glasgow. How did they get away?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Sir John Clarke scarcely raised his head and his words scarcely formed
    </p>
    <p>
     an articulate whisper; “They went by steamers.”

     CHAPTER VII.
    </head>
    <p>
     IN LONDON, FEBRUARY, 1910.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the smoking room of the Bothwell Club, on Cheapside, back of St.
    </p>
    <p>
     Paul’s, London, on February 12th, in the year of grace, 1910, two men
    </p>
    <p>
     sat in attitudes of earnest attention. A third man older than either
    </p>
    <p>
     with his back to a blazing fire, whose simulated effect of comfort
    </p>
    <p>
     arose from the curling tendrills of gas flames that swept over another
    </p>
    <p>
     simulation of heaped up logs, was speaking with desperate emphasis. He
    </p>
    <p>
     seldom looked at his arrested auditors, nor indeed moved, except when
    </p>
    <p>
     he raised his head, and his eyes, strained with a hopeless longing,
    </p>
    <p>
     sought the gay frescoes of the ceiling, or when, in pauses of his
    </p>
    <p>
     declamations, he walked to a window and raising the curtain looked out
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the city, up to the dome of St. Paul’s, which rose like an Irkutsk
    </p>
    <p>
     igloo above a plain of snow.
    </p>
    <p>
     The man was Alexander Leacraft, the auditors were Mr. Archibald Edward
    </p>
    <p>
     Thomsen and Jim Skaith, both familiar to the reader as rescued and
    </p>
    <p>
     rescuing, in that awful day of November 28th, when the last little band
    </p>
    <p>
     of citizens, led by the provost-marshal, had slipped away in the storm
    </p>
    <p>
     from Edinburgh. Strange things had happened since then: much stranger
    </p>
    <p>
     were in store. The train in which Sir John C-- and his companions
    </p>
    <p>
     escaped, had made its way with painful slowness, and before the
    </p>
    <p>
     English line was reached had stopped repeatedly until it was necessary
    </p>
    <p>
     to desert it. And then the weary crowd of refugees had staggered on
    </p>
    <p>
     their way to a distant station, along a country side emptied of its
    </p>
    <p>
     inhabitants, with the low houses of the country people evident only as
    </p>
    <p>
     mounds of snow. And, with many struggles, with mutual assistance, with
    </p>
    <p>
     prayers and suffering, the men pushed on in the closest companionship,
    </p>
    <p>
     brought by the terrors and dangers of the journey into the usual
    </p>
    <p>
     unhesitating intimacy of peril. They took each other’s places in the
    </p>
    <p>
     work of excavation, helped all to flounder and press through the
    </p>
    <p>
     drifts, divided their company into the weak and strong, and so allotted
    </p>
    <p>
     tasks that the co-operation of all helped their common progress. Camps
    </p>
    <p>
     were made in which shelters were clumsily provided, with tents brought
    </p>
    <p>
     from Edinburgh, and which only the industry of the watchers saved also
    </p>
    <p>
     from burial in the tossing drifts.
    </p>
    <p>
     The frugal meals snatched by chance or at the favorable moments where
    </p>
    <p>
     inequalities of the ground permitted a more regular distribution and
    </p>
    <p>
     preparation of food served well enough. Now and then they espied a
    </p>
    <p>
     deserted house, and into this they crowded, enjoying the heat of fires
    </p>
    <p>
     made of the wood-work, the floors and windows of the house itself,
    </p>
    <p>
     while they dried their clothing, changed their shoes, and, gaining
    </p>
    <p>
     a respite and new strength, salleyed out again into the desolate
    </p>
    <p>
     landscape with its blue gray skies flaming with crimson, when the day
    </p>
    <p>
     set, and the snow cleared, and a sharpened icy edge of cold vibrated
    </p>
    <p>
     like an unseen but intensely realized cord stretched nippingly through
    </p>
    <p>
     the air. The leaders expected to reach a place called Tway stone, where
    </p>
    <p>
     a train was in waiting, which would carry them south of this immediate
    </p>
    <p>
     zone of the greatest snow falls. Grewsome sights were encountered, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the blanched faces of men turned away from the uncovered sepulchre of
    </p>
    <p>
     a horse and rider, now a child and mother, and sometimes in the wet
    </p>
    <p>
     morasses still unfrozen, beneath the towering ridges, the forlorn,
    </p>
    <p>
     immured body of a young woman with blanketed face and streaming hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft and Thomsen, with Jim, worked unremittingly with the young
    </p>
    <p>
     Scotch woman. They patched up a rude litter and they carried her on
    </p>
    <p>
     this, trudging toilsomely along, and watching her needs. Their care was
    </p>
    <p>
     affectionate and touching, and soon other strong men offered their
    </p>
    <p>
     help, for gradually the sensation gained place--so quickly does the
    </p>
    <p>
     human fancy cling to the vaporous skirts of superstition--that the
    </p>
    <p>
     girl’s safety meant the rescue of all, that her security carried with
    </p>
    <p>
     it the common weal. She became a fetich, and they rejoiced in caring
    </p>
    <p>
     for her, as if contribution to her welfare conveyed its unseen benefits
    </p>
    <p>
     to all who engaged in the kind ministry. Nor did she fail, with the
    </p>
    <p>
     living hopefulness of youth, and with her fresh winning loveliness, to
    </p>
    <p>
     establish a return. Her smile, the lingering gratitude she showed to
    </p>
    <p>
     all, her own usefulness and ready help at the stop and waiting places
    </p>
    <p>
     when her eager intelligence watched and directed the provisioning and
    </p>
    <p>
     cooking, rewarded the toilers. She was quick and resourceful, cheerful
    </p>
    <p>
     in exhortation and advice, and certainly--to Leacraft--always lovely.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thomsen had forgotten his first resentment at Leacraft’s apparent
    </p>
    <p>
     admiration for his cousin. The two men had become very intimate. Both
    </p>
    <p>
     felt themselves on the edge of new events, which were in part to be
    </p>
    <p>
     shaped by the blind forces of the earth, and in larger part as they
    </p>
    <p>
     affected England, by the sagacity and steadfastness of men. They talked
    </p>
    <p>
     much over these things together. Both were sombre and frightened. The
    </p>
    <p>
     invincible powers of nature, the unconquerable ferocity of nature which
    </p>
    <p>
     is deaf to reason, blind to suffering, made them shrink and quail.
    </p>
    <p>
     To meet its urgency with make shifts was impossible, to resist it
    </p>
    <p>
     madness; the line of retreat was the only line of escape. They felt
    </p>
    <p>
     this; the thought became oppressively dominant. They began at first to
    </p>
    <p>
     hint at it, they ended, quite quickly too, in predicting it with mutual
    </p>
    <p>
     confessions of dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
     Both loved Miss Tobit, yet, as far as appearances went, only the
    </p>
    <p>
     guardian spirit of her dreams could have told the direction of her
    </p>
    <p>
     inclinations. Perhaps both seemed to her too dear, too much involved
    </p>
    <p>
     in the one peril with herself, to stand apart from each other in any
    </p>
    <p>
     guise or place of preference. Thomsen was the younger man, and he
    </p>
    <p>
     had the advantage of a handsome face, a fine form and a particularly
    </p>
    <p>
     deferential tenderness. Cupid and his mother are not slow to give such
    </p>
    <p>
     gifts their heartiest commendation. But Thomsen was generous to his
    </p>
    <p>
     somewhat reticent, and, probably not greatly feared rival, the prowess
    </p>
    <p>
     of beauty is generally undaunted and oftentimes magnanimous.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the worst hardships of their journey were over, and in the less
    </p>
    <p>
     afflicted regions of England, where at the time the snow falls were not
    </p>
    <p>
     as deep, or the winds as tempestuous, Leacraft had many chances to talk
    </p>
    <p>
     with Miss Tobit, and he found her extremely affable, well informed and
    </p>
    <p>
     sympathetic, certainly not endowed with the mischievous drollery and
    </p>
    <p>
     the roguish merriment of Miss Garrett, and therefore not so piquant,
    </p>
    <p>
     tantalizing, and desirable, but very kindly and soothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     The provost-marshal and most of the party went to Liverpool, whither,
    </p>
    <p>
     before, many of the inhabitants of Edinburgh had fled, but Leacraft
    </p>
    <p>
     and Thomsen kept on to London. They found conditions in London full
    </p>
    <p>
     of fright and trepidation, and the business interests floundering and
    </p>
    <p>
     collapsed. Leacraft took up his headquarters at the Bothwell Club, and
    </p>
    <p>
     Thomsen and his cousin found a home at a maiden aunt’s, in Claverhouse
    </p>
    <p>
     place.
    </p>
    <p>
     But much as Leacraft would have craved an indulgence of sympathy and
    </p>
    <p>
     response, the audience of sense and appreciation, and the agreeable
    </p>
    <p>
     picture before his eyes of acquiescent if not admiring beauty, the
    </p>
    <p>
     fatal progress of events in the world of England kept him away from
    </p>
    <p>
     Miss Tobit more than he wished. These events were far from reassuring;
    </p>
    <p>
     they were directly and successively catastrophic. Their logic seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     inexorable; and Europe became rigid with attention as it watched with
    </p>
    <p>
     most varying feelings of commiseration the tightening grasp of frost
    </p>
    <p>
     and snow, wind and tempest, upon the destiny of England. Not that an
    </p>
    <p>
     actual submergence beneath snowdrifts was threatened, a hyperboreal
    </p>
    <p>
     sepulchre under which every Englishman lay, like the Excelsior youth,
    </p>
    <p>
     “lifeless but beautiful.”
    </p>
    <p>
     No such shocking and shattering misery as had befallen Scotland had
    </p>
    <p>
     as yet engulfed England, especially its southern counties, but the
    </p>
    <p>
     darkening days brought more clearly to the observation of the most
    </p>
    <p>
     recalcitrant and obtuse, the most reluctant and temporizing, the fact
    </p>
    <p>
     that England’s climate was approaching that of Labrador, that the
    </p>
    <p>
     restraints of trade would soon become enormous, that its products
    </p>
    <p>
     would be unmitigatedly diminished and restricted, and that it could
    </p>
    <p>
     no longer raise wheat; that its railroads, for half the year, would
    </p>
    <p>
     endure a dangerous embargo; that its population would perish; that
    </p>
    <p>
     its industries would undergo the most serious curtailment; that
    </p>
    <p>
     foreign ports would absorb its commerce, steal its prestige, insinuate
    </p>
    <p>
     themselves, by its crippled resources, into the markets of the earth
    </p>
    <p>
     in its place; that the ramifications of disaster would penetrate its
    </p>
    <p>
     social, intellectual and political life, and cloud its mental horizon
    </p>
    <p>
     with the gaunt and stupid spectres of Torpor and Helplessness. This
    </p>
    <p>
     monstrous dilemma submerged all minor passions, and plunged England
    </p>
    <p>
     into the noisiest outbreak of argument, suggestion and panic-stricken
    </p>
    <p>
     questionings.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft buried himself in the questions that now with the more forward
    </p>
    <p>
     and statesmanly thinkers were coming to the front with relentless
    </p>
    <p>
     insistence. Amongst these, conspicuously outstrode and outshone
    </p>
    <p>
     the rest, H. G. Wells, the brilliant author and prophet of the New
    </p>
    <p>
     Republicanism, whose book had five years before roused an intense and
    </p>
    <p>
     frightened protest from the servitors of antiquity, and the selfish
    </p>
    <p>
     lackies of a superannuated and mythical class system. Mr. Wells, with
    </p>
    <p>
     his trained skill in scientific deduction and the exercised powers of
    </p>
    <p>
     imagination, with a reckless and defiant desire to unravel the future,
    </p>
    <p>
     with the slenderest regard for the prejudices of religion or old-fogey
    </p>
    <p>
     political conservatism, was now half-deluded himself with the sudden
    </p>
    <p>
     dream of starting the English nation on new grounds. Released from
    </p>
    <p>
     the impedimenta of ceremonies and ruins, names and titles, furnished
    </p>
    <p>
     with a _tabula rasa_ where the new ideals of which he set himself up
    </p>
    <p>
     as a sort of avatar and preacher might most keenly set and develop
    </p>
    <p>
     themselves, he believed--as in a measure Leacraft did himself--that the
    </p>
    <p>
     English cultus would put on those insignia of the coming eras which
    </p>
    <p>
     meant intellectual emancipation, and a social and civil regime where
    </p>
    <p>
     the greatest happiness and the widest material prosperity would unite,
    </p>
    <p>
     in which, too, would not be wanting a radical rearrangement of the
    </p>
    <p>
     relations of the sexes, hinted at in the same author’s later books,
    </p>
    <p>
     but which again, naturally, by many who followed Mr. Wells a certain
    </p>
    <p>
     way, was indignantly repudiated. A more dignified and august group of
    </p>
    <p>
     men--among whom the names of Churchill, Chamberlain, Rosebery, Balfour,
    </p>
    <p>
     Prof. Stubbs, and Bryce led--had assembled themselves in a council of
    </p>
    <p>
     deeply concerned and profoundly patriotic advisers. These men secured
    </p>
    <p>
     a very noble elevation above the wild and unclassified miscellany
    </p>
    <p>
     of men and women who, with cries, denunciations, nostrums, whims,
    </p>
    <p>
     hallucinations, guesses and queries, deluged the pages of the _Times_,
    </p>
    <p>
     stood at the corners of the streets, where such standing was possible
    </p>
    <p>
     in the hard weather, and preached their fantastic mental wares. A still
    </p>
    <p>
     more obvious and ear-assailing group were the religious zealots, who
    </p>
    <p>
     thrive at moments of peril, filling the brains of their listeners with
    </p>
    <p>
     adjurations, exhortations, prayers, pictures and prophecies, for one
    </p>
    <p>
     moment doleful with wailing execrations of past wickedness, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     next piteously shrieking eloquent appeals for repentance and confession.
    </p>
    <p>
     The singular and amazing thing in all this was the convinced assent
    </p>
    <p>
     given to the prediction of Science. Whereas at first the geologists
    </p>
    <p>
     and the meteorologists belittled and ridiculed the warnings of the
    </p>
    <p>
     President, they now enlarged, extended and enforced them with a greater
    </p>
    <p>
     authority, and more illuminated reasoning. Hardly believing that the
    </p>
    <p>
     people of England would realize this approaching disaster, what it
    </p>
    <p>
     meant, what steps should be contemplated to escape its worst effects,
    </p>
    <p>
     how permanent and deep-seated were its causes, the British Association
    </p>
    <p>
     for the Advancement of Science had resolved itself into a body of
    </p>
    <p>
     educators. Lectures were given where practicable, leaflets circulated,
    </p>
    <p>
     letters published in the leading dailies, and a comprehensive
    </p>
    <p>
     educational crusade started--and with one object--to instill a deeper
    </p>
    <p>
     dread of the future, a distrust of the possibility of the longer
    </p>
    <p>
     occupancy of the British Islands, and yet a firm reliance that under
    </p>
    <p>
     changed auspices of place, the same civilization, with unchanged
    </p>
    <p>
     features, would still continue to rule the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     Parliament was constantly in session, and to it the worshipful English
    </p>
    <p>
     householder and pew-renter looked with unwavering faith, waiting for
    </p>
    <p>
     its sublime wisdom and intrinsic patience, to devise ways and means,
    </p>
    <p>
     and some safe policy of safety. Even the King became earnest, perhaps
    </p>
    <p>
     a little anxious, as among the most popular doctrinaire plebiscites
    </p>
    <p>
     was the reiterated need of an abolition of the discarded system of the
    </p>
    <p>
     royal household.
    </p>
    <p>
     From the midst of all this confusion, organized and disorganized
    </p>
    <p>
     movements, the collapse of trade, the desertion of workers, the
    </p>
    <p>
     sudden emergence of a thousand voices claiming, clamoring, debating,
    </p>
    <p>
     the physical wreck of business, the inflamed transcendentalism that
    </p>
    <p>
     saw ahead of the present moment, re-adjudication, rehabilitation,
    </p>
    <p>
     renovation of all social wrongs; and with the cruel winter breathing
    </p>
    <p>
     its desolating rigors, the snow rising in the streets, the poor dying
    </p>
    <p>
     from starvation or exposure, the steamers crowded to their taffrails,
    </p>
    <p>
     daily exporting the timid and selfish rich, or the pinched poor,
    </p>
    <p>
     escaping with a bare competency, to establish themselves under less
    </p>
    <p>
     penurious skies--from all this there suddenly grew into stalwart and
    </p>
    <p>
     national proportions, _the resolve to leave England_.
    </p>
    <p>
     It grew with a certain flaming ardor of noble hopes and resolves.
    </p>
    <p>
     It grew also with an agony of doubt. The whole implication of the
    </p>
    <p>
     idea was grievously wounding to pride, and it strained at the very
    </p>
    <p>
     heart-string of the English nature. To go away from England was to
    </p>
    <p>
     become _un-Englished_, to lose the rich heritage of pastoral beauty,
    </p>
    <p>
     the treasured wealth of historic associations, the spot and home of
    </p>
    <p>
     literary triumphs, the soil, the air, which by some impalpable union of
    </p>
    <p>
     efficacies made the English blood and temperament, and which could not
    </p>
    <p>
     be taken away to make the same fine product elsewhere. The pathos of
    </p>
    <p>
     it! A nation wandering homeless with its Lares and Penates in its arms,
    </p>
    <p>
     its face darkened with humiliation; its shoulders, that erstwhile bore
    </p>
    <p>
     the burdens of states, bowed with the shame of enforced desertion; its
    </p>
    <p>
     voice, that summoned the freemen of the earth to convocation, silent
    </p>
    <p>
     with fear, or perhaps broken by the irrepressible echo wrung from its
    </p>
    <p>
     own anguish, at turning its back on the cradle and the home of its
    </p>
    <p>
     greatness.
    </p>
    <p>
     _And yet it grew_--this same resolve--and eloquence, and poetry, and
    </p>
    <p>
     prayers, and science, and statescraft united to make it strong and
    </p>
    <p>
     beautiful, to blend in it the supernatural benisons of religion, the
    </p>
    <p>
     purified affections of the heart, and the resolute affirmations of
    </p>
    <p>
     conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My friends,”--it was Leacraft speaking from the fireside of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Bothwell Club, in Cheapside, on the night of February 12th, 1910--“I
    </p>
    <p>
     think the speech to-day of the members from Scotland in Parliament was
    </p>
    <p>
     decisive. It leaves no alternative. We cannot hopelessly, in the face
    </p>
    <p>
     of this modern world’s competition, fight out a narrowing chance for
    </p>
    <p>
     existence under the conditions facing us. And it is an unmistakable
    </p>
    <p>
     alternative. Our climate has changed, and the change is irrevocable,
    </p>
    <p>
     and it is subversive, too. We must go away, taking all that we have
    </p>
    <p>
     with us. The English nation has reached a sublime crisis. We transplant
    </p>
    <p>
     our virtues; we will relinquish our failings; we have a world of our
    </p>
    <p>
     own to choose from, and we are given an opportunity unparalleled in
    </p>
    <p>
     history.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s a great chance to begin all over again,” expostulated Jim.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not at all,” resumed Leacraft, his voice rising with that peculiar
    </p>
    <p>
     English intonation of tenuity, which often animates their sluggist
    </p>
    <p>
     accents, if it does not soon soar into nasal squeaks;--“Not at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     We leave England with not a thing forgotten or lost. The machinery of
    </p>
    <p>
     our greatness is in our history, and in ourselves; the products of
    </p>
    <p>
     industry and art, so far as they are necessary fixtures, stay. What
    </p>
    <p>
     of it--a cathedral, a palace here and there? They often stand for
    </p>
    <p>
     things it would be best for us to forget, and under which perhaps only
    </p>
    <p>
     revolution and violence will make us forget, if we remain as we are.
    </p>
    <p>
     What stirs my imagination, what grows visibly before me”--both Thomsen
    </p>
    <p>
     and Jim watched intently the fervid Englishman, released into a sort
    </p>
    <p>
     of mystic clairvoyance--“is a new land which is a physical unit, which
    </p>
    <p>
     has known no political subdivision, which holds within it no inherited
    </p>
    <p>
     rages, and taunting bitternesses, as these islands do to-day. Let it be
    </p>
    <p>
     Australia, let it be South Africa--though there, I admit, is the memory
    </p>
    <p>
     of a bungle--but we enter it a single people, blended into homogeneity
    </p>
    <p>
     by adversity, and we set about the tremendously interesting task of
    </p>
    <p>
     re-creating England, at least in all things pertaining to her that are
    </p>
    <p>
     great and lovable.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I fail to see,” said Thomsen, “that the probabilities are that way. On
    </p>
    <p>
     the contrary, freed from the geographical confinement of neighboring
    </p>
    <p>
     islands governed from London, in a new land, Irish, Scotch, English
    </p>
    <p>
     will segregate again, and then scatter, just as might mixed races of
    </p>
    <p>
     birds, who, while they are in the same cage mingle, but when they fly
    </p>
    <p>
     out, fall back into their natural groups, by the most certain of all
    </p>
    <p>
     animal tendencies, that ‘like seeks like.’”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, and what of it?” retorted Leacraft. “These elements are
    </p>
    <p>
     together in a new country. It is one. There is no history behind it of
    </p>
    <p>
     subjugation and ill treatment; there can be no reversion to bickerings
    </p>
    <p>
     and recriminations where even the monuments and milestones familiarly
    </p>
    <p>
     associated with injustice have disappeared. Besides, we leave behind
    </p>
    <p>
     the obnoxious, shameless law of entail--at least we shall be free of
    </p>
    <p>
     that disgrace--and at last--but,” he added, his voice again sinking to
    </p>
    <p>
     a pained whisper, “with what a wrench!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, Mr. Leacraft,” spoke up Jim Skaith again, “it’s mair than moving
    </p>
    <p>
     that has to be done. There’s the new land to be bought and settled.
    </p>
    <p>
     There’s getting there, and biding there. There’s schools to be built,
    </p>
    <p>
     and hames and shops, and, it seems to me, with pardon for being so
    </p>
    <p>
     forward, that if it took so many years to make a great city, it’s no
    </p>
    <p>
     fule’s wark to sail ower the seas and pit it up again”; then, after a
    </p>
    <p>
     pause, “An’ it’s never the auld hame.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” resumed Leacraft, “that is true. It’s not the old home, and a big
    </p>
    <p>
     city--the greatest--cannot be boxed up in straw and packing cloth and
    </p>
    <p>
     get set up by order in another place, with the precision of a movable
    </p>
    <p>
     bungalow. But we need not trifle. We all know that it’s no child’s
    </p>
    <p>
     work. We expect something very different from London. We can meet the
    </p>
    <p>
     emergencies of place and room. Our population can be distributed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Remember, we are on trial, and the new, strange chapter opening before
    </p>
    <p>
     us will bring again into view the inalienable fortitude and power of
    </p>
    <p>
     the English mind. It’s a test. The conditions are irreversible, and
    </p>
    <p>
     mind and character will win--must win--or slowly, surely, the stars of
    </p>
    <p>
     our ascendancy pale and disappear. Nature for a moment has thrown us
    </p>
    <p>
     in a great peril, but was it nature or ourselves that won us footholds
    </p>
    <p>
     throughout the world? Open coasts await us, hundreds of thousands
    </p>
    <p>
     will welcome us. The influences of a common language, ancestry and
    </p>
    <p>
     institutions have chained together the links of our supremacy around
    </p>
    <p>
     the world, and made of it an inseparable girdle. Shall we falter now,
    </p>
    <p>
     when nature again challenges our mind to quell her hostility, opposing
    </p>
    <p>
     her impediments of sense to our invisible treasuries of thought,
    </p>
    <p>
     invention and self-confidence? It is a new step--our best step,--in
    </p>
    <p>
     the march of human liberty. We need to be divorced from the material
    </p>
    <p>
     constants, amid which the long fought battle for free thought and
    </p>
    <p>
     action has been waged. We are yet entangled in the meshes of tradition,
    </p>
    <p>
     the stumbling blocks of convention--and now they are shattered. We rise
    </p>
    <p>
     to splendid hopes. Or shall we say it is retribution, it is punishment
    </p>
    <p>
     for many sins. Let it be so. A chastened pride will not hurt us, nor
    </p>
    <p>
     will it hurt our chances.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, Leacraft,” interrupted Thomsen, “I feel better to hear you talk
    </p>
    <p>
     this way, but I must look at some very disagreeable facts, too. They
    </p>
    <p>
     are not easily eliminated by words or fancies, and even seem to
    </p>
    <p>
     evince a provoking facility to become more numerous, the more they
    </p>
    <p>
     are considered. Take the mechanical problem of transportation. We are
    </p>
    <p>
     some forty millions of people. The extravagant powers of assimilation
    </p>
    <p>
     of the United States barely digests the one million of emigrants that
    </p>
    <p>
     come to their shores each year; what conceivable powers of absorption
    </p>
    <p>
     will dispose of our forty millions without an attack of industrial
    </p>
    <p>
     _gastritis_ that will induce the worst political convulsions. And the
    </p>
    <p>
     carrying skill and capacity of our whole merchant marine cannot in
    </p>
    <p>
     less than ten years take away this monstrous human cargo, together
    </p>
    <p>
     with all the colossal accumulation of paraphernalia, stocks, chattels,
    </p>
    <p>
     goods, treasures, books and belongings, that have gathered in this
    </p>
    <p>
     rich island, until they seem like a sort of pactolian alluvium that
    </p>
    <p>
     is indigenous and irremovable. Think of the women, the children! What
    </p>
    <p>
     method of domiciliation will you devise to accommodate these armies?
    </p>
    <p>
     And with this removal comes the crash of all domestic values, railroad
    </p>
    <p>
     stock, gas stock, mill stock, warehouses, land values, everything
    </p>
    <p>
     goes with the removal of the human vitality that gives them worth. It
    </p>
    <p>
     staggers the imagination to think how the disorganization radiates and
    </p>
    <p>
     increases in all directions. In 1905–6 this Great Britain consumed
    </p>
    <p>
     in one industry alone nearly four millions of bales of cotton, spun
    </p>
    <p>
     them out into merchantable goods on her fifty million spindles. Do you
    </p>
    <p>
     measure the almost unfathomable depths of distress the stoppage of this
    </p>
    <p>
     one industry means? Is it not better to fight it out here, to defeat
    </p>
    <p>
     Nature, if I may be allowed to copy your own enthusiasm, to put on our
    </p>
    <p>
     own heads the regalia of the Ice King, and _rule him_, wrest from him
    </p>
    <p>
     his own sceptre, and excel his power with the power of this new century
    </p>
    <p>
     of invention?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Impossible.” Leacraft’s retort was quick and impetuous. “Impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
     No expedients of man overcome the deliberate intentions of Nature. We
    </p>
    <p>
     utilize her forces, but we may not deflect her purposes. It is the
    </p>
    <p>
     voice of that very science which has made us such powerful masters
    </p>
    <p>
     of her utilities that now tells us: _We must go._ To quote the words
    </p>
    <p>
     of Prof. Darwin, spoken at the Cape Town meeting of the British
    </p>
    <p>
     Association for the Advancement of Science, ‘Stability is further
    </p>
    <p>
     a property of relationship to surrounding conditions; it denotes
    </p>
    <p>
     adaptation to environment’; there can be no adaptation to this new
    </p>
    <p>
     environment, which will retain our former greatness. Nature opposes
    </p>
    <p>
     us, indeed, in forcing us away, but we thwart her niggardliness by
    </p>
    <p>
     subterfuge and endurance and courage. We can make her plastic enough
    </p>
    <p>
     for our purposes if we do not overstep the limits of her last negation.
    </p>
    <p>
     The practical question, the panic, the loss! Ah! Well, if all should
    </p>
    <p>
     be as it has been, if the inequalities still remained, the very moral
    </p>
    <p>
     significance and regeneration which I hope for could not come. It means
    </p>
    <p>
     the levelling process by which the New Brotherhood is visibly and
    </p>
    <p>
     violently enforced. And as to place and means, thousands upon thousands
    </p>
    <p>
     will establish themselves in America, blessing every community they
    </p>
    <p>
     enter, and being blessed in turn with opportunity. Australia and
    </p>
    <p>
     South Africa, and Canada, with millions upon millions of square miles
    </p>
    <p>
     of unused land, will furnish us with new homes. Revivification,
    </p>
    <p>
     regeneration, rehabilitation will be rapid. We shall not see its
    </p>
    <p>
     final outcome, but we shall know the virile impulse of self help at
    </p>
    <p>
     its inception. If social differences, if social pageantry, vanish,
    </p>
    <p>
     the constraining push of Christian tolerance and fellowship succeeds.
    </p>
    <p>
     Differences may emerge later, but they will be differences of endowment
    </p>
    <p>
     and industrious energy; no other. And as to the transportation problem,
    </p>
    <p>
     it can be solved. We should not all go at once. It may be a slow
    </p>
    <p>
     movement; perhaps the slower the better. But see how we become unified.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like refugees or shipwrecked outcasts, we shall help each other, and
    </p>
    <p>
     every man’s hand will help his neighbor, but also we shall organize on
    </p>
    <p>
     the basis of each man’s aptitude; the farmer to his ploughshare, the
    </p>
    <p>
     mechanic to his workshop, the preacher to his pulpit, the artist to his
    </p>
    <p>
     easel, the banker to his counting room; at last, an ideal assortment
    </p>
    <p>
     of talents.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Thomsen hid a slight yawn, and made a smile of incredulity serve
    </p>
    <p>
     the ends of a salutation of encouragement. “There’s no denying the
    </p>
    <p>
     contagion of your confidence, Leacraft, but really I think that we
    </p>
    <p>
     are all mournfully in the dark as to what we best can do; and in the
    </p>
    <p>
     meanwhile it’s a matter of positive terror what we are going to live
    </p>
    <p>
     on. I brought all the available cash I could for Ethel and myself, but
    </p>
    <p>
     already famine has unfurled its banners, and you know how cramped and
    </p>
    <p>
     shrunk our living has become in London. The Thames alone saves us from
    </p>
    <p>
     starvation. It’s no longer a question of having a bank balance, but the
    </p>
    <p>
     more definite and fundamental one of finding something to buy.
    </p>
    <p>
     “By the by, Balfour closes the debate at ten to-night. You have
    </p>
    <p>
     admission to the gallery of the Commons. Let us go down. It promises to
    </p>
    <p>
     be a fine effort. I only hope it’s not going to be a funeral oration.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft pulled out his watch and found the time a half-hour after
    </p>
    <p>
     nine. Yes, he would go; in fact he had already engaged a boatman at
    </p>
    <p>
     Blackfriars’ Bridge, to be in waiting for him at almost that very
    </p>
    <p>
     moment. Jim stepped to the window and looked out. The night was pure
    </p>
    <p>
     and clear. Huge hummocks of snow encumbered the streets below, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     moon blazed in the keen sky like some target of disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Weel, Mr. Leacraft, you won’t want me along, and somehow I’d rather
    </p>
    <p>
     sit here and think over your own words, little as I believe it will all
    </p>
    <p>
     come oot so gude-like.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, Jim, keep the fire on, and watch out for us, and you might
    </p>
    <p>
     remember to brew us a stiff snack after your own heart; it won’t
    </p>
    <p>
     come amiss.” Jim assented with alacrity, and Leacraft and Mr.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thomsen, muffled up to their ears, and almost hermetically enclosed
    </p>
    <p>
     in fur ulsters, left the room, descended the stairs, and appeared at
    </p>
    <p>
     the doorway on the street. A tolerable path led through a part of
    </p>
    <p>
     Cheapside, but it was not their intention to follow that thoroughfare;
    </p>
    <p>
     they turned towards the church and clambered along a devious footway,
    </p>
    <p>
     that imitated the sinuous and irregular wanderings of a mountain
    </p>
    <p>
     trail. It led them to Ludgate Hill, where they encountered a few other
    </p>
    <p>
     travellers like themselves making their way to the bridge for the same
    </p>
    <p>
     purpose. Bridge street was just passable, and soon the ice-laden waters
    </p>
    <p>
     of the river were seen, blazoned like some spectacle of enchantment
    </p>
    <p>
     in the deluge of argent light. They found the boatman in the basement
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Hotel Royal, which was dead, to the last stories of its
    </p>
    <p>
     ornamented facade, silent and dark. It was a part of the indications
    </p>
    <p>
     that London already had lost its visitors. The barge men stole out of
    </p>
    <p>
     their retreat, and Leacraft and Thomsen followed them, the shadows of
    </p>
    <p>
     the party printed in ink on the winnowed snow. Two men accompanied
    </p>
    <p>
     the boat; one rowed and the other stood at the prow, pushing off
    </p>
    <p>
     the cakes of ice, and correcting the passage of the boat through
    </p>
    <p>
     the lanes of water, flowing like limpid threads of molten silver
    </p>
    <p>
     between the crunching and veering floes. Leacraft and Thomsen watched
    </p>
    <p>
     with fascinated eyes the broad terrace of the Victoria Embankment,
    </p>
    <p>
     illuminated with the moon’s effulgence, whose unchecked glory met a
    </p>
    <p>
     feeble rivalry in a few sickly gas mantels, and a solitary electric
    </p>
    <p>
     lamp. The noble houses of legislation--and to the eyes of Leacraft
    </p>
    <p>
     they never seemed more imbued with a supremely delicate and elevating
    </p>
    <p>
     beauty--rose from the water’s edge, like some creation of an inspired
    </p>
    <p>
     dreamer, woven of splintered rays of light, with pencilled lines of
    </p>
    <p>
     ebony filched from the darkest night. It embodied a loveliness past
    </p>
    <p>
     even the powers of thought to measure or describe. The houses flamed
    </p>
    <p>
     with light, and the strong light on the clock tower, announced the
    </p>
    <p>
     sitting of Parliament, sent back to the moon a terrestrial radiance,
    </p>
    <p>
     that resembled the pulsations of a fallen star. As they passed the
    </p>
    <p>
     Westminster Bridge, their eyes caught the distant lights of Lambeth
    </p>
    <p>
     Palace. Both knew that to-night the King dined with the Archbishop.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly their boat drew near the landing, and the two men who guided it
    </p>
    <p>
     motioned to its occupants to get ready to disembark, as the landing
    </p>
    <p>
     was deprived of its usual outfit, owing to the clogging cakes of ice
    </p>
    <p>
     which clung to the wall. The heavy nose of the boat was pushed into the
    </p>
    <p>
     wall, and Leacraft and Thomsen scrambled up the steps, and gained the
    </p>
    <p>
     walk which led to the Victoria Arch, and the entrance of the Parliament
    </p>
    <p>
     House. Here a jam was encountered, and the news was soon learned that
    </p>
    <p>
     Balfour had begun his speech an hour before the announced time, and was
    </p>
    <p>
     now engaged in the closing appeal on the motion before the house.
    </p>
    <p>
     And what was this motion? To explain it, it is necessary to rehearse
    </p>
    <p>
     some of the preceding events, which had finally eventuated in this
    </p>
    <p>
     most marvellous situation; a debate in the House of Parliament as to
    </p>
    <p>
     whether the English people should evacuate England. This momentous
    </p>
    <p>
     and world-moving spectacle was now actually contemplated by the
    </p>
    <p>
     fixed attention of every nation on the earth. Its awful solemnity,
    </p>
    <p>
     the convulsing pathos of it, the immense commercial dislocation it
    </p>
    <p>
     involved, its social agony, the calamitous doubts it summoned as to
    </p>
    <p>
     the stability of Europe itself, and the fiercer sudden question of
    </p>
    <p>
     the meaning of human existence on this planet, it aroused, made the
    </p>
    <p>
     debate of the English Parliament then pending the most extraordinary
    </p>
    <p>
     discussion ever known in human annals.
    </p>
    <p>
     The occasion for it had practically been forced or precipitated by the
    </p>
    <p>
     coercive power of scientific opinion. And the curious thing about this
    </p>
    <p>
     same scientific opinion was that it first resisted the overwhelming
    </p>
    <p>
     proof of the subsidence of the isthmus and the elevation of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Caribbean wall of transgression, and then fervently accepted it, with
    </p>
    <p>
     not one scintilla more of demonstration, and in accepting it proposed
    </p>
    <p>
     for itself the unwelcome task of convincing the English people that
    </p>
    <p>
     they should evacuate their country.
    </p>
    <p>
     It would be hard to conceive of anything to the English mind less
    </p>
    <p>
     conceivable than such a desertion. Its mere mention raised the most
    </p>
    <p>
     violent denunciation and poured a torrent of abuse upon the unfortunate
    </p>
    <p>
     advisors. The thought of it sapped the very foundations of the English
    </p>
    <p>
     sense of existence. It seemed the vertigo of madness. It deranged the
    </p>
    <p>
     most obvious assertions of common sense. It was an impeachment of the
    </p>
    <p>
     English reality. To think of it was a betrayal of trust, a breach of
    </p>
    <p>
     faith, a succinct defiance of the Almighty, a blasphemous rejection
    </p>
    <p>
     of the lessons of history, a timorous surrender to the threats of the
    </p>
    <p>
     weather.
    </p>
    <p>
     But later, when the Scottish population began to throw its inundating
    </p>
    <p>
     tides of people into England, and the Englishman read at his breakfast
    </p>
    <p>
     table of the floes of ice in the Clyde, and the buried Grampians, the
    </p>
    <p>
     insurmountable drifts about Stirling, and the incipient neve masses on
    </p>
    <p>
     Scuir-na-Gillean, in Skye, the reluctant embarkation of the merchants
    </p>
    <p>
     of Aberdeen, the closing of its great University, the shrinkage of
    </p>
    <p>
     business in Glasgow; when they realized that in truth the Atlantic
    </p>
    <p>
     and Pacific oceans had become united by a broad gateway through which
    </p>
    <p>
     the Gulf Stream, which erstwhile transported the heat of the equator
    </p>
    <p>
     to Europe, now emptied its torrid waters, bathing the western coasts
    </p>
    <p>
     of North America as far north as Alaska, and bringing to that Arctic
    </p>
    <p>
     country almost the same blessing of fructifying warmth with which it
    </p>
    <p>
     had before endowed England; when still further they began to hear, and
    </p>
    <p>
     to realize, by private letters, the affectionate summons and offers
    </p>
    <p>
     of the colonies, the overwhelming loyalty of the brothers across the
    </p>
    <p>
     sea, their frenzied eagerness to place their lands almost gratuitously
    </p>
    <p>
     in the hands of the mother people, and assume towards them the role
    </p>
    <p>
     of honored beneficiaries, then a strange, unwonted wondering began,
    </p>
    <p>
     as to whether it might not be best to look into the matter. And then
    </p>
    <p>
     intelligence aroused, with continued inspection, the impression grew,
    </p>
    <p>
     that indeed the prospects were alarming. The English mind, once
    </p>
    <p>
     startled in a certain direction, soon takes on an impetus proportionate
    </p>
    <p>
     to the inertia of its first movements, and therefore by a natural
    </p>
    <p>
     law of psychology and mechanics gains in accelerated velocity with
    </p>
    <p>
     each succeeding moment. So it was now. The industry of the scientific
    </p>
    <p>
     propaganda, its inventive persistency, was followed by the conversion
    </p>
    <p>
     of the large financial and commercial interests, and then a panic
    </p>
    <p>
     seized the great masses of the nation. Parliament took it up, the
    </p>
    <p>
     papers bulged and teemed with information, discussion, advice, and
    </p>
    <p>
     reports. A determining influence with the large trading classes was
    </p>
    <p>
     the decline, in some instances the positive disappearance of business,
    </p>
    <p>
     while to others not chained in insular possessions, a new world of
    </p>
    <p>
     adventure and chance seemed not altogether undesirable.
    </p>
    <p>
     The pressure of popular approval hastened, in the Parliament, the
    </p>
    <p>
     formulation of a plan for the slow and careful removal of the
    </p>
    <p>
     population. The Law of Exodus, as it was termed, was a thoroughly
    </p>
    <p>
     English legislative work. And that meant a wise, adequate and
    </p>
    <p>
     deliberate evacuation. It involved a re-tabulation, so to speak, of
    </p>
    <p>
     the wealth and occupations of the individuals of the country, and
    </p>
    <p>
     so adjusted their departure, their association, their duties, their
    </p>
    <p>
     facilities and trades, that the least competition would arise in the
    </p>
    <p>
     new quarters, and then they were also so distributed in the colonies,
    </p>
    <p>
     that they met the requirements of these, as it was ascertained, from
    </p>
    <p>
     the authorities, the latter demanded. Thousands upon thousands had
    </p>
    <p>
     already sailed away, forming for themselves combinations as their
    </p>
    <p>
     acquaintances and connexions permitted, and still other thousands, with
    </p>
    <p>
     property invested abroad made a home in the land in which their support
    </p>
    <p>
     lay. A singular consequence of the situation was the speculative
    </p>
    <p>
     gale it produced in America, where large amounts of unemployed or
    </p>
    <p>
     released capital took flight. It settled tumultuously in Wall Street,
    </p>
    <p>
     voraciously attacking every variety of security, and driving stock
    </p>
    <p>
     values out of sight in a tremendous boom that disconcerted the tried
    </p>
    <p>
     veterans of the famous mart.
    </p>
    <p>
     All the time the Londoner was himself gaining some convincing insight
    </p>
    <p>
     into the dread nature of the climatic change about him. The snows
    </p>
    <p>
     covered the greater part of the streets of London, the parks became
    </p>
    <p>
     desolate tracts, deserted, uncleared, unused, swept over by the
    </p>
    <p>
     freezing winds, and chased from end to end with buffeted wreaths of
    </p>
    <p>
     snow, whose ghostly swirling columns ran over the wintry exposures like
    </p>
    <p>
     a race of Titanic spirits, crossing each other in cyclonic confusion,
    </p>
    <p>
     or meeting in shivering collisions, dissolving in cloud-bursts of
    </p>
    <p>
     microscopic and penetrating needles of ice. The Thames was almost
    </p>
    <p>
     closed, the shipping stayed idle at the wharfs, almost unmitigated
    </p>
    <p>
     suffering spread among the poor, for miles the streets were only
    </p>
    <p>
     traversed by foot-paths worn by their occupants, and the strangest
    </p>
    <p>
     sights occurred in the smaller reservations like Lincoln Inn Fields,
    </p>
    <p>
     St. Paul’s Churchyard, the Temple Gardens, the Artillery Grounds,
    </p>
    <p>
     Finsbury Circus and other confined spaces. By a freak of circumstances,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the curious and entirely unexpected vagary of the winds, the snow
    </p>
    <p>
     piled up and up in these quarters, because of a peculiar inrush of
    </p>
    <p>
     wind from the converging streets around, and this sweeping effect
    </p>
    <p>
     continued until the mound of snow, circumvallating the buildings,
    </p>
    <p>
     reached to their windows or overtopped them, while in enclosures
    </p>
    <p>
     not pre-empted by buildings, as Highbury Fields, and the various
    </p>
    <p>
     cemeteries, the hills of snow formed colossal billows, which seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     like a phalanx of rigid waves tortured into fantastic pinnacles by
    </p>
    <p>
     the storms of wind. Such spectacles turned back the life-blood of the
    </p>
    <p>
     bravest, and converted the most recalcitrant objectors to the new view
    </p>
    <p>
     of the necessity of leaving the immemorial splendors of England’s
    </p>
    <p>
     Capital.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a demoralizing and distressing picture of change, to visit
    </p>
    <p>
     the great docks on the Thames; the London docks, the Commercial and
    </p>
    <p>
     the West India docks, and in the place of the varied throngs, the
    </p>
    <p>
     miscellaneous rabble of laborers in which the forms, faces and even
    </p>
    <p>
     the dresses of the people of the world made a composite aggregate,
    </p>
    <p>
     which was a suggested reflex of the myriad-handed toil and industry of
    </p>
    <p>
     London, a significant hint of the immense wealth and opulent indulgence
    </p>
    <p>
     of the great metropolis--in place of all this, the harsh winds whistled
    </p>
    <p>
     over deserted yards, shrieked through the rigging of idle ships, or
    </p>
    <p>
     blew tempestuous volleys of rime and sleet across the river between
    </p>
    <p>
     Wapping and Rotherhithe. Before this awful change, English fortitude
    </p>
    <p>
     and confidence quailed, or wrapping itself in the reserve of bitterness
    </p>
    <p>
     and distrust, turned silently away, for an instant, at least, driven to
    </p>
    <p>
     confess that the time-honored legend of English destiny had become a
    </p>
    <p>
     perverted and silly shibboleth.
    </p>
    <p>
     February 12th, which has in meteorology, along with the twelfths of
    </p>
    <p>
     November, May and August, been isolated as the period of the ice
    </p>
    <p>
     saints, viz.: four periods characterized in an unaccountable manner by
    </p>
    <p>
     a fall in temperature--this 12th of February, 1910, had been determined
    </p>
    <p>
     by the Parliament for the closing of the great debate on the Motion of
    </p>
    <p>
     Evacuation. It was this night that Leacraft and Thomsen found so clear
    </p>
    <p>
     and cold, a keen and perilous intensity of cold probably never before
    </p>
    <p>
     experienced in the English islands, unless one, in his inenviable task
    </p>
    <p>
     of comparison could have found an equivalent in the Ice Age itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Leacraft and his companion attained the Victoria Tower, already
    </p>
    <p>
     the debate, on the motion which in an enlarged way had been before
    </p>
    <p>
     the English nation for more than a month, had reached its final
    </p>
    <p>
     stage. Balfour had been chosen to close, in a long peroration, the
    </p>
    <p>
     tremendous forensic display which had been limited to the walls of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Houses of Parliament. But it was only an episodic and distinguished
    </p>
    <p>
     incident in an argument which had convulsed every household in England,
    </p>
    <p>
     which had sent its clamorous assertions and appeals to the whole
    </p>
    <p>
     English-speaking people throughout the world, and which would, by all
    </p>
    <p>
     rational expectations, remain to the end of historic time the most
    </p>
    <p>
     startling venture in language, the most dramatic performance in oratory
    </p>
    <p>
     ever known.
    </p>
    <p>
     The two men hurried in, past the flaming chandeliers of the beautiful
    </p>
    <p>
     archway. Upon Leacraft showing his particular cards of admission,
    </p>
    <p>
     an attendant escorted them through the Royal Gallery, the House of
    </p>
    <p>
     Peers, the Peers’ Lobby, all of which were deserted. They chased in
    </p>
    <p>
     most indecorous fashion through the marvellous rooms, only intent upon
    </p>
    <p>
     catching the last words of the great speech whose purport and end
    </p>
    <p>
     was to empty those glorious apartments of their human interest, and
    </p>
    <p>
     bring expatriation upon all the memories they harbored. They passed
    </p>
    <p>
     through the Central Hall, the Commons’ Lobby, the Division Lobby, and
    </p>
    <p>
     were expeditiously inserted in the Reporters’ Gallery, where, backed
    </p>
    <p>
     up against the topmost wall, they surveyed the thronged mass beneath
    </p>
    <p>
     them. Every inch of space, every point of observation was packed, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the scene, on which a softened flood of light fell, with an enhancing
    </p>
    <p>
     effect of wonder, was eloquent in picturesque power and interest. Lords
    </p>
    <p>
     and ladies--to-night no interfering screen concealed the women--earls,
    </p>
    <p>
     dukes, baronets, the clergy, even bishops in their robes, merchants,
    </p>
    <p>
     men of science, bankers, and the whole House of Peers, standing at
    </p>
    <p>
     the bar of the House of Commons, were arrayed in a vast and irrelevant
    </p>
    <p>
     assemblage, pierced by one thought, the anguish of a supreme decision.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Balfour!
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon an erect and stalwart figure, moved by an instinct of regnancy at
    </p>
    <p>
     this sublime instant to stand free of his compeers in the broad way,
    </p>
    <p>
     between the benches of the Government and those of the Opposition,
    </p>
    <p>
     and facing the speaker--all the eyes of that assemblage were riveted.
    </p>
    <p>
     The classic sentences of Macaulay in describing the trial of Warren
    </p>
    <p>
     Hastings--hackneyed as they are by innumerable repetitions--might well
    </p>
    <p>
     apply to this unwonted and intense spectacle; “the long galleries were
    </p>
    <p>
     crowded by an audience such as has rarely excited the fears or the
    </p>
    <p>
     emulations of an orator. There were gathered together from all parts
    </p>
    <p>
     of a great, free, enlightened and prosperous empire, grace and female
    </p>
    <p>
     loveliness and learning, the representatives of every science and
    </p>
    <p>
     every art.” And the comparison can be illuminatively emphasized. At
    </p>
    <p>
     the trial of the illustrious Pro-consul, curiosity in a man, sympathy
    </p>
    <p>
     with a race, admiration for the local splendor of a gorgeous scene,
    </p>
    <p>
     summoned to the hall of William Rufus the resplendent galaxy. But the
    </p>
    <p>
     motives were objective. In the present case, thought Leacraft, how
    </p>
    <p>
     pathetic, how tragic their subjective force. It was as if the children
    </p>
    <p>
     of a home, about to disappear in some horrible engulfment, calmly
    </p>
    <p>
     prepared to leave its threshold, but it was that sorrow multiplied by
    </p>
    <p>
     all the individuals of a nation, and magnified by the moral surrender
    </p>
    <p>
     of the associations of two thousand years. A nervous tension, that was
    </p>
    <p>
     expressed in the almost petrified stare of some faces, the startling
    </p>
    <p>
     pallor of others, the half-open lips, the strained attitudes, the
    </p>
    <p>
     involuntary shudders, the curious grieved looks of inattention,
    </p>
    <p>
     overmastered the assembly. Its contagious thrill seized Leacraft,
    </p>
    <p>
     and brought his mental receptivity up to a quickened pitch of almost
    </p>
    <p>
     deranged alertness, while every sense seemed preternaturally awake.
    </p>
    <p>
     He heard a woman sob somewhere in front of him, and far down the left
    </p>
    <p>
     gallery, in the glare and glitter, he saw a noble head, white-haired,
    </p>
    <p>
     but still wearing the flush of manhood’s prime upon his cheeks, leaning
    </p>
    <p>
     on a hand, and turned towards him, with unchecked tears coursing
    </p>
    <p>
     silently from its upraised eyes; he saw a little girl clasping the neck
    </p>
    <p>
     of her mother and father, as she sat half on the laps of each, and
    </p>
    <p>
     heard the soft lisp of her kisses on their brows; he saw the almost
    </p>
    <p>
     saturnine face of a dowager stonily gazing at the speaker, and, most
    </p>
    <p>
     strangely, he detected on her finger a topaz ring cut in _relievo_
    </p>
    <p>
     with the head of Queen Victoria; and yet, while his senses reported
    </p>
    <p>
     these trifles with startling keenness, they were also all enlisted in
    </p>
    <p>
     catching every gesture, every movement, every accent of the man whose
    </p>
    <p>
     plastic power of eloquence was there engaged in pleading for English
    </p>
    <p>
     abdication.
    </p>
    <p>
     How the words rang in his ears, how persuasively the voice sank and
    </p>
    <p>
     rose, and with what a soaring melody some of the cadences seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     to linger in the scented air. “Let us,” it said, “bow before the
    </p>
    <p>
     revelation of our own destiny. The ordination of Nature is the express
    </p>
    <p>
     reflection--nay, it is the objective expression of Divine will. Accept
    </p>
    <p>
     it with submission, with the subserviency of faith, and act on that
    </p>
    <p>
     condition with the abundance of that native resolution that from the
    </p>
    <p>
     time of Alfred has made our path upward, outward, onward.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I do not, sir, under-estimate the tremendous ordeal; I cannot be
    </p>
    <p>
     blind to the colossal undertaking. It resumes in one herculean
    </p>
    <p>
     exertion, all the efforts of our race through two thousand years. It
    </p>
    <p>
     is without precedent, or else it shall only be reverently compared
    </p>
    <p>
     to the exodus of the Children of God from Egypt. And in that light,
    </p>
    <p>
     sir, without subterfuge or apology, without extenuation of rhetoric,
    </p>
    <p>
     without ribaldry or vanity, I do regard it. We are solemnized by some
    </p>
    <p>
     vast scheme in the order of things to carry with us the genius of our
    </p>
    <p>
     civilization to another home, where its power and beauty shall both
    </p>
    <p>
     benefit others, and become themselves more powerful and more beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
     We have lived through a stadium of progress and achievement. We
    </p>
    <p>
     certainly advance to the opening of another. Let the gathered
    </p>
    <p>
     multitudes of our race, here at its ancestral hearth, gird up their
    </p>
    <p>
     loins and accept the august command to go forth.
    </p>

    <p>
     “But, sir, with new positions, new prospects, new opportunities in

    <p>
     illimitable areas of expansion, we enter upon undreamed of material

     enlargements. A greater London will, in the coming centuries appear, in
    </p>
    <p>
     which through the phase of exaltation we shall assume, will be seen the
    </p>
    <p>
     Miracle of Time, in which all we have learned, the highest technical
    </p>
    <p>
     skill, our loftiest constructive, creative mind will be realized.

    <p>
     ours--_London rediviva, London redux, London sempieterna, et ne plus
    </p>
    <p>
     ultra_. A greater England shall be gathered within its walls. It will
    </p>
    <p>
     hold our sanctified patriotism, our emancipated reason, our ennobled,

    <p>
     disciplined applied science, the embodyment of our imagination, and to
    </p>
    <p>
     its doors the world will gather, too, in fealty, in trust, in homage.
    </p>
    <p>
     “‘O et praesidium et dulce decus meum.’”
    </p>
    <p>
     The voice ceased, the speaker dropped dumbly into his seat, and for
    </p>
    <p>
     an instant, held his hands over features convulsed with feeling. The
    </p>
    <p>
     surprising thing then was--the awful silence, the deadness of that
    </p>
    <p>
     living, throbbing, almost frantic audience, who looking out upon a
    </p>
    <p>
     blackness of uncertainty felt the happy past, radiant with ease and
    </p>
    <p>
     fame, ceremonial and cultured luxury, slipping out of their possession
    </p>
    <p>
     forever, and uttered no sound.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Speaker of the House rose; there was a shifting of heads, the
    </p>
    <p>
     rustle of turning bodies, a simultaneous orientation, but no other
    </p>
    <p>
     sound, and Leacraft scanned the multitude more. Again the portentous
    </p>
    <p>
     silence; the Speaker with quite unusual ardor alluded to the imposing
    </p>
    <p>
     power and beauty of the speech, and put the motion.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then another thing more astonishing happened, that House of Commons
    </p>
    <p>
     leaped to its feet and shouted in one long, vibrant roar, “Aye! Aye!
    </p>
    <p>
     Aye!” The eager agony of the assemblage then split and tore the proud
    </p>
    <p>
     repression that had almost strangled it. Cry upon cry started from
    </p>
    <p>
     various points, and the clamor grew, the agitation took on the aspect
    </p>
    <p>
     of disorder and panic, and then it resolved itself into thundering
    </p>
    <p>
     cheers for the King, and then, with electrifying unanimity the
    </p>
    <p>
     multitude sang the national anthem.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was over. The House of Commons had ordered the evacuation of
    </p>
    <p>
     England; the House of Peers would follow their lead, and while that
    </p>
    <p>
     evacuation would take place slowly, covering a long space of time, and
    </p>
    <p>
     permit the recreant forces of nature to reform--if they would--the
    </p>
    <p>
     face of the world as it had been, while it had consideration for all
    </p>
    <p>
     the conflicting interests involved, and was so skillfully framed as to
    </p>
    <p>
     cause the least shock of derangement to the immense business agencies,
    </p>
    <p>
     still it was a surrender of the proudest people on the face of the
    </p>
    <p>
     earth to the blind powers of nature, and it meant for Englishmen a new
    </p>
    <p>
     heaven and a new earth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft and Thomsen returned that night to their lodgings at the
    </p>
    <p>
     Bothwell Club, through Pall Mall, where but a few of the clubs were
    </p>
    <p>
     still in action and as they moved painfully along over the debris and
    </p>
    <p>
     dirt, the disturbed and shapeless heaps of snow, the abandoned articles
    </p>
    <p>
     of furniture, in front of some houses, and saw the darkened fronts of
    </p>
    <p>
     others, with broken windows, and broached and falling doors, noted the
    </p>
    <p>
     signs of interior commotion in the treasury, the admiralty, the foreign
    </p>
    <p>
     and Indian offices, the war office and the horse guards, they felt that
    </p>
    <p>
     Parliament had already been forestalled, and that the evacuation of
    </p>
    <p>
     London and with it all England had already begun.

    <p>
     THE EVACUATION.
    </p>
    <p>
     Events were moving rapidly. Ever since the Parliament, by a legislative
    </p>
    <p>
     decree, had authorized the desertion of England, and the eventful day
    </p>
    <p>
     approached when the King and his household, the Parliament itself, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the Church and the Titled Estate should, in a formal and expressive
    </p>
    <p>
     manner, leave England’s shores, the mass of the population had been
    </p>
    <p>
     diligently hunting about for refuge and occupation. Steamers and ships
    </p>
    <p>
     had scattered in all directions the fleeing multitudes. Relatives
    </p>
    <p>
     abroad, friends and even acquaintances offered homes and employment,
    </p>
    <p>
     no utility now was too small to be considered, nor any designation too
    </p>
    <p>
     insignificant to merit attention. This scampering was largely among
    </p>
    <p>
     those who felt the pinch already of idleness and the diminishing chance
    </p>
    <p>
     of work, among operatives and workmen, clerks and the bread winners of
    </p>
    <p>
     the middle class. The nobleman and the pauper did not stir.
    </p>
    <p>
     The English nation had decreed through its legislature, that the
    </p>
    <p>
     evacuation of the country should be conducted with pageantry, that the
    </p>
    <p>
     solemn parting should be enrolled in all time honored ceremony and
    </p>
    <p>
     stately pomp with which kings had been crowned, and for which, with
    </p>
    <p>
     all its heart and mind, the English nature cries out with unappeasible
    </p>
    <p>
     hunger. So the moment for the King’s departure, which meant the
    </p>
    <p>
     official desertion of the Old Home, might be justly compared to the
    </p>
    <p>
     flight of the queen bee in the bee colony when her faithful followers
    </p>
    <p>
     swarm after and upon her, and with resolute constancy create a new city
    </p>
    <p>
     about her inviolable person.
    </p>
    <p>
     The King was to leave England in June, 1910, and when he left with
    </p>
    <p>
     sumptuous and melancholy observance, with splendor of color and
    </p>
    <p>
     depth and power of music, with uniform and ritual, with prayer and
    </p>
    <p>
     chorus and prophecy, with august and intolerable grandeur, with the
    </p>
    <p>
     art of tradition and the ornaments of invention, he was to pass down
    </p>
    <p>
     to Tilbury and sail away beyond Gravesend to the new realm of his
    </p>
    <p>
     possession on the shores of Australia. It was a pretty hard thing to
    </p>
    <p>
     believe; it was a harder thing to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it was to be done with all the gorgeous effectiveness which
    </p>
    <p>
     accumulated traditions of centuries and the practice of every day and
    </p>
    <p>
     the mere resources in artifices and equipment of a magnificent realm
    </p>
    <p>
     could display. The day came with splendid beauty, the sun shone over
    </p>
    <p>
     an England which somewhat returned to the flowery loveliness of its
    </p>
    <p>
     olden sweet estate. The city had been cleared, though the snowfalls had
    </p>
    <p>
     reached the most unexpected depth, and the severity of the winter had
    </p>
    <p>
     been appalling. The meteorologists discovered the fact that the western
    </p>
    <p>
     and northwestern zones of extreme precipitation, those of eighty inches
    </p>
    <p>
     had moved inward, and had even exceeded this maximum, and the condition
    </p>
    <p>
     of the country was really extraordinary and desperate. The immense
    </p>
    <p>
     accumulations of snow in the outlying districts had risen to such
    </p>
    <p>
     heights that the low, long houses of the peasantry were covered and the
    </p>
    <p>
     aspect of the country was that of a Labrador landscape transplanted to
    </p>
    <p>
     southern latitudes, where trees, stone walls and villages assumed the
    </p>
    <p>
     place of the more familiar tundra, plains and stone floored plains.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suffering had been very general, and the importunity of nature had done
    </p>
    <p>
     more to convince the people that the necessity of removal was an actual
    </p>
    <p>
     threat, not to be avoided or placated, than the speeches, the tracts of
    </p>
    <p>
     the scientific societies, or the deliberations of statesmen and editors.
    </p>
    <p>
     But in London, on this twentieth of June, though the air bore the
    </p>
    <p>
     strange traces of the changed climate, in its tingling sharpness, yet
    </p>
    <p>
     this exhilaration only served the purpose of adding swiftness to the
    </p>
    <p>
     movement of the hosts of people in the streets, and a new and wonderful
    </p>
    <p>
     tremor of excitement to their eagerness in awaiting the development of
    </p>
    <p>
     the day’s great preparations.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the morning the King was to be enthroned in Westminster Abbey, and
    </p>
    <p>
     to receive the homage of the Peers, and, as usual at a coronation,
    </p>
    <p>
     the day itself was inaugurated with the firing of a royal salute at
    </p>
    <p>
     sunrise. A measure of the august and overpowering rites and observances
    </p>
    <p>
     that mark the assumption of a King’s rule was now to be gone through
    </p>
    <p>
     with, as a symbol and memento, before the King transferred his throne
    </p>
    <p>
     to another land; and this ceremonial was emblematic of the unbroken
    </p>
    <p>
     allegiance of the English nation to his removed majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
     The King was to ascend the theatre of the Abbey, and be lifted into His
    </p>
    <p>
     Throne by the Archbishops and Bishops, and other Peers of the kingdom,
    </p>
    <p>
     and being enthronized, or placed therein, all the great officers, those
    </p>
    <p>
     that bear the swords and sceptres, and the rest of the nobles, should
    </p>
    <p>
     stand round about the steps of the throne, and the Archbishop standing
    </p>
    <p>
     before the King should say the exhortation, beginning with the words,
    </p>
    <p>
     “Stand firm, and hold fast from henceforth the Seat of State of Royal
    </p>
    <p>
     and Imperial Dignity, which is this day delivered unto you in the Name
    </p>
    <p>
     and by the Authority of Almighty God, and by the hands of Us, the
    </p>
    <p>
     Bishops and Servants of God, though unworthy, etc, etc.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And then the homage being offered and accepted, the King attended and
    </p>
    <p>
     accompanied, the four swords--being the sword of Mercy, the sword of
    </p>
    <p>
     Justice to the Spirituality, the sword of Justice to the Temporality,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the sword of State--were to be carried before him. He should then
    </p>
    <p>
     descend from his throne crowned, and, carrying his Sceptre and Rod in
    </p>
    <p>
     his hands, should go into the area eastward of the theatre, and pass
    </p>
    <p>
     on through the door on the south side of the altar into King Edward’s
    </p>
    <p>
     Chapel, the organ and other instruments all the while playing.
    </p>
    <p>
     The King should then, standing before the altar, deliver the Sceptre
    </p>
    <p>
     with the Dove to the Archbishop, who would lay it upon the altar there.
    </p>
    <p>
     The King would then be disrobed of his imperial mantle, and be arrayed
    </p>
    <p>
     in his royal robe of purple velvet, by the Lord Great Chamberlain.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Archbishop should then place the orb in his majesty’s left hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then his majesty should proceed through the choir to the west door of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Abbey, in the same manner as he came, wearing his crown and bearing
    </p>
    <p>
     in his right hand the Sceptre, with the Cross, and in his left the orb;
    </p>
    <p>
     all Peers wearing their coronets, and the Archbishops and Bishops their
    </p>
    <p>
     caps.
    </p>
    <p>
     The interior arrangements in the Abbey were familiar. From the west
    </p>
    <p>
     door where the procession should enter to the screen which divides
    </p>
    <p>
     choir from nave, two rows of galleries were to be erected on each side
    </p>
    <p>
     of the centre aisle--the one gallery level with the vaultings, the
    </p>
    <p>
     other with the summit of the western door. These galleries should have
    </p>
    <p>
     their fronts fluted with crimson cloth richly draped at the top, and
    </p>
    <p>
     decorated with broad golden fringe at the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the floor of the centre aisle a slightly raised platform or carpeted
    </p>
    <p>
     way, should be laid down, along which the King and Queen, in procession
    </p>
    <p>
     should pass to the choir. This was to be matted over and covered with
    </p>
    <p>
     crimson cloth. On the pavement of the aisle bordering this carpeted way
    </p>
    <p>
     should stand the soldiery as a fence against interference.
    </p>
    <p>
     The theatre where the principal parts of the ceremony were to be
    </p>
    <p>
     enacted lies immediately under the central tower of the Abbey, and was
    </p>
    <p>
     a square formed by the intersection of the choir and the transcepts,
    </p>
    <p>
     extending nearly the whole breadth of the choir. On this square a
    </p>
    <p>
     platform was to be erected ascended by five steps. The summit of this
    </p>
    <p>
     platform and also the highest step leading to it, was to be covered
    </p>
    <p>
     with the richest cloth of gold. From that step down to the flooring of
    </p>
    <p>
     the theatre, all was covered with carpet of rich red or purple color
    </p>
    <p>
     bordered with gold. In the centre of the theatre the sumptuously
    </p>
    <p>
     draped chair was to be placed for the sovereign, in which he receives
    </p>
    <p>
     the homage of the Peers.
    </p>
    <p>
     This interior pomp and splendor escaped the observation of Leacraft,
    </p>
    <p>
     though he was not unfamiliar with the details of the solemn pageant,
    </p>
    <p>
     but now it hardly interested him. His mind by a natural emancipation
    </p>
    <p>
     from the thrall of such spectacles, dwelt rather on the attitude of the
    </p>
    <p>
     people in this extreme peril and solicitude. He felt inquisitive to
    </p>
    <p>
     learn their feelings, their hopes, their cohesiveness in the changed
    </p>
    <p>
     estate. Were they likely to resolve into a chaos of preferences with
    </p>
    <p>
     only the cry of _sauve qui peut_ in their mouths, or would they follow
    </p>
    <p>
     the new destinies, and preserve the nation. At length the populace were
    </p>
    <p>
     coming into their own. It was pretty evident that a King and Queen
    </p>
    <p>
     and Regalia, and Peers, and Peeresses, and a much surpliced Clergy,
    </p>
    <p>
     would not make a nation, without the workers, the rent payers, the men
    </p>
    <p>
     of action, the bread winners, the clerks, artisans, and merchants,
    </p>
    <p>
     the householder and his family, and that the sacred classes would be
    </p>
    <p>
     suddenly subjected to a _reductio ad absurdum_, if they formed the
    </p>
    <p>
     only inhabitants of the new regime and their titles lost their _raison
    </p>
    <p>
     d’etre_ with the disappearance of the untitled mass.
    </p>
    <p>
     After the rendering of the Homage at the Abbey, the Procession was to
    </p>
    <p>
     take place, and the King arriving at Tilbury, with the royal family,
    </p>
    <p>
     a selection of the Peers, the highest Episcopal prelates, and certain
    </p>
    <p>
     representative men from the Commons, including the Ministry, would be
    </p>
    <p>
     received on the Dreadnought, and with a glorious escort of the largest
    </p>
    <p>
     battleships, carrying the royal equipage, the furniture of Windsor
    </p>
    <p>
     Castle, and of St. James palace, and of the Buckingham mansion, the
    </p>
    <p>
     archives of the Parliament, at least a portion, steam away from England
    </p>
    <p>
     to Australia, to Melbourne. This Nucleus of Government holding the
    </p>
    <p>
     inseparable insignia, and the actual essence of the English nation
    </p>
    <p>
     would there, with pomp and solemn allegations, with rolling music and
    </p>
    <p>
     pious prayers, with thunders of the guns by the Navy, and the salute of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Army, be as it were reinstalled.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the route of the procession was not to be straight out of London.
    </p>
    <p>
     It comprised a broader purpose. It was proposed to circumvallate
    </p>
    <p>
     London, to impregnate it with the sentiment of the King’s leaving.
    </p>
    <p>
     It should be traversed and penetrated in all directions, gathering
    </p>
    <p>
     thus the public allegiance, and absorbing its loyalty, shedding the
    </p>
    <p>
     effulgence of the royal splendor upon the populace, and enchaining
    </p>
    <p>
     them anew to the principle and fact of English Sovreignty. It was a
    </p>
    <p>
     stupendous project. It involved stations and relays. Camps of the
    </p>
    <p>
     military were to be established at St. James Park, at Victoria Park, at
    </p>
    <p>
     Regent’s Park, at the West End near Paddington, at Wormwood Scrubs,
    </p>
    <p>
     and in the southern districts around Clapham Common and towards Putney.
    </p>
    <p>
     The King was to stop at resting places, and in the largest local
    </p>
    <p>
     churches, a reduced form of the Homage was to be instituted involving
    </p>
    <p>
     the _enthronization_, with the displays of the Regalia, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     jubilation, and the reverence of the people expressed, as always in the
    </p>
    <p>
     shouts--
    </p>
    <p>
     God save King Edward!
    </p>
    <p>
     Long live King Edward!
    </p>
    <p>
     May the King live forever!
    </p>
    <p>
     The bells of the churches were to ring, the houses were to hang out
    </p>
    <p>
     their banners, flags were to cover the streets, bands stationed on
    </p>
    <p>
     prominent balconies, at points covering the entire long journey through
    </p>
    <p>
     and around the city, were to play national airs, that so there might
    </p>
    <p>
     be generated an overwhelming enthusiasm, a tumult of devotion, and
    </p>
    <p>
     thus constrain the Englishman afresh in the religion of the nation’s
    </p>
    <p>
     immortality.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was finely conceived, this elevation of the King. It was gorgeously
    </p>
    <p>
     executed. The imagination of the people was tremendously impressed, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the Ark of the Covenant of the eternal supremacy of the English crown
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed thus visibly incorporated, and presented to them. The procession
    </p>
    <p>
     was glittering, and it was majestic. It ponderously emphasized the
    </p>
    <p>
     English idea. There were really two processions, the first from
    </p>
    <p>
     Westminster to Buckingham Palace, the second through London. In the
    </p>
    <p>
     first--the King issued from Westminster, his crown borne before him,
    </p>
    <p>
     but holding in his right hand the Sceptre with the Cross, and in his
    </p>
    <p>
     left the Orb. Then began the most wonderful State ride through London.
    </p>
    <p>
     The superb chariot of the King surrounded by heralds, kings at arms,
    </p>
    <p>
     pursuivants, with judges, councillors, lords, and dignitaries, was
    </p>
    <p>
     followed by the open carriages of the nobility.
    </p>
    <p>
     The King was immersed in color. Garter--principal King-at-arms--was
    </p>
    <p>
     a miracle of dress. He wore a frock or tabard, crimson and gold
    </p>
    <p>
     emblazoned with the quarters of the United Kingdom. Then there was
    </p>
    <p>
     the Clarencieux of the South, and Norroy of the North--and the
    </p>
    <p>
     heralds of Lancaster, Somerset, Richmond, all wonderfully bedight,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the pursuivants--Rouge Croix, Rouge Dragon, Portcullis, and Blue
    </p>
    <p>
     Mantel--looking like the genii of a Christmas pantomime. And here with
    </p>
    <p>
     the King were the Lord Chamberlain, the Lord Steward, and the Master
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Horse. And there followed this cavalcade, surrounding the King
    </p>
    <p>
     like a many colored fringe, the carriages of the nobles wherein all the
    </p>
    <p>
     signs of degree, order, rank, were sumptuously shown. Here the robes of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Peers, crimson velvet edged with miniver--the capes furred with the
    </p>
    <p>
     same--and powdered with bars or rows of ermine, according to degree,
    </p>
    <p>
     rolled together in a bank of oscillating glory. Beneath the mantles
    </p>
    <p>
     a court dress, a uniform, or regimentals were descried. The coronets
    </p>
    <p>
     were even worn, and as the scintillating groups passed, eager admirers
    </p>
    <p>
     separated the coronet of the baron with its six silver equidistant
    </p>
    <p>
     balls, from the coronet of a viscount with sixteen, from the coronet
    </p>
    <p>
     of an earl with eight balls raised on points, and with glistening gold
    </p>
    <p>
     strawberry leaves between the points, from the coronet of a marquis
    </p>
    <p>
     with four gold strawberry leaves alternating with four silver balls,
    </p>
    <p>
     and from the coronet of a duke with the eight gold strawberry leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor did beauty hesitate to add its witchery to the sports of splendor,
    </p>
    <p>
     and in behalf of that ancient idea of Monarchy, which now was enlisted
    </p>
    <p>
     against a deep peril of mistrust and repudiation. The Peeresses formed
    </p>
    <p>
     part of the procession. Their scarlet kirtles over the petticoats of
    </p>
    <p>
     white satin and lace, their flowing sleeves slashed and furred, their
    </p>
    <p>
     cushioned trains heaped in confusion in the carriages, and relieved by
    </p>
    <p>
     shining plaques of silver silk, were still more bewilderingly graced by
    </p>
    <p>
     jewelry, by oceans of gems resplendently transfigured in the blazing
    </p>
    <p>
     sun. In this momentous pageant the limits of the spectacular were
    </p>
    <p>
     invaded, even distended, in which some saw not only a lack of good
    </p>
    <p>
     taste, but the pressure of a little fear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even the church advanced the bold bid for admiration and wonder. It
    </p>
    <p>
     sent out its archbishops, bishops, rectors, canons, prebendaries and
    </p>
    <p>
     deacons, to compose parts of the vast exhibit to be interwoven in the
    </p>
    <p>
     variegated human carpet that filled the streets. Before the churches
    </p>
    <p>
     that were passed, choirs gathered and sang melodiously; the strong
    </p>
    <p>
     religious fibre of the English men and women was sedulously appealed
    </p>
    <p>
     to, or else it was the elemental flaming forward of their powerful
    </p>
    <p>
     conviction. At this strange moment there was less of pretence and trick
    </p>
    <p>
     than sincerity. The heart of the people was steadfastly united with the
    </p>
    <p>
     old traditions; they clung unbrokenly to the inheritance of English
    </p>
    <p>
     greatness. There was no reason to doubt their faith.
    </p>
    <p>
     The route of the second marvellous procession was from the Abbey
    </p>
    <p>
     through Bird Cage Walk past Victoria monument to Procession road, to
    </p>
    <p>
     the Strand, to Fleet street, over Ludgate hill, past St. Paul’s, to
    </p>
    <p>
     Cheapside, to Bishops street, to Shoreditch, to Hackney street, and so
    </p>
    <p>
     out to Victoria Park and Homerton. Back again to Highbury Fields, south
    </p>
    <p>
     by Essex road to Pentonville road, to Euston road, to Marylebone road,
    </p>
    <p>
     through Regents Park, through Hampstead road to Hampstead, to West
    </p>
    <p>
     Side, through Edgeware road to Hyde Park, and the Bays water to Holland
    </p>
    <p>
     park, to Hammersmith road, by Hammersmith bridge road to Castelnau;
    </p>
    <p>
     thence to Putney, to Battersea, to Clapham, to Camberwell, thence to
    </p>
    <p>
     Walworth road, by London road, by Waterloo road to Westminster bridge,
    </p>
    <p>
     to the Houses of Parliament, and on the banks of the river Thames to
    </p>
    <p>
     the Tower, and on through White Chapel, Mile End road, Bow road, to
    </p>
    <p>
     Bromley, to Stratford, to Barking, to Tilbury.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nothing so prodigious had ever been conceived; and the resources of the
    </p>
    <p>
     empire, of the military, and the squadrons of the colonists, who should
    </p>
    <p>
     again, as at the Jubilee of Queen Victoria, present the diversified
    </p>
    <p>
     elements of English power, would be involved.
    </p>
    <p>
     At Tilbury on the Essex bank, opposite Gravesend, where rise the low
    </p>
    <p>
     bastions of Tilbury Fort, originally constructed by Henry III, King
    </p>
    <p>
     Edward the VII, would in a fashion diverse, and with a different end in
    </p>
    <p>
     view, also declare that he “had the heart and stomach of a King, and of
    </p>
    <p>
     a King of England too,” as had said Queen Elizabeth. But now it should
    </p>
    <p>
     be said by a King unappalled by the invasion of the powers of the air,
    </p>
    <p>
     as she was before the power of Spain, but now said with undiminished
    </p>
    <p>
     confidence and high hope, though said too with obedience to the supreme
    </p>
    <p>
     mandate of expulsion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before it took place, Leacraft and Thomsen began their long walk from
    </p>
    <p>
     Ludgate hill, and Leacraft intently watched the street crowds. He
    </p>
    <p>
     noted also with recording interest the groups in the balconies with
    </p>
    <p>
     lunch baskets. The expectant air everywhere was not unnoticeably
    </p>
    <p>
     mingled with a kind of frightened silence. There was not much noise,
    </p>
    <p>
     no indiscriminate hubbub in the streets, and where groups were
    </p>
    <p>
     encountered, hurrying to their destination, they were quiet and
    </p>
    <p>
     restrained. Tension was evident, a high strung expectancy verging with
    </p>
    <p>
     impalpable approach upon tears, and the agony of penitential promises.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fundamentally religious optimism of the Englishman was confounded,
    </p>
    <p>
     and his acceptance of invisible guidance made itself seen in faces
    </p>
    <p>
     desolated by the grief of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
     The preparations were remarkable and elaborate. The windows were filled
    </p>
    <p>
     with chairs. Platforms were erected, almost luxuriously draped with red
    </p>
    <p>
     cloth and scarlet velvet, and surging crowds in spots seemed to bely
    </p>
    <p>
     the significance of the portentous moment. From time to time as the two
    </p>
    <p>
     observers walked in the middle of the street, they stopped reluctantly
    </p>
    <p>
     to notice signs of mourning. These took on the form of trailing
    </p>
    <p>
     streamers of crape, hung upon white cloth and their singularity amid
    </p>
    <p>
     the almost bombastic surplusage of scarlet dressings, awoke protest and
    </p>
    <p>
     resentment. At one point there was a particularly conspicuous dismal
    </p>
    <p>
     challenge to the susceptibilities of the spectators in a balcony loaded
    </p>
    <p>
     with sombre trappings which gained a startling prominence because of
    </p>
    <p>
     the patriotic and cheerful decorations on either side of it. Before
    </p>
    <p>
     this lugubrious appeal a small group of malcontents had gathered, and
    </p>
    <p>
     were indulging in incendiary criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hits no use turning a sour face to the thing. What’s got to be, is
    </p>
    <p>
     got to be, and a little heart will keep a sour stomach from making
    </p>
    <p>
     itself sick. Hi say we’re hall in the same boat, and cheerfulness makes
    </p>
    <p>
     pleasant company. Such a show as that hought not to be tolerated, Hi
    </p>
    <p>
     say.” This belligerency came from the thick lips of a red faced man,
    </p>
    <p>
     who had his coat over his arm, and whose leathern leggings, corduroy
    </p>
    <p>
     knee breeches, and flaming weskit with a high collar strapped to his
    </p>
    <p>
     muscular neck by a pea green scarf, betokened a representative of the
    </p>
    <p>
     “fancy,” or an ostler turned out for a day’s holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Indeed I think so,” squealed a thin, short man with a red nose and a
    </p>
    <p>
     curious habit of wiping his mouth with a yellow handkerchief. “It’s
    </p>
    <p>
     hard enough for the sufferin’ masses to leave hearth, home, and, I
    </p>
    <p>
     may say, family, not to be saddened more’n than is natural with these
    </p>
    <p>
     funereal suggestions.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well,” shouted a sturdy arrival on the other limit of the circle;
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let’s tear them down. The quickest way to cure trouble is to git
    </p>
    <p>
     rid of it. It’s rotten insultin’ to stick those weeds under our
    </p>
    <p>
     noses.” Under the influence of these defiant words the knot of men
    </p>
    <p>
     moved towards the objectionable drapery with evidently unfriendly
    </p>
    <p>
     intentions. But they had not been unobserved from the inside of
    </p>
    <p>
     the house on whose front these sad reminders hung. A window shot up
    </p>
    <p>
     and a tall slender woman advanced to the edge of the balcony. She
    </p>
    <p>
     was dressed deeply in black, her neck was surrounded by some white
    </p>
    <p>
     crepe stuff, and the sentiment, as Howells has it, of her dress was
    </p>
    <p>
     a pathetic suggestion of bereavement and misfortune. Her hair, yet
    </p>
    <p>
     luxuriant, was plentifully sprinkled with gray; her face had the
    </p>
    <p>
     authorized look of nobility and distinction. She was yet prepossessing,
    </p>
    <p>
     though the crowding years had brought her past middle life. The
    </p>
    <p>
     distinctive impression she made upon Leacraft, as he and Thomsen,
    </p>
    <p>
     somewhat withdrawn, watched the denouement of this street episode,
    </p>
    <p>
     was that of abiding sorrow, patiently borne, and doubtless united
    </p>
    <p>
     in her, with Christian resignation and unsullied piety. A beautiful
    </p>
    <p>
     picture of the English woman, who resolutely lives her earnest life of
    </p>
    <p>
     prayer and self-sacrifice, holding intensely to her heart some fond
    </p>
    <p>
     memory, wreathed in amaranth. And Leacraft, as an Englishman, blessed
    </p>
    <p>
     Providence there were such. The men on the street were a little abashed
    </p>
    <p>
     by the pale face and lofty mien of the lady who had recognized their
    </p>
    <p>
     purpose, and placed herself there to thwart it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She came forward and instantly spoke; her voice was excessively clear,
    </p>
    <p>
     but an underlying mellowness imparted an extreme sweetness to its
    </p>
    <p>
     tones.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My friends you wish these mourning signs taken away. They offend
    </p>
    <p>
     you. But when you know that they express to me the approaching loss
    </p>
    <p>
     of all my friends, you will not, I think, feel so harshly about them.
    </p>
    <p>
     The King, in a week, leaves the shores of England--the evacuation of
    </p>
    <p>
     England begins to-day--and with the King goes the great English nation
    </p>
    <p>
     and this wonderful city with all its memories, with its beauty, its
    </p>
    <p>
     historic power, its incessant interest, our common home for all our
    </p>
    <p>
     lifetimes, will dwindle and dwindle and disappear, lost in arctic snows
    </p>
    <p>
     and ice, at least so they tell us.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But I shall stay. In this house suffering has come to me; it has never
    </p>
    <p>
     left _me_. I shall not leave _it_. I mourn for those who in going away
    </p>
    <p>
     die to English pride, to English love, to English devotion, and”--she
    </p>
    <p>
     leaned out over the sullen men beneath her--“and die to me. These black
    </p>
    <p>
     films are for them.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She stopped. The men, worried and puzzled and surprised, looked a
    </p>
    <p>
     little sheepishly at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, well,” said he of the hostler type, “my leddy, no offense, seein’
    </p>
    <p>
     how you feel about it. Hi say--’ave your way.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, yes,” squealed the preacher, “if the empty badges of mournin’
    </p>
    <p>
     give ennyone--ennyone--satisfaction, why it’s not in reason to question
    </p>
    <p>
     their motives in this excroociating moment.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Gad! the lady’s right,” shouted the former belligerent, whose prompt
    </p>
    <p>
     hint had at first nearly precipitated the riot, “She’s got the right
    </p>
    <p>
     ring--and I’m damned if anyone teches the rags there I’ll bust his
    </p>
    <p>
     cock-eyed head aff his shoulders.”
    </p>
    <p>
     This vociferous statement produced a hubbub of approval, and won many
    </p>
    <p>
     distinct admissions of entire acquiescence--and with these reassuring
    </p>
    <p>
     murmurs the lady retired, after telling her thanks, and the gathering
    </p>
    <p>
     withdrew down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft and Thomsen continued their way westward. Before them
    </p>
    <p>
     suddenly, after a half-hour’s sauntering, shone an avenue of military
    </p>
    <p>
     splendor. They were in Charing Cross, having pushed down the Strand,
    </p>
    <p>
     and they were on the south side of Trafalgar Square, and not far from
    </p>
    <p>
     the equestrian statue of Charles I. Trafalgar Square was filled with
    </p>
    <p>
     troops. The effect of color was transporting. The massed regiments of
    </p>
    <p>
     infantry were broken by parks of artillery, while immediately under
    </p>
    <p>
     Nelson’s column the Nineteenth Hussars--the “Dumpies of 1759,” the
    </p>
    <p>
     Fifteenth Hussars--“Elliott’s Light Horse,” the Sixteenth Lancers--“the
    </p>
    <p>
     Queen’s,” and the Thirteenth Hussars--“the ragged brigade”--were
    </p>
    <p>
     confusedly stationed, their mingling busbies and dependent bags looking
    </p>
    <p>
     like a garden patch.
    </p>
    <p>
     From point to point issued galloping videttes, carrying their pennants
    </p>
    <p>
     on lance-heads affixed to the stirrups, which undulated in the air,
    </p>
    <p>
     as the horses pranced and caracolled. The tramp of troops, the sighing
    </p>
    <p>
     of bugles, and the resounding surges of music, surrounded them. It was
    </p>
    <p>
     afternoon. The beginning of the first day’s procession from the Abbey
    </p>
    <p>
     doubtless was at hand. The stirring air communicated the thrills of an
    </p>
    <p>
     immense event, and the people, petrified into attention, stood crushed
    </p>
    <p>
     against each other in rows of forlorn expectancy. The suffocating
    </p>
    <p>
     excitement was unbearable, the more so because of its immobility.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft decided to rush through London, and reach Victoria Park, the
    </p>
    <p>
     Hackney Marshes and Clapton, in order to determine the attitude, the
    </p>
    <p>
     action, of the poorer classes. Thomsen was unwilling to desert the
    </p>
    <p>
     fermenting throngs around Trafalgar Square, or miss, for a moment,
    </p>
    <p>
     the kaleidoscope of changing soldiery, and so Leacraft, leaving him,
    </p>
    <p>
     entered a hansom and shot off.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was not averse to this solitude. His affections for Miss Tobit had
    </p>
    <p>
     lately warmed into a less indifferent kindliness, and he began to
    </p>
    <p>
     feel a gnawing anxiety lest the pretty Scotch woman thought less of
    </p>
    <p>
     him--in the way lovers like--than she did of her cousin, the handsome
    </p>
    <p>
     and obnoxiously unconcerned Thomsen. Thomsen knew exactly Leacraft’s
    </p>
    <p>
     feelings, and regarded them with unconcealed forbearance, and--what
    </p>
    <p>
     was more provoking--with a frank condescension of sympathy. And yet
    </p>
    <p>
     the men had become good friends; they had talked long and seriously,
    </p>
    <p>
     with all the elements of critical guidance they could summon, about the
    </p>
    <p>
     strange reversal or revolution in the nation’s affairs. But at these
    </p>
    <p>
     moments they were in an impersonal frame of contact, and the personal
    </p>
    <p>
     exigencies which later crept between them, were all absent. Leacraft’s
    </p>
    <p>
     intellectual weight easily made itself felt in these discussions,
    </p>
    <p>
     and Thomsen, with cordial alacrity, assumed the obedient position of
    </p>
    <p>
     audience and pupil.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Leacraft was driven eastward in the swinging vehicle, he flung
    </p>
    <p>
     himself against its cushions, and again thought of the monstrous and
    </p>
    <p>
     incredible metamorphosis in the fortunes of his people. The vigorous
    </p>
    <p>
     life of ten centuries, with all its memories, the heaped up riches of
    </p>
    <p>
     its achievements, the splendid literary legacy of the past, with its
    </p>
    <p>
     art, its lineaments of beauty, its dusky shadows, the solicitous charm
    </p>
    <p>
     of its contrasted periods of history, the deep encrustation, nay,
    </p>
    <p>
     rather, the unfathomable deposits of character, and accomplishment
    </p>
    <p>
     which overlaid the Kingdom of England, and, in this city of London,
    </p>
    <p>
     the beating heart of its vast interests, thickly choked each avenue
    </p>
    <p>
     and current of its life--to abandon all this at the summons of a
    </p>
    <p>
     temperatural caprice, at the tempestuous whim of an earthquake, before
    </p>
    <p>
     the blind violence of frost and snow and ice, was the most unendurable
    </p>
    <p>
     of humiliations! It bit too deeply at the generalized assumption of
    </p>
    <p>
     the whole world, that man ruled the earth; it soured the contentment
    </p>
    <p>
     of his avid vanity, and to the Englishman it assailed the hitherto
    </p>
    <p>
     impregnable fortress of his heroic conceit. And yet--the old dream
    </p>
    <p>
     of a greater England arose, as it had arisen a hundred times before,
    </p>
    <p>
     in all these troubling and disconcerting months--an England leaping
    </p>
    <p>
     forward, as an exultant youth, bearing in his hands the trophies of new
    </p>
    <p>
     and brighter conquests, flushed under changed environments, with the
    </p>
    <p>
     inspiration of new ambitions, and new powers of creation, issuing into
    </p>
    <p>
     a greater chapter of human growth than had ever before been conceived
    </p>
    <p>
     or written.
    </p>
    <p>
     And yet what an eviction! This glorious old England, with its sweet
    </p>
    <p>
     homes, its innumerable beauties, its convincing happiness of downs and
    </p>
    <p>
     glade and gardens, flowering into clouds of blossoms, its lakes, its
    </p>
    <p>
     gentle streams, its æsthetic softness and dimness, its manifold and
    </p>
    <p>
     opulent charm of landscape, the hurrying and constant kisses of its
    </p>
    <p>
     moist skies, in league with all the graces of the seasons--to cast this
    </p>
    <p>
     aside, and begin again, elsewhere, in regions drear and sterile of all
    </p>
    <p>
     these things; ah! that was too hard! too hard! and, as he had often
    </p>
    <p>
     done, Leacraft covered his face with his hands and sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Amid these fluctuating thoughts and feelings, the hansom swung with
    </p>
    <p>
     vehement oscillations along the streets, in the more deserted parts
    </p>
    <p>
     of London, and brought its occupant in sight of the Bethnal Green
    </p>
    <p>
     Museum, from which a diversion along Old Ford Road and Approach Road,
    </p>
    <p>
     flung him into Victoria Park, the huge playground of the poorer eastern
    </p>
    <p>
     section of the city. He was driven to the eastern part of the immense
    </p>
    <p>
     reservation, and was gratified to find a public meeting in progress,
    </p>
    <p>
     the exact thing he most wished to be present at, and to estimate.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a broad and treeless area of the park, with the grass showing
    </p>
    <p>
     hesitatingly after the long winter, but vivid also in spots, in the
    </p>
    <p>
     strong light of the afternoon, with an atmosphere strangely variant
    </p>
    <p>
     from the traditional, and, to Leacraft, much loved velvety softness
    </p>
    <p>
     and mellowed obscuration of former days, were gathered a multitude of
    </p>
    <p>
     people. They surrounded a speaker, who, on some sort of improvised
    </p>
    <p>
     platform, with a knot of associated leaders, with a swaying body and
    </p>
    <p>
     occasionally outstretched hands, was engaged in a harangue which was
    </p>
    <p>
     received with attention unattended by the slightest demonstration of
    </p>
    <p>
     assent or disapproval. It looked from a short distance almost like a
    </p>
    <p>
     devotional assembly, it seemed so reverently silent, and as Leacraft
    </p>
    <p>
     approached, this impression was partially at least verified, for the
    </p>
    <p>
     speaker’s hands ceased their agitated appeal, the occasional higher
    </p>
    <p>
     cries proceeding from his lips died away, and a song or hymn burst
    </p>
    <p>
     suddenly from the still motionless multitude. It lasted for an instant,
    </p>
    <p>
     perhaps a single verse, and as Leacraft drew near, another man from
    </p>
    <p>
     the platform group stood up, and stepped to the front of the small
    </p>
    <p>
     stand. At that precise moment the cannonading, agreed upon as a signal,
    </p>
    <p>
     announced the starting of the royal cortege, and the sad beginning
    </p>
    <p>
     of the imperial evacuation of England. It was heard with far away
    </p>
    <p>
     reverberations, as it was repeated from other nearer points, and this
    </p>
    <p>
     vagueness, by a congruity of effect with the dull misery weighing on
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft’s heart, seemed to give to it a deeper poignancy of grievous
    </p>
    <p>
     import. It produced the impression of an irrevocable doom. As the
    </p>
    <p>
     sounds were heard by the assembled crowds, the speaker lifted his hand
    </p>
    <p>
     and raised his face skyward, as if in supplication, the heads were all
    </p>
    <p>
     uncovered by one spontaneous impulse, and, caught in the same wave of
    </p>
    <p>
     feeling, Leacraft sought the invocation of his own blessing on the King
    </p>
    <p>
     and all he stood for.
    </p>
    <p>
     The interrupted speaker began his address. The man was a strong type.
    </p>
    <p>
     His face was somewhat leisurely framed in short whiskers, confined
    </p>
    <p>
     to his cheeks; his eyes were large, blue and unblinking, with a
    </p>
    <p>
     resolute look in them that had the merit of extorting, at least,
    </p>
    <p>
     a respectful recognition; his complexion met all the requirements
    </p>
    <p>
     of the English reputation for color, but it left no impression of
    </p>
    <p>
     having attained its superior brilliancy through less innocent means
    </p>
    <p>
     than exercise and personal care. His broad, high forehead--a little
    </p>
    <p>
     heightened in its expansive effect through the faltering recession of
    </p>
    <p>
     the iron grey hair that stood a little stiffly above it--rose above
    </p>
    <p>
     the admirably firm nose, whose size and contour formed to the reader
    </p>
    <p>
     of physiognomies another compelling admonition to give its wearer the
    </p>
    <p>
     rational allegiance of attention. The man’s voice was musical, with
    </p>
    <p>
     a single intonation that imparted to it much carrying power, and it
    </p>
    <p>
     yielded to certain tendencies of relaxation in speaking that gave it
    </p>
    <p>
     almost a feminine sweetness. Leacraft put him down for a labor leader
    </p>
    <p>
     of a sort, character and design belonging to the best elements of the
    </p>
    <p>
     current labor thought and organization; a man of that impressive stamp
    </p>
    <p>
     in modern adjustments of self-assertion, of which John Burns was so
    </p>
    <p>
     extraordinary an example.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had begun his speech as Leacraft, with insistent zeal, pushed his
    </p>
    <p>
     way deeply toward the centre and margins nearer the stage, of the
    </p>
    <p>
     attentive throng.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My friends, we must think for ourselves. We are not likely to have
    </p>
    <p>
     our thinking done for us to the best advantage. Now there are some
    </p>
    <p>
     plain, undeniable facts. They are the kind of facts which cannot be hid
    </p>
    <p>
     under a bushel basket, nor, for that matter, under a king’s crown. One
    </p>
    <p>
     of the most intelligible of these facts--and it is fundamental--is
    </p>
    <p>
     that the number of individual heads apportioned to the same number
    </p>
    <p>
     of paired legs make up the population, and units of population make
    </p>
    <p>
     nations, and nothing else can. An aggregate of gentlemen dressed in
    </p>
    <p>
     wigs, or holding truncheons sticking out of purple and gold-braided
    </p>
    <p>
     shawls never has, and, from sheer destitution, never could make a
    </p>
    <p>
     nation. By all the signs around us, and I am willing to accept them
    </p>
    <p>
     without any question, this country of ours is going to move; is about
    </p>
    <p>
     to begin housekeeping somewhere else, and I think it is an imperative
    </p>
    <p>
     necessity for the success of such a change that everyone living now on
    </p>
    <p>
     this island and calling himself an Englishman, must move also, and move
    </p>
    <p>
     to the same place (Hear, Hear,). But that moving is conditioned. It is
    </p>
    <p>
     indispensably necessary that we proclaim that condition, and insist
    </p>
    <p>
     upon its acceptance. We hold the situation in our own hands. We control
    </p>
    <p>
     the key to the future, to make or mar, or destroy the continuity of the
    </p>
    <p>
     English name. Why? Because if to-morrow the English workingman refused
    </p>
    <p>
     to follow the English flag to Australia, and took his wisdom, his tools
    </p>
    <p>
     and his savings somewhere else, that flag would lose twenty millions
    </p>
    <p>
     of subjects, and would wave over a remnant that could not ensure its
    </p>
    <p>
     protection or its support. (Hear, Hear). But the condition?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The speaker paused, sweeping his eyes over the sea of upturned faces,
    </p>
    <p>
     as if he was hunting through the chaotic assemblage for the disclosure
    </p>
    <p>
     of some particular visage which, either as an ally or an opponent,
    </p>
    <p>
     might receive the shock of his omnipotent secret. Whether he discovered
    </p>
    <p>
     the facial invitation or not, was not revealed in his subsequent
    </p>
    <p>
     action. He wheeled sideways to the stiffened line of men behind
    </p>
    <p>
     him--doubtless expectant and impatient numbers in the afternoon’s
    </p>
    <p>
     programme--and bringing his clenched right hand into the hollowed palm
    </p>
    <p>
     of his left hand, shouted, and not discordantly: “The condition is the
    </p>
    <p>
     abolition forever of the Law of Entail that to-day makes us a servile
    </p>
    <p>
     race.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Again he paused, as if so ponderous a statement, so fiercely declared,
    </p>
    <p>
     would elicit a demonstration--but to Leacraft’s abounding wonder, not
    </p>
    <p>
     a sound arose from the vast audience. Whether it was appalled, or
    </p>
    <p>
     thrilled, interested, or pleased, or dumbfounded, it gave no sign. Its
    </p>
    <p>
     immutable decree for the speaker to go on was its very silence. No
    </p>
    <p>
     public orator could conveniently, with respect to his own sensitive
    </p>
    <p>
     needs for public encouragement, stop there. But he had become cautious.
    </p>
    <p>
     He felt that perchance his auditors yet held mental reservations in
    </p>
    <p>
     favor of things as they were, as they wished them to continue.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I say, with all my heart and soul,” he went on, “stay with the
    </p>
    <p>
     Flag, stay with the King, stay with our lords and ladies, but on
    </p>
    <p>
     one condition as freemen, to whose keeping now in this hour of peril
    </p>
    <p>
     they are wholly given. Into your hands the God of Nations entrusts
    </p>
    <p>
     their fate, but that fate can only be propitious as you are true to
    </p>
    <p>
     yourselves, your children, and your children’s children.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Then came the long delayed approval. A wave of excited pleasure brushed
    </p>
    <p>
     across the crowds, and the hand-clapping, begun in many separate
    </p>
    <p>
     centres, ran together, and with shouts of acquiescence, with cheers,
    </p>
    <p>
     with central and periphera, agitation, the huge aggregate expressed its
    </p>
    <p>
     tumultuous adhesion. Leacraft felt that the loyalty of these people was
    </p>
    <p>
     not impaired, and that the logic of events would still hold them united
    </p>
    <p>
     in a consentaneous allegiance at least, to the idea of the English
    </p>
    <p>
     nation, though it was pretty evident that the democratic claims of a
    </p>
    <p>
     wider opportunity for personal, for family promotion, leavened all
    </p>
    <p>
     their feelings, and that in the new regime it might be expected, that a
    </p>
    <p>
     great deal of the present relation of the classes would be swept away,
    </p>
    <p>
     and that the old time idolatry of degree, the mere flunkeyism of homage
    </p>
    <p>
     to name and geneological prestige, among the masses, had shrunken into
    </p>
    <p>
     nothingness.
    </p>
    <p>
     The stage was again occupied by a speaker, who was interested in very
    </p>
    <p>
     practical and urgent questions, the _how_ and _where_ and _when_, the
    </p>
    <p>
     disposition of the emigrants to the new country, and he revelled in
    </p>
    <p>
     plans, provisions, details of occupancy, and employment. He showed
    </p>
    <p>
     conclusively the power and effectiveness of organization, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     surprising accommodations that can be extracted from the most forlorn
    </p>
    <p>
     prospects by a shrewd use of forethought and combination. Funds had
    </p>
    <p>
     been scraped together, settlements, as yet in the dream stage of
    </p>
    <p>
     realization created, and a practical socialism consummated in the
    </p>
    <p>
     confederation of a large numbers in one common venture. This aspect
    </p>
    <p>
     of the emigration was dwelt upon by the speaker with some rigor. It
    </p>
    <p>
     was a surprise to Leacraft, and lent a strange expression to the still
    </p>
    <p>
     irreconcilable spectacle of Englishmen looking for a new home.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft soon tired of sums, schedules, names, and lists, and wandered
    </p>
    <p>
     away over the park through the scattered groups, many centred around
    </p>
    <p>
     one of those popular tribunes, who, by reason of a little more
    </p>
    <p>
     leisure, perhaps a little more application, and always much more
    </p>
    <p>
     labial facility, influence their class profoundly. The broad lawns
    </p>
    <p>
     were filled with these improvised parliaments, in which too banter,
    </p>
    <p>
     argument, retort, query, admonition bore a part. The perplexing thing
    </p>
    <p>
     was the average satisfaction shown by the people, a kind of holiday
    </p>
    <p>
     anticipation, as if they were off for an excursion. To them perhaps
    </p>
    <p>
     it seemed a new start in life, with the ground less encumbered by
    </p>
    <p>
     rivals, by restrictions, less shadowed by priority, and favors for a
    </p>
    <p>
     few, and by the intimidation of a necessary subserviency. They almost
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed happy in the thought of change. There was bitterness in this,
    </p>
    <p>
     and yet to Leacraft with his undissembling and emancipated mind it
    </p>
    <p>
     was understood. It meant _chance_ to these people--this removal; and
    </p>
    <p>
     to most of them chance never came, never could come as they were.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then to linger, was starvation, loneliness, disuse, death. The
    </p>
    <p>
     business of the country had enormously shrunken, its productive power
    </p>
    <p>
     had been halved, commerce was drifting in stronger and steadier
    </p>
    <p>
     currents elsewhere, and no where so strongly as to Germany, while the
    </p>
    <p>
     over mastering pre-eminence of America loomed up in proportions that
    </p>
    <p>
     paralysed conjecture.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pondering on all these things Leacraft, in his absorbed way, stumbled
    </p>
    <p>
     over a little girl on the edge of one of the shaded walks. He quickly
    </p>
    <p>
     stooped and picked her up, and confronted the young mother, already
    </p>
    <p>
     hastening to the rescue of her child.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I should have been more careful,” said the embarrassed gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, indeed we have all good reason to be thinking more than seeing,
    </p>
    <p>
     these times,” said the smiling mother, “I wonder what we’ll all be like
    </p>
    <p>
     this time, come twelve month.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, I dare say that we shall be doing much the same thing that we do
    </p>
    <p>
     here, in a different place--and then we shall be a year older;” the
    </p>
    <p>
     young woman laughed, and attested a complete willingness to talk more,
    </p>
    <p>
     as she raised the ruffled child from the grass and moved nearer to
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft. Nor was Leacraft indifferent. He felt nettled, and willful,
    </p>
    <p>
     with a subconsciousness of disappointment and fear. This human and
    </p>
    <p>
     healthy mother, with the fresh guerdon of her blushing youth in her
    </p>
    <p>
     arms, was a helpful companion, and then she carried the solace of some
    </p>
    <p>
     new story, perhaps a new need, and Leacraft was not averse to being
    </p>
    <p>
     sympathetic or helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Willie, that’s my man, sir,” continued the girl, “is right glad to
    </p>
    <p>
     get away. Last Candlemas his mother died, and left Willie her savings,
    </p>
    <p>
     and that, and what we have, will tide us to America, and Willie he
    </p>
    <p>
     says that he can get a home, and have a little land, and Willie will
    </p>
    <p>
     be better of his sickness. He’s not here the day, because of his cough
    </p>
    <p>
     and the fever that he has. Ah! sir, it makes me chill at my heart to
    </p>
    <p>
     see him, and to think that we are going so far,” and the sweet face
    </p>
    <p>
     looked piteously at Leacraft, and the tears overran the sad gray eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft saw it all; a consumptive father, poor, out of work, staking
    </p>
    <p>
     everything now to reach that bourne, where the hopeless of all nations
    </p>
    <p>
     saw the welcome light of opportunity. As he thought of this he saw
    </p>
    <p>
     how great this avulsion was, what a tearing up of the roots of family
    </p>
    <p>
     and home life, and how ruthlessly they were to be planted in all
    </p>
    <p>
     sorts of soils, under alien skies, with inauspicious hands to tend
    </p>
    <p>
     and raise them. He turned to the young mother, and said, “It won’t
    </p>
    <p>
     seem so far, if a face from the old home greets you there. I shall be
    </p>
    <p>
     there also, and I will not only be glad to see you, but glad to help
    </p>
    <p>
     you, if you need it. Take this,” and opening his card case, he wrote
    </p>
    <p>
     an address in New York city. “If,” he continued, “you do not remain
    </p>
    <p>
     in New York, this will always find me. Good bye.” He extended his
    </p>
    <p>
     hand and shook with unaffected warmth the hand of the young English
    </p>
    <p>
     woman, to whom the future loomed up in misty and insecure, perhaps
    </p>
    <p>
     menacing shadows. How merciful is sympathy, with what a solacing hand
    </p>
    <p>
     it soothes the “ruffled brow of care,” and how genially it bids the
    </p>
    <p>
     springs of life still follow, and, for a moment at least, flow too in
    </p>
    <p>
     the sunlight of affection. The English woman seized Leacraft’s hand
    </p>
    <p>
     and pressed it tightly, and her face looked into his with almost an
    </p>
    <p>
     enamored thankfulness; she raised the baby girl and held it close to
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft, and the restrained Englishman kissed it with quaint shyness.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the instant, all the shifting helplessness about him moved him
    </p>
    <p>
     inexpressibly. Again they shook hands and the Englishman betrayed into
    </p>
    <p>
     emotional excess, walked rapidly away, reassuring her at the last that
    </p>
    <p>
     he would indeed be soon in America.
    </p>
    <p>
     A few feet away a different encounter swept him into a contrasted
    </p>
    <p>
     realm of emotional excitement. A rude brawling loafer, none too sober,
    </p>
    <p>
     and reckless in oaths and obscenity, had seized the small flags of two
    </p>
    <p>
     little boys--union jacks--and throwing them down on the ground, with
    </p>
    <p>
     an outburst of profanity trampled and defaced them. The Englishman
    </p>
    <p>
     inflamed and ardent, holding a wounded heart, stood stupified and
    </p>
    <p>
     insulted. The next instant and he had snatched the flags from their
    </p>
    <p>
     degradation, and with an instantaneous revulsion struck the culprit of
    </p>
    <p>
     this outrage squarely in the face. The blow was unmistakably adequate.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ruffian reeled and fell and failed to regain his feet, before a
    </p>
    <p>
     shout of applause greeted Leacraft and a concourse of men, who had
    </p>
    <p>
     hastened to the spot on the outcry of the children surrounded him with
    </p>
    <p>
     welcome salutation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “A fine blow--well hit and straight as a gunshot man! That was the
    </p>
    <p>
     right medicine for his complaint. I’m thinking that a little water
    </p>
    <p>
     might wash it down. I say, boys, let’s duck him, souse him in the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
     A tubbing might clean his sassy mouth, and a man is none too good to be
    </p>
    <p>
     rolled in the mud himself, who treads on the English flag.” The subject
    </p>
    <p>
     of this criticism was on his feet again in rather a belligerent mood,
    </p>
    <p>
     blinking and rolling his fists in a minatory fashion, and sputtering
    </p>
    <p>
     defiance, and presenting a transient spectacle of inebriety and
    </p>
    <p>
     coarseness that would have been ludicrous, if the temper of the men
    </p>
    <p>
     behind the new speaker had not seemed so hostile. Leacraft felt that
    </p>
    <p>
     they would do some serious mischief to the miserable delinquent, and he
    </p>
    <p>
     stepped in front of them interposing his body between the foremost of
    </p>
    <p>
     the ranks, and the, now somewhat intimidated drunkard.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think my friends, that you should spare yourselves the trouble to
    </p>
    <p>
     punish this miscreant just now. Let him alone. Neither he or his kind
    </p>
    <p>
     are likely to hurt our flag. He has learned his lesson. To-day my
    </p>
    <p>
     friends it becomes us to command ourselves, and hold ourselves above
    </p>
    <p>
     resentment. We are all sad, our hearts are heavy, the old Manse is
    </p>
    <p>
     to be left and new conquests across the waters made, new homes. Ah!
    </p>
    <p>
     how large the vision grows.” The men had enclosed Leacraft in a dense
    </p>
    <p>
     circle. He saw that he had their attention, while the stumbling object
    </p>
    <p>
     of their first anger effected a shuffling retreat with ignominious
    </p>
    <p>
     haste. His ruse now was to entirely capture their thoughts. “It is a
    </p>
    <p>
     vision of a new England, one made so by our devotion, the fixed quality
    </p>
    <p>
     of our patriotism, an undeviating union among ourselves, and just pride
    </p>
    <p>
     in our history, our race, our King. It may be a better England; it can
    </p>
    <p>
     not be a more beautiful England. We are deeply stricken. While we bow
    </p>
    <p>
     to this necessity, let us make the grandest display of fortitude of
    </p>
    <p>
     resource, of hope, of courage, of skill, of judgment, ever known. In
    </p>
    <p>
     our disaster we shall again conquer the world and hold it submissive
    </p>
    <p>
     at our feet.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft had enough disengagement of thought to half smile to himself
    </p>
    <p>
     at this grandiloquent pretense, but he knew his audience. It was quite
    </p>
    <p>
     British, embued with that cloutish conceit which all popular masses in
    </p>
    <p>
     every successful nation instinctively display. He had appealed to their
    </p>
    <p>
     conceit, though not only to that, and they responded enthusiastically.
    </p>
    <p>
     As he finished this mild buncombe, not without some misgivings as
    </p>
    <p>
     to his own honesty, as he intended at first to repair to the United
    </p>
    <p>
     States, the men nearest to him grasped his hand, others shouted
    </p>
    <p>
     approbation, and still others in silence moved away shaking their
    </p>
    <p>
     heads. Leacraft talked with the men about him. He found that they had
    </p>
    <p>
     been assigned places in the scheme of emigration; some were going to
    </p>
    <p>
     Australia, with a systematic dispersion over the region, which most
    </p>
    <p>
     needed their labor, others to New Zealand into socialistic farming;
    </p>
    <p>
     others to the cape and Rhodesia and still others to Canada; so that his
    </p>
    <p>
     exalted sentiment of solidarity lost a little of its impressiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft lingered a while longer, and as the day ended in a refulgent
    </p>
    <p>
     sunset with church bells, near and far ringing to the services, that
    </p>
    <p>
     now for a week would be held at all hours, inaugurating an unbroken
    </p>
    <p>
     intercession at the throne of grace for the guidance and protection of
    </p>
    <p>
     the people, he left his cordial acquaintances and went westward.
    </p>
    <p>
     He reached Park Lane near the Kensington Gardens, Gloucester House,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the fountain of Thornycroft, the region of Mayfair, the dazzling
    </p>
    <p>
     centre, the illustrious apse of English social splendor, where the
    </p>
    <p>
     inherited privileges of life were not discordantly blended with the
    </p>
    <p>
     no less inherited gifts of fortune; that spot in all London which
    </p>
    <p>
     to relinquish, would seem to sound the depths of national disgrace.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moon swam in the lucent sky, the air was clear, but cold, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the familiar ravishing softness of the June nights as London knew
    </p>
    <p>
     them once, was gone; those illumined mists, the dewyness that spread
    </p>
    <p>
     from the ground to the enveloping air, and threw veil over veil of
    </p>
    <p>
     shimmering opacity upon arch and tower, sward, tree, bridge and storied
    </p>
    <p>
     palace, was all gone, too, and the beautiful neighborhood, as Leacraft
    </p>
    <p>
     wandered through it, from Cumberland Gate--where he saw snow still
    </p>
    <p>
     resting in sheltered recesses--along Park Lane to Hyde Park Corners,
    </p>
    <p>
     through Grosvenor Place to Chapel street, to Belgrave Square, was
    </p>
    <p>
     revealed in an aerial sincerity, that gave its splendor an almost
    </p>
    <p>
     scintillant loveliness, and drove still deeper into Leacraft’s heart
    </p>
    <p>
     the sense of a bewildering bereavement.
    </p>
    <p>
     The streets were filled with flying equipages, and the mansions were
    </p>
    <p>
     ablaze, the sidewalks held few pedestrians, and as Leacraft sorrowfully
    </p>
    <p>
     moved through the stately purlieus, music swept out from open windows
    </p>
    <p>
     or swinging doors. Often he paused and watched the descending occupants
    </p>
    <p>
     of the carriages; they were entrancing women and peerless men, their
    </p>
    <p>
     laughter was silvery and undismayed, unchecked by tears. Could it
    </p>
    <p>
     be possible that these inner esoteric circles of London high life
    </p>
    <p>
     and unimaginable wealth indulged in revelry; could not the crash and
    </p>
    <p>
     fall of empires turn the votaries of gayety to soberer thoughts, or
    </p>
    <p>
     stifle the intoxicating voice of pleasure? Leacraft wondered, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the weariness of a great suspense weighed him down; the ingrained
    </p>
    <p>
     Puritanism of his nature raged against this heartlessness, this
    </p>
    <p>
     indecent bravado, a mockery of joy, where all should be shadowed with
    </p>
    <p>
     the sighs of penitence and supplication.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft was bitterly offended at this apparent heartlessness; it
    </p>
    <p>
     startled him beyond the limits of endurance; he looked for some
    </p>
    <p>
     representative of this foolish life, upon whom to turn with rebuke
    </p>
    <p>
     and denunciation. Leacraft wandered on in a disconsolate mood, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the growing indications, with the falling night, that the fashionable
    </p>
    <p>
     world of London was engaged, in a preconcerted way, to spend the last
    </p>
    <p>
     hours of its metropolitan sojourn in a spendthrift vortex of excitement
    </p>
    <p>
     and conviviality moved him to muttered objurgations. He had slipped
    </p>
    <p>
     past Hyde Park Corners, past the Apsley House, and had glided with
    </p>
    <p>
     hastening steps, as his passion of revolt, at this unseemly loss of
    </p>
    <p>
     self-respect, rose to a towering indignation, into Grosvenor Square.
    </p>
    <p>
     He stood facing the long facade, where in repetitive elegance, with
    </p>
    <p>
     columned porches and mansard roofs, and wall-like chimneys, the
    </p>
    <p>
     mansions of the very rich, illumined at all their windows, poured forth
    </p>
    <p>
     a torrent of light. Aggrieved and stupefied, he shot into Berkley
    </p>
    <p>
     Square, and still no interruption to the aspect of mad revelry. Could
    </p>
    <p>
     it be a frenzied spasm of indulgence, before separation forever from
    </p>
    <p>
     the bliss of the West End, that terrestrial paradise of swelldom and
    </p>
    <p>
     financial and social glory? He wondered. And thus wondering, he came
    </p>
    <p>
     to Devonshire House, fronting Piccadilly. The comfortable home, with
    </p>
    <p>
     its small brick work, peeking chimney pots, the low entablature and
    </p>
    <p>
     triple doors behind the iron gateway, and the unbroken watch of the
    </p>
    <p>
     woman-headed sphinxes, on either side of the elevated escutcheon of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Kingdom, was there, encompassed by its imprisoning walls--and
    </p>
    <p>
     here, too, the effrontery of lavish gayety assaulted his eyes. The
    </p>
    <p>
     gates were flung wide open, powdered footmen were ranged before the
    </p>
    <p>
     doors, arriving and departing carriages threaded Piccadilly with
    </p>
    <p>
     conscienceless celerity, music uttered its delicious melodies, and in
    </p>
    <p>
     them was no requiem note, no throb of sorrow, and the guests crowding
    </p>
    <p>
     into its dazzling halls seemed untouched by thoughts less careless
    </p>
    <p>
     than the joys of the fleeting moments, whose hurrying steps were
    </p>
    <p>
     bringing the dawn of disaster to England. Exasperated, Leacraft turned
    </p>
    <p>
     on his heel in disgust, and was going towards Leicester Square, when a
    </p>
    <p>
     sharp report somewhere on the side of the Geological Museum, and ahead
    </p>
    <p>
     of his position, startled him, and the next instant he saw a carriage,
    </p>
    <p>
     with prancing steeds, plunging down the street, the swaying figure of
    </p>
    <p>
     the driver denoting his complete loss of control, while on one side of
    </p>
    <p>
     the equipage, that side towards Leacraft, the pale face of a gentleman
    </p>
    <p>
     was seen, and beside him the distracted visage of an elderly lady.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the carriage approached Leacraft, it crossed the street, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     front wheels collided with the curbing. This administered a slight
    </p>
    <p>
     detention, and the struggling horses turned again to the opposite side
    </p>
    <p>
     of the thoroughfare. Quick to see his advantage, Leacraft sprang to the
    </p>
    <p>
     head of the nearer horse, and exerting all his strength, which was not
    </p>
    <p>
     inconsiderable, he succeeded in tripping the beast, and as it fell the
    </p>
    <p>
     traces holding its companion broke, and the freed creature raced away
    </p>
    <p>
     down the avenue. The driver leaped to the sidewalk and held the now
    </p>
    <p>
     imprisoned horse, which, starting to its feet, stood trembling beside
    </p>
    <p>
     him, while Leacraft hastened to the door of the vehicle to liberate its
    </p>
    <p>
     occupants.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had already been forstalled by the gentleman himself, who pushed
    </p>
    <p>
     the door back as Leacraft reached it and stepped to the walk,
    </p>
    <p>
     followed instantly by the lady in much commotion and disorder. Their
    </p>
    <p>
     agitation was short lived, and succumbed to the exercise of their own
    </p>
    <p>
     self-control. It was the gentleman who first spoke: “I am under the
    </p>
    <p>
     deepest obligation to you, sir, for your quickness and your courage.
    </p>
    <p>
     You may readily have saved us from a miserable fate. And”--Leacraft
    </p>
    <p>
     interrupted: “You were going to some _rendezvous_ of pleasure; this,
    </p>
    <p>
     sir, in my opinion, on the eve of the nation’s assassination deserved
    </p>
    <p>
     punishment.” The speech was crude, rude perhaps, and the bitter
    </p>
    <p>
     taunt smote the stranger like a physical blow. He recoiled from it
    </p>
    <p>
     as if the sting of a cowhide had crossed his face. His face itself
    </p>
    <p>
     was a study. He stared at Leacraft, and as the latter met his gaze
    </p>
    <p>
     unflinchingly the pale face, distinguished in outline, feature, and
    </p>
    <p>
     expression, flushed to the temples, while the eyes seated under bushy
    </p>
    <p>
     brows gazed at Leacraft with a peculiar earnestness, not relieved of
    </p>
    <p>
     the dangerous suggestion of a rising passion. His companion understood
    </p>
    <p>
     his excitement, she clutched his arm, and seemed to apprehend a
    </p>
    <p>
     physical outbreak. Then the mouth opened, and spoke, and the voice was
    </p>
    <p>
     unexpectedly calm, and the utterances measured: “We are under deep
    </p>
    <p>
     obligation to you sir, but it is difficult for me to restrain myself
    </p>
    <p>
     before the false statements you have ventured to make. Can you explain
    </p>
    <p>
     this insult?”
    </p>
    <p>
     He moved nearer to Leacraft who did not budge, but inspired with an
    </p>
    <p>
     increasing vigor of disgust, and eager to summarily remonstrate at the
    </p>
    <p>
     seeming cruelty of the parade about him, its grotesque wickedness,
    </p>
    <p>
     said: “I do not wish to take advantage of the accidental relations
    </p>
    <p>
     which have thus unexpectedly thrown us together. But surely it is
    </p>
    <p>
     known among men, and known bitterly among Englishmen that the shadows
    </p>
    <p>
     of an awful twilight are falling about them, and the Nation’s Day is
    </p>
    <p>
     closing. At such a crisis can it be possible for men and women, calling
    </p>
    <p>
     themselves English, in whom the memory of English fame and English
    </p>
    <p>
     glory, is still a present pride, can it be possible that at this moment
    </p>
    <p>
     they still consort for amusement, for display, for the fugitive follies
    </p>
    <p>
     of mutual admiration? This aristocracy is the head and forefront of the
    </p>
    <p>
     nation, and it should now be bowed in penitence, in supplication, in
    </p>
    <p>
     the agony of self inquiry, and it stupifies me to find them gay, when
    </p>
    <p>
     the heart of England is breaking with grief.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A curious metamorphosis worked in the lineaments of the gentleman he
    </p>
    <p>
     was addressing. The hard lines relaxed, and a wistful smile, that
    </p>
    <p>
     drew its occult meaning from the man’s interior sadness, stole softly
    </p>
    <p>
     over his face. He put out his hand, which Leacraft accepted, and he
    </p>
    <p>
     returned Leacraft’s pressure. There was an instant’s silence, and then
    </p>
    <p>
     the stranger spoke, still holding Leacraft’s hand, and retaining his
    </p>
    <p>
     undeviating inspection of Leacraft’s face, as if he would force upon
    </p>
    <p>
     himself the recognition of a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
     “These are just words, sir,” he began: “but how much you misunderstand
    </p>
    <p>
     what is going on here. This apparent revelry is an effort to keep from
    </p>
    <p>
     swooning: it is the forced continuance of a life familiar to us, when
    </p>
    <p>
     that life is to be crushed into nothingness; it is the defiance of
    </p>
    <p>
     habit, the revolt against extinction, the mortal protest against the
    </p>
    <p>
     infamous tyranny of circumstances. It is a delirium of indulgence, to
    </p>
    <p>
     forget what is coming upon us; a moment’s arbitrary refusal to think
    </p>
    <p>
     of the future, a dance, in whose whirl we shall remit the impulses of
    </p>
    <p>
     suicide. It is unreasonable, but its monstrous unreasonableness to
    </p>
    <p>
     you sir, measures our appalling sense of the disaster we can not stop
    </p>
    <p>
     to think of, measures the intensity of the recoil from obliteration;
    </p>
    <p>
     like the dressed and garlanded victim of an Aztec immolation we taste
    </p>
    <p>
     again the festive sweets upon which perhaps our cloyed appetites are no
    </p>
    <p>
     longer to feed. We are the sufferers in this eviction; the greatest,
    </p>
    <p>
     the poor, the artisan, laborer, the vast mediocrity lose something, but
    </p>
    <p>
     it amounts to little more than the exchange of one station here, for
    </p>
    <p>
     another of the same sort somewhere else. In a material sense our loss
    </p>
    <p>
     is incalculable; half our riches disappears but with that loss goes
    </p>
    <p>
     social prestige, title, and the moral consciousness of elevation, the
    </p>
    <p>
     breath of our nostrils. I, sir, am ----.” Leacraft did not move; his
    </p>
    <p>
     astonishment was too sharply focussed upon all the astounding previous
    </p>
    <p>
     confession. “And,” continued the man, “the ruin of worldly fortune
    </p>
    <p>
     seems small, after all, compared with the sacrifice of that dignified
    </p>
    <p>
     and sheltered life, which moved serenely, with every accompaniment of
    </p>
    <p>
     joy, in these delightful abodes, and under the protecting aegis of an
    </p>
    <p>
     inexpressible separation from the rest of the world. But”--he seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     to wish to justify himself, somehow, as he noticed the still petrified
    </p>
    <p>
     stare of Leacraft--“we have not been neglectful of the matters
    </p>
    <p>
     of adjustment. Committees have been appointed, plans laid, funds
    </p>
    <p>
     appropriated, agents despatched, for the selection of our new homes,
    </p>
    <p>
     and though we take our flight with lopped wings, our plumage may in
    </p>
    <p>
     time resume its former beauty. Do not misunderstand us because of these
    </p>
    <p>
     assemblies. We too carry deeper than you the pain of an unutterable
    </p>
    <p>
     grief.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He finished, and Leacraft drawn into a reverie over the singular
    </p>
    <p>
     confession, which was anything but reassuring, and partook, to his
    </p>
    <p>
     mind, of the dementia of the foolish victim of a depraved habit, was
    </p>
    <p>
     silent. He felt the imperious requirements of speech, but he could
    </p>
    <p>
     say nothing. He felt pity, he was not without sympathy, though
    </p>
    <p>
     perhaps in that matter, a certain savor of self denying control, and
    </p>
    <p>
     a practical judgment interfered with his approval of the hyperbole of
    </p>
    <p>
     the speaker. And, almost dreaming, he stood there while the stranger
    </p>
    <p>
     and his lady re-entered their carriage, to which the runaway horse had
    </p>
    <p>
     been reattached, and drove off. Leacraft watched them mechanically and
    </p>
    <p>
     then turned, walked down Piccadilly, crossed Green Park, and looked at
    </p>
    <p>
     Buckingham Palace. The huge structure was partially illuminated, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the square in front of it was filled with soldiers, many of whom were
    </p>
    <p>
     at rest around the Victoria Memorial. To an officer lounging near by,
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft said, “Can you tell me where the King is to-night?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “He sleeps at St. Leonards in Shoreditch,” was the laconic reply.

     CHAPTER IX.
    </head>
    <p>
     THE SPECTACLE.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was two days later than the events narrated above, that Leacraft
    </p>
    <p>
     and Thomsen, with Miss Tobit between them, sat in a crowded window on
    </p>
    <p>
     Hammersmith road watching for the enormous procession that had been
    </p>
    <p>
     slowly winding through London, with offices and services, halts and
    </p>
    <p>
     functions, as the King sadly led the departure of the English people
    </p>
    <p>
     from the Mother of Nations.
    </p>
    <p>
     And the vast pageant approached. Down Kensington road its first
    </p>
    <p>
     glittering sallies were seen, the block of London police, a gorgeous
    </p>
    <p>
     cavalcade behind them of the peers of the realm, and in the
    </p>
    <p>
     immeasurable distance the shimmering parts, that looked stationary,
    </p>
    <p>
     and yet were coming on with ample speed. The blaring trumpets in the
    </p>
    <p>
     bands drew near, the street was cleared from curb to curb, the dense
    </p>
    <p>
     assemblage, covering stoop and roof, and leaning from every window
    </p>
    <p>
     became silent, the reiterated thud of the falling feet was heard,
    </p>
    <p>
     and in an instant the marching host was passing beneath them. The
    </p>
    <p>
     police and the peers of the realm passed in silence or with barely
    </p>
    <p>
     noticeable tokens of recognition. The peers presented a dazzling array,
    </p>
    <p>
     on superbly caparisoned horses, and in the regalia of their separate
    </p>
    <p>
     stations, with a bearing of unmistakable dignity, and possessing in
    </p>
    <p>
     a large measure the impress and gift of English manly beauty, they
    </p>
    <p>
     uttered the note of _caste_. Behind them came the marshalled Church,
    </p>
    <p>
     a wonderful picture; choirs of boys, surpliced and gowned, in open
    </p>
    <p>
     carriages, priests and bishops, in their robes of office, with flying
    </p>
    <p>
     standards of chapel, church or cathedral, golden lambs, crosses and
    </p>
    <p>
     crowns, figures and mottes on white silk or ruby silk, in wavering
    </p>
    <p>
     confusion, while hymns in wavering sopranos rose petulantly, or again
    </p>
    <p>
     with sustained vitality and strength. It appealed to the people
    </p>
    <p>
     strangely. They became very still, and faces contorted with sobs, or
    </p>
    <p>
     heads bowed to hide the unbidden tears for a few moments drew a veil of
    </p>
    <p>
     gloom over the splendid show. After the Church and the peers, a forest
    </p>
    <p>
     of equipages brought in view the marvellous display of the robed and
    </p>
    <p>
     crowned peeresses, and succeeding this shining cloud of matrons, that
    </p>
    <p>
     gave the touch of tenderness, the atmosphere of feminine companionship,
    </p>
    <p>
     and endurance, as if the mothers of England responded in this untoward
    </p>
    <p>
     hour with an embracing sympathy; after them came the King’s Household
    </p>
    <p>
     and the King, with outriders, equerries, and panoplied footmen, a
    </p>
    <p>
     miracle of ostentatious and ceremonial color. His equipage was drawn
    </p>
    <p>
     by ten jet black stallions, with diapers of the King’s colors on their
    </p>
    <p>
     backs, and a line of ancient guardsmen, with pikes in their hands,
    </p>
    <p>
     hedging them in, and a footman in sparkling white at the head of each
    </p>
    <p>
     horse. The King was himself robed in the gowns of his high estate, and
    </p>
    <p>
     was uncovered, the Crown resting on a cushion in front of him. A cheer
    </p>
    <p>
     rent the air, unfurled flags and fluttering handkerchiefs, turned a
    </p>
    <p>
     sea of faces into an ocean of white and red pennants. The King gravely
    </p>
    <p>
     acknowledged the salute and bowed to right and left. He was alone;
    </p>
    <p>
     the Queen had been enthroned among the peeresses. After the King came
    </p>
    <p>
     the Mayor of London, with all the antiquated grandeur of his office,
    </p>
    <p>
     coach, beef eaters, and all, and the people settled back again to their
    </p>
    <p>
     luncheons, which had been interrupted by the King.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then came the troops. The display was exhaustive. It was conceived upon
    </p>
    <p>
     a scale of imperial magnificence, and it appealed in the succession of
    </p>
    <p>
     its gorgeous units to the historic sense, to that divine purpose of
    </p>
    <p>
     continuity which every Englishman instinctively appropriates to his
    </p>
    <p>
     race and nation. It represented the chronological development of the
    </p>
    <p>
     English army. As its sonorous length defiled before Leacraft, he saw
    </p>
    <p>
     an objective symbol--nay, the corporeal fact--of England’s growing
    </p>
    <p>
     power; regiment after regiment made a pictorial calendar from 1660 to
    </p>
    <p>
     1900, and to the informed mind what a vista of martial glory, what
    </p>
    <p>
     a presentation of advance and retreat over the tractless wastes of
    </p>
    <p>
     the world, they made! It was a trampling chronicle of woe and fame,
    </p>
    <p>
     shame and satisfaction; it embodied the progress of ideas, the clash
    </p>
    <p>
     of political tendencies, the spreading domination of English rule; it
    </p>
    <p>
     was a panorama of battles, the tide of victory, the ebbing terrors
    </p>
    <p>
     of defeat; it reflected the pages of political designs, political
    </p>
    <p>
     subterfuge, political confusion; the music that swelled from its ranks
    </p>
    <p>
     now sent the long waves of its solemn processional melody through the
    </p>
    <p>
     thrilled spectators, now in limpid folk-songs, quivered delightfully in
    </p>
    <p>
     their ears, and now again summoned them to their feet with the stately
    </p>
    <p>
     and pious invocation of the nation’s hymn.
    </p>
    <p>
     The scarlet uniforms of the First Life Guards passed, and Maestricht,
    </p>
    <p>
     Boyne, the Peninsular, and Waterloo, flashed in view--the regiment
    </p>
    <p>
     which was raised in Holland by King Charles the Second, and was
    </p>
    <p>
     composed of eighty gentlemen, whose sobriquet of the “cheeses,” along
    </p>
    <p>
     with other Life Guards, had been acquired from the contemptuous
    </p>
    <p>
     refusal of their veterans to serve in them when remodelled, because
    </p>
    <p>
     they were no longer composed of gentlemen, but of cheesemongers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again, the Second Life Guards revived the stained memory of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Stuarts, its own exile in the Netherlands, its return with the
    </p>
    <p>
     restoration; and its sea green facings pleasantly restored for a
    </p>
    <p>
     moment the face of the injured Queen Caroline. Here were the Royal
    </p>
    <p>
     Horse Guards, that inherited, or at least might claim the virtues of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Parliamentary army, which fought with dogmas at the ends of their
    </p>
    <p>
     pike-staffs, and convictions in their hearts. Now passed the First
    </p>
    <p>
     Dragoon Guards, that carried on its proud records the Battle of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Boyne in 1690, Oudenarde in 1708, Malplaquet in 1709, Fontenoy in 1745,
    </p>
    <p>
     Waterloo in 1815, and Pekin in 1860, though to Leacraft’s sensitive
    </p>
    <p>
     mind the last was an inscription of disgrace. The beating hoofs of the
    </p>
    <p>
     “Queen’s Bays,” the Second Dragoon Guards, hurried the reminiscent
    </p>
    <p>
     admirer back to Lucknow and the Indian Mutiny. The nodding plumes of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Prince of Wales, with the Rising Sun, and the Red Dragon which
    </p>
    <p>
     came in view with the Third Dragoon Guards, unfailingly recalled to
    </p>
    <p>
     the custodians of English military renown, that the regiment captured
    </p>
    <p>
     the standard and kettle drums of the Bavarian Guards at the Battle of
    </p>
    <p>
     Ramilies. Trampling on the heels of their horses, the lordly “Blue
    </p>
    <p>
     Horse” defiled past, and the Fifth Dragoon Guards, which supported
    </p>
    <p>
     the vital legend, “_Vestigia nulla retrorsum_,” and which captured
    </p>
    <p>
     four standards at the Battle of Blenheim. Still the endless lines
    </p>
    <p>
     advanced, wavered, stood still, and again with rattling and shivering
    </p>
    <p>
     harness, passed. Now it was the Second Dragoons, the Scotch Greys,
    </p>
    <p>
     raised in Scotland, and older than any other dragoons in the British
    </p>
    <p>
     army, that started the furious applause, an ovation not unintelligently
    </p>
    <p>
     bestowed--for it was they who captured the colors of the French at
    </p>
    <p>
     Ramilies, and their standards at Dettingen. Now it was the “Black
    </p>
    <p>
     Dragoons,” the Sixth, on its glistening horses--once part of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Inniskilling forces, and still bearing as its crest the Castle of
    </p>
    <p>
     Inniskilling; now the Eighth Hussars, whose Protestant fealty had made
    </p>
    <p>
     their founders defenders of William of Orange at the Battle of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Boyne, and who, with signal power, captured forty-four stands of colors
    </p>
    <p>
     and seventy-two guns at the Battle of Leswarree. Now the Fifteenth
    </p>
    <p>
     Hussars, who bore upon their helmets the dazzling inscription, “Five
    </p>
    <p>
     Battalions of French defeated and taken by this Regiment, with their
    </p>
    <p>
     Colors, and nine pieces of cannon, at Emsdorf, 16th of July, 1760.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Swelling hearts greeted the Grenadier Guards, rich in the legacy of the
    </p>
    <p>
     fame of the defeated French Imperial Guards.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here were the Dublin Fusileers--the “Green Linnets,” the “Die
    </p>
    <p>
     Hards”--the East Surries--the West Yorks--and Devons, who had been
    </p>
    <p>
     part of that indiscriminate blunder and glory--the Boer War.
    </p>
    <p>
     And now the infantry, in closing ranks, unrolled the endless phalanxes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Where regiments, as entire units, were absent, companies took their
    </p>
    <p>
     places, and English cheers saluted the swinging standards. The
    </p>
    <p>
     Thirty-fifth, which took the Royal Roussillon French Grenadiers at the
    </p>
    <p>
     Battle of Quebec--the Thirty-fourth, which impregnably covered the
    </p>
    <p>
     retreat from Fontenoy--the Thirty-ninth, which defended Gibraltar in
    </p>
    <p>
     1780, and captured the insurgents’ guns and standards at Maharajpore,
    </p>
    <p>
     in 1843, along with the Fortieth--the Forty-second, with the red heckle
    </p>
    <p>
     in its bonnets, to commemorate its capture of the French standards of
    </p>
    <p>
     the “Invincible Legion,” in 1801, as well as for its distinguished
    </p>
    <p>
     ardor in the Battle of Guildermalsen, in 1795, and the “Little Fighting
    </p>
    <p>
     Toms” stirred the crowds, and even to those who regarded the pageant
    </p>
    <p>
     with glances of bitterness, as the hollow mask of a cruel abdication,
    </p>
    <p>
     even to their glassy stare, this epic review brought a momentary gleam
    </p>
    <p>
     of gratitude and pride.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here was the Forty-sixth, whose colonel, with the English nonchalence
    </p>
    <p>
     which always wins so enduring a regard with Englishmen, in spite of
    </p>
    <p>
     a kind of artifice of mere stubbornness in it, preached a sermon
    </p>
    <p>
     to his men, under a heavy fire, about the Lacedemonians and their
    </p>
    <p>
     discipline--and which, at least to an American, awoke only hateful
    </p>
    <p>
     memories--and here the Fiftieth, “The Blind Half Hundred,” who fought
    </p>
    <p>
     with damaged eyes in Egypt, and who shone resplendent with courage and
    </p>
    <p>
     gallant sacrifice at Vimiera--Ah! and here was the Fifty-seventh--“the
    </p>
    <p>
     Die Hards”--which had thirty bullets through the King’s colors, and
    </p>
    <p>
     only one officer out of twenty-four, and one hundred and sixty-eight
    </p>
    <p>
     men out of five hundred and eighty-four left standing at Albuera. The
    </p>
    <p>
     people shouted and stormed, an avalanche of flags suddenly sprang up
    </p>
    <p>
     over the walled street, and at points showers of flowers and bags of
    </p>
    <p>
     fruit descended in a tornado of delight. Surely, if Englishmen had such
    </p>
    <p>
     blood in them, the nation would yet live.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here were the men from India, the regiments of the Seventy-third, the
    </p>
    <p>
     Seventy-fourth, wearing the badge of the “elephant,” the Seventy-sixth,
    </p>
    <p>
     too, that unfurled its victorious pennants at the Battle of Leswarree,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the Seventy-seventh and Seventy-eighth, and on, on, straight in
    </p>
    <p>
     the line, brave squadrons, whose illusive recognition in a numeral,
    </p>
    <p>
     connoted glorious deeds, defiant strength, the prodigal powers of
    </p>
    <p>
     the brave. The thundering salutations drowned the rollicking music
    </p>
    <p>
     of “Clear the Way,” the cry at Barrosso, which with fife and drum
    </p>
    <p>
     announced the approach of the Eighty-seventh--the Prince of Wales’ own
    </p>
    <p>
     Irish--and the Eighty-eighth, the Connaught Rangers, whose more loving
    </p>
    <p>
     sobriquet was “The Devil’s Own Connaught Boys,” from its gallantry
    </p>
    <p>
     in action, and its irregularities in quarters. Uniform and vanity
    </p>
    <p>
     with reciprocal enhancement made the Argyleshire Highlanders and the
    </p>
    <p>
     Gordon Highlanders and the Sutherland Highlanders an envious spectacle
    </p>
    <p>
     to manly youth, a vision of ingratiating heroes to feminine beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again India sprang back to memory, perhaps not without, to souls of
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft’s fibre, inflicting some stinging stabs of remorse, when the
    </p>
    <p>
     One Hundred Foot, the One Hundred and Second Foot, “the Lambs,” the
    </p>
    <p>
     One Hundred and Third Foot, “the Old Toughs,” the One Hundred and
    </p>
    <p>
     Fourth Foot, and Seventh, and Eighth, and Ninth marched past, with
    </p>
    <p>
     ear shattering dim, in resplendent waves of color, and expressing the
    </p>
    <p>
     English temperament of reserved force, and intelligent determination,
    </p>
    <p>
     with, to the more analytical observer, a suggestion of brutal power in
    </p>
    <p>
     their sturdy and inelastic tramp.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then came the people of the Earth, from the ends of the world they
    </p>
    <p>
     came; the wild, the exotic, the uncouth, the suave, and treacherous,
    </p>
    <p>
     the mystic, the benign, the terrible, in all garbs, in vestures of wool
    </p>
    <p>
     and silk and cotton, in no small numbers without much vesture. It was
    </p>
    <p>
     a web of hues, a carpet of figures and dyes, a lithe and sinuous and
    </p>
    <p>
     portentous living worm, each zone of its immense length, as it swayed
    </p>
    <p>
     and twisted and halted, and then slipped on with ludicrous indecision
    </p>
    <p>
     and disorder, made up of races, ethnic blotches or flowers from the
    </p>
    <p>
     round prolific globe. The army had been history, the procession now
    </p>
    <p>
     became psychological, a review of temperaments, endowments, climates,
    </p>
    <p>
     proclivities and talents; nay it wore the aspect of a zoological
    </p>
    <p>
     medley, a vast menagery of animal products, that with growl and
    </p>
    <p>
     scream, trumpetings or fluttering wings gave to the congeries of
    </p>
    <p>
     men and women who walked among them, or with them, the sentiment
    </p>
    <p>
     and resemblance of the parade of the beasts before Adam. As if with
    </p>
    <p>
     England’s dislodgement, the shaken countries of the earth emptied out
    </p>
    <p>
     their populations in her wake, disturbed in all their resting places by
    </p>
    <p>
     her calamity; spilled from their hidden corners into the shining light
    </p>
    <p>
     of day, and bringing with them the animals of the fields and the birds
    </p>
    <p>
     of the air. And the air itself was cruelly brilliant. The severity of
    </p>
    <p>
     outlines, the sharp shadows, the nipping frostiness in the shades,
    </p>
    <p>
     where the sun was not found, told the weary story that England had lost
    </p>
    <p>
     her climate, and was swept back in a normal alignment with the cold and
    </p>
    <p>
     feeble countries of the pole.
    </p>
    <p>
     What is this odd group accentuated in the midst of all this confusion
    </p>
    <p>
     of types by a more bizarre strangeness, the quizzical fatuity and
    </p>
    <p>
     simpering idiocy of devotion--grinning _shikaris_ from the Tibet with
    </p>
    <p>
     prayer wheels--from the lofty valleys of Baltistan and Ladakh, from
    </p>
    <p>
     Kargil and Maulbek Chamba--incredible children from the East with their
    </p>
    <p>
     rotating brass wheels, with a woman or so, proudly walking among them
    </p>
    <p>
     carrying a burden of wealth in her turquoise and carnelian encrusted
    </p>
    <p>
     pberak bound around her head and terminating in a black knotted fringe
    </p>
    <p>
     behind her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     And straggling on their tracks come the Malays from Pinang and
    </p>
    <p>
     Dindings, from Malaca and Singapore, the small brown men, enduring,
    </p>
    <p>
     brighteyed, straight black-haired, in jackets, trousers and
    </p>
    <p>
     sarongs--the tartan skirt fastened around the waist, and reaching to
    </p>
    <p>
     the knee--and with a raja sprinkled among them with a yellow umbrella
    </p>
    <p>
     over him, a dandy nonchalance printing his sleek cheek with dimples.
    </p>
    <p>
     And India, the nursery of religions, of dreams, of talking and sleeping
    </p>
    <p>
     and famishing men, followed, and for an instant Leacraft thought of
    </p>
    <p>
     Kim’s journey “from Umballa through Kalka and the Pinjore gardens near
    </p>
    <p>
     by up to Simla,” which Kipling told; he thought on “the flush of the
    </p>
    <p>
     morning laid along the distant snows; the branched cacti; tier upon
    </p>
    <p>
     tier the stony hillsides; the voices of a thousand water channels; the
    </p>
    <p>
     chatter of the monkeys, the solemn deodars, climbing one after another,
    </p>
    <p>
     with down-drooped branches; the vista of the plains rolled far out
    </p>
    <p>
     beneath them; the incessant twanging of the tonga horns and the wild
    </p>
    <p>
     rush of the led horses, the halt for prayers, the evening conference by
    </p>
    <p>
     the halting places, when camels and bullocks chewed solemnly together.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He closed his eyes in a revery, and the next opened them upon the very
    </p>
    <p>
     thing. Here were the bullocks, the monkeys, the camels, and here too
    </p>
    <p>
     came the hulking elephants. Dravidians from the southern peninsular, in
    </p>
    <p>
     shawls; the Hill tribes, in coats; the high caste Hindus, in skirts and
    </p>
    <p>
     turbans; Mussulmen from Cashmere, and a few Indian Princes, with their
    </p>
    <p>
     suites, in a coruscation of gem stones, made up a train of spectacles
    </p>
    <p>
     that drew the eager crowds together, almost to the obliteration of
    </p>
    <p>
     the narrow string of exotics that, a little shabbily, shuffled along
    </p>
    <p>
     between them, with however the Princes on horseback or swung in state
    </p>
    <p>
     in palanquins.
    </p>
    <p>
     But here came Egypt bearing her witness of the universality of that
    </p>
    <p>
     power which, with her, at least, had seemed to play the part of a
    </p>
    <p>
     benevolent trustee and guide. No longer the impetuous crowds crushed
    </p>
    <p>
     the line of march; behind the blaring band that now approached rode
    </p>
    <p>
     Lord Kitchener, Sirdar of the Egyptian army who had resumed his ancient
    </p>
    <p>
     post and from an overwrought sentiment for exoneration, announced his
    </p>
    <p>
     desire to remain there and thus efface the irreconcileable differences
    </p>
    <p>
     which had caused Lord Curzon’s retirement from India. It was a
    </p>
    <p>
     magnanimous action and had deeply ingratiated this popular hero in
    </p>
    <p>
     the favor of the nation. Lord Kitchener, with his staff, preceded,
    </p>
    <p>
     in military stateliness, and with smart precision, five regiments or
    </p>
    <p>
     groups of Egyptian soldiers. These were combined or selected so as to
    </p>
    <p>
     make a bouquet of colors, but essentially business like also in their
    </p>
    <p>
     serious regularity, a demeanor fortified to the point of affectation by
    </p>
    <p>
     the plaudits and unconcealed admiration of the hosts of people on the
    </p>
    <p>
     streets, and protruding from every point above them. There were Arab
    </p>
    <p>
     lancers--in light blue uniforms, almost too delicate in tone for daily
    </p>
    <p>
     travel, the bodies of the camel corps, with the blackest type of men in
    </p>
    <p>
     the Sudanese infantry regiments, assimilating to the soil of the desert
    </p>
    <p>
     in the color of their khaki costume, and then other details of the
    </p>
    <p>
     military organization, gleaming in immaculate white trousers and coats.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was unmistakably effective, and it imparted moral strength to this
    </p>
    <p>
     illimitable advertisement of physical power. It recalled the campaigns
    </p>
    <p>
     of Khartum and Omdurman, and memorialized that time-worn boast of
    </p>
    <p>
     the English rehabilitation of Egypt; a fact certainly, but not to be
    </p>
    <p>
     distinguished as a very incredible achievement.
    </p>
    <p>
     The spectacle closed with Zulus and Hottentots, the bushmen of
    </p>
    <p>
     Australia, some dejected New Zealanders, and a picturesque assortment
    </p>
    <p>
     of Jamaican negroes, who tramped along with amusement in their
    </p>
    <p>
     staring eyes, and a raggedness of deportment, reflecting the wasteful
    </p>
    <p>
     and careless way of the tropics. Nor were there wanting Greeks from
    </p>
    <p>
     Cyprus. And at the last the loyalty of the Colonies was splendidly
    </p>
    <p>
     emphasized, Canada, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Natal,
    </p>
    <p>
     Bermuda, the Bahamas, contributed a final burst of patriotic zeal,
    </p>
    <p>
     and seemed to open the wide earth, to their kindred in the English
    </p>
    <p>
     island, for home-making and re-establishment. Nor was the show of
    </p>
    <p>
     devotion fortuitous or hollow. It was sincere. It represented a sudden
    </p>
    <p>
     _rapprochement_, an instantaneous and valid impulse of sympathy and
    </p>
    <p>
     support. Nothing had ever happened in the history of the English
    </p>
    <p>
     people, which had had so vital an influence in stimulating unity
    </p>
    <p>
     among the English themselves, which so peremptorily flung them into
    </p>
    <p>
     each other’s arms, and in a great peril summoned to the surface the
    </p>
    <p>
     inextinguishable claims of blood, ancestry, tradition, instincts,
    </p>
    <p>
     and pride, advancing them to a solidarity never before realised.
    </p>
    <p>
     Its effects were very apparent. The pictures of Hope, lit up by the
    </p>
    <p>
     imaginative flamings of Ambition, almost at times, at this dread
    </p>
    <p>
     moment, gave to the future in the new habitations awaiting them, an
    </p>
    <p>
     unexpected salubrity and beauty. The English leaders dreamed of new
    </p>
    <p>
     achievements, a new literature, a greatness vastly exceeding all
    </p>
    <p>
     historic records.
    </p>
    <p>
     Three days after the parade, which Leacraft saw so magniloquently
    </p>
    <p>
     evolved in the streets of London, at Tilbury, the King left English
    </p>
    <p>
     soil, to transplant the symbols and the functions of the English
    </p>
    <p>
     government to Australia, and to begin the new experiment. The hills,
    </p>
    <p>
     the fields, the shores, were all too contracted to hold the army and
    </p>
    <p>
     the people, gathered in one sublime throb of loyalty and affection
    </p>
    <p>
     to witness the inexpressible event. The King wearing the uniform of
    </p>
    <p>
     a Field Marshall issued from a royal tent and with uncovered head
    </p>
    <p>
     moved towards the shore where his barge was moored. The moment was
    </p>
    <p>
     statuesque; the immeasurable multitude with a wave of heart breaking
    </p>
    <p>
     emotion uncovered; the national hymn played by a string and wind
    </p>
    <p>
     orchestra of four hundred pieces pierced the air with its magnificent
    </p>
    <p>
     undulation of melody, and a selected chorus led the engulfing tide
    </p>
    <p>
     of song. Amid the surges of vocal outpouring the parks of artillery
    </p>
    <p>
     belched their resounding salutes, the lines of war vessels with their
    </p>
    <p>
     crews at attention returned the iron throated call, and the King
    </p>
    <p>
     standing below the sweeping oars, turned for an instant towards the
    </p>
    <p>
     shore, and then regained his first posture of immovable fixture upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the pregnable sides of the Dreadnought, whither each stroke of those
    </p>
    <p>
     fateful oarsmen was swiftly sending him.
    </p>
    <p>
     The suspense was insupportable, the poignant crushing terror of it all,
    </p>
    <p>
     the incredible predicament of a nation bodily leaving its birth place,
    </p>
    <p>
     stunned the crowds, and in silence with a thousand varying episodes
    </p>
    <p>
     throughout its interminable acres, the populace stood, dumb as the
    </p>
    <p>
     unresponsive rock, apparently as apathetic as the herding cows.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then at sunfall the Dreadnought, followed by an escort of cruisers
    </p>
    <p>
     heavily churned the waters, and passed down the Thames, from its
    </p>
    <p>
     mouth into the Channel, and so on to the open sea, and with it went
    </p>
    <p>
     the concentrated expression of the Idea of the English empire--the
    </p>
    <p>
     King. How strangely immobile is Nature! A race which had covered
    </p>
    <p>
     its literary vestures with the garlands of poetry, wrought from the
    </p>
    <p>
     imagery in nature’s picture-book, which had spent its brain and
    </p>
    <p>
     industry in winning for nature new devotees, and new sacrifices of
    </p>
    <p>
     praises and idolatry, which had enthroned among its chiefest charms
    </p>
    <p>
     its surrender to the control of nature, in this hour of torturing
    </p>
    <p>
     doubt, disenthronement and eviction won no sign of recognition. The
    </p>
    <p>
     day closed brightly. The sun went down in a sky of unchecked splendor,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the moon-illuminated night bathed the ancient bastions of Tilbury
    </p>
    <p>
     with an argent sheen. The terrible event found no reflection in the
    </p>
    <p>
     august calmness and serenity of Nature. “Its withers were unwrung.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Enveloped in the processes of decay and change, the lapse of a kingdom
    </p>
    <p>
     was but a paltry contribution to the chronicle of destroyed continents,
    </p>
    <p>
     and shattered worlds. There was no contact between its mechanism
    </p>
    <p>
     and the obliteration of a sentiment, or an idea, or moral regime.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nothing short of a change in atmospheric pressure would bring tears to
    </p>
    <p>
     its face, or agony in its deportment. And what in any case was this
    </p>
    <p>
     desertion of a land, the removal of a people? It was subordinated to
    </p>
    <p>
     fluctuations of an oceanic river, to the up and down shiverings of
    </p>
    <p>
     the crust of the earth. It was a part of the huge drama part of the
    </p>
    <p>
     inlaid order of things, as determined at creation, when the ways and
    </p>
    <p>
     means of shaping the world, and all things in it, were inaugurated.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why should the disappearance of a condition shock a system of
    </p>
    <p>
     disappearances and appearances, which is another name for the unceasing
    </p>
    <p>
     orbit of revolutions in the face of the earth, and which is nature? An
    </p>
    <p>
     individual counts for nothing in the lapse of twenty-four hours gone
    </p>
    <p>
     or come. Why in the aeons gone and the aeons yet to come should the
    </p>
    <p>
     migration of a people, or the emptying of a vestige of the earth’s
    </p>
    <p>
     surface merit notice? And so the elements did not hasten to weep, or
    </p>
    <p>
     storm, or furiously proclaim their commiseration, and the whispering
    </p>
    <p>
     calls of the half revived summer from pond and wood and meadow retained
    </p>
    <p>
     their old time sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus it happened, but from the mouth of men and women, and prompted
    </p>
    <p>
     deeply in their yearning soul, rose clouds of prayers that night, for
    </p>
    <p>
     the safety of the King, and ever and anon as troops marched over the
    </p>
    <p>
     roads in the cold summer night the hymn:
    </p>
    <p>
     Lord of the Wave and Deep,
    </p>
    <p>
     Save those at Sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     Their path upon the Ocean keep,
    </p>
    <p>
     And let them see
    </p>
    <p>
     Thy hand each passing day,
    </p>
    <p>
     Thy Ministry of Peace.
    </p>
    <p>
     was played with bewitching plaintiveness. Men and women stopped and
    </p>
    <p>
     sang it aloud as the regiments went by, and sometimes a company of
    </p>
    <p>
     troopers added with resounding vigor their sonorous refrain.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Prime Minister and Mr. Birrell, and Mr. Asquith, who had been
    </p>
    <p>
     associated in 1906, in the famous dead lock between the Commons
    </p>
    <p>
     and the House of Lords over the Educational Bill, prepared on the
    </p>
    <p>
     departure of the King a statement which really was a programme of
    </p>
    <p>
     evacuation. It contemplated a progressive transference of the people
    </p>
    <p>
     from England, a slowly consummated shrinkage of the business facilities
    </p>
    <p>
     and the moderated outflow of capital to the new centres of English
    </p>
    <p>
     activity. In this way some check would ensue to the frightful fall in
    </p>
    <p>
     the land values and rentals, apart from the practical consideration
    </p>
    <p>
     of the physical impossibility of at once removing forty millions of
    </p>
    <p>
     people. The government had usurped unusual powers in the creation
    </p>
    <p>
     of a Committee of Direction, which by a house to house canvass, an
    </p>
    <p>
     exhaustive survey of all titles, and a comparative estimate of the
    </p>
    <p>
     hardship imposed by emigration to different families, with immense
    </p>
    <p>
     labor, had prepared an itemized list of departure of the families
    </p>
    <p>
     of London. This plan had been copied in the large cities of the
    </p>
    <p>
     kingdom, and a co-operative scheme framed, which comprised a detailed
    </p>
    <p>
     prescription of the time of sailing, and the places of settlement
    </p>
    <p>
     for all persons listed. These lists were commonly referred to as the
    </p>
    <p>
     “Doomsday Rolls.” The scope of the committee’s power was comprehensive.
    </p>
    <p>
     It prohibited to individuals and to societies, federations and unions,
    </p>
    <p>
     independent action, without explicit conference with the committee. It
    </p>
    <p>
     proved to be a most helpful device, and lessened to the lowest possible
    </p>
    <p>
     percentage of hardship the suffering of the people.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft and his new friends freed themselves from the jurisdiction
    </p>
    <p>
     of the committee, by announcing their intention to go to America, and
    </p>
    <p>
     upon ample evidence of their ability to do so, and their independent
    </p>
    <p>
     financial standing.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was fully understood that the evacuation was to be a sustained,
    </p>
    <p>
     gradual movement, with, however, an irreversible determination to
    </p>
    <p>
     make it finally complete. It was not believed that England had
    </p>
    <p>
     become utterly uninhabitable, or that some vestiges of its former
    </p>
    <p>
     occupation might not be still maintained. A part of the plan of
    </p>
    <p>
     evacuation involved an affectionate care of its greater monuments of
    </p>
    <p>
     architecture, if possible, though the fierceness of the winter winds
    </p>
    <p>
     augured unhappily for the success of this design. A regency of love
    </p>
    <p>
     at any rate was to be established, and as many links as possible of
    </p>
    <p>
     connection, sentimental and real, were to be left unbroken.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Edinburgh? Thomsen had woefully noted every day the scanty
    </p>
    <p>
     paragraphs which entered the papers, and which gave brief intimations
    </p>
    <p>
     of the devastating and continuous storms, which, through the winter,
    </p>
    <p>
     swept over Scotland. As if, in order that the impending changes
    </p>
    <p>
     might be most forcibly realized, and the loss of time averted from
    </p>
    <p>
     too leniently interpreting the enormous seasonal metamorphosis going
    </p>
    <p>
     on, nature had exhausted her power in developing disaster. Terrific
    </p>
    <p>
     gales had lashed the rocky coasts, fierce insatiable blizzards had
    </p>
    <p>
     devouringly raged in the interior, and the pitiless and untired skies
    </p>
    <p>
     had emptied avalanches of snow upon the southern counties of Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
     Edinburgh became a storm centre. With whirling inconstancy the storms
    </p>
    <p>
     beat upon the doomed city from the East and West; buildings were almost
    </p>
    <p>
     buried in the banked up and superimposed drifts, crested ranges were
    </p>
    <p>
     in the streets, and palisades of snow tortured into fantastic shapes,
    </p>
    <p>
     towered over the outer eminences, fed from the blinding torrents of
    </p>
    <p>
     flakes driven off from the Pentland hills and the Salisbury Crags.
    </p>
    <p>
     These summits alone, in the whitened waste, lifted their scraped crowns
    </p>
    <p>
     to the thickened skies. Edinburgh had become a city of the Frost King,
    </p>
    <p>
     and his slumbering legions bivouacked on and around it, except when
    </p>
    <p>
     aroused to riotous commotions by the sudden descent of the whistling
    </p>
    <p>
     armies of the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
     These details were rather incoherently reported, as the spring
    </p>
    <p>
     advanced, and an occasional survivor from the north made his way
    </p>
    <p>
     out of the beleaguered capital. When the spring had fairly ripened
    </p>
    <p>
     into summer, an energetic effort was made to reach Edinburgh, and it
    </p>
    <p>
     succeeded. Scotland at that time became inundated, and though the
    </p>
    <p>
     enormous accumulations of snow refused at once to surrender their
    </p>
    <p>
     blockade, they were so deeply broached and undermined that the North
    </p>
    <p>
     British line pushed a train forward to the edge of the city, though
    </p>
    <p>
     unable to reach its depot in the heart of the city, by reason of the
    </p>
    <p>
     hammered wedge of snow which it encountered under the Castle’s cliffs.
    </p>
    <p>
     After cutting their way out, to the Lothian Road, the explorers
    </p>
    <p>
     began investigations and were horror stricken to find that immense
    </p>
    <p>
     conflagration had broken out, destroying great sections of the city,
    </p>
    <p>
     which owed its partial survival to the masses of invading snow. These
    </p>
    <p>
     fires had started in the houses occupied by the domestic bandits, who
    </p>
    <p>
     had seized the finest residences, provisioned them from the stores,
    </p>
    <p>
     and surrendered themselves to an orgy of rapine and indulgence, by
    </p>
    <p>
     which their own fears were stifled, through the excesses of their
    </p>
    <p>
     drunken dissipation. Hundreds of these unfortunates had perished in
    </p>
    <p>
     the flames, their recklessness had invoked. The picture of the noble
    </p>
    <p>
     and beautiful city was shocking. The fires had made inroads upon the
    </p>
    <p>
     attractive Princes street, and in the portions west of the Caledonian
    </p>
    <p>
     station, towards the Donaldson hospital, gaping openings and swept
    </p>
    <p>
     acres revealed the unchecked fury of the flames. While it was probable
    </p>
    <p>
     that the city might, with a return of auspicious conditions resume
    </p>
    <p>
     some of its old beauty it was also too plain that the veto of Nature
    </p>
    <p>
     had been indelibly written across all such plans. Glaciers had already
    </p>
    <p>
     begun their formation in the Highlands, and the incipient development
    </p>
    <p>
     of an Ice Age was forcibly proclaimed on every hand. The logic of
    </p>
    <p>
     events was unanswerable. The United Kingdom throughout all its parts
    </p>
    <p>
     must participate again in the benighted life of Labrador and Siberia.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Europe throughout its borders felt the poignant exasperation of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Arctic goad. It trembled with a new apprehension. The touch of
    </p>
    <p>
     those icy fingers, stretched out in myriad lines of approach, swarming
    </p>
    <p>
     like wavering steel points in thick onslaught from the crowded skies,
    </p>
    <p>
     made it suddenly anxious. It corrected its habits, it took council of
    </p>
    <p>
     piety and played with beseeching care its pretty role of devotee. Its
    </p>
    <p>
     ridiculous and wicked society, with futile haste filled the churches,
    </p>
    <p>
     and tried to forget its inherited cruelty, and even turned with an
    </p>
    <p>
     unexpected solicitude to the consideration of improving, in some sure
    </p>
    <p>
     way, the state of the untitled majority. Its scientific men rushed into
    </p>
    <p>
     congresses and explored their text books, and read and reread hopeless
    </p>
    <p>
     papers on the _why_ and _how_ of it, but being unable to invent another
    </p>
    <p>
     Gulf Stream, retired into dismal prognostications of a returning Ice
    </p>
    <p>
     Age. In fact deluded, as scientific men often are, by language, they
    </p>
    <p>
     embraced the thought of a “returning Ice Cap,” which would successfully
    </p>
    <p>
     force its way from the Baltic to the Mediterranean. They nervously
    </p>
    <p>
     began measurements of the Alpine glaciers, took temperatures, wandered
    </p>
    <p>
     up in the higher regions of the atmosphere in balloons, sounded the
    </p>
    <p>
     floor of the ocean, established meteorological stations everywhere,
    </p>
    <p>
     and became so excited and convinced that they were happily on hand at
    </p>
    <p>
     a critical geological juncture, that they succeeded in supplying a
    </p>
    <p>
     technical ground for panic.
    </p>
    <p>
     The statesmen and economists were more useful. They estimated the
    </p>
    <p>
     results of any continued lowering of the temperatures, the effects
    </p>
    <p>
     of climatic alterations on life and production, especially in grain,
    </p>
    <p>
     and found that the southern countries of Europe were in some danger,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the northern countries very really threatened with a commercial
    </p>
    <p>
     overthrow, as England had been. They too turned to the colonies of
    </p>
    <p>
     their respective countries for refuge. It looked as if the bursting
    </p>
    <p>
     receptacles of European Culture were about to explode and scatter over
    </p>
    <p>
     the ends of the world the germinal seeds of its civilization.

    <p>
     ADDENDUM.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Histories leave oppressive legacies behind them. They may furnish
    </p>
    <p>
     subjects for art and literature and poetry, but, as in family
    </p>
    <p>
     inheritance, they burden posterity with considerable rubbish. Society
    </p>
    <p>
     does not quickly free itself from superstition, nor from its habits of
    </p>
    <p>
     thinking or of doing things. Even when they become anachronisms we are
    </p>
    <p>
     loathe to part from them, because, to our own detriment, we are fond of
    </p>
    <p>
     them. America has started fresh, and runs on the road of opportunity,
    </p>
    <p>
     while other nations must hobble and limp as best they can, with the
    </p>
    <p>
     clogs of old usage and prejudice hanging on their feet.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the voice of our friend Leacraft, and he was standing on a broad
    </p>
    <p>
     piazza built at the rear of a spacious villa on the topmost slopes
    </p>
    <p>
     of Staten Island, in the harbor of New York city, looking at the
    </p>
    <p>
     motionless ocean far beyond the fringe of land immediately before him,
    </p>
    <p>
     flushed by the setting sun. That luminary with glorious opulence had
    </p>
    <p>
     painted the sky a seething carmine in the west, and imparted its most
    </p>
    <p>
     delicate reminders of the morn to the eastern arches of the heavens,
    </p>
    <p>
     that hung above the sea. The picture was superbly satisfying. There
    </p>
    <p>
     was enough detail in the landscape, enough isolation of house and wood
    </p>
    <p>
     and field, of moor and strand, and not too much. The oncoming twilight
    </p>
    <p>
     softly blended these nearer things, yet left them palpable. But the day
    </p>
    <p>
     still flung its garlands of illumination over the broad skies; and the
    </p>
    <p>
     sensitive surfaces of the water with lavish sympathy repeated on its
    </p>
    <p>
     face the smiles of the blending zenith. And on either side of Leacraft
    </p>
    <p>
     stood Miss Tobit and Mr. Thomsen, and the month was June, and the year,
    </p>
    <p>
     narrated.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before we satisfy our curiosity more closely as to their relation, or
    </p>
    <p>
     note those changes which five years, however kindly inclined, must
    </p>
    <p>
     leave behind them, let us follow this conversation which of itself
    </p>
    <p>
     1915, five years after all the happenings previously may unroll some
    </p>
    <p>
     curtains of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well,” it was Thomsen who was now speaking, “then I suppose you are
    </p>
    <p>
     not willing to quarrel with the material revolution we have been
    </p>
    <p>
     through, because all that has come between the present and the past,
    </p>
    <p>
     like the sundering of Damocles’ sword, has saved us from the necessity
    </p>
    <p>
     of denuding ourselves of the old things, turning us loose in a fresh
    </p>
    <p>
     field, where we may play high jinks with all we once venerated, and
    </p>
    <p>
     where we may end by despising ourselves, for the very liberties you
    </p>
    <p>
     seem anxious for us to indulge in.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft motioned to the chairs, and the three sat down, in the
    </p>
    <p>
     same order as they stood. The place obviously was Leacraft’s, or he
    </p>
    <p>
     exercised some sort of control over it. And it was Miss Tobit’s voice
    </p>
    <p>
     which next took up the thread of talk--it was noticeable that Leacraft
    </p>
    <p>
     turned eagerly and looked at her, though his earnest face betrayed no
    </p>
    <p>
     symptoms of possession, in truth, a contemplative sadness for a moment
    </p>
    <p>
     rested on his features, vanishing even with its dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why give up old things? Why change and change and change? You call
    </p>
    <p>
     it progress. Is it anything but going around in a circle? You will
    </p>
    <p>
     come back to the very things you now reject, and some centuries hence
    </p>
    <p>
     the world will try the old experiments of Feudlism and Chivalry; and
    </p>
    <p>
     Kings by Divine Right will be as popular as elected Presidents--indeed,
    </p>
    <p>
     people may care some day as much as ever to say their prayers and go to
    </p>
    <p>
     church.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Both Leacraft and Thomsen laughed, but it was Leacraft who retorted,
    </p>
    <p>
     and he leaned far back in the Morris chair, his eyes bent upon the
    </p>
    <p>
     visionary ring of the horizon now webbed with bluescent shades.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think there will be no returns, Mrs. Thomsen”--Ah! then Leacraft had
    </p>
    <p>
     lost again--“no Merry-go-round; our path, the path of humanity, is on
    </p>
    <p>
     and on and on, not always straight, not always level, and never final
    </p>
    <p>
     in its destinations. It was a physical chasm that separated the first
    </p>
    <p>
     colonies of this land from Europe. They brought with them traditions,
    </p>
    <p>
     customs, though luckily not of a very silly sort--but the lack of
    </p>
    <p>
     continuity with the whole antecedent history of England practically
    </p>
    <p>
     destroyed that history for them, and they began in untrammelled freedom
    </p>
    <p>
     to think for themselves and determine the essence of manhood, of worth,
    </p>
    <p>
     of liberty, of faith, of brotherhood, and their thinking throve upon
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing so much as the contemplation of the as yet, humanly speaking,
    </p>
    <p>
     unused world about them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And the vicissitudes of living, the peril, the undiminished levy made
    </p>
    <p>
     by necessity upon their inventiveness, their industry, their courage,
    </p>
    <p>
     expelled the remaining vestiges of fealty to humbug, the pretense
    </p>
    <p>
     of class, the arrogance of office. They had wrested a living from
    </p>
    <p>
     Nature, under circumstances of unabashed familiarity with the cruelty
    </p>
    <p>
     of the savage, the obduracy of climate, and the grudging responses of
    </p>
    <p>
     a sterile soil, and they estimated worth by the hardihood of men who
    </p>
    <p>
     worked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “An American essayist has pointed out the emphasis laid by the
    </p>
    <p>
     northern, the Teutonic races, upon individual liberty. He says
    </p>
    <p>
     something like this: The Germanic race has been distinguished at
    </p>
    <p>
     all ages for its political capacity, and the possession of vigorous
    </p>
    <p>
     institutions of self-government; that there grew up among the nations
    </p>
    <p>
     of this race a well ordered system of government, based upon the right
    </p>
    <p>
     of the individual. And why was this? Because they knew of the hardships
    </p>
    <p>
     of living, and the fibre of liberty-loving natures were formed under
    </p>
    <p>
     the kneading strains of perpetual conflict. James McKinnon has pointed
    </p>
    <p>
     out the same thing in his History of Modern Liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Arbitrary and selfish rule was most quickly crushed in Central Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
     No! we shall not return to the old follies, because we shall not be
    </p>
    <p>
     permitted to return; because struggle with Nature will never cease.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Russia has been a cold country,” answered Thomsen; “and if the gauge
    </p>
    <p>
     of liberty is coldness, we should expect to have seen the fruits of
    </p>
    <p>
     popular government ripening, if you will permit the paradox, in its
    </p>
    <p>
     zero atmospheres; or if wildness and natural enemies--those that
    </p>
    <p>
     make housekeeping difficult, and a man’s skin a precious abode for
    </p>
    <p>
     his soul--why have not the negroes of Africa won over the images of
    </p>
    <p>
     rhetoric which have been wasted upon Greece and Rome--both, by-the-by,
    </p>
    <p>
     hot countries?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rome and Greece never knew what Liberty was in the modern sense. Both
    </p>
    <p>
     were types of class government. Before Christianity, there could be no
    </p>
    <p>
     ideal of freedom in its holiest meanings. As for Russia, the germs of
    </p>
    <p>
     liberty are yet buried there, but it is understood; an accident has put
    </p>
    <p>
     the autocracy in power, and like all beneficiaries of a system, its
    </p>
    <p>
     members fight for their living; besides, Russia has not left off its
    </p>
    <p>
     barbarism. But nothing under Heaven will keep her from being free. As
    </p>
    <p>
     to the negro, he lies too far back, too near to the origins, and, in
    </p>
    <p>
     any case, the dangers of the jungle are met by craft, rather than by
    </p>
    <p>
     consecutive exertion and daring.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You regret that our new growth in the Pacific--the Australian
    </p>
    <p>
     England--has not put on the features of a republic, instead of
    </p>
    <p>
     preserving the heritage of the kingly and royal class institutions
    </p>
    <p>
     under which the old England flourished. Do you think that nations can
    </p>
    <p>
     safely try experiments, like children playing games, or chemists mixing
    </p>
    <p>
     solutions, which, in the latter case, may at any moment blow their
    </p>
    <p>
     heads off? I think not.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think,” Leacraft slowly replied, while Agnes Ethel Tobit--she who
    </p>
    <p>
     had become inferentially the wife of the handsome Thomsen--arose and,
    </p>
    <p>
     walking to her husband’s side, leaned over the back of his chair,
    </p>
    <p>
     thus looking down upon the speaker, who had turned towards Thomsen,
    </p>
    <p>
     as if her movement was dictated by a desire to hear his friend more
    </p>
    <p>
     distinctly; “I think that the finest, the most inspiring--yes, the
    </p>
    <p>
     most delicate and subtle virtues flourish in a republic, such as
    </p>
    <p>
     this Republic of the United States is. I confess, I am in love with
    </p>
    <p>
     it; I love its people. They are superbly human, and humanly noble.
    </p>
    <p>
     The American gentleman, and he lives on no particular and restricted
    </p>
    <p>
     level--you find him among the firemen, the policemen, the clerks, the
    </p>
    <p>
     fathers of families--this unique man is always gracious, delightful,
    </p>
    <p>
     unerringly just. I believe that these traits develop most naturally
    </p>
    <p>
     under the dispensations of equality, reasonably understood. I think the
    </p>
    <p>
     most fruitful national life ensues, when a nation stands fundamentally,
    </p>
    <p>
     in its government, and in its social conceptions, for common sense
    </p>
    <p>
     standards, and an unqualified acceptance of the principles of personal
    </p>
    <p>
     freedom. I like these Americans. To me, their ardor, their naturalness,
    </p>
    <p>
     their hearty friendship, their generous self-forgetfulness, and a
    </p>
    <p>
     certain deferential amusement at the foibles of less emancipated
    </p>
    <p>
     cultures, is fascinating. Of course, there are stupid rich Americans,
    </p>
    <p>
     dressed in most obnoxious livery of affectation and imitation, men and
    </p>
    <p>
     women who have treacherous tendencies in their feelings and desires,
    </p>
    <p>
     willing always to kick their own country, and willing to leave it, but
    </p>
    <p>
     never willing to relinquish the luxuries its prosperity has enabled
    </p>
    <p>
     them to enjoy. There are also hateful middle-class Americans, who
    </p>
    <p>
     deteriorate the impressions made by the best aspects of the American
    </p>
    <p>
     heart and mind; but the substance and the spirit of the American
    </p>
    <p>
     life, however much disguised, or, from momentary and economic reasons
    </p>
    <p>
     obscured, is to me the most palatable; it is palpably the best life
    </p>
    <p>
     now shown on the world; it is the most energizing, the most alert, and
    </p>
    <p>
     it carries the power of enormous assimilation, because it is built on
    </p>
    <p>
     the essence of manhood, the respect for the rights of others. I know
    </p>
    <p>
     what is in your thoughts and on the point of your tongue. You would
    </p>
    <p>
     ask: How about the Chinaman, the Negro, and the Japanese, perhaps?
    </p>
    <p>
     That is a long question, and has nothing to do with my contention, for
    </p>
    <p>
     in a nutshell, respect for others’ rights does not involve respect
    </p>
    <p>
     for others’ habits, and generous as the Americans are, they are not
    </p>
    <p>
     so stupid as to wish to imperil, for an unnecessary sentiment, the
    </p>
    <p>
     hard-gained benefits of their own national experiment. They have
    </p>
    <p>
     already leavened the whole earth; it’s not to be expected that they
    </p>
    <p>
     digest all of its rubbish as well. Let the rest of the world do
    </p>
    <p>
     something for itself, and clean its own social sloughs, by a little
    </p>
    <p>
     more admixture of freedom and sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
     “All this may seem to you intensely disagreeable, perhaps a little
    </p>
    <p>
     disloyal, but you wrong me. If I might answer your question without
    </p>
    <p>
     more evasion. I would peremptorily declare that I hoped that the new
    </p>
    <p>
     England in Australia would put on the lineaments, nay, incorporate the
    </p>
    <p>
     very breath and body of this land. I know it has not; possibly it could
    </p>
    <p>
     not; possibly pernicious and selfish instrumentalities have made it
    </p>
    <p>
     impossible. Pardon my intractable enthusiasm, but do not mistrust my
    </p>
    <p>
     heart. It is always England’s. The night is too calm, too beautiful,
    </p>
    <p>
     to disgrace it with wrangling. Let us tell the story of the last years
    </p>
    <p>
     to each other. Mine is a short one, and can come last; but yours? Ah!
    </p>
    <p>
     well I know some of it,” and Leacraft, without constraint or any show
    </p>
    <p>
     of vacillating envy, smiled up in the face of the pretty woman who
    </p>
    <p>
     looked down at him, and deeply that woman’s heart honored him for his
    </p>
    <p>
     magnanimous courage.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a pause for an instant, and then Thomsen began. He rose from
    </p>
    <p>
     his chair, and walking to the railing of the piazza, sat on it, half
    </p>
    <p>
     turned to the paling East, half towards Leacraft, and told the story of
    </p>
    <p>
     the transplanted English nation.
    </p>
    <p>
     That story can be told in more exacting phraseology than the colloquial
    </p>
    <p>
     method permits, and until his narrative becomes more personal, let
    </p>
    <p>
     us authentically review the events he rehearsed, which form a unique
    </p>
    <p>
     historic episode.
    </p>
    <p>
     With the departure of the King from the shores of England, the actual
    </p>
    <p>
     evacuation of the island began, and the means and ways of transferring
    </p>
    <p>
     the people previously thought out, were carefully applied.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment the King and Parliament arrived in Australia, a predicament
    </p>
    <p>
     arose. The King was recognized as king, functional in Australia and in
    </p>
    <p>
     England, functional anywhere the English control was established; but
    </p>
    <p>
     the Parliament of England, as the highest law-giving legislature of
    </p>
    <p>
     the realm, did it supersede the regional legislation of Australia? Was
    </p>
    <p>
     the autonomic power of the provinces of Australia obliterated with the
    </p>
    <p>
     arrival of the supreme legislative body of the British Empire? There
    </p>
    <p>
     was one broad, obvious proposition. The remedy to all doubt, collision,
    </p>
    <p>
     and ambiguity was to resume in Australia the exact conditions which
    </p>
    <p>
     had vanished in England, and now naturally sought a restatement and
    </p>
    <p>
     erection in the land the King and Parliament had reached. And this was
    </p>
    <p>
     generally accepted. There was a cordial and almost precipitate display
    </p>
    <p>
     of adhesion to the new plan. It destroyed the independent existence
    </p>
    <p>
     of the various sections of Australia, and made the continental island
    </p>
    <p>
     a unit under the control of the Parliament, just as England had been.
    </p>
    <p>
     The enthusiasm which greeted this solution was adequate and convincing.
    </p>
    <p>
     It gave renewed hope to the patriotic and loyal souls who prayed and
    </p>
    <p>
     worked for the re-production of the England they had left. The King
    </p>
    <p>
     himself responded to this burst of practical allegiance with a wise
    </p>
    <p>
     and fervent expression of affection and thankfulness. It was a gem of
    </p>
    <p>
     deliberate composition, and was well received. Meetings of endorsement
    </p>
    <p>
     and proclamations of ratification were made everywhere, and in the
    </p>
    <p>
     tumult of acclamation it escaped notice that a formidable opposition
    </p>
    <p>
     had become organized for a forcible resistance to the whole scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was over-awed or suppressed, not without a show of force, in
    </p>
    <p>
     which Thomsen had been himself engaged, and which brought about some
    </p>
    <p>
     adventures around the region at Mount Harwick, in New South Wales.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thomsen, after the conclusion had been reached that his own and
    </p>
    <p>
     Miss Tobit’s families should follow the stream of people going to
    </p>
    <p>
     Australia, rather, than was at first intended, to coincide with
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft’s wishes for them all to visit America, had sought employment
    </p>
    <p>
     in the Government’s service, among those to whom had been entrusted
    </p>
    <p>
     the regulation of this colossal emigration. He was therefore well
    </p>
    <p>
     acquainted with its various phases and results.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the King and the Parliament left England, over two millions had
    </p>
    <p>
     preceded them, being naturally, those who accepted the situation,
    </p>
    <p>
     and who, besides, were not specifically limited for their support to
    </p>
    <p>
     investments at home. They went everywhere, many to the continent, many
    </p>
    <p>
     to India, perhaps half to America, which grew more and more, before
    </p>
    <p>
     the eyes of the people, as the most natural, most desirable, the
    </p>
    <p>
     most friendly home. A large number strayed to Africa, and yet others
    </p>
    <p>
     sought the expanding possibilities of South America. Englishmen had
    </p>
    <p>
     acquired such extended interests, drew so largely upon the resources
    </p>
    <p>
     of the entire world for their support, that now in a way they found
    </p>
    <p>
     natural business refuges all over its varied surface. It was a happy
    </p>
    <p>
     consequence of the constraining littleness of their own island.
    </p>
    <p>
     The financial question was the real difficulty, apart from the harsh
    </p>
    <p>
     bereavement and hardship of the divorce from all their previous living
    </p>
    <p>
     and associations. It was solved, at least partially, by the Government
    </p>
    <p>
     issuing paper money, similar to the greenbacks, which carried the
    </p>
    <p>
     United States through the Civil War. These were furnished to applicants
    </p>
    <p>
     upon deposit of sworn, approved and examined statements of their
    </p>
    <p>
     property of all kinds in England. Twenty-five per cent of the amount
    </p>
    <p>
     thus appearing was given, or rather loaned, to the applicant, and
    </p>
    <p>
     with this he was enabled to make a start in the new quarters he had
    </p>
    <p>
     selected. The plan involved the assumption of an enormous burden by the
    </p>
    <p>
     Government, and an unqualified confidence in it by the people.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, England was not in any sense to become a depopulated island.
    </p>
    <p>
     Its real estate values, though shrunk to slender fractions of their
    </p>
    <p>
     former worth, would yet have some value, and whereas, in the case of a
    </p>
    <p>
     manufacturer, the Government made the loan upon his attested resources
    </p>
    <p>
     in machinery and certified correspondence, the risk was reduced
    </p>
    <p>
     sensibly within discoverable limits. Loss, agitation, dislocations, in
    </p>
    <p>
     many cases ruin, resulted, but the transfer of the manufacturing plants
    </p>
    <p>
     was made most skilfully, and before the factories in England were
    </p>
    <p>
     closed, the same products were being produced in Australia. The menace
    </p>
    <p>
     of the emergency had startled Englishmen into a really reasonable
    </p>
    <p>
     and adequate show of sense, quickness and resource; usually poor
    </p>
    <p>
     business men, torpid and conservative, shackled with a kind of mild and
    </p>
    <p>
     traditional laziness, they became, under the stimulation of the danger
    </p>
    <p>
     of extinction, active and wary, and intensive.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the meanwhile the climatic changes continued, and the face of the
    </p>
    <p>
     United Kingdom more and more altered under the infliction of the long
    </p>
    <p>
     and tempestuous winters, the cool, shortened summers, and the ice
    </p>
    <p>
     blockade about its coasts. For it had early become apparent that in
    </p>
    <p>
     some inexplicable way, the Arctic currents streamed down from the polar
    </p>
    <p>
     regions with reinforced volume and velocity, bringing with them the
    </p>
    <p>
     discharged masses of ice projected from their usual course westward,
    </p>
    <p>
     by the irruption into the Arctic Ocean through Behring Straits of the
    </p>
    <p>
     united oceanic rivers of the Gulf Stream and the currents from the
    </p>
    <p>
     Yellow Sea. Throughout the spring, the beleaguered coasts were deeply
    </p>
    <p>
     fringed with ice-floes and icebergs, whose chilling emanations created
    </p>
    <p>
     fogs, and wrapt the islands in cheerless cold. Each passing year had
    </p>
    <p>
     made more clear the surpassing wisdom of the evacuation. But a large
    </p>
    <p>
     population found that they could support themselves on the island, made
    </p>
    <p>
     up of the hardy, enduring types, the sailors, fishermen, and the boreal
    </p>
    <p>
     agriculturists--the farmer who entertains life successfully where the
    </p>
    <p>
     earth reluctantly yields her products, and the scant nature furnishes
    </p>
    <p>
     but few of the products of the soil. For now a most extraordinary thing
    </p>
    <p>
     happened. The refrigeration of Northern Europe had driven down towards
    </p>
    <p>
     the south the northern denizens. They eagerly seized the deserted land
    </p>
    <p>
     of the southerners, less accustomed to the niggardly responses of the
    </p>
    <p>
     field, and met the attacks of the climate with the accustomed patience
    </p>
    <p>
     and resistance to which they had become innured in their northern home.
    </p>
    <p>
     In this way the population of Iceland almost bodily left the bleak
    </p>
    <p>
     and ice-bound coasts of the Arctic island, that no longer offered the
    </p>
    <p>
     meagre semblance even of subsistence, which previously maintained its
    </p>
    <p>
     stubbornly hardy occupants. Nothing could have been more fortunate,
    </p>
    <p>
     as it retarded in some measure the shocking decline in the values of
    </p>
    <p>
     the land, and gave to all establishments that might otherwise have
    </p>
    <p>
     been turned into homes for owls and foxes a partial usefulness. Not
    </p>
    <p>
     indeed that the manufacturing interests would be considerably revived,
    </p>
    <p>
     but warehouses and buildings connected with manufacturing or shipping
    </p>
    <p>
     business would be made into storehouses, and the castles and large
    </p>
    <p>
     manor houses were converted into curious communal colonies, where
    </p>
    <p>
     those boreal people most joyfully repaired and developed profitable
    </p>
    <p>
     communities.
    </p>
    <p>
     Large numbers of the very poor found in the exodus of the well paid or
    </p>
    <p>
     employed classes above them, a grand chance to renew their own luck.
    </p>
    <p>
     They became keepers of the deserted buildings; they fraternized with
    </p>
    <p>
     the newcomers, and freed from the incubus of a superimposed social
    </p>
    <p>
     repression, became happy and industrious.
    </p>
    <p>
     To all the brands and grades of the surviving or deserted inhabitants
    </p>
    <p>
     came increasing numbers of Scandinavians; important fractions of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Scotch settled on the coasts of England, and even immigrants from
    </p>
    <p>
     Newfoundland and Canada were tempted to seize the strange opportunity
    </p>
    <p>
     to occupy vast and abandoned cities, which furnished them in many
    </p>
    <p>
     instances with palatial shelters, but which later became repellant
    </p>
    <p>
     and unpleasant abodes, from which they too willingly withdrew to the
    </p>
    <p>
     smaller settlements.
    </p>
    <p>
     The tragedy of the big cities was complete. They were melancholy
    </p>
    <p>
     wastes, their empty streets seemed baleful and dismal. They gave
    </p>
    <p>
     ghostly thrills of terror, even in the noon-day, to the passers
    </p>
    <p>
     by--silent graves of past memories--the speechless, vacant, staring
    </p>
    <p>
     windows in the unlit rooms were like the open but expressionless
    </p>
    <p>
     eyes of corpses, and the awful fall of silence through the labyrinth
    </p>
    <p>
     of ways, roads, lanes, places, squares, alleys, descended upon the
    </p>
    <p>
     wanderer, caught by some malign trick of adventure within their
    </p>
    <p>
     voiceless, motionless depths, with the benumbing touch of the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
     He hastened his steps; he ran to escape the deadly stupor, the
    </p>
    <p>
     inexpressible gloom of loneliness, where every aspect betokened life.
    </p>
    <p>
     The solitude of nature inspires, draws to the lips an involuntary
    </p>
    <p>
     prayer, or places in the heart the movements of hope, but this hideous
    </p>
    <p>
     contradiction of signs and effect weighed like lead upon the spirit,
    </p>
    <p>
     and forced from the shrinking heart the ejaculations of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Never on earth was there such a picture of dejected grandeur, as this
    </p>
    <p>
     emptied metropolis of the world presented; never before had a great
    </p>
    <p>
     city become its own tomb, through the flight of its inhabitants; never
    </p>
    <p>
     in any record of disaster, whether by earthquake, pestilence, flood or
    </p>
    <p>
     vulcanism, was there such obliteration as followed the withdrawal of
    </p>
    <p>
     the citizens of London from their own capital.
    </p>
    <p>
     The thick blanket of the snow was thrown over it in winter, and its
    </p>
    <p>
     emergent domes, pinnacles, obelisks and needles offered a fantastic
    </p>
    <p>
     similitude to mortuary monuments, or else beneath the yellow moon its
    </p>
    <p>
     piercing whiteness, like a titanic face of someone killed, smote the
    </p>
    <p>
     blue black skies above it with remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
     But in Australia the English strength revived and broadened; it
    </p>
    <p>
     promised to make a gigantic social revolution; it worked strangely
    </p>
    <p>
     enough in unison with the newly awakened hopes of the King to restore
    </p>
    <p>
     an accustomed prestige to the Crown. This political phenomenon
    </p>
    <p>
     attracted the attention of the civilized world. The King in a most
    </p>
    <p>
     adroit proclamation to the people had peculiarly enlisted their
    </p>
    <p>
     sympathy by his veiled complaint of the habitual loss of power, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the encroachments upon the kingly prerogatives of the self-constituted
    </p>
    <p>
     Cabinet of Ministers. The King’s action was always tacitly prescribed
    </p>
    <p>
     and anticipated. He was a puppet, dressed in regalia, with no shadow
    </p>
    <p>
     of power, real and personal. And this he resented, but his language
    </p>
    <p>
     was the sentences of diplomacy, and lost the individual note entirely
    </p>
    <p>
     in a concerned and measured argument, restrained by every possible
    </p>
    <p>
     regard for the present custom, urging a greater confidence in the
    </p>
    <p>
     King’s wishes, and a larger precinct of action for his judgment. This
    </p>
    <p>
     momentous promulgation was contemptuously referred to by its critics
    </p>
    <p>
     as “the Ourselves” letter, but it met a favorable reception and it
    </p>
    <p>
     enlisted the cordial endorsement of the House of Lords, nor was it
    </p>
    <p>
     altogether resented by the House of Commons. The achievement of this
    </p>
    <p>
     success led the King into a further step of interference, in the
    </p>
    <p>
     appointments and in the personnel of the Cabinet, and he succeeded
    </p>
    <p>
     further in impressing his wishes upon a number of important bills
    </p>
    <p>
     passing through the Parliament. In short, by a persistent pressure,
    </p>
    <p>
     seconded by friends among the people, and a growing following in the
    </p>
    <p>
     legislature, he had inserted his views, and extorted from the grudging
    </p>
    <p>
     concessions of the Commons’ recognition of the royal prerogatives.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had shown himself unusually active in resource, in suggestions,
    </p>
    <p>
     and in intercourse with the people. His examples had been followed
    </p>
    <p>
     with enthusiasm by the nobility, who, so to speak, spread themselves
    </p>
    <p>
     before the observation of the nation, and exerted an unaccustomed
    </p>
    <p>
     generosity and ubiquitous energy in practically assisting the work of
    </p>
    <p>
     rehabilitation. At a general election, many candidates were discussed
    </p>
    <p>
     and elected upon this issue, viz.: the restoration to the King of
    </p>
    <p>
     kingly power.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And so, you see,” Thomsen concluded, “the unexpected happens, as it
    </p>
    <p>
     always does. We moved to an ultra-democratic _milieu_, a veritable
    </p>
    <p>
     nest of fads and socialistic temerities and experiments, and lo! the
    </p>
    <p>
     reaction sets in, and in Australia the King may recover the power, lost
    </p>
    <p>
     with the Stuarts, and the monarchial principle gets a shove ahead,
    </p>
    <p>
     which, with prosperity, and in England, no impulse short of the fiat
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Almighty, could have secured for it. A prophet who would have
    </p>
    <p>
     foretold that, would have scored a poor success in 1900 as a state
    </p>
    <p>
     maker.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Before he had finished speaking, Leacraft had left his chair, and was
    </p>
    <p>
     walking to and fro near the speaker--and then he advanced to the edge
    </p>
    <p>
     of the few steps that led from the piazza to the open swards beneath
    </p>
    <p>
     them, which were fringed by an emergent crown of trees growing thickly
    </p>
    <p>
     in some lower crease or hollow of the ground, beyond which again the
    </p>
    <p>
     eye fell to the foot swells, and the undulations of land far off, in
    </p>
    <p>
     the flats, just beginning to twinkle with lights.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft spoke slowly, his eyes still fixed upon the distance, as if in
    </p>
    <p>
     revery, but his measured words came clearly to his two friends, carried
    </p>
    <p>
     by a voice which, always melodious and cultured, now gained a sort of
    </p>
    <p>
     passionate yearning, and then again was approved as disinterestedly
    </p>
    <p>
     clean and judicial: “All this is an episode. Nothing more. The future
    </p>
    <p>
     of the races of the world means the widening scope of the Republican
    </p>
    <p>
     idea. There can be no other. Education forbids its extinction. Yes,
    </p>
    <p>
     and Authority endorses it. This sudden foolishness in Australia will
    </p>
    <p>
     only invoke a perilous reaction. There can be to-day in governmental
    </p>
    <p>
     systems only varied applications of the one thought; the rule of the
    </p>
    <p>
     people through an appeal to the people’s choice of rulers. It is
    </p>
    <p>
     fundamentally common sense in an era of enlightenment, to begin with;
    </p>
    <p>
     but since the United States have eclipsed all nations, and raised the
    </p>
    <p>
     standards of individual action beyond all previous estimates, this
    </p>
    <p>
     conclusion has coercively been accepted, that through the influences
    </p>
    <p>
     propagated under this popular freedom of control, the finest, the
    </p>
    <p>
     richest, the sweetest, the most magnanimous types of character are also
    </p>
    <p>
     engendered and completed. A kind of psychological logic is involved.
    </p>
    <p>
     A vast psychic power of selection sets in, and irrevocably the most
    </p>
    <p>
     noble, the most disenthralled natures slowly appear. In comparison
    </p>
    <p>
     with their best results, the representatives of other cultures appear
    </p>
    <p>
     dwindling and abortive. And why? Because in the least limited field of
    </p>
    <p>
     opportunity the unrestrained power of nature to make character must
    </p>
    <p>
     of necessity evolve consummate and supreme examples. Nothing is more
    </p>
    <p>
     demonstrable. It must be conceded, I grant, that at first the crop of
    </p>
    <p>
     temperaments is marked more by rash hardihood, strident vulgarities,
    </p>
    <p>
     and climbing audacity, but these very qualities, which in the naming
    </p>
    <p>
     seem so distasteful, mature naturally, in later generations, into
    </p>
    <p>
     devoted courage, æsthetic spontaneity; juices of the fruit when green
    </p>
    <p>
     form the basis of its later richness.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know the tiresome and hackneyed nonsense, and the mean-spirited
    </p>
    <p>
     sneers of the European at the American, for his lack of culture,
    </p>
    <p>
     his defect in polish, his money-getting haste. And it’s all a lie!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Leacraft wheeled round as if on a pivot, and even in the pale light the
    </p>
    <p>
     Thomsens could see that his face flushed, and the stern decision of his
    </p>
    <p>
     voice betrayed the fires of resentment. “Who is it that these precious
    </p>
    <p>
     pretenders of Europe look to when they have famine and disaster; who
    </p>
    <p>
     has taught the lessons of sympathy, of open-hearted helpfulness, and
    </p>
    <p>
     unswerving generosity, or made them recognize in their own natures the
    </p>
    <p>
     almost exterminated seeds of kindness? As to culture, let me tell you
    </p>
    <p>
     in all seriousness that the idle glamour of a scholar’s diction does
    </p>
    <p>
     not weigh a barleycorn as against the flashing splendor of an honest
    </p>
    <p>
     and sincere spirit; as to polish, who made the European regard Woman as
    </p>
    <p>
     something better than the helpless ally of his lust, and the chained
    </p>
    <p>
     companion to his exultant vanity? Woman has gained a new empire of
    </p>
    <p>
     dignity in these new lands; she for once triumphs in the unquenched
    </p>
    <p>
     assertion of her rights. As to money-making greed, where under the
    </p>
    <p>
     canopy will you find a more meanly mercenary race than these same
    </p>
    <p>
     Europeans, inert panderers to pleasure for money, fortune hunters, and
    </p>
    <p>
     silent spectators of atrocities, if the risk of money loss stops their
    </p>
    <p>
     way to succor. I know the dolts and traitors on the American soil,
    </p>
    <p>
     the men and women who sell their birthright for the mess of pottage
    </p>
    <p>
     contained in a gilded name in Europe, or the hollow mockery of a
    </p>
    <p>
     coat-of-arms. These are the tattooed children of humbug--careless and
    </p>
    <p>
     ungrateful, indolent and self-seeking, lured by that strange beauty
    </p>
    <p>
     which Europe, for some inscrutable reason, seems to keep, and of which
    </p>
    <p>
     even I, an Englishman, feel jealous, for the sake of a country which
    </p>
    <p>
     may not be so good-looking, but which becomes every day more sublimely
    </p>
    <p>
     the appointed pattern of the future state. Well! my friends, you must
    </p>
    <p>
     pardon these ‘wild and whirling words.’ They may strike you as an
    </p>
    <p>
     unseemly tirade, but if you knew this land as well as I do, you, too,
    </p>
    <p>
     might trespass beyond the limits of moderation in its defense. But
    </p>
    <p>
     other matters have for you a less doubtful interest. The great physical
    </p>
    <p>
     revolution which has left its mark no less in the political world
    </p>
    <p>
     than in the material, has become consolidated and solidified into a
    </p>
    <p>
     permanent feature of the earth. The broad engulfment of the land at the
    </p>
    <p>
     isthmus has established an open way to the Pacific from the Atlantic,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the initial formation of the barrier northward from the Caribbean
    </p>
    <p>
     Sea by the erection of a ridge from Cuba to Yucatan, and partially from
    </p>
    <p>
     Jamaica to Honduras, this latter connexion the singular sequel to the
    </p>
    <p>
     disturbance which overwhelmed Kingston in 1907, has advanced far enough
    </p>
    <p>
     to effectually assist the momentous deflection of the Gulf Stream from
    </p>
    <p>
     the Atlantic. And another transformation has thereby been achieved.
    </p>
    <p>
     The alien mass of hot water pouring into the Pacific at the isthmus,
    </p>
    <p>
     when no longer propelled by the easterly winds, resumes its original
    </p>
    <p>
     impetus of rotary direction, and streams, sweeping northward, along the
    </p>
    <p>
     coasts of California, Oregon and Washington, bringing in its further
    </p>
    <p>
     extension warmth to British America and Alaska. By this amelioration
    </p>
    <p>
     of its climate, Alaska has specially profited. Its numerous mineral
    </p>
    <p>
     resources have been more exhaustively explored, and the wealth of its
    </p>
    <p>
     boundless areas promises returns beyond the wildest dreams of avarice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The convulsions which were so dismally foretold, in the social and
    </p>
    <p>
     political fabric of this country, never occurred. They were quite
    </p>
    <p>
     lost sight of in the wonderful happenings of the world, and the trite
    </p>
    <p>
     aphorism that the spirit of discontent is best overcome by an appeal
    </p>
    <p>
     to the spirit of curiosity, obtained an almost ludicrous illustration
    </p>
    <p>
     in the subsidence of every murmur of schism and contention, as the
    </p>
    <p>
     amazement grew over the upset of the temporalities of the world, as
    </p>
    <p>
     the earth readjusted its members for another, let us hope, long and
    </p>
    <p>
     uneventful slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
     “For myself, perhaps I should deprecate your censure by an apology.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is true, I did not follow the fortunes of my country, though with
    </p>
    <p>
     my mind I ardently canvassed and considered them. The very interests
    </p>
    <p>
     which brought me to this land were English, and my superintendence
    </p>
    <p>
     and success with them, has in a few ways made the survival of not
    </p>
    <p>
     a few Englishmen possible at this crisis. Really, my best place of
    </p>
    <p>
     helpfulness was here. Jim has been with me, and has proved invaluable,
    </p>
    <p>
     and that poor woman, whom I told you about meeting in Victoria Park,
    </p>
    <p>
     the night before we saw the great procession of evacuation, was found
    </p>
    <p>
     by me, and now Jim is her husband. There’s nothing shocking about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her first husband died of consumption. It was a foregone conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jim showed himself a big-hearted friend, and the girl learned to think
    </p>
    <p>
     the world of him. And when she was alone, what could have been better
    </p>
    <p>
     from any point of view than that she should have married him?
    </p>
    <p>
     “And for me, Mrs. Thomsen, there is peace, too.” Leacraft moved to the
    </p>
    <p>
     doorway of the broad hall that divided the spacious house. He pushed
    </p>
    <p>
     it open, and as the light from the interior fell upon his face, the
    </p>
    <p>
     visitors saw the smile of an abiding happiness upon the thoughtful
    </p>
    <p>
     countenance, and Agnes Ethel Thomsen utter a prayer of thankfulness
    </p>
    <p>
     that _he_ had found contentment.

     Transcriber’s note:

    <p>
     Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made consistent when a

    <p>
     predominant preference was found in the original book.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many, but by no means all, simple typographical errors were corrected.
    </p>
    <p>
     Unpaired quotation marks were remedied when the change was obvious,
    </p>
    <p>
     and otherwise left unpaired.

    </p>
    <p>
     things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
    </p>
    <p>
     even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
    </p>
    <p>
     paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
    </p>
    <p>
     Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

    <p>
     works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
    </p>
    <p>
     States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the

     United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
    </p>
    <p>
     claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,

    </p>
    <p>
     you share it without charge with others.

    </p>
    <p>
     Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the

    <p>
     assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
    </p>
    <p>
     goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
    </p>
    <p>
     remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
    </p>
    <p>
     Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
    </p>
    <p>
     and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future

    <p>
     Literary Archive Foundation
    </p>
    <p>
     Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
    </p>
    <p>
     spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
    </p>
    <p>
     increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
    </p>
    <p>
     freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
    </p>
    <p>
     array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
    </p>
    <p>
     ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
    </p>
    <p>
     status with the IRS.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
    </p>
    <p>
     charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
    </p>
    <p>
     States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
    </p>
    <p>
     considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
    </p>
    <p>
     with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
    </p>
    <p>
     where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
    </p>
    <p>
     DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
    </p>
    <p>
     state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate
    </p>
    <p>
     While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
    </p>
    <p>
     have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
    </p>
    <p>
     against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
    </p>
    <p>
     approach us with offers to donate.
    </p>
    <p>
     International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
    </p>
    <p>
     any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
    </p>
    <p>
     outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

    <p>
     Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation

     Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.
    </p>
    <p>
     Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
    </p>
    <p>
     Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
    </p>
    <p>
     freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
    </p>
    <p>
     distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
    </p>
    <p>
     volunteer support.
    </p>
    <p>
     Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
    </p>
    <p>
     editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
    </p>
    <p>
     the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
    </p>
    <p>
     necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
    </p>
    <p>
     edition.
    </p>
