     Alexander Leacraft was regarding with as much interest as his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1110">
     constitutional lassitude permitted, the progress of a distinctly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1120">
     audible altercation on Pennsylvania avenue, Washington, D. C. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1130">
     disputants had not felt it necessary, under the relaxing influences
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1140">
     of a premature spring, to interpose any screen of secrecy, such as a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1150">
     less exposed position, or subdued voices, between themselves and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1160">
     news-mongering (and hungering, let it be added) proletariat of our
    </p>

     nation’s capital.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1190">
     A small crowd, composed of the singular human compound always
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1200">
     pervasive and never to be avoided in Washington, which, in that centre
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1210">
     of political sensations, is made up of street loafers, accidental
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1220">
     tourists, perambulating babies, “niggers,” and presumptive statesmen,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1230">
     enclosed this “argument”; and from his elevated station, within the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1240">
     front parlor of the McKinley, Mr. Leacraft was afforded a very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1250">
     excellent view of and an equally distinct hearing of the disagreement
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1260">
     and its principals.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1280">
     The two disputants were themselves sufficiently contrasted in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1290">
     appearance to have allured the casual passer-by to observe their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1300">
     contrasted methods in debate. One--the taller--was a thin, angular
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1310">
     man with unnaturally long arms, a peculiar swaying habit of body, an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1320">
     elongated visage, terminating in a short, stubby growth of whiskers,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1330">
     and a sharp, crackling kind of voice, with unmistakable nasal faults.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1340">
     He seemed to be a southern man modified by a few imitations of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1350">
     northern type.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1370">
     He was addressing a bulky, rather disdainful man in a checquered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1380">
     suit of clothes, who had advanced the season’s fashion by assuming a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1390">
     straw hat, and whose rosy face, broad and typical features, and yet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1400">
     not plethoric expansion of body, strong and stalwart frame betokened
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1410">
     much animal force, and reserved power of action. He might have been a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1420">
     northern man. As Alexander Leacraft looked at them, it was the southern
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1430">
     man who was speaking, and his uplifted arm, at regular intervals, rose
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1440">
     and fell, as the palms of both hands met in a cadence of corroborative
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1450">
     whacks. It may interest the reader to know that the particular time of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1460">
     this particular incident was April, 1909.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1480">
     “Let me tell you this, Mr. Tompkins,” drawled the southerner with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1490">
     loquacious ease, the crackle and sharpness of his intonation appearing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1500">
     as his excitement increased, “the necessities of our states demand
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1510">
     the Canal at whatever cost. It will be the avenue for an export trade
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1520">
     to the east, which will convert our stored powers of production into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1530">
     gold, and it will react upon the whole country north and south in a way
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1540">
     that will make all previous prosperity look like nothing. Our cotton
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1550">
     mills have grown, our mineral resources have been developed; Georgia
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1560">
     and Alabama are to-day competing with your shaft furnaces and steel
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1570">
     mills for the trade of the railroads, and builders; and for that matter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1580">
     we are building ourselves. We can support a population ten times all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1590">
     we have to-day; our resources have been just broached, but exhaustion
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1600">
     is a thousand years away. Our rival has been Cuba. She has robbed us
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1610">
     of trade; she has put our sugar plantations out of business; even
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1620">
     her iron, which I will admit is superior in quality, has scaled our
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1630">
     profits on raw ingots, but she can’t hold us down on cotton. Open up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1640">
     this canal, and we will gather the riches of the Orient; our ships will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1650">
     fill it with unbroken processions, and in the train of that commerce
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1660">
     in cotton, every section of the Union will furnish its contribution to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1670">
     swell the argosies of trade. I tell you sir” and the excited speaker,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1680">
     conscious of an admiring sympathy in the crowd around him, raised his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1690">
     voice into a musical shout, in which the crackle was quite lost, “the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1700">
     commerce, the mercantile integrity of these United States will be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1710">
     restored, and American bottoms for American goods will be no longer a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1720">
     vain aspiration; it will be a realized dream, an actual fact.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1740">
     He paused, as if the projectile force of his words had deprived him of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1750">
     breath, and then at the momentary opportunity Mr. Tompkins, in a clear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1760">
     and metallic voice, with a punctuative force of occasional hesitation,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1770">
     undertook his friend’s refutation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1790">
     “I’m not contesting the fact, Mr. Snowden,” he said, “that the opening
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1800">
     of the Canal means a good deal to your portion of the country. Does it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1810">
     mean as much to the rest of the country, and does it mean so much to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1820">
     you for a long time. You mention cotton. Do you know that the cotton
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1830">
     cultivation of India and Egypt has increased enormously, and that it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1840">
     is grown with cheaper labor than you can command. You have made the

     have thrust him into a hundred avenues of occupation and every one of

     his new avocations adds a shilling a day to the worth per man of the

     remainder, who stick to field work and cultivate your cotton fields.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1890">
     The cotton of Egypt and the cotton of India, I mean its manufactured
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1900">
     forms, will go through that canal to Asia and Japan and Polynesia just
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1910">
     as surely as yours will, and it’ll go cheaper. It is poorer cotton, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1920">
     know, but that will not effect the result.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1940">
     “That isn’t all. Brazil and the Argentine Republic are growing cotton,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_1950">
     and they are doing well at it. Europe will take the raw stuff from them

     only important opponents of his election, and their surprising record
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_3690">
     made the prophetic warnings, which had convinced Roosevelt of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_3700">
     necessity of his candidacy, appear like a veritable intervention of

     Providence, at least this was the language commonly used with reference

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_3740">
     Roosevelt had displayed remarkable self-control and consistent gravity,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_3750">
     and had even, in a very extraordinary address at his inauguration,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_3760">
     deprecated the unanimity of his election. He deplored the precarious

     dilemma of a country which found itself forced to do violence to its
    </p>

     traditions in order to escape an imagined danger.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_3800">
     Almost synchronous with his re-election, the announcement had been made
    </p>

     and exhortation, was advancing very rapidly, engineering difficulties
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_3840">
     unexpectedly had vanished, a system of extreme precision in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_3850">
     control of the work, itself largely the device of the President, had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_3860">
     facilitated the entire operation, and a promise of still more rapid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_3870">
     progress was made.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_3890">
     This promise had produced a storm of southern enthusiasm. The south,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_3900">
     completely restored in its financial autonomy, had been growing richer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_3910">
     and richer, and their public men had not hesitated to paint, in the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4000">
     in which the unmistakable notes of designs almost criminal had been

     detected. Mr. Tompkins, whose altercation with the southerner had led

     agent, in the employ of this cabal.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4050">
     Alexander Leacraft was an Englishman, inheriting an English temperament
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4060">
     without English prejudices; he was fortunately free from the worst
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4070">
     faults of that insular hesitancy which imparts the curious impression
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4080">
     of timidity, and had advanced far enough in cosmopolitan observation to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4090">
     get rid of the queerness of provincial ignorance. He was indeed a sane
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4100">
     and attractive man, and provided by nature with a forcible physique,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4110">
     a good face, and a really fascinating proclivity to make the best of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4120">
     things, admire his companions, and bend unremittingly to the pressure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4130">
     of his environment.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4150">
     He had not escaped the dangers incident to youth, and his heart had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4160">
     become attached to a lady of Baltimore--one of the undeviatingly arch
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4170">
     and winning American girls--to whom he had been introduced by her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4180">
     brother, a commercial correspondent.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4200">
     The nature of his affairs--he was the secretary of an English company
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4210">
     which operated some copper mines in Arizona and Canada--had made him a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4220">
     frequent visitor to the shores of the New World, and he had not been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4230">
     unwilling to express his hope that the United States would become his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4240">
     final home. These sentiments were quite honest, though it might have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4250">
     elicited the cynical observation that the capture of his affections by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4260">
     Miss Garrett had done more to weaken his loyalty to the crown than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4270">
     any dispassionate admiration of a Republican form of government. But
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4280">
     the imputation would have been malicious. Leacraft did feel an earnest
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4290">
     admiration for the American people, and yielded a genial acquiescence
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4300">
     to the claims of popular suffrage. His connexion with America had been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4310">
     fortunate, and he had come in contact with men and women whose natures
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4320">
     by endowment, and whose manners and habits, conversation and tastes, by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4330">
     inheritance and cultivation, were elevating and engaging--men and women
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4340">
     whose nobility of sympathy with all things human was reflected in an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4350">
     art of living not only always decorous and refined, but guided, too, by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4360">
     the principles of urbanity and justice.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4380">
     The Garretts of Baltimore were a widely connected, and in numbers an

     imposing social element, and none of the various daughters of light

     Her graces of manner were not less delightful than her conversation
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4430">
     was spirited and roguish, and her assumption of a demure simplicity
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4440">
     had often driven Alexander Leacraft to the limits of his English

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4500">
     her patient suitor, disingenuously concealed. Sally really enjoyed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4510">
     the painstaking gravity with which the young Englishman explained the
    </p>

     eternal principles of English rule, and the never-to-be-forgotten

     Mr. Leacraft had met Sally under circumstances the most provocative of

     urgency of an American’s deference to the best instincts of courtesy,
    </p>

     did not altogether mitigate her coquetry and mirthful affectations,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4590">
     and even, by the faintest gloss of repression, made them the more
    </p>

     delicious. The Englishman was bewitched, and his infatuation declared
    </p>

     itself so plainly that Sally--whose heart was quite untouched by his

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4670">
     visit to the Garretts at Baltimore, and he had quite firmly resolved
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4680">
     that he would reveal his desperate extremity to Sally, and plead his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4690">
     best to show her how empty life would be to him without her, and that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4700">
     it would be shockingly obdurate in her to decline to regard him as the
    </p>

     goal of her marital ambitions.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4730">
     He felt some fear of her revolting gayety, and his fears were not

     assuaged by the remembrance of any particular occasion when her conduct
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4750">
     towards him permitted him to indulge in hopes. Still the thing must
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4760">
     be done. His unrest must be quieted. To know the worst was better
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4770">
     than this feverish anxiety of doubt. And besides, with a prudence not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4780">
     altogether British, he thought he could endure repulse better now than
    </p>

     later, and in the event of that evil alternative, he could cast about
    </p>

     him for alleviating resources which might be more easily found now,

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_4890">
     It read:

     worth remembering besides. Write to the house, and I will get your

     Edward T. Garrett.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5080">
     Leacraft put down the letter slowly. He was disappointed. A summons to

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5090">
     the west, to the mines in Arizona, had reached him just the day before,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5100">
     and he must get out there before a week was over. He had thought to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5110">
     have finished this affair first, and to find in the tiresome trip
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5120">
     distraction, if Sally was unfavorable to his appeal, or unexpected
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5130">
     interest if he succeeded in winning her assent. Still he could readily
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5140">
     accept the invitation. He would be back in May, and, perhaps after all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5150">
     the occasion might be more favorable. Sally softened into a little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5160">
     sympathetic humor by her visit to her sick aunt, and he strengthened
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5170">
     by the encouraging reflexion of having successfully dissipated the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5180">
     little cloud of misunderstanding, or worse, at the mines, might produce
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5190">
     conditions psychologically adequate to bring about his victory.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5210">
     He stepped to the window. The view from it was always pleasing, at

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5220">
     this moment in the descending shades of the closing day and with the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5240">
     an ineffable loveliness. The great white spectre of the Washington

     monument, immaterialized and faintly roseate against the softly flaming

     skies, and brooding genius-like above the trees of the Reservation was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5270">
     always there, and that night it assumed the strangely deceptive but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5280">
     fascinating vagary of an exhalation, as if built up from the emanations
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5290">
     of the earth, and the vapors of the air, remaining immobile in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5300">
     still ether as a portent or a promise. The man’s face grew clouded as

     the fairy obelisk faded, and with the enveloping darkness became again
    </p>

     discernible as a dull and stony pile.
    </p>

     That evening Leacraft felt particularly restless and detached. He

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5350">
     felt the need of entertainment, and of entertainment of a sort that
    </p>

     in reasonings and the intricacies of argument. The few theatrical

     House, when he met Dr. M--, the most amiable and accomplished editor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5550">
     of the National Museum, and one of those multi-facetted gentlemen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5560">
     who respond to every scientific thrill around them, and hold in the

     labelled and accessible, of the world. Leacraft knew the Doctor; had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5590">
     indeed consulted him upon a chemical reaction, in the elimination of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5600">
     cadmium from zinc. The Doctor, with genial fervor, grasped his hand,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5610">
     persuasively put his own disengaged hand on Leacraft’s back, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5620">
     dexterously turned him around with the observation: “You are going the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5680">
     Leacraft jumped with pleasure, if an Englishman may be said ever

     to respond so animatedly to a welcome alternative. This met his

     “It is curious,” resumed Dr. M--, as they directed their steps

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5760">
     towards the umbrageous solitudes of the Reservation, “how inevitably

     In the spring of 1906 a destructive outbreak of Vesuvius occurred,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5800">
     and much of the ensuing loss of life might have been prevented by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5810">
     reliance upon scientific warnings. Indeed, the loss of life on this

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5870">
     flanks of that querulous protuberance. But it can hardly be expected,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5880">
     I suppose, that large populations can effect a change in habitation as

     long as the dangers that threaten them occur at long intervals, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5900">
     human fatality of unreasoning trust in luck remains unchanged. Take

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5960">
     “I suppose,” queried Leacraft, “that we are to be informed to-night
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_5970">
     whether the Canal from the scientific point of view is a safe

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6000">
     “Perhaps,” doubtfully returned the doctor. “You see, it’s this way. In

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6010">
     the spring of the year that saw the outpouring of lava that invaded
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6020">
     the villages of southern Italy, San Francisco suffered from a serious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6030">
     earthquake that ruptured the public structures of the city, dislocated
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6040">
     miles of railroad tracks, ruined the beautiful Stanford University,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6050">
     shook out the fronts of buildings, and precipitated a fire that all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6060">
     but wiped out the Queen City of the Pacific coast. It has been feared
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6070">
     that some such seismic terror might demolish the superb structures of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6080">
     the canal, and we are to learn to-night whether these earth movements
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6090">
     threaten the new waterway at the isthmus.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6110">
     “I have reason to believe,” rejoined Leacraft, “that this canal has
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6120">
     been itself a source of political disturbance, and that it is likely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6130">
     to effect convulsions in your body politic as dangerous in a social way
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6140">
     as those which brought about the financial and physical upset at San

     Francisco.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6170">
     “Don’t worry on that score,” replied his companion. “I can tell you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6180">
     that the political texture of this country is not to be worn to a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6190">
     frazzle by any collision of interests. Such things adjust themselves,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6200">
     and the way out only means a new entrance to brighter prospects and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6210">
     bigger undertakings. Yes, I guess someone will be hurt, but individuals
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6220">
     don’t count if the whole people are benefited.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6240">
     “Still,” remonstrated Leacraft, “the people is made up of individuals,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6250">
     and it’s simply a fact that you can’t disturb the equilibrium of one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6260">
     part of society without jostling the rest.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6280">
     “In a way, yes,” slowly answered the doctor. “But it is quite clear to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6290">
     my mind that the enormous advantages of the canal will hide from sight
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6300">
     the losses that may be inflicted on the railroads, in the dislocation
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6310">
     of rates, and even that will be temporary, as the new business raises
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6320">
     our population, and their passenger traffic touches higher and higher
    </p>

     averages.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6350">
     “The canal has been an expensive enterprise,” suggested Leacraft.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6360">
     “It would be a great misfortune if it brought any kind of material
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6370">
     reverses.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6390">
     “Rubbish,” retorted the doctor; “this prating is the madness or the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6400">
     envy of croakers and cranks. Do you think that a connexion between the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6410">
     oceans that will shorten the route from one to the other by nearly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6420">
     6,000 miles, and bring our eastern seaboard, with all its tremendous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6430">
     agencies of production within reach of a continent that is slowly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6440">
     becoming itself occidentalized, and demanding every day the equipment
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_6450">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7030">
     distinctly saw the fair face, with its light blue eyes, its delicate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7040">
     blush of color, and the slightly mocking pout of the lips of Sally,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7050">
     the beloved. Leacraft almost rose upright in his astonishment at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7060">
     impossible hallucination. He was leaning forward, half incredulous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7070">
     of the report of his own senses, and half subjected by a delicious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7080">
     whim that the apparition was an augury of success, when a commotion
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7090">
     spreading on all sides of him roused his attention, and the vision
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7100">
     fled. He would have willingly had it stay. People were rising in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7110">
     vicinity, and soon the assembly was on its feet. Some one had entered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7120">
     who was the cause of this unusual excitement. “The President” came
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7130">
     to his ears, murmured by a dozen persons near him, and he had hardly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7140">
     sprung to his own feet when, with many salutations, a strongly formed,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7150">
     rather bulky man, with a manner of almost nervous scrutiny passed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7160">
     by him moving down the aisle to the front. It was indeed President
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7170">
     Roosevelt, and Leacraft, now startled into the most active interest,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7180">
     slipped forward a seat or two, to gain a position which might afford
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7190">
     him a better view of this remarkable person. The audience remained
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7200">
     standing until the President, escorted by a tall red-whiskered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7210">
     gentleman, whom Doctor M--, who had just turned up in search of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7220">
     friend, whispered was Dr. George O. Smith, the distinguished Director
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7230">
     of the Survey, had reached a seat reserved for him at the front of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7240">
     hall.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7260">
     Leacraft now observed more closely the character of the convocation,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7270">
     and realized its composite and representative elements. Dr. M--,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7280">
     always himself immersed in the study of the lives, achievements and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7290">
     distinctions of the prominent men of the country, was an enthusiastic
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7300">
     verbal _cicerone_ through the maze of faces which seemed suddenly to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7310">
     have condensed into a really crowded audience. Here was Dr. D--, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7320">
     Alaskan explorer in the early days of the nineteenth century, the

     world recognized authority on the tertiary fossils of the east and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7340">
     west coasts, and a man of erudition and delightful literary skill.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7350">
     Beyond him sat Dr. M--, a quiet-faced man, curator of the National
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7360">
     Museum, author of text books, and gifted with a singularly shrewd
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7370">
     thoughtfulness. At his side sat the sphinx-featured F--, of Chicago,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7380">
     a gentle-minded scholar, to whom the Heavens had entrusted the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7390">
     secrets of their meteoritic denizens, and who, by a more fortunate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7400">
     circumstance, held a pen of consummate grace. Again at his side was the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7410">
     Jupiter-browed Ward, an erratic over the face of the globe, possessed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7420">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7450">
     the smouldering fires of a temper that defied reason or resistance.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7460">
     At the front of the rows of chairs, and not far from the cynosure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7470">
     of all eyes--the President--were two notable students of the past
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7480">
     life of the globe, Professors O-- and S--, men whose studies in that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7490">
     amazing storehouse of extinct life which the West held sealed in its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7500">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7510">
     and more certain levels the work of Marsh and Leidy and Cope, and who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7520">
     had transcribed before the whole world, in monuments of scientific
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7530">
     precision, the most startling confessions of the fossil dead. To one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7540">
     side, on the same row, sat Prof. B--, known in two continents, for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7550">
     chemical learning, especially on that side of chemistry which mingles
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7560">
     insensibly with the laws of matter. And whispering in his ear, with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7570">
     sundry emphatic nods, sat, next to him, Dr. R--, of Washington, learned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7580">
     in the ways of men’s digestion, and the enigmas of food and the arts of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7590">
     food-makers. In the row behind, the expressive head of Young, aureoled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7600">
     with years and honors, was seen, and at his side the face of Newcomb,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7610">
     who had set the seal of his genius and industry across the patterned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7620">
     stars. Here was A-- H--, the geologist, reticent and receptive, there

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7630">
     C--, weighted with new responsibilities in furnishing time to the
    </p>

     rapacious biologist, and in discovering new ways of making this old

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7660">
     brachiopods, vindictively assertive, and self-sacrificingly tender and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7670">
     kind. There was McG-- and I--, W--, A--, V--, and B-- W--, bringing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7680">
     to the speaker the homage of archæology, of petrology, of zoology,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7690">
     and morphology. In a group of motionless and eager attention were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7700">
     A--, the sage metereologist, beloved in two continents; B--, abstruse
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7710">
     and difficult, meditative, as a man might be who kept his hand on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7720">
     the pulses of matter, and B--, skillful in weighing the atoms of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7730">
     air, or probing the volcanoes of the moon. In one line, mingling in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7740">
     conversation that reached Leacraft’s ears as a strange jargon of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7750">
     conflicting sciences, were G--, H-- and H--k. And beyond them, mute,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7760">
     as if by mutual repulsion, sat F--, the agile scrutinizer of Nature’s
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7770">
     crystals; P--, holding in his labyrinthine memory the names of half a

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7780">
     universe of shells, and B--n, to whom each plant of the wayside bowed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7790">
     in recognition of a master’s knowledge of itself. Against the wall, in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7800">
     a triad of sympathy, was A--, the surgeon; S--, the neurologist, and

     R--. And alone, in an isolation that belied his intense geniality, was

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7840">
     And through all the scientific congeries, which were far more extended
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7850">
     than Leacraft could recognize, or even Dr. M-- recall, was a more

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7860">
     garrulous grouping of politicians, statesmen, diplomats, ministers, the
    </p>

     well dressed circles of the rich, and the dillettantes, drawn to this
    </p>

     unusual assemblage by the presence of the President.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7900">
     The quiet and dull room, faded, and with contents tiresomely drilled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7910">
     into the exact alignments of a museum hall, took on an almost brilliant
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7920">
     appearance. The fancy amused itself with the thought that it too felt,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7930">
     in its stagnated life, the unique occasion, and shook itself into a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7940">
     momentary wakefulness, to note and record its distinguished guests,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7950">
     that its streaked walls tried to hide their unseemly rents, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7960">
     multiplied models and charts struggled to look recent and familiar and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7970">
     appreciative, amid such intellectual tumult.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_7990">
     But now the audience was forgotten at that theatrical moment when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8000">
     the chairman and the lecturer advanced over the platform to assume
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8010">
     the directive guidance of the evening. They did advance with that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8020">
     curious _gaucherie_ which somehow always disables the scientific man
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8030">
     in his official and public utterances, and seems, by some trick of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8040">
     compensation, the more unredeemable as the unfortunate victim of its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8050">
     cynical attachment is the more distinguished and renowned.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8070">
     Dr. S-- stepped gingerly forward, a tall, effective man with hair
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8080">
     hardly sanguine in color, and quite conventional in arrangement, with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8090">
     a cerebral development, that somehow disappointingly dwarfed the lower
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8100">
     contours of his face, domed and broad as it was, with much scholarly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8110">
     promise. He was followed by the speaker of the evening, Mr. Binn,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8120">
     who seemed half inclined to screen himself from observation behind
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8130">
     the utterly inadequate profile of the famous Director. The two men
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8140">
     momentarily catching the full assault of the numerous eyes, each pair
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8150">
     among them being the visible battery of a questioning and critical mind
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8160">
     behind it, underwent an obvious confusion of intention and movement,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8170">
     and became somewhat mixed up with the table and chairs, and with each
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8180">
     other. The Director extricated himself, came forward to the edge of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8190">
     platform, and in a voice of half propitiatory jocularity, introduced
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8200">
     the subject, and the speaker. He alluded to the favorable conjunction
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8210">
     of the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8220">
     Science and that of the National Academy of Science, which brought
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8230">
     so many eminent thinkers and observers together, and administered an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8240">
     especial emphasis to the question to be considered this evening. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8250">
     mentioned, with a deferential bow in the direction of the President,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8260">
     that they had all been deeply honored by the presence of the Chief
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8270">
     Executive of the Nation, to whom perhaps, more than to anyone else
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8280">
     in the brilliant audience, the grave question of the structural and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8290">
     geological stability of the Isthmus of Darien, was one of overshadowing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8300">
     interest, and he congratulated everyone that the subject was in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8310">
     the hand “of one whose geological fame was beyond dispute, and his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8320">
     carefulness of statement unimpeached,” and the Director sat down,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8330">
     pulling off to one side of the stage, lest his own refulgence might dim
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8340">
     the legitimate monopoly of that article by Dr. Binn. Leacraft observed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8350">
     that as the lecturer unrolled his manuscript on the reading desk, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8360">
     President leaned outward, adjusted his eyeglasses, and scrutinized the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8370">
     geologist, who, from a rather embarrassed fumbling with his sheets,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8380">
     seemed conscious of the inquisition. A moment later, as if satisfied
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8390">
     with his inspection, the President leaned back, bulky and immobile, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8400">
     became an absorbed listener.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8420">
     Mr. Binn, well known for his lithological studies, and the possession
    </p>

     He had provided himself with charts, which had been distended in an

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_8500">
     His reading of the important pages before him was clear and audible,

     the blackboard, and, standing alongside of it, began, with a pointer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_12910">
     of elucidation, a direct allocution to that subject of confusion, “we

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_12990">
     Under the encouragement of this exhortation, the audience seemed to

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_13170">
     the latter circle, stopping near the position of San Francisco. “You
    </p>

     recall,” the speaker continued, “the terrifying affliction of this
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15170">
     Defeat was preferable to the hardship of doubt. He would be less
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15180">
     miserable after rejection, if rejection it was, than he was now;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15190">
     tormented with an immeasurable uncertainty. And his English heaviness,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15200">
     that semi-sepulchral seriousness which by some amusing compensation
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15210">
     in the gifts of Nature is mingled with the very substantial merits of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15220">
     these people, induced a rather grim sadness in his mind, and he reached
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15230">
     the door of 72 Monument Square, Baltimore, with no actual palpitation,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15240">
     but with a strained sense of the importance of his own fate which made
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15250">
     him grave.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15270">
     Leacraft had many personal merits. He had an excellent mind, a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15280">
     reasonably fearless heart, a sense of justice, itself the best gift of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15290">
     God to man, and a face, which if not distinguished by remarkable beauty
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15300">
     became, under the excitement of feeling, and in the more propitious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15310">
     circumstances of good health, attractive, from a manly comeliness, not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15320">
     handsome perhaps, but certainly not commonplace. And he had physique.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15330">
     He was tall and strong, and his strength acknowledged obedience to an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15340">
     intelligence which made it formidable.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15360">
     The door of the quiet house before which he stood, opened and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15370">
     there--Leacraft almost stumbled into unconsciousness--_as if expecting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15380">
     him_, as if flying on the wings of--if not Love, something else
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15390">
     uncommonly pleasant--as if impatient to cross the laggard moments which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15400">
     separated them--was Sally Garrett.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15420">
     It would be difficult to reproduce in words this difficult and puzzling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15430">
     young lady; difficult to impart by any means less effective than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15440">
     painting or have proven ineffective, unless somehow helped out by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15450">
     personal acquaintanceship--the impression which gave both to her active
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15460">
     admirers, and to those who, for reasons best known to themselves,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15470">
     had tried to forget her charms. Sally was decidedly pretty, she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15480">
     readily, under the phases of excitement and gayety moved upward into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15490">
     the realms of beauty. She was fair, not large, delicately modelled,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15500">
     with perniciously accomplished eyes that looked out from beneath the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15510">
     pencilled eye-brows, and under their long lashes, with all kinds of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15520">
     provocative invitations, that were no sooner accepted than their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15530">
     desperate little giver revoked them with derision and anger.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15550">
     Her lips, of course met the most scrupulous requirements of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15560">
     critic, and her teeth were as fatally perfect. In coloring she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15570">
     furnished an example of protean adaptibility. The emblems of fury were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15580">
     seen in her flushed cheeks, and the tokens of contrition in the same
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15590">
     when they grew pale with grief. This was the secret of her compelling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15600">
     art. She bowed to all emotions, and as they controlled her they set
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15610">
     upon her face the evidence of their presence, refined by the resistance
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15620">
     of a nature which abhorred wrong feelings, improved by the welcome of a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15630">
     spirit which was magnanimous and sympathetic. No wonder that Leacraft
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15640">
     loved her. No wonder that a bewildered lot of other young men were in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15650">
     similar predicament.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15670">
     I presume at this point I owe some deference to feminine importunity.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15680">
     How was Sally dressed? Well; Sally had good taste, perhaps a trifle
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15690">
     insubordinate by nature, but a rigorous subjection to good social
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15700">
     usage had made it fairly unimpeachable. At that particular moment
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15710">
     in the afternoon of May 27th, 1909, after his extrication from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15720">
     the subterranean embraces of the Baltimore and Ohio tunnel, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15730">
     an uninspired walk along Charles street, Sally to Leacraft’s eyes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15740">
     presented the acme of sartorial perfection. She wore a white lisseree
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15750">
     gown in which were inwoven threads of gray which gave it “atmosphere,”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15760">
     a kind of filmyness quite indescribable, but very inviting--above
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15770">
     that, a waist of almost the same color, without the gray threads,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15780">
     and fitting tightly at the wrists with faintly voluminous sleeves--a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15790">
     stock of daffodill yellow encircled by an aqua-marine necklace, and in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15800">
     her clustering golden brown cascades of hair, rushed up into a chaste
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15810">
     confinement between pearl-starred combs--she had thrust an amethyst
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15820">
     aigrette. It was a willful thought, a vagary of sheer carelessness.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15830">
     But it looked well, and--Leacraft might have danced a jig (if he knew
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15840">
     how) of pure ecstacy; and if his impurturbable nature would have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15850">
     permitted so gross a jest--it was one Leacraft had himself given her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15860">
     only last Christmas. You can see or infer ladies that your attractive
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15870">
     sister, given, as I have tried to do, her natural adaptibility for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15880">
     embellishment, must have looked more than pleasing, that to a young
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15890">
     man approaching her with idolatry in his heart and prayers on his lips
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15900">
     she must have looked very nearly like the embodyment of the feminine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15910">
     ideal, like that inscrutable loveliness which first wins from a man his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15920">
     careless notice, and the next moment has him chained to its feet in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15930">
     servitude.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15950">
     Well; such were the circumstances, and Leacraft hastily removing his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15960">
     hat looked with all his eyes at the fair vision, and found himself
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15970">
     embarrassed in speaking his formal salutation:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_15990">
     “How do you do, Miss Garrett?” “Why, Mr. Leacraft,” replied the arch
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16000">
     tormenter; “I thought it was Ned. He has just gone to get our tickets
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16010">
     for to-morrow. And you, Mr. Leacraft, go with us? You will see our
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16020">
     great battle field and hear our President. I’m sure you will find both
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16030">
     wonderful. But come in, Mr. Leacraft.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16050">
     The vision with intoxicating grace swung back the door and preceded the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16060">
     tongue-tied suitor to the parlor. Mr. Leacraft left his hat and valise
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16070">
     in the hall, and followed. Another instant, they were both seated in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16080">
     the deep room from whose walls the portraits of ancient and meagre,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16090">
     or stately and peptic Garretts, looked down upon them, and in looking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16100">
     were amused or distressed, according to their nature, at the display of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16110">
     modern elegance, helped out by a tasteful condescension to antiquities
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16120">
     and heirlooms.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16140">
     The next moment was successfully engaged in greeting Mrs. Garrett,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16150">
     the mother of the vision, a dignified and well preserved lady, who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16160">
     honored all her children’s friends with motherly hospitality, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16170">
     resented mentally all masculine strategy, whose ulterior aims were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16180">
     the destruction of her daughter’s peace of mind. Her devotion to her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16190">
     daughter was itself part of a devotion which made every thing which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16200">
     bore the Garrett name sacred in her eyes, and which reflected a family
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16210">
     pride, unmitigating in its self-exaction, unrelenting in its engrossing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16220">
     enmity to all that offended it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16240">
     “Ned will be glad to find you here Mr. Leacraft. It was only last
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16250">
     night that Ned said he wondered if you had got rid of the business
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16260">
     engagements that took you out west, and expressed himself willing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16270">
     to believe that if you had, you would not forget his invitation for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16280">
     Decoration Day at Gettysburg.” It was the voice of Mrs. Garrett,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16290">
     a little somnolent in quality, with a subdued melodiousness, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16300">
     monotonously even in tone.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16320">
     “Indeed, Mrs. Garrett, few things could have less readily escaped my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16330">
     mind. It has been an alleviation to think of it when I got bored with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16340">
     quarrelsome miners. Whatever good luck I have had in settling the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16350">
     mine troubles came from my own eagerness to get back to Baltimore,”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16360">
     and Leacraft turned with, actually, a very grave face towards the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16370">
     meditative Sally.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16390">
     “Oh, Mr. Leacraft,” said that unconscionable woman, “we have Ned’s old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16400">
     classmate, Brig Barry, to go with us to Gettysburg. He is in the army,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16410">
     a lieutenant, who has fought Indians on the reservations, has lots
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16420">
     of medals for bravery and is just the best thing in the way of a man
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16430">
     you ever saw. I half think your English prejudices will be a little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16440">
     discouraged when you see him, or else you will love him as well as we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16450">
     do,” and this merciless compound of mischief and bewitching beauty
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16460">
     looked out of her blue gray eyes with an absurd intimation of solitude
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16470">
     which half made Leacraft forget manners.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16490">
     “Yes,” acquiesced Mrs. Garrett, “Mr. Barry is a great favorite. I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16500">
     almost fear that Mr. Leacraft will find him unreasonably popular.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16520">
     “I am sure,” replied that rapidly aspiring sycophant, “that I ought to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16530">
     feel no inclination to impugn Miss Garrett’s good taste.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16550">
     This was so evident an affectation to shield a too obvious chagrin
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16560">
     that the wicked object of the inuendo simply laughed outright and was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16570">
     vicious enough to reply that “she had never felt it necessary for her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16580">
     own comfort to have her own personal opinions endorsed by any one,” a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16590">
     cruel barb that lacerated the tender Englishman feelings immensely.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16610">
     The next instant the front door opened with a rough shake, and a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16620">
     commotion of hurrying feet announced the arrival of Ned Garrett. Ned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16630">
     Garrett was a typical American of the best breed, and with the most
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16640">
     unmistakable marks of that American suavity, sweetness and splendid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16650">
     confidence, not a whit tainted with assumption or vanity, which makes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16660">
     the American man the best type of man the world over. He, too, was tall
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16670">
     and fair, with fascinating aplomb, and a frank surrender to the claim
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16680">
     of friendship, without a too credulous endorsement of all social paper
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16690">
     not readily negotiable. As he saw Leacraft he ran to him with a glad
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16700">
     welcome of surprise and pleasure. “Good, Burney; I am right glad to see
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16710">
     you. I knew you would not forget us, and you will have great reason
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16720">
     to be satisfied with yourself for coming. The affair at Gettysburg
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16730">
     to-morrow will be splendid. The President will give us something
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16740">
     characteristic, the day will be the Nation’s, and the reunion of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16750">
     veterans of both sides--you know this country once tried to strangle
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16760">
     itself with its own hands--will be honored by a tremendous turn-out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16770">
     of people. I know,”--with a laugh,--“that you Englishmen hate crowds,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16780">

     day, or the jubilee of a king, or something swell and uninteresting,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16800">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16810">
     for its fallen dead,” and the big fellow full of enthusiasm, his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16820">
     handsome countenance dilated with pride, shook Leacraft’s hand, who was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16830">
     quite as delighted to greet his friend, whom he appreciated on his own
    </p>

     account, without considering his influential relations to the desirable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16850">
     Sally.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16870">
     Sally and her mother were now standing and, with, from the former a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16880">
     smile of approval and from the latter a gesture of satisfaction the two
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16890">
     ladies departed, a servant appeared, and the young men ascended the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16900">
     stairs to prepare for dinner.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16920">
     A variety of intentions had been coursing through Leacraft’s mind,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16930">
     and while ostensibly he was engaged in the commonplaces of address
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16940">
     an interior agitation of plans and designs, all indubitably pointed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16950">
     towards the denouement of his visit, were tingling through his cerebral
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16960">
     cortex with various success. He felt a sudden pressure of prudence
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16970">
     assert itself, as if by some sort of psychological premonition he was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_16980">
     made aware of the danger of temerity.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17000">
     Left by Ned Garrett to assume the conventional apparel for dinner,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17010">
     and lingering with a delighted inspection of the details of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17020">
     bedroom which he thought just reflected, to the nice point of a modest
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17030">
     assertion of feminine adroitness, a really exquisite taste, he ran
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17040">
     over the possible and best programme for the short campaign he felt it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17050">
     necessary to devise for the capture of the gentle and ethereal enemy.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17060">
     As he gazed, with increasing uneasiness, and poorly repressed envy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17070">
     at Henry’s piquant and picturesque colored sketches of “A Virginia

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17090">
     suggestively between the white curtains on the saffron tinted paper,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17100">
     he came to this conclusion. He would that evening, if the occasion
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17110">
     presented itself for a really favorable interview, let Sally know how
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17120">
     much he thought of her, and how hopelessly unhappy he must become, if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17130">
     she could furnish him with no encouragement. That would do just now;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17140">
     but when they got to Gettysburg he might expect to find a convenient
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17150">
     moment to be more explicit, indeed to urge her to the critical
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17160">
     extremity of telling him what he might hope for.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17180">
     This progressive method he fancied promised the best results, and, his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17190">
     thoughts still recalling with infatuation the uncalled for insertion
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17200">
     of his aigrette in her hair on the very day when he was expected, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17210">
     imagined if there was not absolute surrender on Sally’s part now, there
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17220">
     might be compromising negotiations for surrender later.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17240">
     With complacency, he looked at himself in the glass, walked to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17250">
     hallway and descended. He had reached the broad stairway which entered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17260">
     the centre of the first floor of this sumptuous home, descending on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17270">
     two sides in a series of separate steps, and then uniting into a wide
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17280">
     terrace of steps, expanding upon the hall at the bottom, and guarded by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17290">
     a balustrade, which ended in two newel posts of surprising proportions,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17300">
     each carrying an enormous Rokewood vase, from which sprang a mingled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17310">
     white and red exuberance of sweet alyssum and geranium. As Leacraft
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17320">
     stood at the top of the terrace of steps, he commanded a full view of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17330">
     the lower hall. And right beneath him, at the foot of the terrace,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17340">
     under the Rokewood vases, he saw Sally Garrett--the girl whom a moment
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17350">
     ago he had with some unction and self-flattery ventured to think was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17360">
     not averse to his attentions--pinning on the lapel of the evening
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17370">
     suit of a most offensively good looking young man, a _boutonniere_ of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17380">
     geranium and alyssum, filched (the theft was evident) from the great
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17390">
     vase above their heads, and to accomplish which, it seemed to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17400">
     maddened observation of Leacraft, that the young man must have lifted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17410">
     the young lady. This was a conjunction of agencies too terrible to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17420">
     dwell on with equanimity, and in pure fright Leacraft stopped a moment,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17430">
     and became an involuntary spy upon proceedings evidently not intended
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17440">
     for an inspection so inimical as his.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17460">
     It was Sally’s voice: “Well, Brig, I must confess that as an accomplice
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17470">
     in crime you are shockingly cool. It was quite unnecessary for you to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17480">
     expect more than the flowers; and yet”--Leacraft seemed to hit the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17490">
     balustrade with his foot. The interruption was perhaps involuntary. In
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17500">
     Leacraft’s condition, human nature could not stand a more excruciating
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17510">
     strain. Sally looked up. So did the young man. “Oh, Mr. Leacraft, this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17520">
     is fortunate. I want you and Mr. Barry to be excellent friends. Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17530">
     Barry is wonderfully strong, and you are so wise. With his agility,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17540">
     and your advice, I will have two escorts to-morrow that will save me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17550">
     from any exertion of mind or body. Mr. Barry will help me over the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17560">
     hard places, and you will explain things. Pardon,” with a coquettish
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17570">
     glance at her companion and a demure courtesy to Leacraft; “you must go
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17580">
     through the usual introductions. My cousin, Mr. Barry, Mr. Leacraft.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17590">
     Remember, I rely upon both of you, and you must be as amicable as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17600">
     doves,” and with that equivocal enforcement of neutrality, this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17610">
     impossible beauty vanished.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17630">
     Ned Garrett appeared, and saved the situation, or at least diminished
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17640">
     an insufferable embarrassment. The three men were the next instant
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17650">
     summoned to dinner. They were met at the door of the dining-room by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17660">
     Mr. Garrett, a tall gentleman, still giving evidence of an athletic
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17670">
     youth. Mr. Garrett was a man somewhat tormented with impatience, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17680">
     genial withal, and possessing a singular power of rapid utterance,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17690">
     conjoined also with the power of business-like demonstration. He shook
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17700">
     hands with Leacraft cordially, and addressed a salutation of flattering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17710">
     familiarity to Mr. Barry.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17730">
     Leacraft had suffered a very staggering blow, as he recalled the affair
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17740">
     of the stairway, and he fell back, with only a half-satisfied security,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17750">
     upon Sally’s intimation that this unwelcome intruder--the Brig Barry of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17760">
     her previous encomiums--was a cousin. And the plague of it all was that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17770">
     he (Leacraft) was overpoweringly conscious of this same Brig Barry’s
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17780">
     indisputable charms. Mr. Brig was a type of physical perfection. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17790">
     carried on straight, but not too broad, shoulders, a finely shaped
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17800">
     head, such which, at their best, are only seen in America; a head which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17810">
     announced to the world its intelligent emotions through the medium
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17820">
     of an expressive face, wherein brown eyes, dark, straight eyebrows,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17830">
     a strong, large mouth, an aquiline nose, and blue veined temples,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17840">
     overhung by short, curled hair, combining their mutually enhancing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17850">
     details in making their young owner the target of feminine admiration.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17860">
     Cousins are by no means denied the privileges of marital union, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17870">
     as there are all kinds of cousins, and the privilege is less and less
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17880">
     questionable according to the numerical distance between them, it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17890">
     became a matter of preliminary importance for Leacraft to find out what
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17900">
     kind of a cousin Brig Barry was to Sally Garrett.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17920">
     In pondering sadly over this uncertainty his well formed plans, so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17930">
     agreeably outlined during his toilet, fell into disorder, and, as it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17940">
     were, evaporated. His agony of heart was not relieved when he observed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17950">
     the cruel object of his misgivings. Sally was placed at his side at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17960">
     the dinner table; opposite them sat Mr. Barry and Ned Garrett, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17970">
     ends of the table commodiously accommodated Mr. and Mrs. Garrett. Sally
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17980">
     was radiant; she was well dressed, and--Leacraft’s eyes first sought
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_17990">
     its place--the aigrette was gone, and he noticed, acutely conscious of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18000">
     all telltale signals of interference by others with his own designs,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18010">
     a solitaire diamond ring on her right hand. His discomfiture was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18020">
     complete. It was a sad discovery, and Sally, gleaming with a light of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18030">
     happiness it was not his good luck to dispense, relentlessly added
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18040">
     to his distress by showering the loathed Brig Barry with glances of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18050">
     commendation and approval.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18070">
     But when could this engagement--he shuddered at the word--have been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18080">
     made? Leacraft, solicitous from the moment he entered the Baltimore
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18090">
     house in the afternoon, had scanned that same hand with a jealous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18100">
     scrutiny, about two hours before, and it was guiltless of rings--quite
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18110">
     free--he could have sworn to that. Was it possible that he had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18120">
     witnessed the closing rites of their pre-conjugal union from the top of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18130">
     the stairway? It was most likely. For a moment the unhappy man felt a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18140">
     swinging sensation, a kind of revolting nausea that put an actual pain
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18150">
     in his heart, and a sudden impulse almost straightened him upon his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18160">
     legs, and would have sent him flying from the house, seized him, which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18170">
     only an indomitable Spartan furor of resistance, in his English soul,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18180">
     could have conquered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18200">
     The next instant he, too, was smiling, even observing with pleasant
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18210">
     alacrity that when Brig Barry raised his wine glass to his lips, his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18220">
     eyes fell invitingly upon Sally, and that flattered fairy responded by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18230">
     sipping from her own, not, indeed, that such telegraphy of signals was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18240">
     obvious or unmannerly; no! it required the jealous eyes of an irritable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18250">
     rival to have seen it at all. It certainly was a cruel ordeal. It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18260">
     certainly taxed Leacraft’s self-possession. It was so fathomless
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18270">
     and unexpected. Not a word from Ned about it, and Sally had always
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18280">
     before appeared austerely impartial. Perhaps it was a sudden fancy, an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18290">
     illusion, hopeless on her part, because she could never marry her own
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18300">
     cousin. The Englishman rummaged painfully in his stock of conservative
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18310">
     teachings to prove conclusively that so abhorrent a social impropriety
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18320">
     could never be permitted. But there was the ring! Well, a ring; what
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18330">
     of it? A common gift; nothing more. It was madness for him to jump at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18340">
     conclusions so recklessly. Two cousins admiring each other--yes, loving
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18350">

     long time, were naturally rejoicing in reunion. Stupid to attribute
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18370">
     so much as he had done, under so slight provocation, to their mutual
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18380">
     affection, the affection, doubtless, of a brother and sister; keener
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18390">
     indeed, as why not?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18410">
     Ruminating thus propitiously, and only half conscious that he was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18420">
     going through the formalities of a course dinner, and was but poorly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18430">
     assisting the conversation, which consciously he thought had not yet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18440">
     developed into any consecutive line of talk, he suddenly seemed to come
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18450">
     back to his senses, as these words proceeded with celerous distinctness
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18460">
     from the lips of the older Garrett:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18480">
     “A despatch was received in the office this afternoon, about an hour
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18490">
     ago, from Colon, which startled us a good deal. Three earthquake shocks
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18500">
     have been felt in Colon, and an enormous tidal wave swept over Limon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18510">
     Bay, in the direction of Mindi. There was loss of life at Colon. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18520">
     coast towards the _embouchure_ of the Chagres river has sunk sensibly,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18530">
     and a rumor prevailed at Colon, at the time the despatch was sent,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18540">
     that the walls of the great Culebra Cut had collapsed. This is bad
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18550">
     news, if it is true, bad news for the President, bad news for the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18560">
     country. So enormous a disaster will be known at once, if it to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18570">
     known at all. The fact that no press accounts have been given out makes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18580">
     me hope that our despatch is a mistake, a canard, perhaps.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18600">
     “Oh! the poor President!” exclaimed the sympathetic Sally; “he will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18610">
     need his courage now. It can’t be so horrible. They surely can’t mean,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18620">
     papa, that the canal is destroyed. That would be too shameful.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18640">
     “The operations of Nature,” said Ned Garrett, “are not generally
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18650">
     susceptible to shame. Nature is about the most shameless thing on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18660">
     face of the earth,” and they all smiled at the thought.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18680">
     “Yes,” said Mr. Barry--and Leacraft watched him with eager eyes, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18690">
     listened with critical ears--“Nature has a happy way of discriminating
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18700">
     between shame and compassion. She tries to make up for her cruelties by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18710">
     some new blessing, but she never tells anybody that her cruelties ever
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18720">
     made her blush. If this news is a portent of worse; if the canal should
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18730">
     be destroyed, if the isthmus is invaded by the oceans, a canal without
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18740">
     locks will be given to us free of charge.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18760">
     “And we have spent one hundred and thirty million dollars already. As a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18770">
     financial proposition, it is hard to see why we have not paid as much
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18780">
     for one as for the other,” dryly commented Mr. Garrett. Leacraft felt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18790">
     it incumbent upon him to say something, and his fatal over-valuation
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18800">
     of seriousness allured his tongue into a statement statistical and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18810">
     scientific, something which might impress Sally--but which only
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18820">
     afflicted that young degenerate person with an immoderate preference
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18830">
     for the way her cousin, Brig Barry, might have said the same thing.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18850">
     “I am rather curiously reminded,” began Leacraft, “of a lecture which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18860">
     I heard in Washington last April, in which the lecturer, Mr. Binn,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18870">
     ventured to offer a very alarming prediction as to the instability
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18880">
     of the Central American zone, and especially the portions of it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18890">
     embraced in the isthmus. He was rebuked at the time in open meeting by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18900">
     a Senator, but if your information turns out to be correct, perhaps
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18910">
     he is about to receive a stunning corroboration. It would be of some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18920">
     psychological interest to know whether Mr. Binn in that case preferred
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18930">
     his own reputation to his country’s welfare.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18950">
     “I heard of Binn’s talk,” remarked Brig Barry. “I was near the Mexican
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18960">
     line, and we had had a brush with some greasers which were kicking at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18970">
     Uncle Sam’s tariff. A Washington paper turned up in camp, and there was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18980">
     Binn’s Jeremiad. I think the paper had it ‘Science Butting In,’” and,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_18990">
     to Leacraft’s surprise, Sally laughed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19010">
     But a moment later she turned to Leacraft with unaffected interest, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19020">
     said, “But, Mr. Leacraft, do you think Mr. Binn knew?” and her voice
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19030">
     was plaintive and concerned.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19050">
     “It is reserved for astronomy,” said Mr. Garrett, “to have prospective
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19060">
     knowledge, to know the future exactly, with a calendar in one hand,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19070">
     and a watch in the other. I think it is not an imputation on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19080">
     credibility of science to say that in other departments its knowledge
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19090">
     of the future is speculative.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19110">
     “Mr. Binn,” began Leacraft, “was not at all didactic, as regards
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19120">
     time, but he was emphatic in the general scope of his predictions.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19130">
     He regarded the Isthmus and the Central American area as belonging
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19140">
     in their geological habits to the West Indies, and he had a very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19150">
     poor opinion of the fidelity of the latter to implied obligations.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19160">
     He regarded it as capricious and wayward, unsubstantial in its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19170">
     composition, and a bit fickle in its attachments.” It was almost
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19180">
     impossible not to think that the speaker was not putting a little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19190">
     bit of something more than science in his words. He continued: “His
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19200">
     views also involved a curious reference to a rather topsy turvy theory
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19210">
     that the earth was pear-shaped, and that the belt of earthquakes and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19220">
     crustal disorders along the borders of the Pacific resulted from this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19230">
     hypothetically crooked figure of the earth.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19250">
     Brig Barry was listening with intense attention, and a whimsical
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19260">
     glimmer of a smile turned the ends of his lips, while his eyes very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19270">
     gravely, with a slight contraction of their eyelids, watched Leacraft,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19280">
     with half inquisitorial perplexity.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19300">
     “I think,” he broke in, “that the West Indies will manage to take care
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19310">
     of themselves. At least, present indications go to prove, that instead
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19320">
     of disappearing, they are on their way to bigger things. Commander
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19330">
     Beecham, who has just come from the Isle of Pines, told me yesterday,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19340">
     that the island was rising, that in a short time it might become part
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19350">
     of Cuba. The question might then be asked, as we own the Isle of Pines,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19360">
     whether we had not annexed Cuba.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19380">
     “I have heard of the Isle of Pines,” said Mrs. Garrett, “but hardly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19390">
     understand what it is. Perhaps a little enlightenment on the subject
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19400">
     would not be unwelcome to the rest of you.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19420">
     “Do, Brig,” pleaded Sally, “in the role of instructor you may be as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19430">
     successful in geography as in other subjects,” and Leacraft flushed and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19440">
     sat back hard, to resist the harsh blow of this subtle reminder of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19450">
     worst suspicions.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19470">
     Mr. Barry looked around, as if to secure the suffrages of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19480">
     company, and found every eye fixed upon him in expectation. It was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19490">
     his turn to impress Sally. He last looked at her, and as he did, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19500">
     laughingly began: “I shall have no compunctions in being a trifle
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19510">
     the schoolmaster. The Isle of Pines, Mrs. Garrett, lies in a deep
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19520">
     bight or bay near the south coast of the western part of Cuba. There
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19530">
     are some six hundred and thirty thousand acres in it, and it is but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19540">
     ninety-nine square miles less in extent than our little State of Rhode
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19550">
     Island. This island bears a sort of filial relation to Cuba. It is part
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19560">
     of the general chain of the insular mainlands of the Antilles. It is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19570">
     not a coral key or a mangrove swamp. It forms a plateau from fifty to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19580">
     one hundred feet above sea level, broken by ridges of hills or cliffs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19590">
     that start out over its surface like the bones on the back of a thin
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19600">
     cow.” Sally’s deferential attention to Mr. Barry’s learning was here
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19610">
     interrupted by a very audible titter.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19630">
     “I beg to remonstrate against any levity in my class, and I think, Miss
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19640">
     Garrett, you owe me an apology for attempting to disturb my recital.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19650">
     This mock rebuke completed Sally’s disorder. Her eyes, wet with tears
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19660">
     of merriment, looked at Brig Barry, who had assumed himself the amusing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19670">
     expression of offended dignity, and she murmured, “Excuse me, sir,”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19680">
     with such a delicious mockery of piteous appeal that her father laughed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19690">
     aloud, but Leacraft maintained his stern reserve, with eyes uplifted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19700">
     from the face of his rival.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19720">
     “Small as this island is, it offers room for two mountain ridges at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19730">
     its northern end, which reach the respectable elevation of fifteen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19740">
     hundred feet, and are composed of limestones. There are other ridges
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19750">
     in the island, lower and less steep. The whole island is surrounded by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19760">
     swamps, except towards the south, where it is rocky. Commander Beecham
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19770">
     says that in the last month strange uplifts have been noticed, almost
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19780">
     unaccompanied by any serious seismic--this last word, Miss Garrett, may
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19790">
     affect you unpleasantly; it means earthquake,--disturbance and shoals
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19800">
     and reefs are now bristling out of the sea, like the teeth on a comb.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19810">
     And another singular circumstance can be mentioned. The island abounds
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19820">
     in warm springs, curative--for your benefit, Miss Garrett, I may say
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19830">
     that the word means healing--for rheumatism and throat affections,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19840">
     and these springs are sinking; the water seems to recede within the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19850">
     recesses of the earth, while in other cases the subterranean channels
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19860">
     have either crushed together, or have become filled up; the springs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19870">
     are simply not there; they have vanished; the Commander has made
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19880">
     observations on the coast lines, and it seemed to him that they were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19890">
     all rising. The Cuban coast is rising, too. He came through Havana,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19900">
     and the shipways in the harbor have become so shallow that there was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19910">
     a gloomy prospect that the city would be cut off from the sea. I only
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19920">
     heard all this strange news an hour ago, and I fear the excitement
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19930">
     caused by meeting Miss Garrett is to be held responsible for my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19940">
     forgetting to mention it before.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19960">
     The allusion was noticed by only Leacraft; the next voice was that of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_19970">
     Mr. Garrett, whose face had darkened with apprehension. “Extraordinary!

     “The see-saw fancy,” said Leacraft, now thoroughly aroused, and

     “As to the papers not publishing anything,” explained Barry, “there are

     turned to him with one accord, as if saved from their own wretchedness,

     at Leacraft, his eyes almost glittering with the sudden joy of
    </p>

     consolation, and said, “Thank you, Mr. Leacraft, for that true word. It

     Mr. Garrett spoke, and Leacraft rose to his feet. “We have indeed

     the accomplishment of this Canal. It has become a political question.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_22920">
     It has colored the utterances of our public men. It has been the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_22990">
     Flushed with real feeling, Mr. Garrett shook the hand of Leacraft, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_23000">
     in a sort of review, the rest imitated his example, and left the room,

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_23050">
     a question. Ned Garrett looked at his friend with singular intensity
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_23060">
     of interest and sympathy. He realized the anguish of the man who,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_23070">
     loving his sister beyond all earthly price, forgot a country’s peril in

     the eagerness of his hope that perhaps his heart-breaking fears were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_23090">
     unjustified. The two men were standing. Ned Garrett took Leacraft’s
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_23100">
     hand and placed his other hand upon his shoulder, and his earnest face

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_23110">
     uttered its inviolable commiseration: “Yes, Burney; Sally is engaged to

     That night it was not the convulsions of nature breaking down the

     impossible to the visitors, whether they besought the services of a

     that historic spot known as the High Water Mark, which marks the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_23800">
     would accommodate an army. It was quite inexplicable why this annoying
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_23810">
     interference and congestion prevailed. It turned out to be a military
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_23820">
     precaution. The President was to be installed safely at the speaker’s

     enclosed the little village, keeping confined within it the straining

     and impatient visitors.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_23880">
     The village of Gettysburg, which was used in the great battle as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_23890">
     a hospital, and which entirely escaped injury in the three days’

     ceremonies of the day. When the dam was removed it was seen there would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_23920">
     be a dangerous stampede for position. Music, too, swept exhilaratingly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_23930">
     over the throngs from the distant scene of the festivities, and its
    </p>

     martial notes awakened to desperation the disappointed and vexed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_23950">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_23960">
     narrow streets, and turbulently mixed up on the little square of the

     village, groaned aloud.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_23990">
     Voices suddenly rose high in altercation and abuse. A farmer whose
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24000">
     rickety wagon, laden with his sons and daughters, had got packed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24010">
     between a curb and a particularly dense fragment of the crowd, made up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24020">
     of vituperative young men, and was in almost certain danger of being
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24030">
     upset, was engaged in a lusty expostulation not unassisted by the quick
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24040">
     and sharp lashes of his whip, over the heads of the dodging group. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24050">
     latter, not averse to some retaliatory measures that might serve the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24060">
     purpose of freeing their general resentment at their imprisonment,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24070">
     attacked the irate proprietor of the wagon and pushed his shivering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24080">
     vehicle over, spilling its screaming and swearing occupants upon the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24090">
     heads of the bystanders, who were utterly unable to escape, and added
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24100">
     their din to the commotion.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24120">
     This diversion, attended with laughter, shouts and cries of pain,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24130">
     had nearly subsided, when a new and more alarming disorder arose in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24140">
     the neighborhood of the Garrett party, who had betaken themselves
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24150">
     to the porch of one of the souvenir shops. A wandering and aimless
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24160">
     dog, suffering from kicks and repulses, had turned on some of its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24170">
     persecutors, and, yelping and snapping with inflamed and frightened
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24180">
     eyes, had suddenly been diagnosed, by an inconsiderate observer,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24190">
     as “_mad_.” This information, as usually, proclaimed in a loud,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24200">
     denunciatory tone, raised in a second an indescribable hubbub. Room to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24210">
     run from the bewildered canine was not to be found, and the only thing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24220">
     to do for those in the vicinity, was to squeeze more violently against
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24230">
     their companions, leaving a slender and irregular space in which the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24240">
     dog gyrated, biting at friend and foe alike. The undulous area of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24250">
     movement thus formed swayed to and fro, with the distracted struggles
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24260">
     of the dog, and soon swung violently towards the Garretts, who became
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24270">
     rudely jolted and pressed by frantic men and women, in whose legs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24280">
     apprehension of the dog’s teeth seemed to have produced extraordinary
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24290">
     motions, for they shuffled and kicked and scrambled in a way very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24300">
     undignified and ridiculous. The upshot of it was to drive a frenzied
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24310">
     pack of people towards the souvenir shop, in the hope of entering the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24320">
     shop, and evading the wretched canine somewhere beneath their skirts
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24330">
     and trousers--an absurd design, as the shop itself was solid with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24340">
     condensed humanity.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24360">
     Brig Barry saw the danger, and quickly hustling Sally and Mrs. Garrett
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24370">
     between the men of his party, told all to stand firmly, after knitting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24380">
     their arms within each other, forming an elastic and impenetrable wall.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24390">
     As it was, the colliding tides around them sent them on an unexpected
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24400">
     orbit of translation, and a few minutes later they found themselves
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24410">
     pushed towards the trolley tracks, not far from the dishevelled and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24420">
     malign looking local hotel, but in a less exposed and stormy quarter.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24440">
     And now a marvellous change took place. The barriers were down; the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24450">
     rolled up soldiers opened the avenues of approach; the President,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24460">
     members of his Cabinet, the Commissioners of the Reservation, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24470">
     veterans of the North and the South, were in place, and the delayed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24480">
     populace, released from its confinement, with instantaneous expansion,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24490">
     hurried over the roads and fields to the station of the High Water
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_24500">
     Mark on Cemetery Ridge. It was a picturesque spectacle. When the

     girls and women of the country and the near and distant towns had
    </p>

     The Garrett party had noticed the earnestness and apparent
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25180">
     preoccupation of the people. The news of the previous night had spread

     its sinister announcements through the papers of the country, carried
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25200">
     to every village on the myriad fingered currents of the telegraph. It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25210">
     had left its impress in the serious, sombre and sometimes dully frowned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25220">
     faces of the men. “I feel sorry for the President,” said Sally. “The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25230">
     Canal seemed almost himself, and the people thought of it and him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25240">
     together. What will he do?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25260">
     “The President,” answered Ned Garrett, “will not flinch. Ever since he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25270">
     went down to the Isthmus in 1906, and made the dirt fly, he has watched
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25280">
     the Canal with his whole heart in it. He knew what it meant for the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25290">
     country, for the world, and now”--the speaker hesitated--“he will know
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25300">
     what to say and do. How I believe in that man!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25320">
     “But I can’t see,” continued Brig Barry, “that the idea of the Canal is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25330">
     lost. Let us suppose there is a shifting and readjustment down there.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25340">
     The two oceans are left behind, not much different, and if the isthmus
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25350">
     breaks down, splits up, and goes to thunder, there’s water enough to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25360">
     cover the remains, and we have the Canal anyway.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25380">
     “But it isn’t our Canal any more,” ejaculated Sally. “It seems,” said
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25390">
     Mr. Garrett, “as if our grief had been premature. There is enough to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25400">
     worry over in this frightful catastrophe, and its limits no one to-day
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25410">
     can correctly estimate, but as Brig says, the Canal idea is saved,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25420">
     or at least it seems reasonable to believe that it may be. If Nature
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25430">
     makes a bigger canal, if she changes the face of the earth enough, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25440">
     Leacraft told us last night, to unite the oceans and make a strait, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25450">
     commercial union of the western and eastern continents is secured on a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25460">
     larger scale. Perhaps our national pride must suffer some, but the fact
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25470">
     remains, though, it would have saved our exchequer a handsome outlay,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25480">
     if nature, consulting our financial happiness, had done her work a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25490">
     little earlier.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25510">
     “If we’d only waited,” sighed Mrs. Garrett, ruefully.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25530">
     They had reached the edges of the throngs who stood in the sun,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25540">
     engrossing every coigne of vantage, and an orderly, examining their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25550">
     tickets, conducted them through a narrow lane of envious gazers to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25560">
     a stand of seats to the south of the President’s rostrum. From this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25570">
     position their eyes fell directly upon the amazing outpouring of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25580">
     people, an ocean of individuals, hopelessly cancelled from any chance
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25590">
     to hear the President’s voice, yet extending outward in a solemn
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25600">
     silence, and but furtively invaded by those busy concomitants of such
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25610">
     public gatherings--button men and popcorn merchants. For the most part
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25620">
     such annoyances were inordinately thrust aside, but scurrying over the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25630">
     most distant outposts of the mammoth audience, their eager shapes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25640">
     were seen, and inconstantly, borne inward by the breeze, the shrill
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25650">
     invitation of their voices was heard.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25670">
     Leacraft fixed his eyes upon the President, and he was near enough to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25680">
     him to note his expression. President Roosevelt sat squarely facing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25690">
     the people--now crushing in with an irresistible impulse from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25700">
     distributed masses before him. He seemed serious, at moments almost
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25710">
     solemnly so, at others he turned to his companions with alacrity, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25720">
     his face even smiled at some allusion or whispered comment. Again his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25730">
     eyes wandered dreamily--Leacraft thought sadly--to his notes, and then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25740">
     he moved restlessly and leaned forward, and even half rose, eagerly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25750">
     scanning the expectant faces. A jumping up of half a dozen men at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25760">
     rear of the platform, a signal of a waved handkerchief, followed, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25770">
     the band, stationed somewhere behind the distinguished occupants of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25780">
     platform, began the Star Spangled Banner. Everyone not already standing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25790">
     rose, heads even uncovered, and the spirited strains seized by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25800">
     concourse, were flung back in a torrent of vocality, that sounded like
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25810">
     the far and near thunder of the ocean’s surges. It was overwhelming.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25820">
     As if before the spirit of the Nation, the living and the dead;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25830">
     those whose discarnate beings might seem rushing in upon them from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25840">
     the viewless depths of space, summoned again to the fields of their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25850">
     endeavor by the marshall air, hats were doffed in all directions,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25860">
     until scarcely a covered head among the men remained, and many eyes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25870">
     streamed with irrepressible tears. The note of a requiem, the prouder
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25880">
     challenge of defiance, the lofty questioning of Hope, the loving
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25890">
     clasp of fraternal patriotism, the aspirations of a race, solving
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25900">
     “in the foremost files of time” the problem of the world’s political
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25910">
     creed, seemed blended together, in the avalanche of sound. And it was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25920">
     maintained to the end, even the verses of the national anthem were well
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25930">
     remembered, and that trying and unattainable high note, like the scream
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25940">
     of the eagle, which closes the lips of most singers in dubious apathy,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25950">
     was now sustained. The President sang lustily, and then he stopped, his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25960">
     head bowed; he might have been in prayer. It was noticed by all and it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25970">
     almost seemed as if the music quailed and sank before the mystery of a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_25980">
     man’s outpoured petition to his God.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26000">
     It was over. The music ceased, the frail voice of the chairman sounded
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26010">
     its quavering invitation to prayer, and a clergyman arose and droned an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26020">
     invocation. The President was introduced and stood forward. He was well
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26030">
     in view. One hand grasped the railing before him, the other clutched
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26040">
     some separated papers, he looked well and the man’s vitality, his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26050">
     zealous unmitigated self exaction were realized. As he was seen, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26060">
     tumult rose to a tremendous climax, cheers rolled forward and backward
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26070">
     like the fluctuating billows of a sea; they receded to the outer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26080">
     margins far toward the Hagerstown road, where they vanished in murmurs,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26090">
     they crashed inward in volleying thunders, and the President stood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26100">
     erect, nerved to a steel-like rigidity; the air was swept with flags,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26110">
     the intoxication of the emotion increased, women palled before it, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26120">
     men grew pale with the delirium of sudden enthusiasm. It seemed as if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26130">
     music alone could lead them back into the resignation of attention. It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26140">
     was a stupendous tribute. The man to whom it was given, had no reason
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26150">
     for misgiving, no retributive judgments for his actions, to dread.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26160">
     Slowly, very slowly the cheering and cries died away, and then ensued a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26170">
     silence as remarkable and as impressive. The two contrasted states of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26180">
     the multitude might have been interpreted as a generous invitation to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26190">
     the man to speak, and as a judicial reservation of mind as to its own
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26200">
     verdict when he had spoken. It almost seemed so, and the quick heart of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26210">
     the President might again have felt the palpitation of a doubt, whether
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26220">
     he stood approved, or a critical people withdrew into the refuge of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26230">
     an impartial scrutiny. Leacraft felt all this, and he could not help
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26240">
     also feeling a curious interest in the purely psychological enigma it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26250">
     presented.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26270">
     The President was speaking; his voice reached Leacraft thin and sharp:

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26290">
     “My friends,” he began, “To-day we celebrate again the brave deaths

     of brave men, and the sacrifices they made for the maintenance of our
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26310">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26320">
     more than any other battlefield in that historic war, represented the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26330">
     culminating energies of both sides, the last vital contention for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26340">
     the mastery. These men left behind them the inestimable example of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26350">
     fortitude. And after the battle of Gettysburg it was more difficult

     upheavals, the quickly succeeding disappearance of the solid ground

     disappearing in the folding in and submergence of the rock strata.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26800">
     The President then told the story of the catastrophe as it had been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26810">
     narrated in the despatches received at the White House. He painted in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26820">
     graphic words the shaking down of the hills, the dislodged blankets
    </p>

     slipping from the hill sides like a shawl from a shuddering woman,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26840">

     tendrilous creepers and vines, while above the trees, swaying toward
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26860">
     each other and then outward as if following the crests and troughs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26870">
     of hidden waves, above these tottering trees, the birds in screaming
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26880">
     volleys rose and fell. The bared rocks showed rents, and tremendous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26890">
     explosions sent their shattered fragments into the air, while long
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26900">
     weird groans issued from the ground as if the buried foundations of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26910">
     hills were undergoing the tortures of mutilation. In other places it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26920">
     had been quite different. The ground slowly seemed to melt away, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26930">
     with a sort of shuddering succession of chills the land disappears.
    </p>

     How long, how much further this swallowing up of the land will go no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26950">
     one can tell. But it has seemed to those who have some knowledge of

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26960">
     the region that it may embrace the S shaped Isthmus only, and that the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_26990">
     that Costa Rica on the north and Columbia on the south will rudely

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27010">

    </p>

     by the titanic convulsions of nature, will become a wide and useful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27030">
     passage for commerce.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27050">
     The President indulged the evident curiosity of his popular audience
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27060">
     in a scientific discourse. His own interest was evident. He discussed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27070">
     earthquakes; he plunged into an essay on volcanoes; he spread
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27080">
     luminously before the people the theories of the pear-shaped earth,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27090">
     the slipping of faults, the loading of the earth’s crust, the original
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27100">
     formation of the deep creases in the earth’s surface, which now held
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27110">
     its gathered waters. The President made a model expositor. He was clear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27120">
     and interesting. His style, his illustrative similes were attractive
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27130">
     and deliberately helpful. It was almost amusing to note the contrasted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27140">
     effect of this improvised academic demonstration upon the people and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27150">
     upon the political sages of the platform. The former were attentive and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27160">
     absorbed. Their faces lit up with the quiet pleasure of intelligent
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27170">
     appreciation, frequently at some pungent expression that pictured to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27180">
     them in stirring forcible photographic phrase the stifling struggle of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27190">
     land and water, the fierce unrest far down there in the tropics, which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27200">
     was unsettling the foundations of the earth, and slowly establishing a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27210">
     new order of things, pregnant with revolution in the day and fate of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27220">
     nations, carrying in its geological material insensate womb of meaning
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27230">
     the dissolution of states, the upset and consternation of rulers,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27240">
     a menace to civilization, the ruthless unwavering threat to human
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27250">
     accidents and institutions.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27270">
     To all this the political magnates listened with bored indifference.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27280">
     They expected a party appeal, some appetizing bid for popular suffrage,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27290">
     a shot at the South, a resounding puff for the Republican candidates,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27300">
     a public acknowledgement of their personal industry in securing the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27310">
     re-election of himself, new projects of expenditure, and a programme
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27320">
     of national expansion. They turned and twisted, and some deliberately
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27330">
     slept or engaged in low conversations with an expressive irony of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27340">
     shrugs and smiles.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27360">
     The President paused, his hands came together, and he leaned far
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27370">
     forward, and a moment’s hesitancy marked the termination of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27380">
     scientific periods. He continued, with sudden earnestness and vigour,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27390">
     with almost self-surrender to the impetus of his thought: “My friends,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27400">
     these are the facts, and no lamentations can change them. We must
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27410">
     learn from the courage and devotion of the men who left this field
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27420">
     defeated, to face this new predicament, not with resignation, simply,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27430">
     but with the constructive determination to seize this new turn in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27440">
     events and force it into our service, to make it only a more complete
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27450">
     realization of our first designs. This is the triumph of Opportunity.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27460">
     Thus shall we wrest from the confusion of chance its empire of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27470">
     fitting moment, and drive its scattered impulses into the straight, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27480">
     narrow path of our strictest needs. The canal as a commercial necessity
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27490">
     cannot be eclipsed or abandoned. The original project is replaced.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27500">
     Replaced by something greater, more permanent, more cosmopolitan. It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27510">
     becomes no longer a provincial fact, a national asset simply. It is a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27520">
     feature of the earth.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27540">
     “What exactly has happened, how complete is the transformation no one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27550">
     exactly knows, but if the assistance of engineering is still to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27560">
     invoked it can only be in a way of a help to nature. The facts remain.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27580">
     “And now my friends a stranger possibility confronts us, nay it lifts
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27590">
     up a sinister and awful, an ominous portent for the leading nations of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27600">
     the world. It seems likely that this physical alteration may mean a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27610">
     change in the climate of the older portion of the earth.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27630">
     Again the President launched into a scientific lecture and he was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27640">
     fortunate, as at first, as alertly careful, as broadly popular, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27650">
     adroitly technical, without obscurity. It was well received. And its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27660">
     conclusion was altogether wonderful. Leacraft had good reason to listen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27670">
     with all his ears.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27690">
     The President described the contrasted temperatures of similar
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27700">
     latitudes in Europe and America, how England on the latitude of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27710">
     Labrador was warmer than New York which found its Adirondack
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27720">
     mountains--chilled in the depth of winter to almost forty degrees
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27730">
     below zero--on the same degree as southern France; itself the type
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27740">
     and synonym of warmth. He made it clear how the thermal flood of warm
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27750">
     waters upon the shores of Europe--heating the drifting airs above it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27760">
     till, laden with moisture, they too added their gifts of rain and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27770">
     warmth to Great Britain, and the shores of Scandinavia; how this Gulf
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27780">
     Stream, a wayward impressionable wandering river pushing past Florida
    </p>

     with a cubic capacity of seven hundred thousand cubic feet of water in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27800">
     half a second of time, and, held in its fluctuating course by the laws
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27810">
     of gravity, how this marvellous oceanic flood, controlled the material
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27820">
     conditions of England’s greatness; grasped, as it were, in the filmy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27830">
     fingers of its webbed and spreading tides, its wealth, its maritime
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27840">
     supremacy, its intellectual distinction, its domestic thrift, and sunny
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27850">
     sweetness. And then the President ended, and Leacraft bent forward,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27860">
     gripped the railing before him with sudden fierceness, a knell
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27870">
     strangely appalling sounded in his ears, a portent widely distracting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27880">
     and unreasonable drove the color from his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27900">
     The President ended with these words: “The Gulf Stream whipped into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27910">
     violent activity by the south east trade winds beats impetuously upon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27920">
     the islands of the West Indies, washes the beaches of Central America,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27930">
     and whirls its spinning tides within the Gulf of Mexico, and then,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27940">
     repulsed by the continuous shore lines of North America, returns to

     Europe bearing its mantle of verdure to be thrown over the hills, the

     capes, the valleys the western edges and islands of the Old World.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_27970">
     But now the barrier is gone. The Gulf Stream before the strong and

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28050">
     New Era.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28070">
     The termination of this remarkable address was its most momentous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28080">
     and unexpected announcement. As the President sat down, there was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28090">
     no applause, just a ripple of clapping hands as a half-hearted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28100">
     recognition of an invariable habit. The speech had been utterly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28110">
     robbed of political significance, despoiled of rhetorical or personal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28120">
     emphasis, it failed entirely as the usual thing in public oratory,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28130">
     and it left behind it an oppressive sense of impending changes.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28140">
     The President seemed depressed by his own vaticinations, and those
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28150">
     around him, chilled into anxious forebodings, sat stiffly silent and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28160">
     unresponsive. The moment was saved from intolerable embarrassment by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28170">
     the band.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28190">
     The leader stepped forward, waved his baton and the solemn strains
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28200">
     of America--the transplanted hymn of England--rose plaintively,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28210">
     like a prayer; to Leacraft it sounded like encouragement, like
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28220">
     sympathy. Someone began to sing--hats came off, the guests rose, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28230">
     the multitude sang. If the Star Spangled Banner had been exultant
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28240">
     and triumphant, thronged with the memories of achievement and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28250">
     victory--America throbbed with supplication, and underneath the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28260">
     supplication, the fervor of allegiance, sacrifice and love. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28270">
     peculiar awkwardness of an unusual, an unique predicament, was removed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28280">
     The speakers following the President made no allusion to the Canal,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28290">
     and all the marvellous happenings far away in Central America. They
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28300">
     led the people’s thought back again to the soil they stood upon, to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28310">
     the memories of a glorious past, to the hopes of the future, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28320">
     realization of the present tasks, the reiteration of the nation’s
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28330">
     wealth and happiness, its strength under misfortune, its illimitable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28340">
     resources. They were successful. The pall of misgivings which the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28350">
     President had invoked was lifted. The band broke out again with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28360">
     reassuring liveliness, and good humour and holiday satisfaction revived.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28380">
     Then came a procession through the Reservation to Big Round Top and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28390">
     back again on the lower ground past the Devil’s Den, and over the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28400">
     Emmetsburg road to Gettysburg, and in the clamorous excitement,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28410">
     the parade of uniforms, the brilliant atmosphere, congratulations
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28420">
     and convivial indulgence, all the President’s words became clouded
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28430">
     and unreal. And if the Isthmus was covered by water, if the Gulf
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28440">
     Stream was deflected, if it meant blight for England, what of it?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28450">
     The United States would only become greater--its magnification would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28460">
     be unquestioned, boundless; the stars in their courses worked for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28470">
     them, and the mutations of the earth’s surface only brought to them
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28480">
     unrivalled aptitudes for new chances, for new power.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28500">
     This was said a good many times by a good many kinds of men, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28510">
     intangible something it suggested, by repetition, assumed the force
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28520">
     of demonstration. There was a distinguishable forgetfulness of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28530">
     disasters that had come, and a listless thought of those that were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28540">
     threatened. A few observant and reflecting minds brooded over the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28550">
     strange catastrophe, and yielded an attention to their implications.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28560">
     This attitude sprang from knowledge, and in the case of Leacraft from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28570">
     a personal interest in the singular sequence of events which the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28580">
     President portrayed, and which even the placidity of an Englishman’s
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28590">
     confidence in his destiny failed to contemplate as injurious fiction.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28600">
     It was a thing to be reflected upon, at least, and added its sombre
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28610">
     influence to deepen the gloom of Leacraft’s disappointment. But it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28620">
     also gradually developed for him a remedial efficacy, not simply as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28630">
     a spurious employment for his thoughts, but through a substantial
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28640">
     relevancy to his emotional needs.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28660">
     Leacraft’s mental inclinations carried him towards speculative
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28670">
     forecasts. He had cultivated his predilections along all sorts of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28680">
     scientific horoscopes, and had enjoyed the indulgence of his fancy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28690">
     in studying nations and inventions, with a view to composing a plan
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28700">
     or description of their future condition, phase and expression. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28710">
     had arrived at some curious results, but they represented solely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28720">
     the changed surface of society, in its industrial, civic or social
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28730">
     states, or else, in their more immaterial flights, pictured the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28740">
     enduring alterations of religious or philosophic systems. In all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28750">
     these speculations he had quite neglected the physical constants of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28760">
     the world, its climate and topography. His thought engaged itself
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28770">
     with the mechanical structure of civilization, as affected by new
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28780">
     discoveries, allied with an increasing utilitarianism, in which the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28790">
     individual vanishes before the imperious supervention of the State, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28800">
     incorporated multitude, the abstract Wisdom of the most knowing minds,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28810">
     influenced by a solicitous paternalism for the Whole.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28830">
     But now he found himself confronted by a new exigency, the geological
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28840">
     interferences of Nature, and it piqued his curiosity, it assailed his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28850">
     fancy with indubitable fascination. By reason of his intellectual
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28860">
     proneness to these questions, which quite deeply occupied his mind, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28870">
     felt at this moment that the tremendous and supreme chance of his own
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28880">
     mighty nation, succumbing to the accidents of a tidal caprice might
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28890">
     offer him an alternative refuge of interest which would help to dull
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28900">
     the pain of his misfortune. So convulsing a spectacle as the pitiless
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28910">
     war of nature upon the embedded bulwarks of a great commercial nation’s
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28920">
     prosperity, terrified him as a possible historical fact. Above all, it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28930">
     terrified him as a British subject. It became so overwhelming in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28940">
     magnitude of its effects that he shudderingly admitted to himself that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28950">
     his love for Sally suffered a relieving diminution, as though in such
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28960">
     events the End of the World seemed precipitated, and all human ties
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28970">
     became obliterated, were dissolved.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_28990">
     The day closed in resplendent beauty. The sun curtained in a haze,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29000">
     shed a diffused glory through the upper sky, and sank at last in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29010">
     grating of narrow bars of cloud, that lay across the west like reefs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29020">
     of gold, slowly transmuted into a purple nimbus upon the faintly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29030">
     turquoised ether. The great crowds dispersed, the troops escorted the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29040">
     President away, and music from near and far seemed to mingle dreamily
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29050">
     with the mute harmonies of the sunset.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29070">
     The Garretts, with Mr. Leacraft and Brig Barry, returned that night by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29080">
     train to Baltimore. The night proved a sleepless and excited one for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29090">
     Leacraft. He felt ill at ease. There was much reason for uneasiness
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29100">
     and heartache, and the hours passed in a dull series of mournful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29110">
     reflections upon his own trouble, and the immodest threat of nature at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29120">
     the prestige of his people.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29140">
     The next morning he entered the library and found Miss Garrett bending
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29150">
     over the morning paper. She looked up as he appeared in the doorway,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29160">
     and there was for both a moment’s hesitation, before the morning’s
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29170">
     greeting passed their lips. It was Sally who first spoke, and her voice
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29180">
     was eager with alarm.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29200">
     “Mr. Leacraft, the President’s lecture--surely, it was nothing else--is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29210">
     all here. And there is more news from the Isthmus. The land is sinking,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29220">
     all sinking, and”--she turned to the paper--“almost all the canal has
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29230">
     now disappeared beneath the assault of the waves, and a stormy waste of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29240">
     waters sweeps across the Isthmus of Panama. Isn’t it simply fearful?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29250">
     And nothing can be done.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29270">
     “Miss Garrett,” answered Leacraft slowly, his eyes sadly resting upon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29280">
     her face, grown more beautiful, he thought, by the dwelling of a tender
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29290">
     fearfulness in her eyes, “it is a fearful thing; an occurrence such as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29300">
     this is a pretty sharp shock to our sense of security. I can’t forget
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29310">
     the President’s words. As an Englishman I really contemplate coming
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29320">
     events with a positive terror. But there is something else, Miss Sally,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29330">
     I beg to speak about, another sorrow for me, though I must not permit
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29340">
     my selfish regret to cloud your happiness.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29360">
     Sally Garrett came quite close to Leacraft. She had a true estimate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29370">
     of his strong and dignified nature; she yielded the just homage
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29380">
     of affectionate regard, but her heart had never been moved by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29390">
     Englishman’s impressive seriousness. Leacraft was about to speak
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29400">
     again when voices were heard approaching, and among them the vigorous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29410">
     intonations of Brig Barry. Leacraft stopped, and a shadow of suffering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29420">
     crossed his pale face. Sally understood too clearly. She put out her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29430">
     hand and seized his, and pressed it kindly, and Leacraft understood her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29440">
     sympathy.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29460">
     Brig and Ned Garrett came into the room, and soon the discussion of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29470">
     strange events taking place at the Isthmus occupied the group, to which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29480">
     in a few minutes Mr. and Mrs. Garrett were added.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29500">
     Leacraft shortened his visit under the pretext of an engagement in New

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_29510">
     York, and it was years after that he again saw Miss Sally Garrett--then

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_30950">
     sort of solidity that gave a firm footing. With the continuous fall of

     snow, and the abrupt windfalls of snow drifting into the cut this path
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_30970">
     was rapidly rising, and was also most irregular in its outlines. At
    </p>

     opposite Hanover street, along which formerly ran the cars to the

     upon the commanding back of pounded snow, looking with amazement upon
    </p>

     the silent waste around him, the sunken gardens to the south marked
    </p>

     by a wide superficial depression, with their terraces on either side

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31050">
     outlined in shoulders of white. To the north, up the low hill that
    </p>

     culminated in George street, he saw the houses on either side buried

     as high as their second stories in the snow, from which their attic
    </p>

     over like cornices about the strangely excavated bowl. It was at this

     point that Leacraft’s ears caught a distant sound of mingled cries--a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31140">
     piteous union of a woman’s voice, quickly succeeded by the more robust
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31150">
     shout of a man. The sounds seemed to rise and fall. They were at times
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31160">
     almost lost in the rising roar of the wind, or reduced to ghost-like
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31170">
     semblances of sound, and again they came with the clearest impact on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31180">
     his ears, the shrill scream, the longer resonant “Hallo,” or “Help.” It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31190">
     was impossible for him to determine whether the cries were answering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31200">
     each other, or whether they indicated a mutual and consentaneous peril.

     and then again they sounded in the approaching darkness--there were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31310">
     now no lights at night in the doomed city--more appealingly clear as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31320">
     if by a despairing struggle of strength they hoped to prolong their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31330">
     fruitless invocation. No one spoke. Leacraft broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31350">
     “We must save them,” he said.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31370">
     “It’s nae canny wark to do,” muttered one of the shapes nearest to him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31390">
     “But it’s a grewsome matter to let them dee that wa,” urged a second.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31410">
     “Weel, weel, they’re nae the farst. The country side is as fu’ o
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31420">
     corpses as a crow’s gizzard o’ oats,” admonished a third.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31440">
     Leacraft had been listening. He felt sure that the sounds proceeded
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31450">
     from somewhere on George street, a little to the eastward of its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31460">
     intersection with Hanover. He suspected that the fugitives had taken
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31470">
     refuge in St. Andrew’s Church. He turned to look at the muffled forms
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31480">
     about him. “If two of you will help me, with snow-shoes we can reach
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31490">
     them.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31510">
     There was at first no response, only a protesting shrug, and a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31520">
     disposition to avoid any direct refusal by moving away. Leacraft
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31530">
     spoke again. “The snow packs easily; we can get there on snow-shoes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31540">
     in a short time. There can be no danger. These unfortunate people are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31550">
     imprisoned in the church, I think; there’s a woman there; the man needs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31560">
     help to get her out; he probably could break his way over here, but he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31570">
     can’t drag her with him, and he won’t leave her. It’s murder to turn
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31580">
     our backs on them.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31600">
     Leacraft was alone, save for the presence of the second speaker. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31610">
     rest had disappeared, and the thud of their mallets and the rattle of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31620">
     the sledges acquainted him with their distant operations.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31640">
     “Meester, I’ll gie ye a haud. There’s snaw-shoes down the track in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31650">
     tram; I’ll hae them here in a jiffy.” He vanished down the long cut.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31670">
     Leacraft called after him: “Bring two bottles of whiskey. You can use
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31680">
     my name for them at the hotel.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31700">
     While he waited for the man’s return, Leacraft outlined a possible
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31710">
     avenue of approach to the imprisoned couple, if couple it was. He could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31720">
     indistinctly see--the day was waning--that on the west side of Hanover
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31730">
     street, by reason of the north-westerly direction of the storm, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31740">
     housetops had formed a partial protection to the street below, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31750">
     that the heavy ridged hill of snow occupied the centre of the street,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31760">
     lurching over against the west. Up the short slope this partial shelter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31770">
     continued, but in George street, beyond, the storm drove scurrying
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31780">
     blasts of wind that whirled the snow upward in fantastic pirouetting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31790">
     volleys, and, doubtless, with wicked intent, had piled the drifts up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31800">
     in insurmountable entrenchments against the doors of the buildings on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31810">
     that street. The prospect of progress there was discouraging. Still
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31820">
     there would be ways; the renewed calls nerved him to desperation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31840">
     The volunteer returned with the snow-shoes, a pair for both of them,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31850">
     and an extra pair for the imprisoned man, and the bulging bulk of three
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31860">
     bottles of whiskey. He explained the latter excess: “They gied me the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31870">
     thraw, and I had no heart to haud the ither back. Let well eneugh
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31880">
     alone, I say.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31900">
     “Now, my brave friend, we must know each other’s name, though we shall
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31910">
     not be separated, as we must be tied together. But men working in peril
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31920">
     become close companions,” said Leacraft to the man.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31940">
     “Weel, sir, it mak’s sma’ difference what name we go by, but, an’ you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31950">
     like it, just ca’ me Jim.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31970">
     Leacraft opened one of the bottles of whiskey, and handed it to his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31980">
     companion, who eagerly accepted the invitation, and took so hearty a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_31990">
     draught that Leacraft felt some misgivings over his usefulness. The man
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32000">
     explained: “Ut’s no dram habit I have, sir, but the cauld ha’ gone to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32010">
     mee bains, an’ the wee drap pits fire in my sperit. It’s bonny stuff.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32020">
     It’s nae mickle harm to keep the fires burning in a blast like this.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32030">
     Tak’ my advice and do the same yoursel’, sir.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32050">
     Leacraft was indeed not unwilling to follow this example, and thus
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32060">
     reinforced, the two men plunged into the snow banks that with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32070">
     irregular surfaces of hills and valleys spread before them. They
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32080">
     floundered desperately forward, finding that the snow-shoes were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32090">
     indispensable, and the precaution of being tied together most helpful.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32100">
     The calling voices, with intermittent pauses, were still heard, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32110">
     both Leacraft and his companion exerted themselves to return the calls
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32120">
     with reassurance. It was evident that they had, at least at times,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32130">
     been heard, for the distant shouts became timed to their own, and this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32140">
     indication of recognition served to strengthen and increase their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32150">
     efforts. The work was difficult, and with recurrent accesses of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32160">
     storm’s fury, the snowy wreaths, detached from the cornices of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32170">
     houses, or whirled from off the edges of the tumultuous drifts, blinded
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32180">
     and overwhelmed them. Fortunately, the wind came in gusts, and it was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32190">
     this circumstance that permitted Leacraft first to hear the voices.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32200">
     Between the wintry assaults of the wind, in the pauses of its fury,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32210">
     they stumbled on, forcing their way under the shelter of the western
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32220">
     houses, and, at the corner of George street, struck boldly out towards
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32230">
     the monument, where Leacraft had discerned the inverted cone of snow.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32240">
     The cause of this formation was now apparent, and rendered their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32250">
     further progress more precarious. The wind surged down George street,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32260">
     and by a slight deflection in its course from the axis of the street
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32270">
     itself, was thrown into a vertical motion at the corners of Hanover
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32280">
     street, and became a cyclone, whose towering and fiercely moving walls
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32290">
     were materialized to the eye in the successive shells of snow raised
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32300">
     in oscillating spires above the tops of the houses, where it again
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32310">
     was seized by the direct wind and sent in dusky masses skywards. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32320">
     picture of George street at this point was appalling enough. The snow
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32330">
     lay deeply piled in the street, forming a high central ridge, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32340">
     crossing this obliquely were traverse drifts which had a slow motion
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32350">
     down the street towards the Melvill memorial; these even at times
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32360">
     coalesced, assuming the aspect of a big comber at sea, and advancing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32370">
     with similar menace. When these snow billows flowed into the depression
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32380">
     about the statue, they filled it, and then the revolving winds, like a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32390">
     gigantic and invisible augur, excavated it again, tossing the snow out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32400">
     in spurts resembling the geyser-like bursts in front of a snow-plough.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32410">
     At such moments it would have been almost impossible to have crossed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32420">
     the spot, with the buffeting wind shaking with flagitious fury the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32430">
     folds of snow about the traveller and entombing him also in their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32440">
     rising sheets.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32460">
     Leacraft and Jim had just reached the eastern edge of the hollow
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32470">
     described above, when one of the travelling billows of snow poured
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32480">
     into the pit on its western margin, and the impetuous blasts began to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32490">
     dislodge the inrushing tide with incredible velocity. The shocks of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32500">
     snow overwhelmed the rescuers, and for a moment it seemed as if the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32510">
     contest between them and the fury of nature was too unequal a struggle.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32520">
     The support of the snow-shoes held them fairly well above the snow,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32530">
     but this onslaught knocked them down, and once down, the industrious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32540">
     drifts hastily began their entombment. To speak was impossible, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32550">
     all Leacraft could do was to jerk the rope which connected them, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32560">
     a summons for Jim to reach him. His purpose was obvious. Together,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32570">
     one or the other might make such a purchase of his companion as to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32580">
     extricate himself, and then assist his friend to rise. Jim understood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32590">
     the suggestion of the pull, and groped his way forward, and touched
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32600">
     Leacraft, whom he found prostrate. His body offered a flooring for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32610">
     him to rise upon, and in this way he regained the surface, his head
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32620">
     emerging into the blustering air. He quickly established himself and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32630">
     hauled Leacraft upward, who expected the movement, and had drawn his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32640">
     knees upward to help him regain his feet. The two men were now again
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32650">
     upright and in action, but terribly exhausted and half immersed in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32660">
     snow. The wave had passed and reformed partially after its disruption,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32670">
     while its north and south wings, which had escaped the passage of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32680">
     pit, like white breakers, moved on before it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32700">
     A simultaneous motion with both, which had something almost comic
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32710">
     in it, and would not have, under different circumstances, escaped
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32720">
     receiving its tribute of merriment, brought from the pockets of each
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32730">
     the whisky bottles, that quickly contributed some of their contents
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32740">
     to the renewal of their ebbing strength. As they carefully replaced
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32750">
     the helpful vials, they heard again, but now more clearly, the renewed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32760">
     shouts of the imprisoned captives, and Jim, putting his hands to his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32770">
     mouth, screamed with all the force he could put into the effort,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32780">
     “Coming.” It carried, and something articulate returned, which to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32790">
     Leacraft sounded like “Come quick!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32810">
     Their strength renewed, the two men began again their brave combat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32820">
     with the elements, and forced their way across the snow fields towards
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32830">
     the houses on the north side of George street, which furnished a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32840">
     slight shield against the ferocity of the storm. A helpful lull in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32850">
     blast enabled them to make their way more quickly. The walls of St.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32860">
     Andrew’s Church were near at hand, and all doubts as to the position
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32870">
     of the voices were removed. The calls came very clearly to their ears.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32880">
     Creeping along the edges of the houses, they succeeded in reaching the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32890">
     church, and found that, on the back of the drifts, they were then at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32900">
     the level of its upper windows. The men peered into the darkness beyond
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32910">
     the panes of glass and knocked vociferously. Voices and steps answered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32920">
     them. The next moment a man’s figure could be discerned advancing, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32930">
     then the window opened. Leacraft entered first, followed by Jim, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32940">
     both turned to the yet silent figure beside them. His silence lasted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32950">
     scarcely an instant. “God!” he exclaimed. “You have come none too soon!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32960">
     We should have died here! There is a young girl downstairs, a friend
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32970">
     of mine. We started for the train, and just in front of the church she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32980">
     fainted. I drew her in here, as the door was open. A chill followed; I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_32990">
     could not carry her away in this storm, and we were caught. It was our
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33000">
     last chance. I can’t explain now the reason for our remaining so long
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33010">
     behind the rest of the people who have left Edinburgh. We are here.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33020">
     Can you get us out? I can shift for myself, but Ethel--you see it is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33030">
     impossible. What--what--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33050">
     Leacraft interrupted. “Explanations are not needed. We must all get out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33060">
     of this at once. We must take her between us, and fight our way back.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33080">
     Already he had begun to move towards the flight of stairs near to them,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33090">
     to descend to the man’s companion, when the man seized him by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33100">
     arm, passed him, calling to them to follow. They descended rapidly,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33110">
     and saw on the ground floor of the church, lying in a pew, with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33120">
     flickering gas jet burning feebly above it, the figure of the woman
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33130">
     the man had mentioned. She had propped herself on her hand and elbow,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33140">
     and gazed at the three faces looking down on her, with a frightened,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33150">
     still expression, in which relief and confidence, however, were not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33160">
     altogether absent. Jim had already brought out the whisky bottle, and,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33170">
     with unpractised directness, offered it to the girl. “Here, my leddy;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33180">
     tak’ a sip of this, and let it be a good one. An’, gentlemen,” turning
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33190">
     to Leacraft and the stranger, “it’s awa’ with a’ o’ us, or the deil
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33200">
     will mak’ our shrouds.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33220">
     Leacraft turned to the man. “Have you snow-shoes?” he asked. “Yes,”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33230">
     answered the stranger. “Then,” continued Leacraft, “we will start. Out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33240">
     of the window upstairs. Jim, you go ahead, and I and the gentleman will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33250">
     carry the lady. Madame,” to the lady, “this is a forlorn trip, but it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33260">
     will soon be over, and I feel we can trust you to help us.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33280">
     “Oh, yes,” came the rapid reply. The girl started to rise, and her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33290">
     companion helped her quickly to her feet. The party was ready, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33300">
     without further words the four ascended the steps, made their way to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33310">
     the window, and after one glance at the raging weather outside, another
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33320">
     reassurance for all from the indispensable bottles, the plunge was made.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33340">
     The two fugitives, if such was a proper designation for them, were well
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33350">
     clothed, and the risk of exposure was avoided. It now was a question of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33360">
     physical endurance only, and partly, too, of some possible leniency in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33370">
     the weather. Already their previous steps were thickly buried in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33380">
     flowing tides of snow, and Leacraft and Jim noted with apprehension
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33390">
     that the wind seemed fiercer, and the way back towards Hanover street
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33400">
     blacker and more obscure, with volleys of snow dust thrown upward in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33410">
     increasing clouds. For a moment the party hesitated, and Leacraft and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33420">
     Jim both seemed over-awed and perplexed. Almost at the same moment they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33430">
     cast their eyes towards the corner of George and St. David streets, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33440">
     saw to their wonder and delight that the front of the Commercial Bank
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33450">
     building was relatively clear of snow, and the intimation furnished by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33460">
     its appearance was that the way was more open on St. David street and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33470">
     that in that direction egress and safety lay.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33490">
     “This way,” was the laconic order from Leacraft, and they turned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33500">
     eastward. Leacraft and the stranger, who had given his name as Thomsen,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33510">
     supported the woman between them, and she was directed to throw her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33520">
     arms around their necks, and the sense of support to this frail girl,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33530">
     whose face, terrified and pale from weakness, yet had revealed to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33540">
     Leacraft a winning prettiness, made both men alert and strenuous. An
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33550">
     obstacle of some seriousness stood before them; two heaped up mounds
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33560">
     occupied the centre of the street. It was between these mimic hills
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33570">
     that they made the fortunate discovery of the comparative freedom of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33580">
     the opposite corner, as it was in a measure the interposition of these
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33590">
     very barriers that kept it so. But the passage--the cleft--between
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33600">
     these mounds, that somehow seemed rigid points, underwent startling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33610">
     alterations. It was filled up with avalanches of snow, which at almost
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33620">
     regular intervals were driven out by the massive wind pressure, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33630">
     the dislodged bodies of snow were seen to spread out toward the south
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33640">
     on the opposite side of the mounds from the observers’ position, in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33650">
     geyser-like spouts. It was necessary to thread this pass, but it would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33660">
     be inevitable danger if they were caught in one of the recurrent
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33670">
     avalanches. Sinister as the chance seemed, it must be taken. And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33680">
     towards this triangular cut they slowly moved. Jim was in front of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33690">
     little group, which, sheeted with snow, with bent heads and in silence,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33700">
     resembled Arctic explorers, as they are pictured bringing in some dying
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33710">
     or exhausted companion.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33730">
     The wind was somewhat behind them, though in the collision of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33740">
     reflected waves from the houses on the south side, the vexed air shot
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33750">
     about them in a hundred contradictory directions, and held them in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33760">
     tempest of draughts. And now they were at the northern slope of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33770">
     mounds; the cut was open; it had been cleared a minute before. Through
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33780">
     it they saw more plainly that the bank steps and the corner of St.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33790">
     David street presented more favorable conditions; a dash and they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33800">
     would effect their escape. Leacraft had not failed to notice that the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33810">
     intervals between the inexplicable down-rushes of snow into the gap,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33820">
     were about three minutes, and that something more than that time
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33830">
     elapsed before their expulsion. He whispered to Thomsen, whose fatigue
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33840">
     was becoming too evident, “Keep up, sir. Once through this hole, and we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33850">
     are safe.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33870">
     During all this time since their entrance through the window of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33880">
     church, Leacraft and Jim had remained tied together, and the strong,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33890">
     steady haul of the workman upon the rope now greatly assisted Leacraft,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33900">
     who was quite sensible that he must largely depend on his strength
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33910">
     at this critical moment for their preservation. It was certainly no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33920">
     exaggeration to say that as they entered that rather inconspicuous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33930">
     gateway, between two snow drifts in George street, Edinburgh, in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33940">
     November 1909, they stood on that metropolitan thoroughfare, in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33950">
     Jaws of Death. The simile may sound and look shockingly untrue. It is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33960">
     the exact truth. The white inclines rose on each side of them, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33970">
     the width of the wintry embrasure was about twenty feet; in less than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33980">
     a minute even with their lagging steps they would have crossed it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_33990">
     Suddenly Leacraft felt himself pulled sideways; only the rope stretched
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34000">
     tightly between himself and Jim saved him from falling, if falling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34010">
     it could be called, where they were so immersed in snow. Thomsen had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34020">
     dropped in his tracks and with a low cry of fear the woman’s arm
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34030">
     slipped from his neck and she clung convulsively to Leacraft. It was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34040">
     critical. In a little more than two minutes they would probably be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34050">
     buried--which at this stage of exhaustion meant death. Leacraft tugged
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34060">
     savagely at the rope, and the surprised Jim, almost thrown on his back,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34070">
     returned. A glance told him everything. Leacraft, without speaking,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34080">
     nodded to the motionless figure, beginning by reason of the icy chill
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34090">
     smiting his face from the snow, to stir, and seizing the girl, passed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34100">
     on. Jim managed to jerk Thomsen to his feet, and half holding, half
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34110">
     pushing him, hastened, lest Leacraft should feel his weight on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34120">
     rope, and be hampered in his own struggles. It was slow work, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34130">
     snow-shoes, so essential for their safety, could only be painfully
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34140">
     shoved forwards beneath the snow. It was like wading in deep water but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34150">
     it was a likeness enormously enlarged in difficulty and strain.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34170">
     They had not pushed through the miniature defile when symptomatic
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34180">
     showers of snow drifted in upon them in blinding columns. The avalanche
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34190">
     was coming. The terror stricken Alpine climber, who, behind some serac
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34200">
     on the lofty glacier, has his ears assaulted with the roar of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34210">
     descending avalanche, in no literal sense has greater reason for fear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34220">
     than did those men in the streets of Edinburgh at that moment.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34240">
     Leacraft shouted, “On! On! On! One second and we are lost!” This
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34250">
     despairing cry was not ill calculated to spur their efforts. The very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34260">
     agony of fright it summoned in the two men behind him gave them the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34270">
     strength of desperation. For one instant the spent muscles became
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34280">
     steel. They floundered forward, and fell together almost in one heap
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34290">
     beyond the portal of the two mounds as the swirling snow in torrents
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34300">
     obliterated their outlines in new envelopes. Their fall toppled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34310">
     Leacraft over on his side. The confused objects, looking like some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34320">
     assortment of discarded bundles lay quiet, the darting cold had brought
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34330">
     with it the treacherous drowsiness into their eyes, and had already
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34340">
     begun to lock the keyholes of their senses. It was Jim who had roused
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34350">
     himself to action. He struck Leacraft across the face with his gloved
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34360">
     hand, and did the same to Thomsen, whom he again lifted to his feet.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34370">
     The smart of the stinging blow startled Leacraft on his legs; his nose
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34380">
     bled, and he could feel the woman still stiffly clinging to him. It was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34390">
     Jim who now uttered the warning, “Get out o’ this. I hae the lugger
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34400">
     all right. Get down to the bank.” Leacraft looked quickly. The bank
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34410">
     steps were beneath them, and the vagaries of the storm alternately
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34420">
     covered and cleared them of snow. Half rolling, he pitched down the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34430">
     slope, following Jim, who had his arm around Thomsen’s waist, and who,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34440">
     supporting himself on Jim’s shoulder, was manfully helping his rescuer.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34460">
     In a few minutes, with staggering steps and frequent falls, the four
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34470">
     gained the protection of the bank. This refuge acted favorably. Their
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34700">
     Leacraft hurried Thomsen and his charge to the hotel; he turned to Jim,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34710">
     and grasped his hand fervently, “You’ve been a true man, Jim. I shan’t

     of the trainmen fearful to delay longer their departure from the doomed

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34890">
     and had swept away the lesser Antilles and the Isthmus.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_34910">
     These formerly elevated points were simply projections upon two

     maintained a precarious stability with references to the adjoining

     treated it as impossible, and stigmatized it as “an amusing futility

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_36750">
     During September he had been at the far north of Scotland, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_36760">
     retreated day by day with the invading cold, fleeing with its fleeing

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_36770">
     people, southward. On the memorable evening whose events have been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_36780">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_36790">
     entombment. The work of getting the people away, of convincing the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_36800">
     incredulous, of providing for the needy, of deporting the treasures

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_36820">
     spite of Sir John C--’s useful plans, it could not be different.
    </p>

     Disorder, recriminations, riot and clashes were inevitable at a moment
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_36840">
     of such sudden penetrating terror. Blocks after blocks of private
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_36850">
     homes remained with little or nothing of their rich contents removed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_36860">
     This condition was understood, and predatory bands of desperate men
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_36870">
     broke into them, encamped in them and defied expulsion. They laughed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_36880">
     at warnings, and after filling their improvised camps with coal and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_36890">
     stores, prepared with exultation to enjoy this novel debauch. Furniture
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_36900">
     and household effects had been dumped or deserted in the streets, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_36910">
     almost any extemporaneous digging in the drifts would uncover books,
    </p>

     clothing and utensils. A grotesque hogarthian aspect had been produced
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_36930">
     by the retreat of the cats to the houses, and their mingled swarms at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_36940">
     windows and on sills, whither they were strangely followed by hordes of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_36950">
     mice and rats, expelled from the country and filtering into the city
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_36960">
     in scampering lines before the weather had reached the height of its
    </p>

     tempestuous inclemency.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_36990">
     The documentary archives of the city had been locked up in great safes

     One thing had been accomplished, and it was well done. The people,
    </p>

    </p>

     September the first storm of snow began, and the mercury sunk to
    </p>

     a few degrees below zero Fah., the suffering became intense. Soon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37090">
     the railroads were blocked. Enlightened opinion had received its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37100">
     instructions. The return of Scotland to the bondage of snow and ice was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37110">
     published, and the publications carried conviction to a great many.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37120">
     The loss of the Gulf Stream was at length acknowledged. The impetus
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37130">
     of the discovery made the worst prophecies credible. The intensity of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37140">
     this acquiescence was astounding. It became a matter of faith that the
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37160">
     unanimously with a touching self-surrender to fate. Great numbers
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37170">
     left Leith by boats and steamers summoned from London. The railroads
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37180">
     responded with promptitude, though, by reason of a sudden access of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37190">
     energy in the government, nothing less would have been tolerated,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37200">
     longer than was necessary to confiscate their property and franchises.

     The phenomenal desertion of the city by three hundred thousand souls
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37220">

     and their strange hallucinations wisely aided the anxious efforts of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37380">
     the authorities. They arrayed themselves in white, and went bareheaded

     through the streets of the city, exhorting all who would listen to

     tyrannous control over the emotions of the populace.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37460">
     Then they quickly, and with excellent discernment, organized the
    </p>

     people into small regiments, distributed to them white cockades and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37480">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37610">
     they marched through the country rigorously just and honest. There
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37620">
     was suffering and death among them, and nothing could have been

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37630">
     more sublimely pathetic than the improvised services of burial that

     magnificence of the hymn, sung to the air of _Adestes Fideles_, which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37670">
     began with the words:
    </p>

     “Firm, faithful and tried,

     With endless glory crowned.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37720">
     The success of these “Frigidists” was phenomenal, but it also clearly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37730">
     arose from the awful portents of change which made the stoutest men
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37740">
     quail, and not inaptly tested the scepticism of the boldest scoffers.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37750">
     The revolution in Nature had not only affected Scotland; its dire

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37760">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37810">
     A frightful stagnation invaded the European markets; a panic of doubt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37820">
     spread confusion everywhere, and those who controlled the sources of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37830">
     money, very soon checked its use in the avenues of trade, while of

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37840">
     necessity speculation and the desire for speculation simultaneously
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37850">
     vanished.

     It was the last train intending to leave Edinburgh that, on November
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37880">
     28th, waited for the Provost Marshal, and the little army of workers,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37890">
     and which Leacraft also expected to take. The tracks southward had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37900">
     been patrolled by trains of cars or locomotives for every five miles,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_37910">
     and these had kept the way cleared, while they reinforced each other

     at critical junctures. When this last connection between the muffled

     returned, over the sweep of sixty thousand years, to a geological phase

     This great sheet of land-ice levelled up the valleys of Britain, and

     such extent that the glaciers of Scandinavia coalesced with those of

     Leacraft and Jim reached the hotel at the Caledonian station, in a

     crowd of breathless men, all anxious to escape to more reassuring

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_38230">
     largely recovered from the exposure and scare of their experience.

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_38300">
     were hardly noticed, and then hurried to the former writing room of

     the hotel, where he found a fire burning, and a hastily prepared

     luncheon, around which a dense crowd of men were collected, filling the
    </p>

     room almost to suffocation, greedily devouring the welcome repast, and
    </p>

     muttering doubts of their eventually escaping at all if they remained

     covered his face with his hands. It seemed as if he had lived through

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_38700">
     some dreadful nightmare, and the weird and sickening sense of yet

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_38740">
     A soft voice awoke him. He looked up hastily and saw the lady whose

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_38760">
     She was unquestionably very pretty, and the returning flush upon her

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_38780">
     of beauty. Elsewhere, or under different circumstances, it would have
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_38800">
     held his attention long enough for him to notice that the hair covering

     her head luxuriantly was a raven black, and was gathered beneath the
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_38850">
     were evidently distended by rings, and a superb necklace of diamonds
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_38860">
     and peridots encircled closely her neck, seen through the half-opened

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39020">
     dreadful. And perhaps,” with a reluctant gaze at the young woman, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39030">
     a smile of understanding for Leacraft, “you may wish to understand

     better how the perilous predicament you found us in occurred. It was

     reach Princes street. We then began calling, and it was you, sir, who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39240">
     responded. I think hunger and thirst would have made it impossible,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39250">
     even in the day, for us to have left our retreat, and only the--”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39270">
     “Don’t, Ned,” cried the quivering girl; “don’t don’t! It’s too awful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39280">
     to think of. We need all our best spirits as it is--but to think--Oh!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39290">
     it’s too horrible!” And she hid her face against her cousin’s breast,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39300">
     and broke into sobs. Leacraft felt the embarrassment, and was ill at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39310">
     ease, though somehow at that mournful moment the sight of a beautiful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39320">
     woman seemed a compensation, and in this case, as she lifted her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39330">
     tearful face to Leacraft, piteously struggling to smile, it awoke in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39340">
     him a kind of ardor to be always near her. He looked almost tenderly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39350">
     at her and said: “I think I have every reason to thank my good fortune
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39360">
     and this remarkable weather for a very pleasant adventure. Well, No!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39370">
     he continued, as he caught the reproachful and grieving glance of Miss
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39380">
     Tobit, “that is too cynical. Heaven knows we are all broken-hearted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39390">
     enough to-night to relinquish any false gayety, or even the appearance
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39400">
     of it, but certainly, Miss Tobit, I hope this chance acquaintance will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39410">
     establish a friendship between us. It will be the only compensation for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39420">
     this night of agony, and perhaps for all the other nights of agony that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39430">
     still await us. You will not refuse it?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39450">
     Miss Tobit turned instinctively to her friend, and Leacraft, betrayed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39460">
     into an earnestness perhaps somewhat out of place, had a fleeting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39470">
     glance of an evanescent smile, and then the words, even more sweetly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39480">
     spoken than at first, came to his ears:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39500">
     “It would be all your own fault if we fail to be friends. I am sure I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39510">
     can keep my side of the contract.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39530">
     Mr. Thomsen watched this brief exchange of promises not altogether with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39540">
     approval, if the faintly forming frown on his face meant anything,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39550">
     and the evident inclination to take Miss Tobit away from Leacraft’s
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39560">
     proximity. But he was entirely courteous, and with a half-whispered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39570">
     comment that, “It would not do now to tire their benefactor any more,”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39580">
     he moved off and drew the lady with him. And then the summons came from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39590">
     the other end of the room that all was in readiness, that Sir John was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39600">
     on the train, and that the attempt to reach the south was to be made.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39610">
     There was much confusion and some indecent precipitation to gain the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39620">
     door, and in the rush Leacraft lost sight of his newly made friends,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39630">
     but found, to his great satisfaction, Jim at his side, for Jim had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39640">
     turned out to be that sort of a fellow that meets predicaments with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39650">
     coolness, and quietly, without words, instills confidence.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39670">
     Leacraft was a little nettled over his seriousness with Miss Tobit,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39680">
     because it revealed again to himself that prosaic stiffness of language
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39690">
     which he consciously recognized as having formed an element of failure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39700">
     with Miss Garrett, whose plastic wit found in it a source of amusement.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39710">
     He walked towards the door, wondering bitterly why women placed so much
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39720">
     value on a turn of speech, or the accent of a compliment, when his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39730">
     musing discontent was interrupted by a hand laid on his arm. He turned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39740">
     around and saw a member of the Common Council of the city, associated
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39750">
     with Sir John C-- in the last days of the city’s government. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39760">
     stranger accosted him. “Mr. Leacraft, the Provost Marshal wishes you to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39770">
     share his compartment. He has a great desire to speak with you on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39780">
     affairs of the city, and the dreadful things which seem to be before
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39790">
     us. This way, sir,” and he motioned to a large parlor coach in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39800">
     centre of the train.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39820">
     Leacraft retained him. Placing his hand on Jim’s shoulder, he said,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39830">
     “This man goes with me.” The councilman for a moment looked puzzled,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39840">
     but almost instantly rejoined, “Certainly, sir; your personal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39850">
     attendants are welcome.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39870">
     Leacraft laughed and exclaimed, “No, sir, this is no personal attendant
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39880">
     of mine. This is only a brave man, whom I am proud to call my friend,”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39890">
     and as he turned to Jim the latter gave him a glance of the sincerest
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39900">
     gratitude and pride.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39920">
     The councilman waived the privilege of questions and nodding
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39930">
     vigorously his assent, led Leacraft and Jim to the car of Sir John.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39950">
     It was a car of an American type, and comfortably provided with couches
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39960">
     and seats, tables and easy chairs. A number of men were already in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39970">
     it, and some refreshments, with the circulation of bottles of Scotch
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39980">
     whiskey, showed Leacraft the unappeasible claims of man’s appetite,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_39990">
     even in the ruins of his own fortune.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40010">
     Sir John occupied a chair at a round table in a further corner of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40020">
     compartment, and as Leacraft made his way towards him, the eyes of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40030">
     city’s chief gazed at him in return with inexpressible weariness and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40040">
     sadness. Leacraft motioned Jim to a seat, and took the proffered hand
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40050">
     of Sir John, who let his arm fall heavily on the table, and still kept
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40060">
     his eyes fixed on Leacraft, motionless and silent. It was Leacraft who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40070">
     first spoke:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40090">
     “I think, Sir John, that it was a few years ago that I secured your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40100">
     intervention for a poor fellow who was condemned offhand, and you were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40110">
     willing to help me turn the law back in its course, that it might have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40120">
     an opportunity to find out what it was made for--murder or justice.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40140">
     “Yes, I do recall it, and, Mr. Leacraft, do you know,” replied Sir
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40150">
     John, “that that day seems unmercifully far away. It seems as if you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40160">
     and I lived then in another world, and as if we perhaps had died, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40170">
     were living in quite a different one now, and one very much worse,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40180">
     however bad the old one was. I am too dazed with all this. I feel as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40190">
     if I must wake up and find it all a horrible nightmare. But there can
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40200">
     be no excuse for self-deception with me. I have studied this question.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40210">
     I am one of the most convinced that Scotland is doomed. Yes,” and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40220">
     speaker straightened himself with a movement of exhaustion, “that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40230">
     England is doomed, too, that we are about to see primal conditions
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40240">
     returning which are normal physiographic states, but which will destroy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40250">
     our civilization. Listen,” and as Leacraft sank into a chair near
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40260">
     him, he leaned again upon the table and spoke with a sort of eager
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40270">
     impatience at his own logic, as if he invited and expected and hoped
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40280">
     for contradiction. “Listen. The isothermals as they existed before
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40290">
     this calamity were a travesty on the map; they were an outrage upon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40300">
     meteorological symmetry. See here,” and Sir John drew out a portfolio
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40310">
     which he opened on the table before him; he opened it and displayed a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40320">
     Mercator projection of the world.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40340">
     He was about to continue when a shout, which had mingled with it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40350">
     a throb of grief, like a loud wail, entered their ears--Leacraft
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40360">
     noticed at the moment that the train was moving; it had been moving
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40370">
     for some time. He looked out of the compartment window. “We are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40380">
     leaving Edinburgh,” his voice sank to a sympathetic whisper, as Sir
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40390">
     C-- suddenly turned to gaze, too, along with all the rest, upon the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40400">
     shrouded city.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40420">
     The snow was falling from a leaden sky, and the mantled city, with its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40430">
     higher buildings, here a spire, there a monument, like an irregular
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40440">
     mound hiding a burial, was indistinctly, very partially, seen. The men
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40450">
     and one woman--the Scotch girl saved that afternoon from the tomb of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40460">
     snow--were standing in the coaches, leaning out of the open windows, to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40470">
     fathom the dull, mottling obscurity of the air, to catch--to be forever
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40480">
     remembered--some recognized feature of the great, beautiful habitation
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40490">
     now left in the on-coming night time, to be buried in the whirling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40500">
     wreaths. Hidden between its hills, imperishable but unseen, and waiting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40510">
     for its resurrection again into the joy of life and usefulness--a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40520">
     dead city, save for those brigands who, like wolves or ghouls, dared
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40530">
     death to fatten on abandoned riches, amid its solemn, terrifying
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40540">
     loneliness! Strange vicissitude! and as Leacraft descried, in a blurred
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40550">
     exaggeration of its natural size, the dome of St. George’s Church,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40560">
     opposite the Albert Memorial, a voice somewhere among the tearful and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40570">
     dumb gazers repeated this verse from Burns’ invocation to the honored
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40580">
     and historic site:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40600">
     With awe-struck thought and pitying tears,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40610">
     I view that noble, stately dome
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40620">
     Where Scotia’s kings of other years,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40630">
     Fam’d heroes, had their royal home.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40640">
     Alas! how changed the times to come!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40650">
     Their royal name low in the dust!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40660">
     Their hapless race wild-wandering roam,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40670">
     Tho’ rigid law cries out,’twas just!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40690">
     Though the train made a toilsome way and interrupted progress, with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40700">
     steam sweepers ahead of it, the city soon faded away. The eye could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40710">
     not long pierce that forest of descending veils of snow, the sepulchre
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40720">
     would soon be accomplished, and the spectators shuddered at the thought
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40730">
     of those voluntarily immured and hapless wretches, who had seized this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40740">
     chance for a few hours’ reckless pleasure, and then--their own death,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40750">
     murdered by each other’s hand in the furious combat for survival, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40760">
     choked with the many fingers of the frost at their necks. And Leacraft
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40770">
     remained at the window still looking, while Sir John patiently waited,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40780">
     staring at his map, or raising his eyes expectantly to Leacraft, to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40790">
     resume his attention.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40810">
     A bitter thought passed through Leacraft’s mind. Edinburgh had been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40820">
     faithless. Dressed in beauty, rich in reputation, nurtured in elegance
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40830">
     and culture, she had been wickedly selfish. Her streets were filled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_40840">
     with embruted men and women, with the vassals of drink and depravity;
    </p>

     “The atmosphere is a system of balances never at rest, unless in

     clearly shown that the heat bearing capacity of the Gulf Stream is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_43000">
     enormous. It seems incredible. I recall some of his statements. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_43010">
     says that the Gulf Stream conveys as much heat as is received from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_43020">
     sun by over one million and a half square miles at the equator, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_43030">
     the amount thus conveyed is equal to all the heat which falls upon the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_43040">
     globe within thirty-two miles on each side of the equator; further
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_43050">
     that the quantity of heat conveyed by the Gulf Stream in one year is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_43060">
     equal to the heat which falls, on an average, on three millions and a
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_43080">
     therefore nearly one-half as much heat transferred from tropical

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_43150">
     or much of it from our latitude--produces a more forceful interchange
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_43160">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_43170">
     velocity, and because of this, the wind coming to us from the Equator
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_43180">
     does not so quickly free itself of its contained moisture. Croll has

     longer. But they will bring us moisture, and in larger quantities, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_43240">
     then the process of refrigeration over our chilled coasts will turn

     this way, Croll, defending himself against the criticism of Findlay,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_43270">
     shows that the winds--the anti-trades blowing from the south to replace

     their moisture in the equatorial belt. Now by reason of their greater

     brought by the terrors and dangers of the journey into the usual
    </p>

     unhesitating intimacy of peril. They took each other’s places in the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44030">
     work of excavation, helped all to flounder and press through the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44040">
     drifts, divided their company into the weak and strong, and so allotted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44050">
     tasks that the co-operation of all helped their common progress. Camps
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44060">
     were made in which shelters were clumsily provided, with tents brought
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44070">
     from Edinburgh, and which only the industry of the watchers saved also
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44080">
     from burial in the tossing drifts.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44100">
     The frugal meals snatched by chance or at the favorable moments where
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44110">
     inequalities of the ground permitted a more regular distribution and

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44130">
     deserted house, and into this they crowded, enjoying the heat of fires
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44140">
     made of the wood-work, the floors and windows of the house itself,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44150">
     while they dried their clothing, changed their shoes, and, gaining
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44160">
     a respite and new strength, salleyed out again into the desolate

     landscape with its blue gray skies flaming with crimson, when the day
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44180">
     set, and the snow cleared, and a sharpened icy edge of cold vibrated
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44190">
     like an unseen but intensely realized cord stretched nippingly through
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44200">
     the air. The leaders expected to reach a place called Tway stone, where
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44210">
     a train was in waiting, which would carry them south of this immediate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44220">
     zone of the greatest snow falls. Grewsome sights were encountered, and

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44230">
     the blanched faces of men turned away from the uncovered sepulchre of

     a horse and rider, now a child and mother, and sometimes in the wet

     Scotch woman. They patched up a rude litter and they carried her on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44300">
     this, trudging toilsomely along, and watching her needs. Their care was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44310">
     affectionate and touching, and soon other strong men offered their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44320">
     help, for gradually the sensation gained place--so quickly does the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44330">
     human fancy cling to the vaporous skirts of superstition--that the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44340">
     girl’s safety meant the rescue of all, that her security carried with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44350">
     it the common weal. She became a fetich, and they rejoiced in caring
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44360">
     for her, as if contribution to her welfare conveyed its unseen benefits
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44370">
     to all who engaged in the kind ministry. Nor did she fail, with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44380">
     living hopefulness of youth, and with her fresh winning loveliness, to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44390">
     establish a return. Her smile, the lingering gratitude she showed to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44400">
     all, her own usefulness and ready help at the stop and waiting places
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44410">
     when her eager intelligence watched and directed the provisioning and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44420">
     cooking, rewarded the toilers. She was quick and resourceful, cheerful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44430">
     in exhortation and advice, and certainly--to Leacraft--always lovely.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44440">
     Thomsen had forgotten his first resentment at Leacraft’s apparent
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44450">
     admiration for his cousin. The two men had become very intimate. Both
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44460">
     felt themselves on the edge of new events, which were in part to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44470">
     shaped by the blind forces of the earth, and in larger part as they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44480">
     affected England, by the sagacity and steadfastness of men. They talked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44490">
     much over these things together. Both were sombre and frightened. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44500">
     invincible powers of nature, the unconquerable ferocity of nature which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44510">
     is deaf to reason, blind to suffering, made them shrink and quail.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44520">
     To meet its urgency with make shifts was impossible, to resist it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44530">
     madness; the line of retreat was the only line of escape. They felt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44540">
     this; the thought became oppressively dominant. They began at first to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44550">
     hint at it, they ended, quite quickly too, in predicting it with mutual
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44560">
     confessions of dismay.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44580">
     Both loved Miss Tobit, yet, as far as appearances went, only the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44590">
     guardian spirit of her dreams could have told the direction of her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44600">
     inclinations. Perhaps both seemed to her too dear, too much involved
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44610">
     in the one peril with herself, to stand apart from each other in any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44620">
     guise or place of preference. Thomsen was the younger man, and he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44630">
     had the advantage of a handsome face, a fine form and a particularly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44640">
     deferential tenderness. Cupid and his mother are not slow to give such
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44650">
     gifts their heartiest commendation. But Thomsen was generous to his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44660">
     somewhat reticent, and, probably not greatly feared rival, the prowess
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44670">
     of beauty is generally undaunted and oftentimes magnanimous.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44690">
     When the worst hardships of their journey were over, and in the less
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44700">
     afflicted regions of England, where at the time the snow falls were not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44710">
     as deep, or the winds as tempestuous, Leacraft had many chances to talk
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44720">
     with Miss Tobit, and he found her extremely affable, well informed and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44730">
     sympathetic, certainly not endowed with the mischievous drollery and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44740">
     the roguish merriment of Miss Garrett, and therefore not so piquant,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44750">
     tantalizing, and desirable, but very kindly and soothing.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44770">
     The provost-marshal and most of the party went to Liverpool, whither,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44780">
     before, many of the inhabitants of Edinburgh had fled, but Leacraft
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44790">
     and Thomsen kept on to London. They found conditions in London full
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44800">
     of fright and trepidation, and the business interests floundering and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44810">
     collapsed. Leacraft took up his headquarters at the Bothwell Club, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44820">
     Thomsen and his cousin found a home at a maiden aunt’s, in Claverhouse
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44830">
     place.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44850">
     But much as Leacraft would have craved an indulgence of sympathy and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44860">
     response, the audience of sense and appreciation, and the agreeable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44870">
     picture before his eyes of acquiescent if not admiring beauty, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44880">
     fatal progress of events in the world of England kept him away from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44890">
     Miss Tobit more than he wished. These events were far from reassuring;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44900">
     they were directly and successively catastrophic. Their logic seemed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44910">
     inexorable; and Europe became rigid with attention as it watched with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44920">
     most varying feelings of commiseration the tightening grasp of frost
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44930">
     and snow, wind and tempest, upon the destiny of England. Not that an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44940">
     actual submergence beneath snowdrifts was threatened, a hyperboreal

     sepulchre under which every Englishman lay, like the Excelsior youth,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_44980">
     No such shocking and shattering misery as had befallen Scotland had

     as yet engulfed England, especially its southern counties, but the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_45000">
     darkening days brought more clearly to the observation of the most

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_45010">
     recalcitrant and obtuse, the most reluctant and temporizing, the fact

     monstrous dilemma submerged all minor passions, and plunged England

     into the noisiest outbreak of argument, suggestion and panic-stricken

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_45170">
     Leacraft buried himself in the questions that now with the more forward

     and statesmanly thinkers were coming to the front with relentless

     dream of starting the English nation on new grounds. Released from

     of mystic clairvoyance--“is a new land which is a physical unit, which

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_46500">
     “I fail to see,” said Thomsen, “that the probabilities are that way. On

     “Well, and what of it?” retorted Leacraft. “These elements are
    </p>

     a pained whisper, “with what a wrench!”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_46670">
     “Well, Mr. Leacraft,” spoke up Jim Skaith again, “it’s mair than moving

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_46750">
     “No,” resumed Leacraft, “that is true. It’s not the old home, and a big

     constants, amid which the long fought battle for free thought and
    </p>

     for many sins. Let it be so. A chastened pride will not hurt us, nor

    </p>

     the doorway on the street. A tolerable path led through a part of
    </p>

     Cheapside, but it was not their intention to follow that thoroughfare;

     of the Hotel Royal, which was dead, to the last stories of its

     dreamer, woven of splintered rays of light, with pencilled lines of

     Slowly their boat drew near the landing, and the two men who guided it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_48350">
     motioned to its occupants to get ready to disembark, as the landing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_48360">
     was deprived of its usual outfit, owing to the clogging cakes of ice

     walk which led to the Victoria Arch, and the entrance of the Parliament

     The occasion for it had practically been forced or precipitated by the

     reached the most unexpected depth, and the severity of the winter had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_52120">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_52150">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_52390">
     to another land; and this ceremonial was emblematic of the unbroken

     allegiance of the English nation to his removed majesty.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_52420">
     The King was to ascend the theatre of the Abbey, and be lifted into His

     stand round about the steps of the throne, and the Archbishop standing
    </p>

     “Stand firm, and hold fast from henceforth the Seat of State of Royal
    </p>

     and Imperial Dignity, which is this day delivered unto you in the Name

     and by the Authority of Almighty God, and by the hands of Us, the

     Bishops and Servants of God, though unworthy, etc, etc.”
    </p>

     And then the homage being offered and accepted, the King attended and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_52540">
     accompanied, the four swords--being the sword of Mercy, the sword of
    </p>

     Justice to the Spirituality, the sword of Justice to the Temporality,
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_52590">
     on through the door on the south side of the altar into King Edward’s

     Chapel, the organ and other instruments all the while playing.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_52620">
     The King should then, standing before the altar, deliver the Sceptre
    </p>

     Then his majesty should proceed through the choir to the west door of

     the Abbey, in the same manner as he came, wearing his crown and bearing

     in his right hand the Sceptre, with the Cross, and in his left the orb;

     their fronts fluted with crimson cloth richly draped at the top, and
    </p>

     On the floor of the centre aisle a slightly raised platform or carpeted

     platform and also the highest step leading to it, was to be covered

     the theatre, all was covered with carpet of rich red or purple color

     bordered with gold. In the centre of the theatre the sumptuously

     draped chair was to be placed for the sovereign, in which he receives

     It was finely conceived, this elevation of the King. It was gorgeously

     the Ark of the Covenant of the eternal supremacy of the English crown
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_53650">
     seemed thus visibly incorporated, and presented to them. The procession

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_53660">
     was glittering, and it was majestic. It ponderously emphasized the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_53670">
     English idea. There were really two processions, the first from

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_53680">
     Westminster to Buckingham Palace, the second through London. In the

     first--the King issued from Westminster, his crown borne before him,

     but holding in his right hand the Sceptre with the Cross, and in his

     left the Orb. Then began the most wonderful State ride through London.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_53720">
     The superb chariot of the King surrounded by heralds, kings at arms,

     followed by the open carriages of the nobility.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_53760">
     The King was immersed in color. Garter--principal King-at-arms--was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_53770">
     a miracle of dress. He wore a frock or tabard, crimson and gold

     emblazoned with the quarters of the United Kingdom. Then there was

     the Clarencieux of the South, and Norroy of the North--and the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_53850">
     like a many colored fringe, the carriages of the nobles wherein all the

     the Peers, crimson velvet edged with miniver--the capes furred with the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_53890">
     rolled together in a bank of oscillating glory. Beneath the mantles
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_53900">
     a court dress, a uniform, or regimentals were descried. The coronets

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_53910">
     were even worn, and as the scintillating groups passed, eager admirers
    </p>

     separated the coronet of the baron with its six silver equidistant
    </p>

     balls, from the coronet of a viscount with sixteen, from the coronet

     of an earl with eight balls raised on points, and with glistening gold

     with four gold strawberry leaves alternating with four silver balls,

     Nor did beauty hesitate to add its witchery to the sports of splendor,

     and in behalf of that ancient idea of Monarchy, which now was enlisted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54010">
     against a deep peril of mistrust and repudiation. The Peeresses formed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54020">
     part of the procession. Their scarlet kirtles over the petticoats of
    </p>

     white satin and lace, their flowing sleeves slashed and furred, their

     cushioned trains heaped in confusion in the carriages, and relieved by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54050">
     shining plaques of silver silk, were still more bewilderingly graced by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54060">
     jewelry, by oceans of gems resplendently transfigured in the blazing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54070">
     sun. In this momentous pageant the limits of the spectacular were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54080">
     invaded, even distended, in which some saw not only a lack of good
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54090">
     taste, but the pressure of a little fear.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54110">
     Even the church advanced the bold bid for admiration and wonder. It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54120">
     sent out its archbishops, bishops, rectors, canons, prebendaries and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54130">
     deacons, to compose parts of the vast exhibit to be interwoven in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54140">
     variegated human carpet that filled the streets. Before the churches
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54150">
     that were passed, choirs gathered and sang melodiously; the strong
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54160">
     religious fibre of the English men and women was sedulously appealed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54170">
     to, or else it was the elemental flaming forward of their powerful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54180">
     conviction. At this strange moment there was less of pretence and trick
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54190">
     than sincerity. The heart of the people was steadfastly united with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54200">
     old traditions; they clung unbrokenly to the inheritance of English
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54210">
     greatness. There was no reason to doubt their faith.

     The route of the second marvellous procession was from the Abbey

     through Bird Cage Walk past Victoria monument to Procession road, to

     Nothing so prodigious had ever been conceived; and the resources of the
    </p>

     again, as at the Jubilee of Queen Victoria, present the diversified
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54410">
     elements of English power, would be involved.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54430">
     At Tilbury on the Essex bank, opposite Gravesend, where rise the low

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54450">
     Edward the VII, would in a fashion diverse, and with a different end in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54460">
     view, also declare that he “had the heart and stomach of a King, and of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54470">
     a King of England too,” as had said Queen Elizabeth. But now it should
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54480">
     be said by a King unappalled by the invasion of the powers of the air,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54490">
     as she was before the power of Spain, but now said with undiminished
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54500">
     confidence and high hope, though said too with obedience to the supreme
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54510">
     mandate of expulsion.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54530">
     Before it took place, Leacraft and Thomsen began their long walk from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54540">
     Ludgate hill, and Leacraft intently watched the street crowds. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54550">
     noted also with recording interest the groups in the balconies with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54560">
     lunch baskets. The expectant air everywhere was not unnoticeably
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54570">
     mingled with a kind of frightened silence. There was not much noise,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54580">
     no indiscriminate hubbub in the streets, and where groups were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54590">
     encountered, hurrying to their destination, they were quiet and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54600">
     restrained. Tension was evident, a high strung expectancy verging with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54610">
     impalpable approach upon tears, and the agony of penitential promises.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54620">
     The fundamentally religious optimism of the Englishman was confounded,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54630">
     and his acceptance of invisible guidance made itself seen in faces
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54640">
     desolated by the grief of tears.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54660">
     The preparations were remarkable and elaborate. The windows were filled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54670">
     with chairs. Platforms were erected, almost luxuriously draped with red
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54680">
     cloth and scarlet velvet, and surging crowds in spots seemed to bely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54690">
     the significance of the portentous moment. From time to time as the two
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54700">
     observers walked in the middle of the street, they stopped reluctantly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54710">
     to notice signs of mourning. These took on the form of trailing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54720">
     streamers of crape, hung upon white cloth and their singularity amid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54730">
     the almost bombastic surplusage of scarlet dressings, awoke protest and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54740">
     resentment. At one point there was a particularly conspicuous dismal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54750">
     challenge to the susceptibilities of the spectators in a balcony loaded
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54760">
     with sombre trappings which gained a startling prominence because of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54770">
     the patriotic and cheerful decorations on either side of it. Before
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54780">
     this lugubrious appeal a small group of malcontents had gathered, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54790">
     were indulging in incendiary criticism.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54810">
     “Hits no use turning a sour face to the thing. What’s got to be, is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54820">
     got to be, and a little heart will keep a sour stomach from making
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54830">
     itself sick. Hi say we’re hall in the same boat, and cheerfulness makes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54840">
     pleasant company. Such a show as that hought not to be tolerated, Hi
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54850">
     say.” This belligerency came from the thick lips of a red faced man,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54860">
     who had his coat over his arm, and whose leathern leggings, corduroy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54870">
     knee breeches, and flaming weskit with a high collar strapped to his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54880">
     muscular neck by a pea green scarf, betokened a representative of the

     “fancy,” or an ostler turned out for a day’s holiday.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54910">
     “Indeed I think so,” squealed a thin, short man with a red nose and a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54920">
     curious habit of wiping his mouth with a yellow handkerchief. “It’s
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54930">
     hard enough for the sufferin’ masses to leave hearth, home, and, I

     may say, family, not to be saddened more’n than is natural with these
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54950">
     funereal suggestions.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54970">
     “Well,” shouted a sturdy arrival on the other limit of the circle;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_54980">
     “Let’s tear them down. The quickest way to cure trouble is to git
    </p>

     rid of it. It’s rotten insultin’ to stick those weeds under our
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55000">
     noses.” Under the influence of these defiant words the knot of men
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55010">
     moved towards the objectionable drapery with evidently unfriendly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55020">
     intentions. But they had not been unobserved from the inside of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55030">
     the house on whose front these sad reminders hung. A window shot up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55040">
     and a tall slender woman advanced to the edge of the balcony. She
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55050">
     was dressed deeply in black, her neck was surrounded by some white
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55060">
     crepe stuff, and the sentiment, as Howells has it, of her dress was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55070">
     a pathetic suggestion of bereavement and misfortune. Her hair, yet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55080">
     luxuriant, was plentifully sprinkled with gray; her face had the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55090">
     authorized look of nobility and distinction. She was yet prepossessing,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55100">
     though the crowding years had brought her past middle life. The
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55140">
     in her, with Christian resignation and unsullied piety. A beautiful

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55150">
     picture of the English woman, who resolutely lives her earnest life of

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55180">
     Providence there were such. The men on the street were a little abashed

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55190">
     by the pale face and lofty mien of the lady who had recognized their

     purpose, and placed herself there to thwart it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55220">
     She came forward and instantly spoke; her voice was excessively clear,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55230">
     but an underlying mellowness imparted an extreme sweetness to its

     suddenly, after a half-hour’s sauntering, shone an avenue of military

     splendor. They were in Charing Cross, having pushed down the Strand,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55650">
     and they were on the south side of Trafalgar Square, and not far from

     the equestrian statue of Charles I. Trafalgar Square was filled with

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55670">
     troops. The effect of color was transporting. The massed regiments of

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55720">
     confusedly stationed, their mingling busbies and dependent bags looking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55730">
     like a garden patch.
    </p>

     on lance-heads affixed to the stirrups, which undulated in the air,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55770">
     as the horses pranced and caracolled. The tramp of troops, the sighing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55780">
     of bugles, and the resounding surges of music, surrounded them. It was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55790">
     afternoon. The beginning of the first day’s procession from the Abbey
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55800">
     doubtless was at hand. The stirring air communicated the thrills of an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55810">
     immense event, and the people, petrified into attention, stood crushed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55820">
     against each other in rows of forlorn expectancy. The suffocating
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55830">
     excitement was unbearable, the more so because of its immobility.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55840">
     Leacraft decided to rush through London, and reach Victoria Park, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55850">
     Hackney Marshes and Clapton, in order to determine the attitude, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55860">
     action, of the poorer classes. Thomsen was unwilling to desert the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55870">
     fermenting throngs around Trafalgar Square, or miss, for a moment,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55880">
     the kaleidoscope of changing soldiery, and so Leacraft, leaving him,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55890">
     entered a hansom and shot off.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55910">
     He was not averse to this solitude. His affections for Miss Tobit had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55920">
     lately warmed into a less indifferent kindliness, and he began to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55930">
     feel a gnawing anxiety lest the pretty Scotch woman thought less of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55940">
     him--in the way lovers like--than she did of her cousin, the handsome
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55950">
     and obnoxiously unconcerned Thomsen. Thomsen knew exactly Leacraft’s
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55960">
     feelings, and regarded them with unconcealed forbearance, and--what
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55970">
     was more provoking--with a frank condescension of sympathy. And yet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55980">
     the men had become good friends; they had talked long and seriously,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_55990">
     with all the elements of critical guidance they could summon, about the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56000">
     strange reversal or revolution in the nation’s affairs. But at these
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56010">
     moments they were in an impersonal frame of contact, and the personal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56020">
     exigencies which later crept between them, were all absent. Leacraft’s
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56030">
     intellectual weight easily made itself felt in these discussions,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56040">
     and Thomsen, with cordial alacrity, assumed the obedient position of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56050">
     audience and pupil.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56070">
     As Leacraft was driven eastward in the swinging vehicle, he flung
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56080">
     himself against its cushions, and again thought of the monstrous and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56090">
     incredible metamorphosis in the fortunes of his people. The vigorous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56100">
     life of ten centuries, with all its memories, the heaped up riches of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56110">
     its achievements, the splendid literary legacy of the past, with its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56120">
     art, its lineaments of beauty, its dusky shadows, the solicitous charm
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56130">
     of its contrasted periods of history, the deep encrustation, nay,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56140">
     rather, the unfathomable deposits of character, and accomplishment
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56150">
     which overlaid the Kingdom of England, and, in this city of London,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56160">
     the beating heart of its vast interests, thickly choked each avenue
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56170">
     and current of its life--to abandon all this at the summons of a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56180">
     temperatural caprice, at the tempestuous whim of an earthquake, before
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56190">
     the blind violence of frost and snow and ice, was the most unendurable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56200">
     of humiliations! It bit too deeply at the generalized assumption of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56210">
     the whole world, that man ruled the earth; it soured the contentment
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56220">
     of his avid vanity, and to the Englishman it assailed the hitherto
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56230">
     impregnable fortress of his heroic conceit. And yet--the old dream
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56240">
     of a greater England arose, as it had arisen a hundred times before,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56250">
     in all these troubling and disconcerting months--an England leaping
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56260">
     forward, as an exultant youth, bearing in his hands the trophies of new
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56270">
     and brighter conquests, flushed under changed environments, with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56280">
     inspiration of new ambitions, and new powers of creation, issuing into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56290">
     a greater chapter of human growth than had ever before been conceived
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56300">
     or written.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56320">
     And yet what an eviction! This glorious old England, with its sweet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56330">
     homes, its innumerable beauties, its convincing happiness of downs and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56340">
     glade and gardens, flowering into clouds of blossoms, its lakes, its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56350">
     gentle streams, its æsthetic softness and dimness, its manifold and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56360">
     opulent charm of landscape, the hurrying and constant kisses of its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56370">
     moist skies, in league with all the graces of the seasons--to cast this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56380">
     aside, and begin again, elsewhere, in regions drear and sterile of all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56390">
     these things; ah! that was too hard! too hard! and, as he had often
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56400">
     done, Leacraft covered his face with his hands and sobbed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56420">
     Amid these fluctuating thoughts and feelings, the hansom swung with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56430">
     vehement oscillations along the streets, in the more deserted parts
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56440">
     of London, and brought its occupant in sight of the Bethnal Green
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56450">
     Museum, from which a diversion along Old Ford Road and Approach Road,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56460">
     flung him into Victoria Park, the huge playground of the poorer eastern
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56470">
     section of the city. He was driven to the eastern part of the immense
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56480">
     reservation, and was gratified to find a public meeting in progress,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56490">
     the exact thing he most wished to be present at, and to estimate.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56510">
     In a broad and treeless area of the park, with the grass showing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56520">
     hesitatingly after the long winter, but vivid also in spots, in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56530">
     strong light of the afternoon, with an atmosphere strangely variant
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56540">
     from the traditional, and, to Leacraft, much loved velvety softness
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56550">
     and mellowed obscuration of former days, were gathered a multitude of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56560">
     people. They surrounded a speaker, who, on some sort of improvised
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56570">
     platform, with a knot of associated leaders, with a swaying body and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56580">
     occasionally outstretched hands, was engaged in a harangue which was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56590">
     received with attention unattended by the slightest demonstration of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56600">
     assent or disapproval. It looked from a short distance almost like a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56610">
     devotional assembly, it seemed so reverently silent, and as Leacraft
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56620">
     approached, this impression was partially at least verified, for the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56630">
     speaker’s hands ceased their agitated appeal, the occasional higher
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56640">
     cries proceeding from his lips died away, and a song or hymn burst
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56650">
     suddenly from the still motionless multitude. It lasted for an instant,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56660">
     perhaps a single verse, and as Leacraft drew near, another man from

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56670">
     the platform group stood up, and stepped to the front of the small

     stand. At that precise moment the cannonading, agreed upon as a signal,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56690">
     announced the starting of the royal cortege, and the sad beginning
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56700">
     of the imperial evacuation of England. It was heard with far away
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56710">
     reverberations, as it was repeated from other nearer points, and this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56720">
     vagueness, by a congruity of effect with the dull misery weighing on

     Leacraft’s heart, seemed to give to it a deeper poignancy of grievous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56740">
     import. It produced the impression of an irrevocable doom. As the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56750">
     sounds were heard by the assembled crowds, the speaker lifted his hand
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56760">
     and raised his face skyward, as if in supplication, the heads were all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56770">
     uncovered by one spontaneous impulse, and, caught in the same wave of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56780">
     feeling, Leacraft sought the invocation of his own blessing on the King
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56790">
     and all he stood for.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56810">
     The interrupted speaker began his address. The man was a strong type.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56820">
     His face was somewhat leisurely framed in short whiskers, confined
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56830">
     to his cheeks; his eyes were large, blue and unblinking, with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56840">
     resolute look in them that had the merit of extorting, at least,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56850">
     a respectful recognition; his complexion met all the requirements
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56860">
     of the English reputation for color, but it left no impression of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56870">
     having attained its superior brilliancy through less innocent means
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56880">
     than exercise and personal care. His broad, high forehead--a little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56890">
     heightened in its expansive effect through the faltering recession of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56900">
     the iron grey hair that stood a little stiffly above it--rose above
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56910">
     the admirably firm nose, whose size and contour formed to the reader
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56920">
     of physiognomies another compelling admonition to give its wearer the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56930">
     rational allegiance of attention. The man’s voice was musical, with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56940">
     a single intonation that imparted to it much carrying power, and it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56950">
     yielded to certain tendencies of relaxation in speaking that gave it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56960">
     almost a feminine sweetness. Leacraft put him down for a labor leader
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56970">
     of a sort, character and design belonging to the best elements of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56980">
     current labor thought and organization; a man of that impressive stamp
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_56990">
     in modern adjustments of self-assertion, of which John Burns was so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57000">
     extraordinary an example.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57020">
     He had begun his speech as Leacraft, with insistent zeal, pushed his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57030">
     way deeply toward the centre and margins nearer the stage, of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57040">
     attentive throng.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57060">
     “My friends, we must think for ourselves. We are not likely to have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57070">
     our thinking done for us to the best advantage. Now there are some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57080">
     plain, undeniable facts. They are the kind of facts which cannot be hid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57090">
     under a bushel basket, nor, for that matter, under a king’s crown. One
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57100">
     of the most intelligible of these facts--and it is fundamental--is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57110">
     that the number of individual heads apportioned to the same number
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57120">
     of paired legs make up the population, and units of population make
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57130">
     nations, and nothing else can. An aggregate of gentlemen dressed in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57140">
     wigs, or holding truncheons sticking out of purple and gold-braided
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57150">
     shawls never has, and, from sheer destitution, never could make a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57160">
     nation. By all the signs around us, and I am willing to accept them
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57170">
     without any question, this country of ours is going to move; is about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57180">
     to begin housekeeping somewhere else, and I think it is an imperative
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57190">
     necessity for the success of such a change that everyone living now on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57200">
     this island and calling himself an Englishman, must move also, and move
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57210">
     to the same place (Hear, Hear,). But that moving is conditioned. It is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57220">
     indispensably necessary that we proclaim that condition, and insist
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57230">
     upon its acceptance. We hold the situation in our own hands. We control
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57240">
     the key to the future, to make or mar, or destroy the continuity of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57250">
     English name. Why? Because if to-morrow the English workingman refused
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57260">
     to follow the English flag to Australia, and took his wisdom, his tools
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57270">
     and his savings somewhere else, that flag would lose twenty millions
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57280">
     of subjects, and would wave over a remnant that could not ensure its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57290">
     protection or its support. (Hear, Hear). But the condition?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57310">
     The speaker paused, sweeping his eyes over the sea of upturned faces,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57320">
     as if he was hunting through the chaotic assemblage for the disclosure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57330">
     of some particular visage which, either as an ally or an opponent,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57340">
     might receive the shock of his omnipotent secret. Whether he discovered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57350">
     the facial invitation or not, was not revealed in his subsequent
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57360">
     action. He wheeled sideways to the stiffened line of men behind
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57370">
     him--doubtless expectant and impatient numbers in the afternoon’s
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57380">
     programme--and bringing his clenched right hand into the hollowed palm
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57390">
     of his left hand, shouted, and not discordantly: “The condition is the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57400">
     abolition forever of the Law of Entail that to-day makes us a servile
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57410">
     race.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57430">
     Again he paused, as if so ponderous a statement, so fiercely declared,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57440">
     would elicit a demonstration--but to Leacraft’s abounding wonder, not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57450">
     a sound arose from the vast audience. Whether it was appalled, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57460">
     thrilled, interested, or pleased, or dumbfounded, it gave no sign. Its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57470">
     immutable decree for the speaker to go on was its very silence. No
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57480">
     public orator could conveniently, with respect to his own sensitive
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57490">
     needs for public encouragement, stop there. But he had become cautious.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57500">
     He felt that perchance his auditors yet held mental reservations in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57510">
     favor of things as they were, as they wished them to continue.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57530">
     “I say, with all my heart and soul,” he went on, “stay with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57540">
     Flag, stay with the King, stay with our lords and ladies, but on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57550">
     one condition as freemen, to whose keeping now in this hour of peril
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57560">
     they are wholly given. Into your hands the God of Nations entrusts
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57570">
     their fate, but that fate can only be propitious as you are true to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57580">
     yourselves, your children, and your children’s children.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57600">
     Then came the long delayed approval. A wave of excited pleasure brushed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57610">
     across the crowds, and the hand-clapping, begun in many separate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57620">
     centres, ran together, and with shouts of acquiescence, with cheers,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57630">
     with central and periphera, agitation, the huge aggregate expressed its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57640">
     tumultuous adhesion. Leacraft felt that the loyalty of these people was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57650">
     not impaired, and that the logic of events would still hold them united
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57660">
     in a consentaneous allegiance at least, to the idea of the English
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57670">
     nation, though it was pretty evident that the democratic claims of a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57680">
     wider opportunity for personal, for family promotion, leavened all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57690">
     their feelings, and that in the new regime it might be expected, that a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57700">
     great deal of the present relation of the classes would be swept away,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57710">
     and that the old time idolatry of degree, the mere flunkeyism of homage
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57720">
     to name and geneological prestige, among the masses, had shrunken into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57730">
     nothingness.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57750">
     The stage was again occupied by a speaker, who was interested in very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57760">
     practical and urgent questions, the _how_ and _where_ and _when_, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57770">
     disposition of the emigrants to the new country, and he revelled in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57780">
     plans, provisions, details of occupancy, and employment. He showed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57790">
     conclusively the power and effectiveness of organization, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57800">
     surprising accommodations that can be extracted from the most forlorn
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57810">
     prospects by a shrewd use of forethought and combination. Funds had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57820">
     been scraped together, settlements, as yet in the dream stage of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57830">
     realization created, and a practical socialism consummated in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57840">
     confederation of a large numbers in one common venture. This aspect
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57850">
     of the emigration was dwelt upon by the speaker with some rigor. It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57860">
     was a surprise to Leacraft, and lent a strange expression to the still
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57870">
     irreconcilable spectacle of Englishmen looking for a new home.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57890">
     Leacraft soon tired of sums, schedules, names, and lists, and wandered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57900">
     away over the park through the scattered groups, many centred around
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57910">
     one of those popular tribunes, who, by reason of a little more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57920">
     leisure, perhaps a little more application, and always much more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57930">
     labial facility, influence their class profoundly. The broad lawns
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57940">
     were filled with these improvised parliaments, in which too banter,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57950">
     argument, retort, query, admonition bore a part. The perplexing thing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57960">
     was the average satisfaction shown by the people, a kind of holiday
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57970">
     anticipation, as if they were off for an excursion. To them perhaps
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57980">
     it seemed a new start in life, with the ground less encumbered by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_57990">
     rivals, by restrictions, less shadowed by priority, and favors for a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58000">
     few, and by the intimidation of a necessary subserviency. They almost
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58010">
     seemed happy in the thought of change. There was bitterness in this,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58020">
     and yet to Leacraft with his undissembling and emancipated mind it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58030">
     was understood. It meant _chance_ to these people--this removal; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58040">
     to most of them chance never came, never could come as they were.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58050">
     And then to linger, was starvation, loneliness, disuse, death. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58060">
     business of the country had enormously shrunken, its productive power
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58070">
     had been halved, commerce was drifting in stronger and steadier
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58080">
     currents elsewhere, and no where so strongly as to Germany, while the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58090">
     over mastering pre-eminence of America loomed up in proportions that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58100">
     paralysed conjecture.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58120">
     Pondering on all these things Leacraft, in his absorbed way, stumbled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58130">
     over a little girl on the edge of one of the shaded walks. He quickly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58140">
     stooped and picked her up, and confronted the young mother, already
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58150">
     hastening to the rescue of her child.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58170">
     “I should have been more careful,” said the embarrassed gentleman.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58180">
     “Well, indeed we have all good reason to be thinking more than seeing,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58190">
     these times,” said the smiling mother, “I wonder what we’ll all be like
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58200">
     this time, come twelve month.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58220">
     “Oh, I dare say that we shall be doing much the same thing that we do
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58230">
     here, in a different place--and then we shall be a year older;” the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58240">
     young woman laughed, and attested a complete willingness to talk more,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58250">
     as she raised the ruffled child from the grass and moved nearer to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58260">
     Leacraft. Nor was Leacraft indifferent. He felt nettled, and willful,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58270">
     with a subconsciousness of disappointment and fear. This human and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58280">
     healthy mother, with the fresh guerdon of her blushing youth in her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58290">
     arms, was a helpful companion, and then she carried the solace of some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58300">
     new story, perhaps a new need, and Leacraft was not averse to being
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58310">

     “Willie, that’s my man, sir,” continued the girl, “is right glad to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58340">
     get away. Last Candlemas his mother died, and left Willie her savings,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58350">
     and that, and what we have, will tide us to America, and Willie he

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58380">
     and the fever that he has. Ah! sir, it makes me chill at my heart to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58390">
     see him, and to think that we are going so far,” and the sweet face
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58400">
     looked piteously at Leacraft, and the tears overran the sad gray eyes.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58410">
     Leacraft saw it all; a consumptive father, poor, out of work, staking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58420">
     everything now to reach that bourne, where the hopeless of all nations
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58430">
     saw the welcome light of opportunity. As he thought of this he saw
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58440">
     how great this avulsion was, what a tearing up of the roots of family
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58450">
     and home life, and how ruthlessly they were to be planted in all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58460">
     sorts of soils, under alien skies, with inauspicious hands to tend
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58470">
     and raise them. He turned to the young mother, and said, “It won’t
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58480">
     seem so far, if a face from the old home greets you there. I shall be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58490">
     there also, and I will not only be glad to see you, but glad to help
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58500">
     you, if you need it. Take this,” and opening his card case, he wrote
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58510">
     an address in New York city. “If,” he continued, “you do not remain
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58520">
     in New York, this will always find me. Good bye.” He extended his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58530">
     hand and shook with unaffected warmth the hand of the young English
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58540">
     woman, to whom the future loomed up in misty and insecure, perhaps
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58550">
     menacing shadows. How merciful is sympathy, with what a solacing hand
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58560">
     it soothes the “ruffled brow of care,” and how genially it bids the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58570">
     springs of life still follow, and, for a moment at least, flow too in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58580">
     the sunlight of affection. The English woman seized Leacraft’s hand
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58590">
     and pressed it tightly, and her face looked into his with almost an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58600">
     enamored thankfulness; she raised the baby girl and held it close to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58610">
     Leacraft, and the restrained Englishman kissed it with quaint shyness.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58620">
     At the instant, all the shifting helplessness about him moved him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58630">
     inexpressibly. Again they shook hands and the Englishman betrayed into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58640">
     emotional excess, walked rapidly away, reassuring her at the last that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58650">
     he would indeed be soon in America.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58670">
     A few feet away a different encounter swept him into a contrasted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58680">
     realm of emotional excitement. A rude brawling loafer, none too sober,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58690">
     and reckless in oaths and obscenity, had seized the small flags of two
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58700">
     little boys--union jacks--and throwing them down on the ground, with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58710">
     an outburst of profanity trampled and defaced them. The Englishman
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58720">
     inflamed and ardent, holding a wounded heart, stood stupified and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58730">
     insulted. The next instant and he had snatched the flags from their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58740">
     degradation, and with an instantaneous revulsion struck the culprit of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58750">
     this outrage squarely in the face. The blow was unmistakably adequate.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58760">
     The ruffian reeled and fell and failed to regain his feet, before a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58770">
     shout of applause greeted Leacraft and a concourse of men, who had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58780">
     hastened to the spot on the outcry of the children surrounded him with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58790">
     welcome salutation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58810">
     “A fine blow--well hit and straight as a gunshot man! That was the
    </p>

     right medicine for his complaint. I’m thinking that a little water
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58830">
     might wash it down. I say, boys, let’s duck him, souse him in the lake.

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58860">
     of this criticism was on his feet again in rather a belligerent mood,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58870">
     blinking and rolling his fists in a minatory fashion, and sputtering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58880">
     defiance, and presenting a transient spectacle of inebriety and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58890">
     coarseness that would have been ludicrous, if the temper of the men
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58900">
     behind the new speaker had not seemed so hostile. Leacraft felt that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58910">
     they would do some serious mischief to the miserable delinquent, and he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58920">
     stepped in front of them interposing his body between the foremost of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58930">
     the ranks, and the, now somewhat intimidated drunkard.
    </p>

     “I think my friends, that you should spare yourselves the trouble to

     punish this miscreant just now. Let him alone. Neither he or his kind
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_58970">
     are likely to hurt our flag. He has learned his lesson. To-day my

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59010">
     how large the vision grows.” The men had enclosed Leacraft in a dense
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59020">
     circle. He saw that he had their attention, while the stumbling object
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59030">
     of their first anger effected a shuffling retreat with ignominious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59040">
     haste. His ruse now was to entirely capture their thoughts. “It is a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59050">
     vision of a new England, one made so by our devotion, the fixed quality
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59060">
     of our patriotism, an undeviating union among ourselves, and just pride
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59070">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59080">
     not be a more beautiful England. We are deeply stricken. While we bow
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59090">
     to this necessity, let us make the grandest display of fortitude of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59100">
     resource, of hope, of courage, of skill, of judgment, ever known. In

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59110">
     our disaster we shall again conquer the world and hold it submissive

     at our feet.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59140">
     Leacraft had enough disengagement of thought to half smile to himself
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59150">
     at this grandiloquent pretense, but he knew his audience. It was quite
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59160">
     British, embued with that cloutish conceit which all popular masses in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59170">
     every successful nation instinctively display. He had appealed to their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59180">
     conceit, though not only to that, and they responded enthusiastically.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59190">
     As he finished this mild buncombe, not without some misgivings as
    </p>

     to his own honesty, as he intended at first to repair to the United
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59210">
     States, the men nearest to him grasped his hand, others shouted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59220">
     approbation, and still others in silence moved away shaking their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59230">
     heads. Leacraft talked with the men about him. He found that they had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59240">
     been assigned places in the scheme of emigration; some were going to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59250">
     Australia, with a systematic dispersion over the region, which most
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59260">
     needed their labor, others to New Zealand into socialistic farming;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59270">
     others to the cape and Rhodesia and still others to Canada; so that his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59280">
     exalted sentiment of solidarity lost a little of its impressiveness.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59290">
     Leacraft lingered a while longer, and as the day ended in a refulgent

     sunset with church bells, near and far ringing to the services, that

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59350">
     He reached Park Lane near the Kensington Gardens, Gloucester House,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59360">
     and the fountain of Thornycroft, the region of Mayfair, the dazzling

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59370">
     centre, the illustrious apse of English social splendor, where the

     no less inherited gifts of fortune; that spot in all London which
    </p>

     to relinquish, would seem to sound the depths of national disgrace.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59410">
     The moon swam in the lucent sky, the air was clear, but cold, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59420">
     the familiar ravishing softness of the June nights as London knew
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59430">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59440">
     from the ground to the enveloping air, and threw veil over veil of

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59470">
     wandered through it, from Cumberland Gate--where he saw snow still
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59480">
     resting in sheltered recesses--along Park Lane to Hyde Park Corners,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59490">
     through Grosvenor Place to Chapel street, to Belgrave Square, was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59500">
     revealed in an aerial sincerity, that gave its splendor an almost
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59510">
     scintillant loveliness, and drove still deeper into Leacraft’s heart
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59520">
     the sense of a bewildering bereavement.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59540">
     The streets were filled with flying equipages, and the mansions were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59550">
     ablaze, the sidewalks held few pedestrians, and as Leacraft sorrowfully
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59560">
     moved through the stately purlieus, music swept out from open windows
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59570">
     or swinging doors. Often he paused and watched the descending occupants
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59580">
     of the carriages; they were entrancing women and peerless men, their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59590">
     laughter was silvery and undismayed, unchecked by tears. Could it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59600">
     be possible that these inner esoteric circles of London high life

     fall of empires turn the votaries of gayety to soberer thoughts, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59630">
     stifle the intoxicating voice of pleasure? Leacraft wondered, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59640">
     the weariness of a great suspense weighed him down; the ingrained
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59650">
     Puritanism of his nature raged against this heartlessness, this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59660">
     indecent bravado, a mockery of joy, where all should be shadowed with
    </p>

     the sighs of penitence and supplication.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59690">
     Leacraft was bitterly offended at this apparent heartlessness; it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59700">
     startled him beyond the limits of endurance; he looked for some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59710">
     representative of this foolish life, upon whom to turn with rebuke
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59720">
     and denunciation. Leacraft wandered on in a disconsolate mood, and

     hours of its metropolitan sojourn in a spendthrift vortex of excitement
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59760">
     and conviviality moved him to muttered objurgations. He had slipped
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59770">
     past Hyde Park Corners, past the Apsley House, and had glided with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59780">
     hastening steps, as his passion of revolt, at this unseemly loss of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59790">
     self-respect, rose to a towering indignation, into Grosvenor Square.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59800">
     He stood facing the long facade, where in repetitive elegance, with

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59850">
     it be a frenzied spasm of indulgence, before separation forever from

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59860">
     the bliss of the West End, that terrestrial paradise of swelldom and

     financial and social glory? He wondered. And thus wondering, he came
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59880">
     to Devonshire House, fronting Piccadilly. The comfortable home, with
    </p>

     its small brick work, peeking chimney pots, the low entablature and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59900">
     triple doors behind the iron gateway, and the unbroken watch of the

     woman-headed sphinxes, on either side of the elevated escutcheon of

     the Kingdom, was there, encompassed by its imprisoning walls--and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59930">
     here, too, the effrontery of lavish gayety assaulted his eyes. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59940">
     gates were flung wide open, powdered footmen were ranged before the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59950">
     doors, arriving and departing carriages threaded Piccadilly with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59960">
     conscienceless celerity, music uttered its delicious melodies, and in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59970">
     them was no requiem note, no throb of sorrow, and the guests crowding
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59980">
     into its dazzling halls seemed untouched by thoughts less careless
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_59990">
     than the joys of the fleeting moments, whose hurrying steps were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60000">
     bringing the dawn of disaster to England. Exasperated, Leacraft turned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60010">
     on his heel in disgust, and was going towards Leicester Square, when a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60020">
     sharp report somewhere on the side of the Geological Museum, and ahead
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60030">
     of his position, startled him, and the next instant he saw a carriage,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60040">
     with prancing steeds, plunging down the street, the swaying figure of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60050">
     the driver denoting his complete loss of control, while on one side of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60060">
     the equipage, that side towards Leacraft, the pale face of a gentleman
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60070">
     was seen, and beside him the distracted visage of an elderly lady.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60080">
     As the carriage approached Leacraft, it crossed the street, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60090">
     front wheels collided with the curbing. This administered a slight
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60100">
     detention, and the struggling horses turned again to the opposite side
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60110">
     of the thoroughfare. Quick to see his advantage, Leacraft sprang to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60120">
     head of the nearer horse, and exerting all his strength, which was not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60130">
     inconsiderable, he succeeded in tripping the beast, and as it fell the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60140">
     traces holding its companion broke, and the freed creature raced away
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60150">
     down the avenue. The driver leaped to the sidewalk and held the now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60160">
     imprisoned horse, which, starting to its feet, stood trembling beside
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60170">
     him, while Leacraft hastened to the door of the vehicle to liberate its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60180">
     occupants.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60200">
     He had already been forstalled by the gentleman himself, who pushed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60210">
     the door back as Leacraft reached it and stepped to the walk,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60220">
     followed instantly by the lady in much commotion and disorder. Their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60230">
     agitation was short lived, and succumbed to the exercise of their own
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60240">
     self-control. It was the gentleman who first spoke: “I am under the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60250">
     deepest obligation to you, sir, for your quickness and your courage.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60260">
     You may readily have saved us from a miserable fate. And”--Leacraft
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60270">
     interrupted: “You were going to some _rendezvous_ of pleasure; this,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60280">
     sir, in my opinion, on the eve of the nation’s assassination deserved
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60290">
     punishment.” The speech was crude, rude perhaps, and the bitter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60300">
     taunt smote the stranger like a physical blow. He recoiled from it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60310">
     as if the sting of a cowhide had crossed his face. His face itself
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60320">
     was a study. He stared at Leacraft, and as the latter met his gaze
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60330">
     unflinchingly the pale face, distinguished in outline, feature, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60340">
     expression, flushed to the temples, while the eyes seated under bushy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60350">
     brows gazed at Leacraft with a peculiar earnestness, not relieved of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60360">
     the dangerous suggestion of a rising passion. His companion understood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60370">
     his excitement, she clutched his arm, and seemed to apprehend a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60380">
     physical outbreak. Then the mouth opened, and spoke, and the voice was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60390">
     unexpectedly calm, and the utterances measured: “We are under deep
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60400">
     obligation to you sir, but it is difficult for me to restrain myself
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60410">
     before the false statements you have ventured to make. Can you explain
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60420">
     this insult?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60440">
     He moved nearer to Leacraft who did not budge, but inspired with an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60450">
     increasing vigor of disgust, and eager to summarily remonstrate at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60460">
     seeming cruelty of the parade about him, its grotesque wickedness,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60470">
     said: “I do not wish to take advantage of the accidental relations
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60480">
     which have thus unexpectedly thrown us together. But surely it is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60490">
     known among men, and known bitterly among Englishmen that the shadows
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60500">
     of an awful twilight are falling about them, and the Nation’s Day is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60510">
     closing. At such a crisis can it be possible for men and women, calling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60520">
     themselves English, in whom the memory of English fame and English
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60530">
     glory, is still a present pride, can it be possible that at this moment
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60540">
     they still consort for amusement, for display, for the fugitive follies
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60550">
     of mutual admiration? This aristocracy is the head and forefront of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60560">
     nation, and it should now be bowed in penitence, in supplication, in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60570">
     the agony of self inquiry, and it stupifies me to find them gay, when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60580">
     the heart of England is breaking with grief.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60600">
     A curious metamorphosis worked in the lineaments of the gentleman he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60610">
     was addressing. The hard lines relaxed, and a wistful smile, that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60620">
     drew its occult meaning from the man’s interior sadness, stole softly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60630">
     over his face. He put out his hand, which Leacraft accepted, and he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60640">
     returned Leacraft’s pressure. There was an instant’s silence, and then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60650">
     the stranger spoke, still holding Leacraft’s hand, and retaining his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60660">
     undeviating inspection of Leacraft’s face, as if he would force upon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60670">
     himself the recognition of a friend.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60690">
     “These are just words, sir,” he began: “but how much you misunderstand
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60700">
     what is going on here. This apparent revelry is an effort to keep from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60710">
     swooning: it is the forced continuance of a life familiar to us, when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60720">
     that life is to be crushed into nothingness; it is the defiance of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60730">
     habit, the revolt against extinction, the mortal protest against the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60740">
     infamous tyranny of circumstances. It is a delirium of indulgence, to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60750">
     forget what is coming upon us; a moment’s arbitrary refusal to think
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60760">
     of the future, a dance, in whose whirl we shall remit the impulses of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60770">
     suicide. It is unreasonable, but its monstrous unreasonableness to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60780">
     you sir, measures our appalling sense of the disaster we can not stop
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60790">
     to think of, measures the intensity of the recoil from obliteration;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60800">
     like the dressed and garlanded victim of an Aztec immolation we taste
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60810">
     again the festive sweets upon which perhaps our cloyed appetites are no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60820">
     longer to feed. We are the sufferers in this eviction; the greatest,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60830">
     the poor, the artisan, laborer, the vast mediocrity lose something, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60840">
     it amounts to little more than the exchange of one station here, for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60850">
     another of the same sort somewhere else. In a material sense our loss
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60860">
     is incalculable; half our riches disappears but with that loss goes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60870">
     social prestige, title, and the moral consciousness of elevation, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60880">
     breath of our nostrils. I, sir, am ----.” Leacraft did not move; his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60890">
     astonishment was too sharply focussed upon all the astounding previous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60900">
     confession. “And,” continued the man, “the ruin of worldly fortune
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60910">
     seems small, after all, compared with the sacrifice of that dignified
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60920">
     and sheltered life, which moved serenely, with every accompaniment of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60930">
     joy, in these delightful abodes, and under the protecting aegis of an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60940">
     inexpressible separation from the rest of the world. But”--he seemed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60950">
     to wish to justify himself, somehow, as he noticed the still petrified
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60960">
     stare of Leacraft--“we have not been neglectful of the matters
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60970">
     of adjustment. Committees have been appointed, plans laid, funds
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60980">
     appropriated, agents despatched, for the selection of our new homes,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_60990">
     and though we take our flight with lopped wings, our plumage may in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_61000">
     time resume its former beauty. Do not misunderstand us because of these
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_61010">
     assemblies. We too carry deeper than you the pain of an unutterable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_61020">
     grief.”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_61040">
     He finished, and Leacraft drawn into a reverie over the singular
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_61050">
     confession, which was anything but reassuring, and partook, to his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_61060">
     mind, of the dementia of the foolish victim of a depraved habit, was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_61070">
     silent. He felt the imperious requirements of speech, but he could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_61080">
     say nothing. He felt pity, he was not without sympathy, though
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_61090">
     perhaps in that matter, a certain savor of self denying control, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_61100">
     a practical judgment interfered with his approval of the hyperbole of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_61110">
     the speaker. And, almost dreaming, he stood there while the stranger
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_61120">
     and his lady re-entered their carriage, to which the runaway horse had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_61130">
     been reattached, and drove off. Leacraft watched them mechanically and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_61140">
     then turned, walked down Piccadilly, crossed Green Park, and looked at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_61150">
     Buckingham Palace. The huge structure was partially illuminated, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_61160">
     the square in front of it was filled with soldiers, many of whom were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_61170">
     at rest around the Victoria Memorial. To an officer lounging near by,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_61180">
     Leacraft said, “Can you tell me where the King is to-night?”
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_61200">
     “He sleeps at St. Leonards in Shoreditch,” was the laconic reply.

     assemblage, covering stoop and roof, and leaning from every window

     gave the touch of tenderness, the atmosphere of feminine companionship,

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_61710">
     was uncovered, the Crown resting on a cushion in front of him. A cheer

     English army. As its sonorous length defiled before Leacraft, he saw
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_61860">
     an objective symbol--nay, the corporeal fact--of England’s growing

     of political tendencies, the spreading domination of English rule; it
    </p>

     The scarlet uniforms of the First Life Guards passed, and Maestricht,

    </p>

     painted the sky a seething carmine in the west, and imparted its most

     was enough detail in the landscape, enough isolation of house and wood

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_66650">
     stood Miss Tobit and Mr. Thomsen, and the month was June, and the year,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_66830">
     Leacraft motioned to the chairs, and the three sat down, in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_66840">
     same order as they stood. The place obviously was Leacraft’s, or he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_66850">
     exercised some sort of control over it. And it was Miss Tobit’s voice
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_66860">
     which next took up the thread of talk--it was noticeable that Leacraft
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_66870">
     turned eagerly and looked at her, though his earnest face betrayed no

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_66880">
     symptoms of possession, in truth, a contemplative sadness for a moment
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_66890">
     rested on his features, vanishing even with its dawn.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_66910">
     “Why give up old things? Why change and change and change? You call

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_66990">
     Both Leacraft and Thomsen laughed, but it was Leacraft who retorted,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_67000">
     and he leaned far back in the Morris chair, his eyes bent upon the

     visionary ring of the horizon now webbed with bluescent shades.

     continuity with the whole antecedent history of England practically
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_67100">
     destroyed that history for them, and they began in untrammelled freedom

     to think for themselves and determine the essence of manhood, of worth,

     With the departure of the King from the shores of England, the actual
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_68390">
     evacuation of the island began, and the means and ways of transferring
    </p>

     The moment the King and Parliament arrived in Australia, a predicament
    </p>

     arose. The King was recognized as king, functional in Australia and in
    </p>

     England, functional anywhere the English control was established; but

     the Parliament of England, as the highest law-giving legislature of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_68460">
     the realm, did it supersede the regional legislation of Australia? Was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_68470">
     the autonomic power of the provinces of Australia obliterated with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_68480">
     arrival of the supreme legislative body of the British Empire? There
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_68490">
     was one broad, obvious proposition. The remedy to all doubt, collision,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_68500">
     and ambiguity was to resume in Australia the exact conditions which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_68510">
     had vanished in England, and now naturally sought a restatement and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_68520">
     erection in the land the King and Parliament had reached. And this was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_68530">
     generally accepted. There was a cordial and almost precipitate display
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_68540">
     of adhesion to the new plan. It destroyed the independent existence
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_68550">
     of the various sections of Australia, and made the continental island
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_68560">
     a unit under the control of the Parliament, just as England had been.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_68570">
     The enthusiasm which greeted this solution was adequate and convincing.

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_68590">
     worked for the re-production of the England they had left. The King
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_68600">
     himself responded to this burst of practical allegiance with a wise
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_68610">
     and fervent expression of affection and thankfulness. It was a gem of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_68620">
     deliberate composition, and was well received. Meetings of endorsement
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_68630">
     and proclamations of ratification were made everywhere, and in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_68640">
     tumult of acclamation it escaped notice that a formidable opposition
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_68650">
     had become organized for a forcible resistance to the whole scheme.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_68660">
     This was over-awed or suppressed, not without a show of force, in

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_68850">
     sought the expanding possibilities of South America. Englishmen had

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_68880">
     natural business refuges all over its varied surface. It was a happy
    </p>

     consequence of the constraining littleness of their own island.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_69350">
     but few of the products of the soil. For now a most extraordinary thing
    </p>

     happened. The refrigeration of Northern Europe had driven down towards

     the south the northern denizens. They eagerly seized the deserted land
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_69380">
     of the southerners, less accustomed to the niggardly responses of the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_69400">
     and resistance to which they had become innured in their northern home.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_69410">
     In this way the population of Iceland almost bodily left the bleak

     and ice-bound coasts of the Arctic island, that no longer offered the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_69450">
     as it retarded in some measure the shocking decline in the values of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_69460">
     the land, and gave to all establishments that might otherwise have

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_70010">
     enough in unison with the newly awakened hopes of the King to restore
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_70020">
     an accustomed prestige to the Crown. This political phenomenon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_70030">
     attracted the attention of the civilized world. The King in a most
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_70040">
     adroit proclamation to the people had peculiarly enlisted their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_70050">
     sympathy by his veiled complaint of the habitual loss of power, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_70060">
     the encroachments upon the kingly prerogatives of the self-constituted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_70070">
     Cabinet of Ministers. The King’s action was always tacitly prescribed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_70080">
     and anticipated. He was a puppet, dressed in regalia, with no shadow
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_70090">
     of power, real and personal. And this he resented, but his language
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_70100">
     was the sentences of diplomacy, and lost the individual note entirely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_70110">
     in a concerned and measured argument, restrained by every possible
    </p>

     regard for the present custom, urging a greater confidence in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_70130">
     King’s wishes, and a larger precinct of action for his judgment. This
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_70140">
     momentous promulgation was contemptuously referred to by its critics
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_70150">
     as “the Ourselves” letter, but it met a favorable reception and it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_70160">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_70170">
     altogether resented by the House of Commons. The achievement of this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_70180">

    </p>

     appointments and in the personnel of the Cabinet, and he succeeded
    </p>

     further in impressing his wishes upon a number of important bills

     concessions of the Commons’ recognition of the royal prerogatives.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_70250">
     He had shown himself unusually active in resource, in suggestions,

     with enthusiasm by the nobility, who, so to speak, spread themselves
    </p>

     generosity and ubiquitous energy in practically assisting the work of
    </p>

     rehabilitation. At a general election, many candidates were discussed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000021_70310">
     and elected upon this issue, viz.: the restoration to the King of
