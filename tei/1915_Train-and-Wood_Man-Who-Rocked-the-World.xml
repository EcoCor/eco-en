    PROLOGUE
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_70">
    By July 1, 1916, the war had involved every civilized nation upon the
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_80">
    globe except the United States of North and of South America, which had
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_90">
    up to that time succeeded in maintaining their neutrality. Belgium,
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_100">
    Holland, Denmark, Switzerland, Poland, Austria Hungary, Lombardy, and
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_110">
    Servia, had been devastated. Five million adult male human beings had
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_120">
    been exterminated by the machines of war, by disease, and by famine. Ten
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_130">
    million had been crippled or invalided. Fifteen million women and
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_140">
    children had been rendered widows or orphans. Industry there was none.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_150">
    No crops were harvested or sown. The ocean was devoid of sails.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_160">
    Throughout European Christendom women had taken the place of men as
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_170">
    field hands, labourers, mechanics, merchants, and manufacturers. The
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_180">
    amalgamated debt of the involved nations, amounting to more than
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_190">
    $100,000,000,000, had bankrupted the world. Yet the starving armies
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_200">
    continued to slaughter one another.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_220">
    Siberia was a vast charnel-house of Tartars, Chinese, and Russians.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_230">
    Northern Africa was a holocaust. Within sixty miles of Paris lay an army
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_240">
    of two million Germans, while three million Russians had invested
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_250">
    Berlin. In Belgium an English army of eight hundred and fifty thousand
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_260">
    men faced an equal force of Prussians and Austrians, neither daring to
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_270">
    take the offensive.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_290">
    The inventive genius of mankind, stimulated by the exigencies of war,
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_300">
    had produced a multitude of death-dealing mechanisms, most of which had
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_310">
    in turn been rendered ineffective by some counter-invention of another
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_320">
    nation. Three of these products of the human brain, however, remained
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_330">
    unneutralized and in large part accounted for the impasse at which the
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_340">
    hostile armies found themselves. One of these had revolutionized warfare
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_350">
    in the field, and the other two had destroyed those two most important
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_360">
    factors of the preliminary campaign--the aeroplane and the submarine.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_370">
    The German dirigibles had all been annihilated within the first ten
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_380">
    months of the war in their great cross-channel raid by Pathé contact
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_390">
    bombs trailed at the ends of wires by high-flying French planes. This,
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_400">
    of course, had from the beginning been confidently predicted by the
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_410">
    French War Department. But by November, 1915, both the allied and the
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_420">
    German aerial fleets had been wiped from the clouds by Federston's
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_430">
    vortex guns, which by projecting a whirling ring of air to a height of
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_440">
    over five thousand feet crumpled the craft in mid-sky like so many
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_450">
    butterflies in a simoon.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_470">
    The second of these momentous inventions was Captain Barlow's device for
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_480">
    destroying the periscopes of submarines, thus rendering them blind and
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_490">
    helpless. Once they were forced to the surface such craft were easily
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_500">
    destroyed by gun fire or driven to a sullen refuge in protecting
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_510">
    harbours.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_530">
    The third, and perhaps the most vital, invention was Dufay's
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_540">
    nitrogen-iodide pellets, which when sown by pneumatic guns upon the
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_550">
    slopes of a battlefield, the ground outside intrenchments, or round the
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_560">
    glacis of a fortification made approach by an attacking army impossible
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_570">
    and the position impregnable. These pellets, only the size of No. 4 bird
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_580">
    shot and harmless out of contact with air, became highly explosive two
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_590">
    minutes after they had been scattered broadcast upon the soil, and any
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_600">
    friction would discharge them with sufficient force to fracture or
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_610">
    dislocate the bones of the human foot or to put out of service the leg
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_620">
    of a horse. The victim attempting to drag himself away inevitably
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_630">
    sustained further and more serious injuries, and no aid could be given
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_640">
    to the injured, as it was impossible to reach them. A field well planted
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_650">
    with such pellets was an impassable barrier to either infantry or
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_660">
    cavalry, and thus any attack upon a fortified position was doomed to
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_670">
    failure. By surprise alone could a general expect to achieve a victory.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_680">
    Offensive warfare had come almost to a standstill.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_700">
    Germany had seized Holland, Denmark, and Switzerland. Italy had annexed
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_710">
    Dalmatia and the Trentino; and a new Slav republic had arisen out of
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_720">
    what had been Hungary, Croatia, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Servia, Roumania,
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_730">
    Montenegro, Albania, and Bulgaria. Turkey had vanished from the map of
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_740">
    Europe; while the United States of South America, composed of the
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_750">
    Spanish-speaking South American Republics, had been formed. The
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_760">
    mortality continued at an average of two thousand a day, of which 75 per
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_770">
    cent. was due to starvation and the plague. Maritime commerce had ceased
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_780">
    entirely, and in consequence of this the merchant ships of all nations
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_790">
    rotted at the docks.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_810">
    The Emperor of Germany, and the kings of England and of Italy, had all
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_820">
    voluntarily abdicated in favour of a republican form of government.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_830">
    Europe and Asia had run amuck, hysterical with fear and blood. As well
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_840">
    try to pacify a pack of mad and fighting dogs as these frenzied myriads
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_850">
    with their half-crazed generals. They lay, these armies, across the fair
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_860">
    bosom of the earth like dying monsters, crimson in their own blood, yet
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_870">
    still able to writhe upward and deal death to any other that might
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_880">
    approach. They were at a deadlock, yet each feared to make the first
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_890">
    overtures for peace. There was, in actuality, no longer even an English
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_900">
    or a German nation. It was an orgy of homicide, in which the best of
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_910">
    mankind were wantonly destroyed, leaving only the puny, the
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_920">
    feeble-minded, the deformed, and the ineffectual to perpetuate the race.

    I

   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1000">
    It was three minutes past three postmeridian in the operating room of
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1010">
    the new Wireless Station recently installed at the United States Naval
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1020">
    Observatory at Georgetown. Bill Hood, the afternoon operator, was
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1030">
    sitting in his shirt sleeves with his receivers at his ears, smoking a
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1040">
    corncob pipe and awaiting a call from the flagship _Lincoln_ of the
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1050">
    North Atlantic Patrol with which, somewhere just off Hatteras, he had
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1060">
    been in communication a few moments before. The air was quiet.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1080">
    Hood was a fat man, and so of course good-natured; but he was serious
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1090">
    about his work and hated all interfering amateurs. Of late these
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1100">
    wireless pests had become particularly obnoxious, as practically
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1110">
    everything was sent out in code and they had nothing with which to
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1120">
    occupy themselves. But it was a hot day and none of them seemed to be at
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1130">
    work. On one side of his desk a tall thermometer indicated that the
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1140">
    temperature of the room was 91 degrees Fahrenheit; on the other a big
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1150">
    clock, connected with some extraneous mechanism by a complicated system
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1160">
    of brass rods and wires, ticked off the minutes and seconds with a
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1170">
    peculiar metallic self-consciousness, as if aware of its own importance
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1180">
    in being the official timepiece, as far as there was an official
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1190">
    timepiece, for the entire United States of America.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1210">
    Hood from time to time tested his converters and detector, and then
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1220">
    resumed his non-official study of the adventures of a great detective
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1230">
    who pursued the baffling criminal by the aid of all the latest
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1240">
    scientific discoveries. Hood thought it was good stuff, although at the
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1250">
    same time he knew, of course, that it was rot. He was a practical man of
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1260">
    little imagination, and, though the detective did not interest him
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1270">
    particularly, he liked the scientific part of the stories. He was
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1280">
    thrifty, of Scotch-Irish descent, and at two minutes past three had
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1290">
    never had an adventure in his life. At three minutes past three he began
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1300">
    his career as one of the celebrities of the world.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1320">
    As the minute hand of the official clock dropped into its slot somebody
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1330">
    called the Naval Observatory. The call was so faint as to be barely
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1340">
    audible, in spite of the fact that Hood's instrument was tuned for a
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1350">
    three-thousand-metre wave. Supposing quite naturally that the person
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1360">
    calling had a shorter wave, he gradually cut out the inductance of his
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1370">
    receiver; but the sound faded out entirely, and he returned to his
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1380">
    original inductance and shunted in his condenser, upon which the call
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1390">
    immediately increased in volume. Evidently the other chap was using a
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1400">
    big wave, bigger than Georgetown.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1420">
    Hood puckered his brows and looked about him. Lying on a shelf above his
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1430">
    instrument was one of the new ballast coils that Henderson had used with
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1440">
    the long waves from lightning flashes, and he leaned over and connected
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1450">
    the heavy spiral of closely wound wire, throwing it into his circuit.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1460">
    Instantly the telephones spoke so loud that he could hear the shrill cry
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1470">
    of the spark even from where the receivers lay beside him on the table.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1480">
    Quickly fastening them to his ears he listened. The sound was clear,
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1490">
    sharp, and metallic, and vastly higher in pitch than a ship's call. It
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1500">
    couldn't be the _Lincoln_.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1520">
    "By gum!" muttered Hood. "That fellow must have a twelve-thousand-metre
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1530">
    wave length with fifty kilowatts behind it, sure! There ain't another
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1540">
    station in the world but this can pick him up!"
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1560">
    "NAA--NAA--NAA," came the call.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1580">
    Throwing in his rheostat he sent an "O.K" in reply, and waited
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1590">
    expectantly, pencil in hand. A moment more and he dropped his pencil in
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1600">
    disgust.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1620">
    "Just another bug!" he remarked aloud to the thermometer. "Ought to be
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1630">
    poisoned! What a whale of a wave length, though!"
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1650">
    For several minutes he listened intently, for the amateur was sending
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_1660">

   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2070">
    The following Thursday afternoon a perspiring and dusty stranger from
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2080">
    St. Louis, who, with the Metropolitan Art Museum as his objective, was
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2090">
    trudging wearily through Central Park, New York City, at two o'clock,
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2100">
    paused to gaze with some interest at the obelisk known as Cleopatra's
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2110">
    Needle. The heat rose in shimmering waves from the asphalt of the
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2120">
    roadway, but the stranger was used to heat and he was conscientiously
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2130">
    engaged in the duty of seeing New York. Opposite the Museum he seated
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2140">
    himself upon a bench in the shade of a faded dogwood and wiped the
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2150">
    moisture from his eyes. The glare from the unprotected boulevards was
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2160">
    terrific. Under these somewhat unfavourable conditions he was occupied
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2170">
    in studying the monument of Egypt's past magnificence when he felt a
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2180">
    slight dragging sensation. It was indefinable and had no visual
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2190">
    concomitant. But it was as though the brakes were being gently applied
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2200">
    to a Pullman train. He was the only human being in the neighbourhood;
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2210">
    not even a policeman was visible; and the experience gave him a creepy
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2220">
    feeling. Then to his amazement Cleopatra's Needle slowly toppled from
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2230">
    its pedestal and fell with a crash across the roadway. At first he
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2240">
    thought it an optical illusion and wiped his eyes again, but it was
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2250">
    nothing of the kind. The monument, which had a moment before pointed to
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2260">
    the zenith, now lay shattered in three pieces upon the softening
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2270">
    concrete of the drive. The stranger arose and examined the fragments of
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2280">
    the monolith, one of which lay squarely across the road, barring all
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2290">
    passage. Round the pedestal were scattered small pieces of broken
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2300">
    granite, and from these, after looking about cautiously, he chose one
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2310">
    with care and placed it in his pocket.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2330">
    "Gosh!" he whispered to himself as he hurried toward Fifth Avenue.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2340">
    "That'll just be something to tell 'em at home! Eh, Bill?"

    The dragging sensation experienced by the tourist from St. Louis was

    felt by many millions of people all over the world, but, as in most

    countries it occurred coincidently with pronounced earthquake shocks and
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2390">

   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2400">
    individual phenomenon.

   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2420">
    Hood, in the wireless room at Georgetown, suddenly heard in his
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2430">
    receivers a roar like that of Niagara and quickly removed them from his
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2440">
    ears. He had never known such statics. He was familiar with electrical
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2450">
    disturbances in the ether, but this was beyond anything in his
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2460">
    experience. Moreover, when he next tried to use his instruments he
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2470">
    discovered that something had put the whole apparatus out of commission.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2480">
    About an hour later he felt a pronounced pressure in his eardrums, which
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2490">
    gradually passed off. The wireless refused to work for nearly eight
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2500">
    hours, and it was still recalcitrant when he went off duty at seven
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2510">
    o'clock. He had not felt the quivering of the earth round Washington,
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2520">
    and being an unimaginative man he accepted the other facts of the
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2530">
    situation philosophically. The statics would pass, and then Georgetown
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2540">
    would be in communication with the rest of the world again, that was
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2550">
    all. At seven o'clock the night shift came in, and Hood borrowed a
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2560">
    pipeful of tobacco from him and put on his coat.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2580">
    "Say, Bill, did you feel the shock?" asked the shift, hanging up his hat
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2590">
    and taking a match from Hood.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2610">
    "No," answered the latter, "but the statics have put the machine on the

   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2680">
    pressure? I should worry! And say, I just dropped into the

    Meteorological Department's office and looked at the barometer. She'd
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2700">

   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2750">
    He nodded his head with an air of importance.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2770">
    "Take your word for it," answered Hood without emotion, save for a
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2780">
    slight annoyance at the other's arrogation of superior information.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2790">
    "'Tain't the first time there's been an earthquake since creation." And
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2800">
    he strolled out, swinging to the doors behind him.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2820">
    The night shift settled himself before the instruments with a look of
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2830">
    dreary resignation.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2850">
    "Say," he muttered aloud, "you couldn't jar that feller with a
   </p>

    thirteen-inch bomb! He wouldn't even rub himself!"
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2880">
    Hood, meantime, bought an evening paper and walked slowly to the
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2890">
    district where he lived. It was a fine night and there was no particular
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2900">
    excitement in the streets. His wife opened the door.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2920">
    "Well," she greeted him, "I'm glad you've come home at last. I was plumb
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2930">
    scared something had happened to you. Such a shaking and rumbling and
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2940">
    rattling I never did hear! Did you feel it?"
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2960">
    "I didn't feel nothin'!" answered Bill Hood. "Some one said there was a
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2970">
    shock, that was all I heard about it. The machine's out of kilter."
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_2990">
    "They won't blame you, will they?" she asked anxiously.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3010">
    "You bet they won't!" he replied. "Look here, I'm hungry. Are the

    He did as he was directed, and seated himself in a rocker under the

    men calmly studied the procession of the stars--the onward bore of the
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3690">
    universe through space, and the spectra of newborn or dying worlds.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3710">
    It was a suffocatingly hot night and their foreheads reeked with sweat.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3720">
    Dim shapes on the walls of the room indicated what by day was a tangle
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3730">
    of clockwork and recording instruments, connected by electricity with
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3740">
    various buttons and switches upon the table. The brother of the big
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3750">
    clock in the wireless operating room hung nearby, its face illuminated
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3760">
    by a tiny electric lamp, showing the hour to be eleven-fifty.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3770">
    Occasionally the younger man made a remark in a low tone, and the elder
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3780">
    wrote something on a card.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3800">
    "The 'seeing' is poor to-night," said Evarts, the younger man. "The
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3810">
    upper air is full of striae and, though it seems like a clear night,
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3820">
    everything looks dim--a volcanic haze probably. Perhaps the Aleutian
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3830">
    Islands are in eruption again."
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3850">
    "Very likely," answered Thornton, the elder astronomer. "The shocks this
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3860">
    afternoon would indicate something of the sort."
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3880">
    "Curious performance of the magnetic needle. They say it held due east
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3890">
    for several minutes," continued Evarts, hoping to engage his senior in
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3900">
    conversation--almost an impossibility, as he well knew.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3920">
    Thornton did not reply. He was carefully observing the infinitesimal
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3930">
    approach of a certain star to the meridian line, marked by a thread
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3940">
    across the circle's aperture. When that point of light should cross the
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3950">
    thread it would be midnight, and July 22, 1916, would be gone forever.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3960">
    Every midnight the indicating stars crossed the thread exactly on time,
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3970">
    each night a trifle earlier than the night before by a definite and
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3980">
    calculable amount, due to the march of the earth around the sun. So they
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_3990">
    had crossed the lines in every observatory since clocks and telescopes
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4000">
    had been invented. Heretofore, no matter what cataclysm of nature had
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4010">
    occurred, the star had always crossed the line not a second too soon or
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4020">
    a second too late, but exactly on time. It was the one positively
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4030">
    predictable thing, foretellable for ten or for ten thousand years by a
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4040">
    simple mathematical calculation. It was surer than death or the tax-man.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4050">
    It was absolute.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4070">
    Thornton was a reserved man of few words--impersonal, methodical,
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4080">
    serious. He spent many nights there with Evarts, hardly exchanging a
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4090">
    phrase with him, and then only on some matter immediately concerned with
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4100">
    their work. Evarts could dimly see his long, grave profile bending over
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4110">
    his eyepiece, shrouded in the heavy shadows across the table. He felt a
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4120">
    great respect, even tenderness, for this taciturn, high-principled,
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4130">
    devoted scientist. He had never seen him excited, hardly ever aroused.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4140">
    He was a man of figures, whose only passion seemed to be the "music of
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4150">
    the spheres."
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4170">
    A long silence followed, during which Thornton seemed to bend more
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4180">
    intently than ever over his eyepiece. The hand of the big clock slipped
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4190">
    gradually to midnight.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4210">
    "There's something wrong with the clock," said Thornton suddenly, and
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4220">
    his voice sounded curiously dry, almost unnatural. "Telephone to the
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4230">
    equatorial room for the time."
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4250">
    Puzzled by Thornton's manner Evarts did as instructed.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4270">
    "Forty seconds past midnight," came the reply from the equatorial
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4280">
    observer.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4300">
    Evarts repeated the answer for Thornton's benefit, looking at their own
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4310">
    clock at the same time. It pointed to exactly forty seconds past the
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4320">
    hour. He heard Thornton suppress something like an oath.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4340">
    "There's something the matter!" repeated Thornton dumbly. "Aeta isn't
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4350">
    within five minutes of crossing. Both clocks can't be wrong!"
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4370">
    He pressed a button that connected with the wireless room.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4390">
    "What's the time?" he called sharply through the nickel-plated
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4400">
    speaking-tube.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4420">
    "Forty-five seconds past the hour," came the answer. Then: "But I want
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4430">
    to see you, sir. There's something queer going on. May I come in?"
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4450">
    "Come!" almost shouted Thornton.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4470">
    A moment later the flushed face of Williams, the night operator,
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4480">
    appeared in the doorway.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4500">
    "Excuse me, sir," he stammered, "but something fierce must have
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4510">
    happened! I thought you ought to know. The Eiffel Tower has been trying
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4520">
    to talk to us for over two hours, but I can't get what he's saying."
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4540">
    "What's the matter--atmospherics?" snapped Evarts.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4560">
    "No; the air _was_ full of them, sir--shrieking with them you might say;
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4570">
    but they've stopped now. The trouble has been that I've been jammed by
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4580">
    the Brussels station talking to the Belgian Congo--same wave length--and
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4590">
    I couldn't tune Brussels out. Every once in a while I'd get a word of
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4600">
    what Paris was saying, and it's always the same word--'_heure_.' But
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4610">
    just now Brussels stopped sending and I got the complete message of the
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4620">
    Eiffel Tower. They wanted to know our time by Greenwich. I gave it to
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4630">
    'em. Then Paris said to tell you to take your transit with great care
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4640">
    and send result to them immediately----"
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4660">
    The ordinarily calm Thornton gave a great suspiration and his face was
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4670">
    livid. "Aeta's just crossed--we're five minutes out! Evarts, am I crazy?
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4680">
    Am I talking straight?"
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4700">
    Evarts laid his hand on the other's arm.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4720">
    "The earthquake's knocked out your transit," he suggested.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4740">
    "And Paris--how about Paris?" asked Thornton. He wrote something down on
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4750">
    a card mechanically and started for the door. "Get me the Eiffel Tower!"
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4760">
    he ordered Williams.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4780">
    The three men stood motionless, as the wireless man sent the Eiffel
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4790">
    Tower call hurtling across the Atlantic:
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4810">
    "ETA--ETA--ETA."
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4830">
    "All right," whispered Williams, "I've got 'em."
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4850">
    "Tell Paris that our clocks are all out five minutes according to the

   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4880">
    Williams worked the key rapidly, and then listened.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4900">
    "The Eiffel Tower says that their chronometers also appear to be out by

    Wait a minute! He says Moscow has wired that at eight o'clock last

   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4930">
    evening a tremendous aurora of bright yellow light was seen to the

   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4950">
    wants to know if we have any explanation to offer----"
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4970">
    "Explanation!" gasped Evarts. "Tell Paris that we had earthquake shocks
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_4980">
    here together with violent seismic movements, sudden rise in barometer,
   </p>

    followed by fall, statics, and erratic variation in the magnetic

   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5020">
    "What does it all mean?" murmured Thornton, staring blankly at the
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5030">
    younger man.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5050">
    The key rattled and the rotary spark whined into a shriek. Then silence.

   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5070">
    "Paris says that the same manifestations have been observed in Russia,

   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5090">
    Nauen's calling." Again he sent the blue flame crackling between the

   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5100">
    coils. "Nauen reports an error of five minutes in their meridian

    Evarts whistled.

    "How about it?" he asked of Thornton.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5210">
    The latter shook his head gravely.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5230">
    "It may be--explainable--or," he added hoarsely, "it may mean the end of

    the world."
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5260">
    Williams sprang from his chair and confronted Thornton.

   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5280">
    "What do you mean?" he almost shouted.
   </p>
   <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5300">
    "Perhaps the universe is running down!" said Evarts soothingly. "At any

     2. THE NEGATIVE ACCELERATION. This phenomenon was observed
    </head>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5810">
     to a greater or less extent all over the globe. It was especially
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5820">
     marked near the equator; but in Northern Europe it was noted by only
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5830">
     a few observers, though many clocks were stopped and other
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5840">
     instruments deranged. There appears to be no doubt that a force of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5850">
     terrific magnitude was applied in a tangential direction to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5860">
     surface of the earth, in such a direction as to oppose its axial
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5870">
     rotation, with the effect that the surface velocity was diminished
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5880">
     by about one part in three hundred, resulting in a lengthening of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5890">
     the day by five minutes, thirteen and a half seconds.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5910">
     The application of this brake--(_Bremsekraft_), as we may term
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5920">
     it--caused acceleration phenomena to manifest themselves precisely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5930">
     as on a railroad train when being brought to a stop. The change in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5940">
     the surface speed of the earth at the equator has amounted to about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5950">
     6.4 kilometres an hour; and various observations show that this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5960">
     change of velocity was brought about by the operation of the unknown
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5970">
     force for a period of time of less than three minutes. The negative
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5980">
     acceleration thus represented would certainly be too small to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_5990">
     produce any marked physiological sensations, and yet the reports
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6000">
     from various places indicate that they were certainly observed. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6010">
     sensations felt are usually described as similar to those
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6020">
     experienced in a moving automobile when the brake is very gently
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6030">
     applied.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6050">
     Moreover, certain destructive actions are reported from localities
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6060">
     near the equator--chimneys fell and tall buildings swayed; while
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6070">
     from New York comes the report that the obelisk in Central Park was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6080">
     thrown from its pedestal. It appears that these effects were due to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6090">
     the circumstance that the alteration of velocity was propagated
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6100">
     through the earth as a wave similar to an earthquake wave, and that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6110">
     the effects were cumulative at certain points--a theory that is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6120">
     substantiated by reports that at certain localities, even near the
    </p>

     3. TIDAL WAVES. These were observed everywhere and were
    </head>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6150">
     very destructive in many places. In the Panama Canal, which is near
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6160">
     the equator and which runs nearly east and west, the sweep of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6170">
     water was so great that it flowed over the Gatun Lock. On the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6180">
     eastern coasts of the various continents there was a recession of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6190">
     the sea, the fall of the tide being from three to five metres below
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6200">
     the low-water mark. On the western coasts there was a corresponding
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6210">
     rise, which in some cases reached a level of over twelve metres.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6230">
     That the tidal phenomena were not more marked and more destructive
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6240">
     is a matter of great surprise, and has been considered as evidence
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6250">
     that the retarding force was not applied at a single spot on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6260">
     earth's surface, but was a distributed force, which acted on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6270">
     water as well as on the land, though to a less extent. It is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6280">
     difficult, however, to conceive of a force capable of acting in such
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6290">
     a way; and Björnson's theory of the magnetic vortex in the ether has
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6300">
     been rejected by this commission.

     of the yellow aurora a sudden rise in atmospheric pressure, followed

     the time of arrival of this disturbance at widely separated points
    </p>

     show that it proceeded with the velocity of sound from a point
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6370">
     situated probably in Northern Labrador. The maximum rise of pressure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6380">
     recorded was registered at Halifax, the self-recording barographs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6390">

     5. SHIFT IN DIRECTION OF THE EARTH'S AXIS. The axis of the
    </head>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6420">
     earth has been shifted in space by the disturbance and now points
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6440">
     change appears to have resulted from the circumstance that the force
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6450">
     was applied to the surface of the globe in a direction not quite
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6460">
     parallel to the direction of rotation, the result being the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6470">
     development of a new axis and a shift in the positions of the poles,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6480">
     which it will now be necessary to rediscover.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6500">
     It appears that these most remarkable cosmic phenomena can be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6510">
     explained in either of two ways: they may have resulted from an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6520">
     explosive or volcanic discharge from the surface of the earth, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6530">
     from the oblique impact of a meteoric stream moving at a very high
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6540">
     velocity. It seems unlikely that sufficient energy to bring about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6550">
     the observed changes could have been developed by a volcanic
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6560">
     disturbance of the ordinary type; but if radioactive forces are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6570">
     allowed to come into play the amount of energy available is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6580">
     practically unlimited.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6600">
     It is difficult, however, to conceive of any way in which a sudden
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6610">
     liberation of atomic energy could have been brought about by any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6620">
     terrestrial agency; so that the first theory, though able to account
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6630">
     for the facts, seems to be the less tenable of the two. The meteoric
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6640">
     theory offers no especial difficulty. The energy delivered by a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6650">
     comparatively small mass of finely divided matter, moving at a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6660">
     velocity of several hundred kilometres a second--and such a velocity
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6670">
     is by no means unknown--would be amply sufficient to alter the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6680">
     velocity of rotation by the small amount observed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6700">
     Moreover, the impact of such a meteoric stream may have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6710">
     developed a temperature sufficiently high to bring about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6720">
     radioactive changes, the effect of which would be to expel
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6730">
     helium and other disintegration products at cathode-ray
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6740">
     velocity--(_Kathoden-Strahlen-Fortpflanzung-Geschwindigkeit_)--from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6750">
     the surface of the earth; and the recoil exerted by this expulsion
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6760">
     would add itself to the force of the meteoric impact.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6780">
     The presence of helium makes this latter hypothesis not altogether
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6790">
     improbable, while the atmospheric wave of pressure would result at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_6800">
     once from the disruption of the air by the passage of the meteor

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7570">
     Great Britain, Russia, Germany, and France are doing the same. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7580">
     scientists report that the yellow aurora seen in the north, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7590">
     earthquakes, the variation of the compass, and the eccentricities of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7600">
     barometer are probably all connected more or less directly with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7610">
     change in the earth's orbit. But they offer no explanation. They do not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7620">
     suggest what the aurora is nor why its appearance should have this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7630">
     effect. It, therefore, seems to me clearly my duty to lay before you all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7640">
     the facts as far as they are known to me. Among these facts are the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7650">
     mysterious messages received by wireless at the Naval Observatory
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7660">
     immediately preceding these events."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7680">
     "_Post hoc, ergo propter hoc!_" half sneered Von Koenitz.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7700">
     The President smiled wearily.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7720">
     "What do you wish me to do?" he asked, glancing round the table. "Shall
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7730">
     we remain inactive? Shall we wait and see what may happen?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7750">
     "No! No!" shouted Rostoloff, jumping to his feet. "Another week and we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7760">
     may all be plunged into eternity. It is suicidal not to regard this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7770">
     matter seriously. We are sick from war. And perhaps Count von Koenitz,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7780">
     in view of the fall of Berlin, would welcome something of the sort as an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7790">
     honourable way out of his country's difficulties."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7810">
     "Sir!" cried the count, leaping to his feet. "Have a care! It has cost
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7820">
     Russia four million men to reach Berlin. When we have taken Paris we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7830">
     shall recapture Berlin and commence the march of our victorious eagles
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7840">
     toward Moscow and the Winter Palace."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7860">
     "Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Be seated, I implore you!" exclaimed the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7870">
     President.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7890">
     The Russian and German ambassadors somewhat ungraciously resumed their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7900">
     former places, casting at each other glances of undisguised contempt.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7920">
     "As I see the matter," continued the President, "there are two distinct
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7930">
     propositions before you: The first relates to how far the extraordinary
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7940">
     events of the past week are of such a character as to demand joint
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7950">
     investigation and action by the Powers. The second involves the cause of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7960">
     these events and their connection with and relation to the sender of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7970">
     messages signed Pax. I shall ask you to signify your opinion as to each
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_7980">
     of these questions."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8000">
     "I believe that some action should be taken, based on the assumption
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8010">
     that they are manifestations of one and the same power or cause," said
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8020">
     Monsieur Liban emphatically.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8040">
     "I agree with the French Ambassador," growled Rostoloff.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8060">
     "I am of opinion that the phenomena should be the subject of proper
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8070">
     scientific investigation," remarked Count von Koenitz more calmly. "But
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8080">
     as far as these messages are concerned they are, if I may be pardoned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8090">
     for saying so, a foolish joke. It is undignified to take any cognizance
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8100">
     of them."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8120">
     "What do you think, Sir John?" asked the President, turning to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8130">
     English Ambassador.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8150">
     "Before making up my mind," returned the latter quietly, "I should like
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8160">
     to see the operator who received them."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8180">
     "By all means!" exclaimed Von Koenitz.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8200">
     The President pressed a button and his secretary entered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8220">
     "I had anticipated such a desire on the part of all of you," he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8230">
     announced, "and arranged to have him here. He is waiting outside. Shall
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8240">
     I have him brought in?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8260">
     "Yes! Yes!" answered Rostoloff. And the others nodded.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8280">
     The door opened, and Bill Hood, wearing his best new blue suit and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8290">
     nervously twisting a faded bicycle cap between his fingers, stumbled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8300">
     awkwardly into the room. His face was bright red with embarrassment and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8310">
     one of his cheeks exhibited a marked protuberance. He blinked in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8320">
     glare of the electric light.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8340">
     "Mr. Hood," the President addressed him courteously, "I have sent for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8350">
     you to explain to these gentlemen, who are the ambassadors of the great
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8360">
     European Powers, the circumstances under which you received the wireless
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8370">
     messages from the unknown person describing himself as 'Pax.'"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8390">
     Hood shifted from his right to his left foot and pressed his lips
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8400">
     together. Von Koenitz fingered the waxed ends of his moustache and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8410">
     regarded the operator whimsically.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8430">
     "In the first place," went on the President, "we desire to know whether
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8440">
     the messages which you have reported were received under ordinary or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8450">
     under unusual conditions. In a word, could you form any opinion as to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8460">
     the whereabouts of the sender?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8480">
     Hood scratched the side of his nose in a manner politely doubtful.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8500">
     "Sure thing, your Honour," he answered at last. "Sure the conditions was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8510">
     unusual. That feller has some juice and no mistake."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8530">
     "Juice?" inquired Von Koenitz.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8550">
     "Yare--current. Whines like a steel top. Fifty kilowatts sure, and maybe
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8560">
     more! And a twelve-thousand-metre wave."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8580">
     "I do not fully understand," interjected Rostoloff. "Please explain,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8590">
     sir."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8610">
     "Ain't nothin' to explain," returned Hood. "He's just got a hell of a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8620">
     wave length, that's all. Biggest on earth. We're only tuned for a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8630">
     three-thousand-metre wave. At first I could hardly take him at all. I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8640">
     had to throw in our new Henderson ballast coils before I could hear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8650">
     properly. I reckon there ain't another station in Christendom can get
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8660">
     him."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8680">
     "Ah," remarked Von Koenitz. "One of your millionaire amateurs, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8690">
     suppose."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8710">
     "Yare," agreed Hood. "I thought sure he was a nut."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8730">
     "A what?" interrupted Sir John Smith.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8750">
     "A nut," answered Hood. "A crank, so to speak."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8770">
     "Ah, 'krank'!" nodded the German. "Exactly--a lunatic! That is precisely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8780">
     what I say!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8800">
     "But I don't think it's no nut now," countered Hood valiantly. "If he is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8810">
     a bug he's the biggest bug in all creation, that's all I can say. He's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8820">
     got the goods, that's what he's got. He'll do some damage before he gets
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8830">
     through."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8850">
     "Are these messages addressed to anybody in particular?" inquired Sir
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8860">
     John, who was studying Hood intently.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8880">
     "Well, they are and they ain't. Pax--that's what he calls
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8890">
     himself--signals NAA, our number, you understand, and then says what he

     '_Silas Snooks_'----"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8940">
     "What?" ejaculated Von Koenitz impatiently.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8960">
     "Snooks--man's name--feller in the book--nothing to do with this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8970">
     business," explained the operator. "I forgot all about it. But after the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8980">
     earthquake and all the rest of the fuss I dug it out and gave it to Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_8990">
     Thornton. Then on the 27th came the next one, saying that Pax was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9000">
     getting tired of waiting for us and was going to start something. That
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9010">
     came at one o'clock in the afternoon, and the fun began at three sharp.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9020">
     The whole observatory went on the blink. Say, there ain't any doubt in

     your minds that it's _him_, is there?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9050">
     Von Koenitz looked cynically round the room.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9070">
     "There is not!" exclaimed Rostoloff and Liban in the same breath.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9090">
     The German laughed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9110">
     "Speak for yourselves, Excellencies," he sneered. His tone nettled the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9120">
     wireless representative of the sovereign American people.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9140">
     "Do you think I'm a liar?" he demanded, clenching his jaw and glaring at

     Von Koenitz.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9170">
     The German Ambassador shrugged his shoulders again. Such things were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9180">
     impossible in a civilized country--at Potsdam--but what could you
    </p>

     expect----
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9210">
     "Steady, Hood!" whispered Thornton.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9230">
     "Remember, Mr. Hood, that you are here to answer our questions," said
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9240">
     the President sternly. "You must not address his Excellency, Baron von
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9250">
     Koenitz, in this fashion."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9270">
     "But the man was making a monkey of me!" muttered Hood. "All I say is,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9280">
     look out. This Pax is on his job and means business. I just got another
    </p>

     call before I came over here--at nine o'clock."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9310">
     "What was its purport?" inquired the President.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9330">
     "Why, it said Pax was getting tired of nothing being done and wanted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9340">
     action of some sort. Said that men were dying like flies, and he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9350">
     proposed to put an end to it at any cost. And--and----"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9370">
     "Yes! Yes!" ejaculated Liban breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9390">
     "And he would give further evidence of his control over the forces of

     nature to-night."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9420">
     "Ha! Ha!" Von Koenitz leaned back in amusement. "My friend," he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9430">
     chuckled, "you--are--the 'nut'!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9450">
     What form Hood's resentment might have taken is problematical; but as

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9460">
     the German's words left his mouth the electric lights suddenly went out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9470">
     and the windows rattled ominously. At the same moment each occupant of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9480">
     the room felt himself sway slightly toward the east wall, on which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9490">
     appeared a bright yellow glow. Instinctively they all turned to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9500">
     window which faced the north. The whole sky was flooded with an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9510">
     orange-yellow aurora that rivalled the sunlight in intensity.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9530">
     "What'd I tell you?" mumbled Hood.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9550">
     The Executive Mansion quivered, and even in that yellow light the faces
    </p>

     of the ambassadors seemed pale with fear. And then as the glow slowly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9570">
     faded in the north there floated down across the aperture of the window
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9580">
     something soft and fluffy like feathers. Thicker and faster it came
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9590">
     until the lawn of the White House was covered with it. The air in the

     "Now are you satisfied?" cried Liban to the German.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9700">
     "Satisfied?" growled Von Koenitz. "I have seen plenty of snowstorms in

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9760">
     "What, then, do you require?" gasped Liban.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9780">
     "More than a snowstorm!" retorted the German. "When I was a boy at the

     "What, then, shall be done?" inquired Rostoloff anxiously. "The world

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_9950">
     "Your Excellencies"--Von Koenitz arose and took up a graceful position

     at the end of the table--"I must protest against what seems to me to be

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_10020">
     thing we know: No power on or of the earth can possibly derange its

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_10040">
     'lifting one's self by one's own boot-straps.' I do not doubt the

     "Count von Koenitz," replied Sir John after a pause, "you speak
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_10240">
     "My dear Sir John," returned Von Koenitz courteously, "my ultimate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_10250">
     answer is that we have no adequate reason to connect the phenomena which

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_10280">
     "That," interposed the President, "is something upon which individuals

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_10320">
     "Assuredly," answered Von Koenitz. "Should the sender of these messages

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_10360">
     Monsieur Liban had also arisen and was walking nervously up and down the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_10380">
     emotion cried: "Let us then invite Pax to give us a sign that will

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_10410">
     "Monsieur Liban," replied Von Koenitz stiffly, "I refuse to place myself

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_10440">
     "Very well," shouted the Frenchman, "I will take the responsibility of

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_10480">
     He drew a notebook and a fountain pen from his pocket and carefully
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_10490">
     wrote out a message which he handed to the President. The latter read it

     ready to send the most famous message ever transmitted through the

     began calling:

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11530">
     Ali was at peace with himself and with the world, including even the

     irritating Chud. The west darkened and the stars burned more

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11550">
     brilliantly. With the hookah gurgling softly at his feet, Mohammed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11560">
     leaned back his head and gazed in silent appreciation at the wonders of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11570">
     the heavens. There was Turka Kabar, the crocodile; and Menish el Tabir,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11580">
     the sleeping beauty; and Rook Hamana, the leopard, and there--up there
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11590">
     to the far north--was a shooting star. How gracefully it shot across the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11600">
     sky, leaving its wake of yellow light behind it! It was the season for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11610">
     shooting stars, he recollected. In an instant it would be gone--like a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11620">
     man's life! Saddened, he looked down at his hookah. When he should look
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11630">
     up again--if in only an instant--the star would be gone. Presently he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11640">
     did look up again. But the star was still there, coming his way!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11660">
     He rubbed his old eyes, keen as they were from habituation to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11670">
     blinding light of the desert. Yes, the star was coming--coming fast.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11690">
     "Abdullah!" he called in his high-pitched voice. "Chud! Come, see the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11700">
     star!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11720">
     Together they watched it sweep onward.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11740">
     "By Allah! That is no star!" suddenly cried Abdullah. "It is an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11750">
     air-flying fire chariot! I can see it with my eyes--black, and spouting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11760">
     flames from behind."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11780">
     "Black," echoed Chud gutturally. "Black and round! Oh, Allah!" He fell
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11790">
     on his knees and knocked his head against the deck.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11810">
     The star, or whatever it was, swung in a wide circle toward the coast,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11820">
     and Mohammed and Abdullah now saw that what they had taken to be a trail

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11830">
     of fire behind was in fact a broad beam of yellow light that pointed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11840">
     diagonally earthward. It swept nearer and nearer, illuminating the whole
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11850">
     sky and casting a shimmering reflection upon the waves.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11870">
     A shrill whistle trilled across the water, accompanied by the sound of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11880">
     footsteps running along the decks of the cruiser. Lights flashed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11890">
     Muffled orders were shouted.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11910">
     "By the beard of the Prophet!" cried Mohammed Ali. "Something is going
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11920">
     to happen!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11940">
     The small black object from which the incandescent beam descended passed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11950">
     at that moment athwart the face of the moon, and Abdullah saw that it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11960">
     was round and flat like a ring. The ray of light came from a point
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11970">
     directly above it, passing through its aperture downward to the sea.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_11990">
     "Boom!" The fishing-boat shook to the thunder of the _Fiala's_
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12000">
     eight-inch gun, and a blinding spurt of flame leaped from the cruiser's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12010">
     bows. With a whining shriek a shell rose toward the moon. There was a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12020">
     quick flash followed by a dull concussion. The shell had not reached a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12030">
     tenth of the distance to the flying machine.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12050">
     And then everything happened at once. Mohammed described afterward to a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12060">
     gaping multitude of dirty villagers, while he sat enthroned upon his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12070">
     daughter's threshold, how the star-ship had sailed across the face of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12080">
     the moon and come to a standstill above the mountains, with its beam of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12090">
     yellow light pointing directly downward so that the coast could be seen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12100">
     bright as day from Sfax to Cabes. He saw, he said, genii climbing up and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12110">
     down on the beam. Be that as it may, he swears upon the Beard of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12120">
     Prophet that a second ray of light--of a lavender colour, like the eye
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12130">
     of a long-dead mullet--flashed down alongside the yellow beam. Instantly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12140">
     the earth blew up like a cannon--up into the air, a thousand miles up.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12150">
     It was as light as noonday. Deafened by titanic concussions he fell half
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12160">
     dead. The sea boiled and gave off thick clouds of steam through which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12170">
     flashed dazzling discharges of lightning accompanied by a thundering,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12180">
     grinding sound like a million mills. The ocean heaved spasmodically and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12190">
     the air shook with a rending, ripping noise, as if Nature were bent upon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12200">
     destroying her own handiwork. The glare was so dazzling that sight was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12210">
     impossible. The falukah was tossed this way and that, as if caught in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12220">
     simoon, and he was rolled hither and yon in the company of Chud,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12230">
     Abdullah, and the headless mullet.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12250">
     This earsplitting racket continued, he says, without interruption for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12260">
     two days. Abdullah says it was several hours; the official report of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12270">
     _Fiala_ gives it as six minutes. And then it began to rain in torrents
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12280">
     until he was almost drowned. A great wind arose and lashed the ocean,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12290">
     and a whirlpool seized the falukah and whirled it round and round.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12300">
     Darkness descended upon the earth, and in the general mess Mohammed hit
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12310">
     his head a terrific blow against the mast. He was sure it was but a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12320">
     matter of seconds before they would be dashed to pieces by the waves.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12330">
     The falukah spun like a marine top with a swift sideways motion.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12340">
     Something was dragging them along, sucking them in. The _Fiala_ went
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12350">
     careening by, her fighting masts hanging in shreds. The air was full of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12360">
     falling rocks, trees, splinters, and thick clouds of dust that turned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12370">
     the water yellow in the lightning flashes. The mast went crashing over
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12380">
     and a lemon tree descended to take its place. Great streams of lava
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12390">
     poured down out of the air, and masses of opaque matter plunged into the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12400">
     sea all about the falukah. Scalding mud, stones, hail, fell upon the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12410">
     deck.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12430">
     And still the fishing-boat, gyrating like a leaf, remained afloat with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12440">
     its crew of half-crazed Arabs. Suffocated, stunned, scalded, petrified
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12450">
     with fear, they lay among the mullet while the falukah raced along in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12460">
     its wild dance with death. Mohammed recalls seeing what he thought to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12470">
     a great cliff rush by close beside them. The falukah plunged over a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12480">
     waterfall and was almost submerged, was caught again in a maelstrom, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12490">
     went twirling on in the blackness. They all were deathly sick, but were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12500">
     too terrified to move.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12520">
     And then the nearer roaring ceased. The air was less congested. They
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12530">
     were still showered with sand, clods of earth, twigs, and pebbles, it is

     true, but the genii had stopped hurling mountains at each other. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12550">
     darkness became less opaque, the water smoother. Soon they could see the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12560">
     moon through the clouds of settling dust, and gradually they could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12570">
     discern the stars. The falukah was rocking gently upon a broad expanse
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12580">
     of muddy ocean, surrounded by a yellow scum broken here and there by a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12590">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12600">
     the waters. But death had not overtaken them. Overcome by exhaustion and

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12610">
     terror Mohammed lay among the mullet, his legs entangled in the lemon

     tree. Did he dream it? He cannot tell. But as he lost consciousness he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12630">
     thinks he saw a star shooting toward the north.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_12650">
     When he awoke the falukah lay motionless upon a boundless ochre sea.

     apparently be moved at will over a limited radius of about fifteen

     for in that case the weight of the superstructure would have
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_14890">
     after we have agreed? I believe all will go well; but is it wise for us

     sincerity and view all their doings with suspicion. In a word, Sir John
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_15040">
     believed in following a consistent course and treating Pax as a friend

     at once jumped to the conclusion that the acceleration of the earth's

    </p>

     twenty-six years; but that was one thing about Hooker: you knew he'd be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_18840">
     exactly the same--only more so--as he was when you last saw him. In

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_18900">
     know, but that wouldn't help you in the least. Thornton clutched at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_18910">
     thought of him like a falling aeronaut at a dangling rope. He'd be worth

     midnight train to Boston, reaching Cambridge about two o'clock the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19060">
     The air trembled with heat. Only by dodging from the shadow of one big
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19070">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19080">
     in the university catalogue as Bennie's habitat--alive. As he swung open

     same house where Hooker had lived when a student, twenty-five years
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19110">
     before.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19130">
     "Board" was printed on a yellow, fly-blown card in the corner of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19140">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19160">
     Up there over the porch was the room Bennie had inhabited from '85 to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19170">
     '89. He recalled vividly the night he, Thornton, had put his foot
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19180">
     through the lower pane. They had filled up the hole with an old golf
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19190">
     stocking. His eyes searched curiously for the pane. There it was, still
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19200">
     broken and still stuffed--it couldn't be!--with some colourless material
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19210">
     strangely resembling disintegrating worsted. The sun smote him in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19220">
     back of his neck and drove him to seek the relief of the porch. Had he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19230">
     ever left Cambridge? Wasn't it a dream about his becoming an astronomer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19240">
     and working at the Naval Observatory? And all this stuff about the earth
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19250">
     going on the loose? If he opened the door wouldn't he find Bennie with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19260">
     towel round his head cramming for the "exams"? For a moment he really
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19270">
     imagined that he was an undergraduate. Then as he fanned himself with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19280">
     his straw hat he caught, on the silk band across the interior, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19290">
     words: "Smith's Famous Headwear, Washington, D.C." No, he was really an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19300">
     astronomer.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19320">
     He shuddered in spite of the heat as he pulled the bell knob. What
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19330">
     ghosts would its jangle summon? The bell, however, gave no sound; in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19340">
     fact the knob came off in his hand, followed by a foot or so of copper
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19350">
     wire. He laughed, gazing at it blankly. No one had ever used the bell in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19360">
     the old days. They had simply kicked open the door and halloed: "O-o-h,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19370">
     Bennie Hooker!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19390">
     Thornton laid the knob on the piazza and inspected the front of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19400">
     house. The windows were thick with dust, the "yard" scraggly with weeds.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19410">
     A piece of string held the latch of the gate together. Then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19420">
     automatically, and without intending to do so at all, Thornton turned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19430">
     the handle of the front door, assisting it coincidentally with a gentle
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19440">
     kick from his right toe, and found himself in the narrow cabbage-scented
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19450">
     hallway. The old, familiar, battered black-walnut hatrack of his student
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19460">
     days leaned drunkenly against the wall--Thornton knew one of its back
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19470">
     legs was missing--and on the imitation marble slab was a telegram
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19480">
     addressed to "Professor Benjamin Hooker." And also, instinctively,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19490">
     Thornton lifted up his adult voice and yelled:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19510">
     "O-o-h, ye-ay! Bennie Hooker!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19530">
     The volume of his own sound startled him. Instantly he saw the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19540">
     ridiculousness of it--he, the senior astronomer at the Naval
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19550">
     Observatory, yelling like that----
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19570">
     "O-o-h, ye-ay!" came in smothered tones from above.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19590">
     Thornton bounded up the stairs, two, three steps at a time, and pounded
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19600">
     on the old door over the porch.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19620">
     "Go away!" came back the voice of Bennie Hooker. "Don't want any lunch!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19640">
     Thornton continued to bang on the door while Professor Hooker wrathfully
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19650">
     besought the intruder to depart before he took active measures. There
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19660">
     was the cracking of glass.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19680">
     "Oh, damn!" came from inside.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19700">
     Thornton rattled the knob and kicked. Somebody haltingly crossed the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19710">
     room, the key turned, and Prof. Bennie Hooker opened the door.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19730">
     "Well?" he demanded, scowling over his thick spectacles.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19750">
     "Hello, Bennie!" said Thornton, holding out his hand.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19770">
     "Hello, Buck!" returned Hooker. "Come in. I thought it was that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19780">
     confounded Ethiopian."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19800">
     As far as Thornton could see, it was the same old room, only now crammed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19810">
     with books and pamphlets and crowded with tables of instruments. Hooker,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19820">
     clad in sneakers, white ducks, and an undershirt, was smoking a small
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19830">
     "T. D." pipe.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19850">
     "Where on earth did you come from?" he inquired good-naturedly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19870">
     "Washington," answered Thornton, and something told him that this was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19880">
     the real thing--the "goods"--that his journey would be repaid.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19900">
     Hooker waved the "T. D." in a general sort of way toward some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19910">
     broken-down horsehair armchairs and an empty crate.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19930">
     "Sit down, won't you?" he said, as if he had seen his guest only the day
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19940">
     before. He looked vaguely about for something that Thornton might smoke,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19950">
     then seated himself on a cluttered bench holding a number of retorts,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19960">
     beside which flamed an oxyacetylene blowpipe. He was a wizened little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19970">
     chap, with scrawny neck and protruding Adam's apple. His long hair gave
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19980">
     no evidence of the use of the comb, and his hands were the hands of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_19990">
     Esau. He had an alertness that suggested a robin, but at the same time
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20000">
     gave the impression that he looked through things rather than at them.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20010">
     On the mantel was a saucer containing the fast oxidizing cores of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20020">
     several apples and a half-eaten box of oatmeal biscuits.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20040">
     "My Lord! This is an untidy hole! No more order than when you were an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20050">
     undergrad!" exclaimed Thornton, looking about him in amused horror.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20070">
     "Order?" returned Bennie indignantly. "Everything's in perfect order!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20080">
     This chair is filled with the letters I _have_ already answered; this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20090">
     chair with the letters I've _not_ answered; and this chair with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20100">
     letters I shall _never_ answer!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20120">
     Thornton took a seat on the crate, laughing. It was the same old Bennie!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20140">
     "You're an incorrigible!" he sighed despairingly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20160">
     "Well, you're a star gazer, aren't you?" inquired Hooker, relighting his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20170">
     pipe. "Some one told me so--I forget who. You must have a lot of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20180">
     interesting problems. They tell me that new planet of yours is full of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20190">
     uranium."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20210">
     Thornton laughed. "You mustn't believe all that you read in the papers.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20220">
     What are you working at particularly?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20240">
     "Oh, radium and thermic induction mostly," answered Hooker. "And when I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20250">
     want a rest I take a crack at the fourth dimension--spacial curvature's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20260">
     my hobby. But I'm always working at radio stuff. That's where the big
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20270">
     things are going to be pulled off, you know."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20290">
     "Yes, of course," answered Thornton. He wondered if Hooker ever saw a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20300">
     paper, how long since he had been out of the house. "By the way, did you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20310">
     know Berlin had been taken?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20330">
     "Berlin--in Germany, you mean?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20350">
     "Yes, by the Russians."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20370">
     "No! Has it?" inquired Hooker with politeness. "Oh, I think some one did
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20380">
     mention it."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20400">
     Thornton fumbled for a cigarette and Bennie handed him a match. They
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20410">
     seemed to have extraordinarily little to say for men who hadn't seen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20420">
     each other for twenty-six years.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20440">
     "I suppose," went on the astronomer, "you think it's deuced funny my

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20450">
     dropping in casually this way after all this time, but the fact is I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20460">
     came on purpose. I want to get some information from you straight."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20480">
     "Go ahead!" said Bennie. "What's it about?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20500">
     "Well, in a word," answered Thornton, "the earth's nearly a quarter of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20510">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20530">
     Hooker received this announcement with a polite interest but no

     astonishment.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20560">
     "That's a how-de-do!" he remarked. "What's done it?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20580">
     "That's what I want you to tell _me_," said Thornton sternly. "What
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20590">
     _could_ do it?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20610">
     Hooker unlaced his legs and strolled over to the mantel.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20630">
     "Have a cracker?" he asked, helping himself. Then he picked up a piece
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20640">
     of wood and began whittling. "I suppose there's the devil to pay?" he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20650">
     suggested. "Things upset and so on? Atmospheric changes? When did it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20660">
     happen?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20680">
     "About three weeks ago. Then there's this Sahara business."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20700">
     "What Sahara business?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20720">
     "Haven't you heard?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20740">
     "No," answered Hooker rather impatiently. "I haven't heard anything. I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20750">
     haven't any time to read the papers; I'm too busy. My thermic inductor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20760">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20780">
     "Oh, never mind now," said Thornton hurriedly, perceiving that Hooker's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20790">
     ignorance was an added asset. He'd get his science pure, uncontaminated
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20800">
     by disturbing questions of fact. "How about the earth's losing that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20810">
     quarter of an hour?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20830">
     "Of course she's off her orbit," remarked Hooker in a detached way. "And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20840">
     you want to know what's done it? Don't blame you. I suppose you've gone
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20850">
     into the possibilities of stellar attraction."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20870">
     "Discount that!" ordered Thornton. "What I want to know is whether it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20880">
     could happen from the inside?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20900">
     "Why not?" inquired Hooker. "A general shift in the mass would do it. So
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20910">
     would the mere application of force at the proper point."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20930">
     "It never happened before."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20950">
     "Of course not. Neither had seedless oranges until Burbank came along,"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20960">
     said Hooker.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_20980">
     "Do you regard it as possible by any human agency?" inquired Thornton.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21000">
     "Why not?" repeated Hooker. "All you need is the energy. And it's lying
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21010">
     all round if you could only get at it. That's just what I'm working at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21020">
     now. Radium, uranium, thorium, actinium--all the radioactive
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21030">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21040">
     discharging the enormous energy that is imprisoned in their molecules.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21050">
     It may take generations, epochs, centuries, for them to get rid of it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21060">
     and transform themselves into other substances, but they will inevitably
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21070">
     do so eventually. They're doing with more or less of a rush what all the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21080">
     elements are doing at their leisure. A single ounce of uranium contains
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21090">
     about the same amount of energy that could be produced by the combustion
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21100">
     of ten tons of coal--but it won't let the energy go. Instead it holds on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21110">
     to it, and the energy leaks slowly, almost imperceptibly, away, like
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21120">
     water from a big reservoir tapped only by a tiny pipe. 'Atomic energy'

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21150">
     that energy all at once will revolutionize the civilized world. It will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21160">
     be like the discovery that water could be turned into steam and made to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21170">
     work for us--multiplied a million times. If, instead of that energy just

     oozing away and the uranium disintegrating infinitesimally each year, it

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21190">
     could be exploded at a given moment you could drive an ocean liner with

     a handful of it. You could make the old globe stagger round and turn

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21230">
     Bennie enthusiastically waved his pipe at Thornton.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21250">
     "How! That's the question. Everybody's known about the possibilities,

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21270">
     key could be found to unlock that treasure-house of energy. Some chap
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21280">
     made up a novel once and pretended it was done, but he didn't say _how_.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21290">
     But"--and he lowered his voice passionately--"I'm working at it,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21300">
     and--and--I've nearly--nearly got it."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21320">
     Thornton, infected by his friend's excitement, leaned forward in his

     chair.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21350">
     "Yes--nearly. If only my transformers hadn't melted! You see I got the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21360">
     idea from Savaroff, who noticed that the activity of radium and other
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21370">
     elements wasn't constant, but varied with the degree of solar activity,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21380">
     reaching its maximum at the periods when the sun spots were most
    </p>

     numerous. In other words, he's shown that the breakdown of the atoms of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21400">
     radium and the other radioactive elements isn't spontaneous, as Soddy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21410">
     and others had thought, but is due to the action of certain extremely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21420">
     penetrating rays given out by the sun. These particular rays are the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21430">
     result of the enormous temperature of the solar atmosphere, and their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21440">
     effect upon radioactive substances is analogous to that of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21450">
     detonating cap upon dynamite. No one has been able to produce these rays
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21460">
     in the laboratory, although Hempel has suspected sometimes that traces
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21470">
     of them appeared in the radiations from powerful electric sparks.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21480">
     Everything came to a halt until Hiroshito discovered thermic induction,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21490">
     and we were able to elevate temperature almost indefinitely through a

     destroyed the apparatus."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21590">
     Thornton whistled. "And when you succeed?" he asked in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21610">
     Hooker's face was transfigured.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21630">
     "When I succeed I shall control the world," he cried, and his voice
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21640">
     trembled. "But the damn thing either melts or explodes," he added with a

     tinge of indignation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21670">
     "You know about Hiroshito's experiments, of course; he used a quartz

    </p>

     at the centre of a coil of silver wire carrying a big oscillatory
    </p>

     current. This induced a ring discharge in the bulb, and the temperature
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21710">
     of the vapour mixture rose until the bulb melted. He calculated that the
    </p>

     temperature of that part of the vapour which carried the current was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21730">
     over 6,000°. You see, the ring discharge is not in contact with the wall

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21740">
     of the bulb, and can consequently be much hotter. It's like this." Here

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21750">
     Bennie drew with a burnt match on the back of an envelope a diagram of

     something which resembled a doughnut in a chianti flask.

    </p>

     that a sudden increase in the temperature of the discharge occurred at
    </p>

     the moment when the silver coil of his transformer became white hot,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21970">
     small test tube of black glass. Thornton, with a slight moral
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21980">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_21990">
     oxyacetylene blowpipe, regarding it somewhat as a dog fancier might gaze
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22000">

     astronomer. "That's right--like that!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22030">
     Thrusting the blowpipe forward, he allowed the hissing blue-white flame
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22040">
     to wrap itself round the outer wall of the tube--a flame which Thornton
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22050">
     knew could melt its way through a block of steel--but the astronomer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22060">
     felt no sensation of heat, although he not unnaturally expected the

     this." He picked up a thin plate of white metal. "This is the metal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22320">
     we're going to attack, uranium--the parent of radium--and the whole
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22330">
     radioactive series, ending with the end-product lead."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22350">
     He hung the plate by two fine wires fastened to its corners, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22360">
     adjusted a coil of wire opposite its centre, while within the coil he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22370">
     slipped a small black capsule.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22390">
     "This is the best we can do now," he said. "The capsule is made of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22400">
     zircorundum, and we shall get only a trace of the disintegrating rays
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22410">
     before it blows up. But you'll see 'em, or, rather, you'll see the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22420">
     lavender phosphorescence of the air through which they pass."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22440">
     He arranged a thick slab of plate glass between Thornton and the thermic
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22450">
     transformer, and stepping to the wall closed a switch. An oscillatory
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22460">
     spark discharge started off with a roar in a closed box, and the coil of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22470">
     wire became white hot.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22490">
     "Watch the plate!" shouted Bennie.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22510">
     And Thornton watched.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22530">
     For ten or fifteen seconds nothing happened, and then a faint beam of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22540">
     pale lavender light shot out from the capsule, and the metal plate swung
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22550">
     away from the incandescent coil as if blown by a gentle breeze.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22570">
     Almost instantly there was a loud report and a blinding flash of yellow
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22580">
     light so brilliant that for the next instant or two to Thornton's eyes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22590">
     the room seemed dark. Slowly the afternoon light regained its normal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22600">
     quality. Bennie relit his pipe unconcernedly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22620">
     "That's the germ of the idea," he said between puffs. "That capsule
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22630">
     contains a mixture of vapours that give out disintegrating rays when the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22640">
     temperature is raised by thermic induction above six thousand. Most of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22650">
     'em are stopped by the zirconium atoms in the capsule, which break down
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22660">
     and liberate helium; and the temperature rises in the capsule until it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22670">
     explodes, as you saw just now, with a flash of yellow helium light. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22680">
     rays that get out strike the uranium plate and cause the surface layer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22690">
     of molecules to disintegrate, their products being driven off by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22700">
     atomic explosions with a velocity about equal to that of light, and it's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22710">
     the recoil that deflects and swings the plate. The amount of uranium
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22720">
     decomposed in this experiment couldn't be detected by the most delicate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22730">
     balance--small mass, but enormous velocity. See?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22750">
     "Yes, I understand," answered Thornton. "It's the old, 'momentum equals
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22760">
     mass times velocity,' business we had in mechanics."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22780">
     "Of course this is only a toy experiment," Bennie continued. "It is what
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22790">
     the dancing pithballs of Franklin's time were to the multipolar,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22800">
     high-frequency dynamo. But if we could control this force and handle it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22810">
     on a large scale we could do anything with it--destroy the world, drive
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22820">
     a car against gravity off into space, shift the axis of the earth
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22830">
     perhaps!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22850">
     It came to Thornton as he sat there, cigarette in hand, that poor Bennie
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22860">
     Hooker was going to receive the disappointment of his life. Within the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22870">
     next five minutes his dreams would be dashed to earth, for he would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22880">
     learn that another had stepped down to the pool of discovery before him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22890">
     For how many years, he wondered, had Bennie toiled to produce his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22900">
     mysterious ray that should break down the atom and release the store of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22910">
     energy that the genii of Nature had concealed there. And now Thornton
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22920">
     must tell him that all his efforts had gone for nothing!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22940">
     "And you believe that any one who could generate a ray such as you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22950">
     describe could control the motion of the earth?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22970">
     "Of course, certainly," answered Hooker. "He could either disintegrate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22980">
     such huge quantities of matter that the mass of the earth would be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_22990">
     shifted and its polar axis be changed, or if radioactive
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23000">
     substances--pitchblende, for example--lay exposed upon the earth's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23010">
     surface he could cause them to discharge their helium and other products
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23020">
     at such an enormous velocity that the recoil or reaction would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23030">
     accelerate or retard the motion of the globe. It would be quite
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23040">
     feasible, quite simple--all one would need would be the disintegrating
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23050">
     ray."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23070">
     And then Thornton told Hooker of the flight of the giant Ring machine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23080">
     from the north and the destruction of the Mountains of Atlas through the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23090">
     apparent instrumentality of a ray of lavender light. Hooker's face
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23100">
     turned slightly pale and his unshaven mouth tightened. Then a smile of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23110">
     exaltation illuminated his features.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23130">
     "He's done it!" he cried joyously. "He's done it on an engineering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23140">
     scale. We pure-science dreamers turn up our noses at the engineers, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23150">
     I tell you the improvements in the apparatus part of the game come when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23160">
     there is a big commercial demand for a thing and the engineering chaps
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23170">
     take hold of it. But _who_ is he and _where_ is he? I must get to him. I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23180">
     don't suppose I can teach him much, but I've got a magnificent
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23190">
     experiment that we can try together."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23210">
     He turned to a littered writing-table and poked among the papers that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23220">
     lay there.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23240">
     "You see," he explained excitedly, "if there is anything in the quantum
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23250">
     theory----Oh! but you don't care about that. The point is where _is_ the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23260">
     chap?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23280">
     And so Thornton had to begin at the beginning and tell Hooker all about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23290">
     the mysterious messages and the phenomena that accompanied them. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23300">
     enlarged upon Pax's benignant intentions and the great problems
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23310">
     presented by the proposed interference of the United States Government
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23320">
     in Continental affairs, but Bennie swept them aside. The great thing, to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23330">
     his mind, was to find and get into communication with Pax.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23350">
     "Ah! How he must feel! The greatest achievement of all time!" cried
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23360">
     Hooker radiantly. "How ecstatically happy! Earth blossoming like the

     rose! Well-watered valleys where deserts were before. War abolished,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23380">
     poverty, disease! Who can it be? Curie? No; she's bottled in Paris.

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23410">
     to him right away. So much to talk over." He walked round the room,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23420">
     blundering into things, dizzy with the thought that his great dream had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23430">
     come true. Suddenly he swept everything off the table on to the floor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23440">
     and kicked his heels in the air.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23460">
     "Hooray!" he shouted, dancing round the room like a freshman. "Hooray!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_23470">
     Now I can take a holiday. And come to think of it, I'm as hungry as a

     That night Thornton returned to Washington and was at the White House by

     nine o'clock the following day.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24100">
     end of the house the cylindrical barrel of the gigantic engine of war
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24110">
     raised itself into the air at an angle of forty degrees, and from the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24120">
     muzzle to the ground below it was a drop of over eighty feet. On a track
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24130">
     running off to the north rested the projectiles side by side, resembling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24140">
     in the dim light a row of steam boilers in the yard of a locomotive
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24150">
     factory.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24170">
     "Well," remarked one of the officers, turning to the only one of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24180">
     companions not in uniform. "'Thanatos' is ready."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24200">
     The man addressed was Von Heckmann, the most famous inventor of military
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24210">
     ordnance in the world, already four times decorated for his services to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24220">
     the Emperor.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24240">
     "The labour of nine years!" he answered with emotion. "Nine long years
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24250">
     of self-denial and unremitting study! But to-night I shall be repaid,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24260">
     repaid a thousand times."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24280">
     The officers shook hands with him one after the other, and the group
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24290">
     broke up; the men who were filling the trench completed their labours
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24300">
     and departed; and Von Heckmann and the major-general of artillery alone
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24310">
     remained, except for the sentries beside the gun. The night was balmy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24320">
     and the moon rode in a cloudless sky high above the hill. They crossed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24330">
     the enclosure, followed by the two sentinels, and entering a passage
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24340">
     reached the outer wall of the redoubt, which was in turn closed and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24350">
     locked. Here the sentries remained, but Von Heckmann and the general
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24360">
     continued on behind the fortifications for some distance.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24380">
     "Well, shall we start the ball?" asked the general, laying his hand on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24390">
     Von Heckmann's shoulder. But the inventor found it so hard to master his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24400">
     emotion that he could only nod his head. Yet the ball to which the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24410">
     general alluded was the discharging of a fiendish war machine toward an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24420">
     unsuspecting and harmless city alive with sleeping people, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24430">
     emotion of the inventor was due to the fact that he had devised and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24440">
     completed the most atrocious engine of death ever conceived by the mind
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24450">
     of man--the Relay Gun. Horrible as is the thought, this otherwise normal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24460">
     man had devoted nine whole years to the problem of how to destroy human
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24470">
     life at a distance of a hundred kilometres, and at last he had been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24480">
     successful, and an emperor had placed with his own divinely appointed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24490">
     hands a ribbon over the spot beneath which his heart should have been.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24510">
     The projectile of this diabolical invention was ninety-five centimetres
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24520">
     in diameter, and was itself a rifled mortar, which in full flight,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24530">
     twenty miles from the gun and at the top of its trajectory, exploded in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24540">
     mid-air, hurling forward its contained projectile with an additional
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24550">
     velocity of three thousand feet per second. This process repeated
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24560">
     itself, the final or core bomb, weighing over three hundred pounds and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24570">
     filled with lyddite, reaching its mark one minute and thirty-five
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24580">
     seconds after the firing of the gun. This crowning example of the human
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24590">
     mind's destructive ingenuity had cost the German Government five million
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24600">
     marks and had required three years for its construction, and by no means
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24610">
     the least of its devilish capacities was that of automatically reloading
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24620">
     and firing itself at the interval of every ten seconds, its muzzle
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24630">
     rising, falling, or veering slightly from side to side with each
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24640">
     discharge, thus causing the shells to fall at wide distances. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24650">
     poisonous nature of the immense volumes of gas poured out by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24660">
     mastodon when in action necessitated the withdrawal of its crew to a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24670">
     safe distance. But once set in motion it needed no attendant. It had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24680">
     been tested by a preliminary shot the day before, which had been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24690">
     directed to a point several miles outside the walls of Paris, the effect
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24700">
     of which had been observed and reported by high-flying German aeroplanes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24710">
     equipped with wireless. Everything was ready for the holocaust.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24730">
     Von Heckmann and the general of artillery continued to make their way
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24740">
     through the intrenchments and other fortifications, until at a distance
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24750">
     of about a quarter of a mile from the redoubt where they had left the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24760">
     Relay Gun they arrived at a small whitewashed cottage.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24780">
     "I have invited a few of my staff to join us," said the general to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24790">
     inventor, "in order that they may in years to come describe to their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24800">
     children and their grandchildren this, the most momentous occasion in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24810">
     the history of warfare."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24830">
     They turned the corner of the cottage and came upon a group of officers
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24840">
     standing by the wooden gate of the cottage, all of whom saluted at their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24850">
     approach.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24870">
     "Good evening, gentlemen," said the general. "I beg to present the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24880">
     members of my staff," turning to Von Heckmann.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24900">
     The officers stood back while the general led the way into the cottage,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24910">
     the lower floor of which consisted of but a single room, used by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24920">
     recent tenants as a kitchen, dining-room, and living-room. At one end of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24930">
     a long table, constructed by the regimental carpenter, supper had been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24940">
     laid, and a tub filled with ice contained a dozen or more quarts of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24950">
     champagne. Two orderlies stood behind the table, at the other end of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24960">
     which was affixed a small brass switch connected with the redoubt and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24970">
     controlled by a spring and button. The windows of the cottage were open,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24980">
     and through them poured the light of the full moon, dimming the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_24990">
     flickering light of the candles upon the table.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25010">
     In spite of the champagne, the supper, and the boxes of cigars and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25020">
     cigarettes, an atmosphere of solemnity was distinctly perceptible. It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25030">
     was as if each one of these officers, hardened to human suffering by a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25040">
     lifetime of discipline and active service, to say nothing of the years
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25050">
     of horror through which they had just passed, could not but feel that in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25060">
     the last analysis the hurling upon an unsuspecting city of a rain of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25070">
     projectiles containing the highest explosive known to warfare, at a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25080">
     distance three times greater than that heretofore supposed to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25090">
     possible to science, and the ensuing annihilation of its inhabitants,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25100">
     was something less for congratulation and applause than for sorrow and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25110">
     regret. The officers, who had joked each other outside the gate, became
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25120">
     singularly quiet as they entered the cottage and gathered round the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25130">
     table where Von Heckmann and the general had taken their stand by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25140">
     instrument. Utter silence fell upon the group. The mercury of their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25150">
     spirits dropped from summer heat to below freezing. What was this thing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25160">
     which they were about to do?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25180">
     Through the windows, at a distance of four hundred yards, the pounding
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25190">
     of the machinery which flooded the water jacket of the Relay Gun was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25200">
     distinctly audible in the stillness of the night. The pressure of a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25210">
     finger--a little finger--upon that electric button was all that was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25220">
     necessary to start the torrent of iron and high explosives toward Paris.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25230">
     By the time the first shell would reach its mark nine more would be on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25240">
     their way, stretched across the midnight sky at intervals of less than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25250">
     eight miles. And once started the stream would continue uninterrupted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25260">
     for two hours. The fascinated eyes of all the officers fastened
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25270">
     themselves upon the key. None spoke.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25290">
     "Well, well, gentlemen!" exclaimed the general brusquely, "what is the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25300">
     matter with you? You act as if you were at a funeral! Hans," turning to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25310">
     the orderly, "open the champagne there. Fill the glasses. Bumpers all,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25320">
     gentlemen, for the greatest inventor of all times, Herr von Heckmann,

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25350">
     The orderly sprang forward and hastily commenced uncorking bottles,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25360">
     while Von Heckmann turned away to the window.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25380">
     "Here, this won't do, Schelling! You must liven things up a bit!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25390">
     continued the general to one of the officers. "This is a great occasion
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25400">
     for all of us! Give me that bottle." He seized a magnum of champagne
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25410">
     from the orderly and commenced pouring out the foaming liquid into the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25420">
     glasses beside the plates. Schelling made a feeble attempt at a joke at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25430">
     which the officers laughed loudly, for the general was a martinet and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25440">
     had to be humoured.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25460">
     "Now, then," called out the general as he glanced toward the window,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25470">
     "Herr von Heckmann, we are going to drink your health! Officers of the

     First Artillery, I give you a toast--a toast which you will all remember

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25490">
     to your dying day! Bumpers, gentlemen! No heel taps! I give you the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25500">
     health of 'Thanatos'--the leviathan of artillery, the winged bearer of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25510">
     death and destruction--and of its inventor, Herr von Heckmann. Bumpers,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25520">
     gentlemen!" The general slapped Von Heckmann upon the shoulder and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25530">
     drained his glass.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25550">
     "'Thanatos!' Von Heckmann!" shouted the officers. And with one accord
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25560">
     they dashed their goblets to the stone flagging upon which they stood.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25580">
     "And now, my dear inventor," said the general, "to you belongs the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25590">
     honour of arousing 'Thanatos' into activity. Are you ready, gentlemen? I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25600">
     warn you that when 'Thanatos' snores the rafters will ring."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25620">
     Von Heckmann had stood with bowed head while the officers had drunk his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25630">
     health, and he now hesitatingly turned toward the little brass switch
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25640">
     with its button of black rubber that glistened so innocently in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25650">
     candlelight. His right hand trembled. He dashed the back of his left
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25660">
     across his eyes. The general took out a large silver watch from his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25670">
     pocket. "Fifty-nine minutes past eleven," he announced. "At one minute
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25680">
     past twelve Paris will be disembowelled. Put your finger on the button,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25690">
     my friend. Let us start the ball rolling."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25710">
     Von Heckmann cast a glance almost of disquietude upon the faces of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25720">
     officers who were leaning over the table in the intensity of their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25730">
     excitement. His elation, his exaltation, had passed from him. He seemed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25740">
     overwhelmed at the momentousness of the act which he was about to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25750">
     perform. Slowly his index finger crept toward the button and hovered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_25760">
     half suspended over it. He pressed his lips together and was about to

     rumble.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_26750">
     "What was that?" muttered Bannalec. The sound was followed within a few

     seconds by another, and after a similar interval by a third and fourth.

     Other discharges now followed in rapid succession, some fainter, some

     Rigid with fear, they stood staring with open mouths at the shell that

     aide-de-camp galloped on and the sound of his horse's hoofs grew fainter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27590">
     and fainter down the road toward the village, the comet came sailing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27600">
     swiftly on overhead, deluging the fortifications with a blinding
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27610">
     orange-yellow light. It could not have been more than a mile away when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27620">
     Biedenkopf saw it. Instantly his trained eye recognized the fact that

     this strange round object shooting through the air was no wandering

     celestial body.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27660">
     "_Ein Flieger!_" he cried hoarsely, staring at it in astonishment,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27670">
     knowing full well that no dirigible or aeroplane of German manufacture
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27680">
     bore any resemblance to this extraordinary voyager of the air.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27700">
     A hundred yards down the road his field telephone was attached to a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27710">
     poplar, and casting one furtive look at the Flying Ring he galloped to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27720">
     the tree and rang up the corporal of the guard. But at the very instant
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27730">
     that his call was answered a series of terrific detonations shook the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27740">
     earth and set the wires roaring in the receiver, so that he could hear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27750">
     nothing. One--two--three--four of them, followed by a distant answering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27760">
     boom in the west.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27780">
     And then the whole sky seemed full of fire. He was hurled backward upon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27790">
     the road and lay half-stunned, while the earth discharged itself into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27800">
     the air with a roar like that of ten thousand shells exploding all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27810">
     together. The ground shook, groaned, grumbled, grated, and showers of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27820">
     boards, earth, branches, rocks, vegetables, tiles, and all sorts of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27830">
     unrecognizable and grotesque objects fell from the sky all about him. It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27840">
     was like a gigantic and never-ending mine, or series of mines, in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27850">
     continuous explosion, a volcano pouring itself upward out of the bowels
    </p>

     of an incandescent earth. Above the earsplitting thunder of the eruption
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27870">
     he heard shrill cries and raucous shoutings. Mounted men dashed past him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27880">
     down the road, singly and in squadrons. A molten globe dropped through
    </p>

     the branches of the poplar, and striking the hard surface of the road at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27900">
     a distance of fifty yards scattered itself like a huge ingot dropped
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27910">
     from a blast furnace. Great clouds of dust descended and choked him. A

     withering heat enveloped him....
    </p>

     It was noon next day when Karl Biedenkopf raised his head and looked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27950">
     about him. He thought first there had been a battle. But the sight that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27960">
     met his eyes bore no resemblance to a field of carnage. Over his head he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27970">
     noticed that the uppermost branches of the poplar had been seared as by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27980">
     fire. The road looked as if the countryside had been traversed by a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_27990">
     hurricane. All sorts of débris filled the fields and everywhere there
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_28000">
     seemed to be a thick deposit of blackened earth. Vaguely realizing that

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_28010">
     he must report for duty, he crawled, in spite of his bursting head and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_28020">
     aching limbs, on all fours down the road toward the village.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_28040">
     But he could not find the village. There was no village there; and soon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_28050">
     he came to what seemed to be the edge of a gigantic crater, where the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_28060">
     earth had been uprooted and tossed aside as if by some huge convulsion
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_28070">
     of nature. Here and there masses of inflammable material smoked and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_28080">
     flickered with red flames. His eyes sought the familiar outlines of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_28090">
     redoubts and fortifications, but found them not. And where the village
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_28100">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_28110">
     the cavern, or so it seemed to his half-blinded sight, was at about the

     point where the cottage had stood which his general had used as his

     and retardation of its motion. Filled with a pure and unselfish

     which is the nearest harbour to the mouth of the River Moisie. She was a

     slowly fell behind. Off their leeward bow the Isle of Orléans swung

     nearer and swept past, its neat homesteads inviting the weary traveller
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_29910">
     to pastoral repose. The river cleared. Low, farm-clad shores began to

     slip by. The few tourists and returning habitans settled themselves in

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_30020">
     accustomed way, passed by Tadousac, and made her first stop at the

     Godbout. Bennie, finding the boat no longer in motion, reappeared on

     deck under the mistaken impression that they had reached the end of the
    </p>

     voyage, for he was unfamiliar with the topography of the St. Lawrence,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_30060">
     and in fact had very vague ideas as to distances and the time required
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_30070">
     to traverse them by rail or boat.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_30090">
     At the Godbout the _Druro_ dropped a habitan or two, a few boatloads of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_30100">
     steel rods, crates of crockery and tobacco, and then thrust her bow out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_30110">
     into the stream and steered down river, rounding at length the Pointe

     sunlight again, she steamed across and put in past the Carousel, that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_30170">
     picturesque and rocky headland, into Seven Islands Bay. Here she
    </p>

     anchored, and, having discharged cargo, steamed out by the Grand Boule,
    </p>

     where eighteen miles beyond the islands Bennie saw the pilot house of

     He had emerged from the retirement of his stateroom only on being asked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_30230">
     by the steward for his ticket and learning that the _Druro_ was nearing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_30240">
     the end of her journey. For nearly two days he had been submerged in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_30250">
     Soddy on The Interpretation of Radium. The _Druro_ was running along a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_30260">
     sandy, low-lying beach about half a mile offshore. They were nearing the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_30270">
     mouth of a wide river. The volume of black fresh water from the Moisie
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_30280">
     rushed out into the St. Lawrence until it met the green sea water,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_30290">
     causing a sharp demarcation of colour and a no less pronounced conflict
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_30300">
     of natural forces. For, owing to the pressure of the tide against the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_30310">
     solid mass of the fresh stream, acres of water unexpectedly boiled on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_30320">
     all sides, throwing geysers of foam twenty feet or more into the air,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_30330">
     and then subsided. Off the point the engine bell rang twice, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_30340">
     _Druro_ came to a pause.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_30360">
     Bennie, standing in the bow, in his sportsman's cap and waterproof,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_30370">
     hugging his rod cases to his breast, watched while a heterogeneous fleet
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_30940">
     lowered Bennie's luggage into the boat. The professor followed, avoiding

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_30950">
     with difficulty stepping on his mackintosh as he climbed down the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_30960">
     slippery rounds. Holliday grasped his hand and yanked him to a seat in

     the stern.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_30990">
     "Yes," he repeated, "if you've come all the way from Boston I guess

     we'll have to put you up for a few days anyway."

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31020">
     A crate of canned goods, a parcel of mail, and a huge bundle of

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31040">
     _Druro_ churned the water and swung out into midstream again. Bennie
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31050">
     looked curiously after her. To the north lay a sandy shore dotted by a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31060">
     scraggy forest of dwarf spruce and birch. A few fishing huts and a mass
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31070">
     of wooden shanties fringed the forest. To the east, seaward, many miles
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31080">
     down that great stretch of treacherous, sullen river waited a gray bank
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31090">
     of fog. But overhead the air was crystalline with that sparkling,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31100">
     scratchy brilliance that is found only in northern climes. Nature seemed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31110">
     hard, relentless. With his feet entangled in rod cases Professor Hooker
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31120">
     wondered for a moment what on earth he was there for, landing on this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31130">
     inhospitable coast. Then his eyes sought the genial face of Malcolm
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31140">
     Holliday and hope sprang up anew. For there is that about this genial
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31150">
     frontiersman that draws all men to him alike, be they Scotch or English,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31160">
     Canadian habitans or Montagnais, and he is the king of the coast, as his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31170">
     father was before him, or as was old Peter McKenzie, the head factor,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31180">
     who incidentally cast the best salmon fly ever thrown east of Montreal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31190">
     or south of Ungava. Bennie found comfort in Holliday's smile, and felt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31200">
     toward him as a child does toward its mother.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31220">
     They neared shore and ran alongside a ramshackle pier, up the slippery
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31230">
     poles of which Bennie was instructed to clamber. Then, dodging rotten
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31240">
     boards and treacherous places, he gained the sand of the beach and stood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31250">
     at last on Labrador. A group of Montagnais picked up the professor's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31260">
     luggage and, headed by Holliday, they started for the latter's house. It

     was a strange and amusing landing of an expedition the results of which

    </p>

     and how he took him for a gold hunter.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31360">
     "Anyhow," he finishes, "I knew he wasn't a salmon fisherman in spite of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31370">
     his rods and cases, for he didn't know a Black Dose from a Thunder and

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31380">
     Lightning or a Jock Scott, and he thought you could catch salmon with a

     worm!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31410">
     It was true wholly. Bennie did suppose one killed the king of game fish

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31420">
     as he had caught minnows in his childhood, and his geologic researches

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31460">
     "My dear fellow," said Holliday as they smoked their pipes on the narrow

     board piazza at the Post, "of course I'll help you all I can, but you've

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31490">
     be eaten alive by black flies, gnats, and mosquitoes." He slapped
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31500">
     vigorously as he spoke. "And you'll have the devil of a job getting
    </p>

     fine lot, too, take 'em altogether, gentle, obedient, industrious,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31560">
     polite, cheerful, and fair to middling honest. They have a good deal of

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31570">
     French blood--a bit diluted, but it's there."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31590">
     "Can't I get a few to go along with me?" asked Bennie anxiously.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31610">
     "That's a question," answered the factor meditatively. "You know how the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31620">
     birds--how caribou--migrate every year. Well, these Montagnais are just
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31630">
     like them. They have a regular routine. Each man has a line of traps of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31640">
     his own, all the way up to the Height of Land. They all go up river in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31650">
     the autumn with their winter's supply of pork, flour, tea, powder, lead,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31660">
     axes, files, rosin to mend their canoes, and castoreum--made out of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31670">
     beaver glands, you know--to take away the smell of their hands from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31680">
     baited traps. They go up in families, six or seven canoes together, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31690">
     as each man reaches his own territory his canoe drops out of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31700">
     procession and he makes a camp for his wife and babies. Then he spends
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31710">
     the winter--six or seven months--in the woods following his line of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31720">
     traps. By and by the ice goes out and he begins to want some society. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31730">
     hasn't seen a priest for ten months or so, and he's afraid of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31740">
     _loup-garou_, for all I know. So he comes down river, takes his Newport
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31750">
     season here at Moisie, and goes to mass and staves off the _loup-garou_.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31760">
     They're all here now. Maybe you can get a couple to go up river and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31770">
     maybe you can't."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31790">
     Then observing Bennie's crestfallen expression, he added:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31810">
     "But we'll see. Perhaps you can get Marc St. Ange and Edouard Moreau,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31820">
     both good fellows. They've made their mass and they know the country
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31830">
     from here to Ungava. There's Marc now--_Venez ici_, Marc St. Ange." A
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31840">
     swarthy, lithe Montagnais was coming down the road, and Holliday
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31850">
     addressed him rapidly in habitan French: "This gentleman wishes to go up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31860">
     river to the forks to see the big cache. Will you go with him?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31880">
     The Montagnais bowed to Professor Hooker and pondered the suggestion.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31890">
     Then he gesticulated toward the north and seemed to Bennie to be telling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31900">
     a long story.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31920">
     Holliday laughed again. "Marc says he will go," he commented shortly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31930">
     "But he says also that if the Great Father of the Marionettes is angry
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31940">
     he will come back."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31960">
     "What does he mean by that?" asked Bennie.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31980">
     "Why, when the aurora borealis--Northern Lights--plays in the sky the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_31990">
     Indians always say that the 'marionettes are dancing.' About four weeks
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32000">
     ago we had some electrical disturbances up here and a kind of an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32010">
     earthquake. It scared these Indians silly. There was a tremendous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32020">
     display, almost like a volcano. It beat anything I ever saw, and I've
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32030">
     been here fifteen years. The Indians said the Father of the Marionettes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32040">
     was angry because they didn't dance enough to suit him, and that he was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32050">
     making them dance. Then some of them caught a glimpse of a shooting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32060">
     star, or a comet, or something, and called it the Father of the

     Marionettes. They had quite a time--held masses, and so on--and were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32080">
     really cut up. But the thing is over now, except for the regular,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32090">
     ordinary display."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32110">
     "When can they be ready?" inquired Bennie eagerly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32130">
     "To-morrow morning," replied Holliday. "Marc will engage his uncle.

     They're all right. Now how about an outfit? But don't talk any more

     sand to where a canoe had been run into the riffles of the beach. Marc

     came first, carrying a sheet-iron stove with a collapsible funnel; then

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32260">
     mackintosh and rifle, entirely unaware of the fact that his careful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32270">
     guides had removed all the cartridges from his luggage lest he should
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32280">
     shoot too many caribou and so spoil the winter's food supply. It was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32290">
     cold, almost frosty. In the black flood of the river the stars burned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32300">
     with a chill, wavering light. Bennie put on his mackintosh with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32310">
     shiver. The two guides quietly piled the luggage in the centre of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32320">
     canoe, arranged a seat for their passenger, picked up their paddles,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32330">
     shoved off, and took their places in bow and stern.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32350">
     No lights gleamed in the windows of Moisie. The lap of the ripples

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32390">
     broke the deathlike silence of the semi-arctic night. Bennie struck a

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32400">
     match, and it flared red against the black water as he lit his pipe, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32410">
     he felt a great stirring within his little breast, a great courage to

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32430">
     for the secret that would remake the world. With the current whispering

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32460">
     glow made the horizon seem blacker than ever. Ahead the wide waste of

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32470">
     the dark river seemed like an engulfing chasm. Drowsiness enwrapped

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32480">
     Professor Hooker, a drowsiness intensified by the rythmic swinging of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32490">
     the paddles and the pile of bedding against which he reclined. He closed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32500">
     his eyes, content to be driven onward toward the region of his hopes,

     "Where?" he cried. "Where?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32610">
     "_Au nord_," answered Marc. "_Mais il descend!_"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32630">
     Professor Hooker stared in the direction of Marc's uplifted paddle. Was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32640">
     he deceived? Was the wish father to the thought? Or did he really see at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32650">
     an immeasurable distance upon the horizon a quickly dying trail of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32660">
     orange-yellow light? He rubbed his eyes--his heart beating wildly under
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32670">
     his sportsman's suiting. But the north was black beyond the coming dawn.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32690">
     Old Edouard grunted.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32710">
     "_Vous êtes fou!_" he muttered to his nephew, and drove his paddle deep
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32720">
     into the water.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32740">
     Day broke with staccato emphasis. The sun swung up out of Europe and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32750">
     burned down upon the canoe with a heat so equatorial in quality that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32760">
     Bennie discarded both his mackintosh and his sporting jacket. All signs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32770">
     of human life had disappeared from the distant banks of the river and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32780">
     the bow of the canoe faced a gray-blue flood emerging from a wilderness
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32790">
     of scrubby trees. A few gulls flopped their way coast-ward, and at rare
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32800">
     intervals a salmon leaped and slashed the slow-moving surface into a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32810">
     boiling circle; but for the rest their surroundings were as set, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32820">
     immobile, as the painted scenery of a stage, save where the current
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32830">
     swept the scattered promontories of the shore. But they moved steadily
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32840">
     north. So wearied was Bennie with the unaccustomed light and fresh air
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32850">
     that by ten o'clock he felt the day must be over, although the sun had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32860">
     not yet reached the zenith. Unexpectedly Marc and Edouard turned the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32870">
     canoe quietly into a shallow, and beached her on a spit of white sand.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32880">
     In three minutes Edouard had a small fire snapping, and handed Bennie a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32890">
     cup of tea. How wonderful it seemed--a genuine elixir! And then he felt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32900">
     the stab of a mosquito, and putting up his hand found it blotched with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32910">
     blood. And the black flies came also. Soon the professor was tramping up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32920">
     and down, waving his handkerchief and clutching wildly at the air. Then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32930">
     they pushed off again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32950">
     The sun dropped westward as they turned bend after bend, disclosing ever
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32960">
     the same view beyond. Shadows of rocks and trees began to jut across the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32970">
     eddies. A great heron, as big as an ostrich, or so he seemed, arose
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32980">
     awkwardly and flapped off, trailing yards of legs behind him. Then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_32990">
     Bennie put on first his jacket and then his mackintosh. He realized that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33000">
     his hands were numb. The sun was now only a foot or so above the sky
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33010">
     line.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33030">
     This time it was Marc who grunted and thrust the canoe toward the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33040">
     river's edge with a sideways push. It grounded on a belt of sand and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33050">
     they dragged it ashore. Bennie, who had been looking forward to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33060">
     night with vivid apprehension, now discovered to his great happiness
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33070">
     that the chill was keeping away the black flies. Joyfully he assisted in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33080">
     gathering dry sticks, driving tent pegs, and picking reindeer moss for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33090">
     bedding. Then as darkness fell Edouard fried eggs and bacon, and with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33100">
     their boots off and their stockinged feet toasting to the blaze the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33110">
     three men ate as becomes men who have laboured fifteen hours in the open
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33120">
     air. They drank tin cups of scalding tea, a pint at a time, and found it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33130">
     good; and they smoked their pipes with their backs propped against the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33140">
     tree trunks and found it heaven. Then as the stars came out and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33150">
     woods behind them snapped with strange noises, Edouard took his pipe
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33160">
     from his mouth.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33180">
     "It's getting cold," said he. "The marionettes will dance to-night."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33200">
     Bennie heard him as if across a great, yawning gulf. Even the firelight
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33210">
     seemed hundreds of yards away. The little professor was "all in," and he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33220">
     sat with his chin dropped again to his chest, until he heard Marc
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33230">
     exclaim:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33250">
     "_Voilà! Elles dansent!_"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33270">
     He raised his eyes. Just across the black, silent sweep of the river
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33280">
     three giant prismatic searchlights were playing high toward the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33290">
     polestar, such searchlights as the gods might be using in some monstrous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33300">
     game. They wavered here and there, shifting and dodging, faded and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33310">
     sprang up again, till Bennie, dizzy, closed his eyes. The lights were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33320">
     still dancing in the north as he stumbled to his couch of moss.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33340">
     "_Toujour les marionettes!_" whispered Marc gently, as he might to a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33350">
     child. "_Bon soir, monsieur._"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33370">
     The tent was hot and dazzling white above his head when low voices,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33380">
     footsteps, and the clink of tin against iron aroused the professor from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33390">
     a profound coma. The guides had already loaded the canoe and were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33400">
     waiting for him. The sun was high. Apologetically he pulled on his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33410">
     boots, and stepping to the sand dashed the icy water into his face. His
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33420">
     muscles groaned and rasped. His neck refused to respond to his desires
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33430">
     with its accustomed elasticity. But he drank his tea and downed his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33440">
     scrambled eggs with an enthusiasm unknown in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33450">
     Marc gave him a hand into the canoe and they were off. The day had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33460">
     begun.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33480">
     The river narrowed somewhat and the shores grew more rocky. At noon they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33490">
     lunched on another sand-spit. At sunset they saw a caribou. Night came.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33500">
     "Always the marionettes." Thus passed nine days--like a dream to Bennie;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33510">
     and then came the first adventure.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33530">
     It was about four o'clock on the afternoon of the tenth day of their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33540">
     trip up the Moisie when Marc suddenly stopped paddling and gazed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33550">
     intently shoreward. After a moment he said something in a low tone to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33560">
     Edouard, and they turned the canoe and drove it rapidly toward a small
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33570">
     cove half hidden by rocks. Bennie, straining his eyes, could see nothing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33580">
     at first, but when the canoe was but ten yards from shore he caught
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33590">
     sight of the motionless figure of a man, lying on his face with his head
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33600">
     nearly in the water. Marc turned him over gently, but the limbs fell
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33610">
     limp, one leg at a grotesque angle to the knee. Bennie saw instantly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33620">
     that it was broken. The Indian's face was white and drawn, no doubt with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33630">
     pain.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33650">
     "_Il est mort!_" said Marc slowly, crossing himself.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33670">
     Edouard shrugged his shoulders and fetched a small flask of brandy from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33680">
     the professor's sack. Forcing open the jaws, he poured a few drops into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33690">
     the man's mouth. The Indian choked and opened his eyes. Edouard grunted.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33710">
     "_La jeunesse pense qu'elle sait tout!_" he remarked scornfully.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33730">
     Thus they found Nichicun, without whom Bennie might never have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33740">
     accomplished the object of his quest. It took three days to nurse the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33750">
     half-dead and altogether starved Montagnais back to life, but he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33760">
     received the tenderest care. Marc shot a young caribou and gave him the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33770">
     blood to drink, and made a ragout to put the flesh back on his bones.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33780">
     Meanwhile the professor slept long hours on the moss and took a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33790">
     much-needed rest; and by degrees they learned from Nichicun the story of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33800">
     his misfortune--the story that forms a part of the chronicle of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33810">
     expedition, which can be read at the Smithsonian Institution.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33830">
     He was a Montagnais, he said, with a line of traps to the northeast of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33840">
     the Height of Land, and last winter he had had very bad luck indeed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33850">
     There had been less and less in his traps and he had seen no caribou. So
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33860">
     he had taken his wife, who was sick, and had gone over into the Nascopee
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33870">
     country for food, and there his wife had died. He had made up his mind
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33880">
     very late in the season to come down to Moisie and make his mass and get
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33890">
     a new wife, and start a fresh line of traps in the autumn. All the other
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33900">
     Montagnais had descended the river in their canoes long before, so he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33910">
     was alone. His provisions had given out and he saw no caribou. He began
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33920">
     to think he would surely starve to death. And then one evening, on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33930">
     point just above their present camp, he had seen a caribou and shot it,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33940">
     but he had been too weak to take good aim and had only broken its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33950">
     shoulder. It lay kicking among the boulders, pushing itself along by its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33960">
     hind legs, and he had feared that it would escape. In his haste to reach
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33970">
     it he had slipped on a wet rock and fallen and broken his leg. In spite
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33980">
     of the pain he had crawled on, and then had taken place a wild, terrible
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_33990">
     fight for life between the dying man and the dying beast.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34010">
     He could not remember all that had occurred--he had been kicked, gored,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34020">
     and bitten; but finally he had got a grip on its throat and slashed it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34030">
     with his knife. Then, lying there on the ground beside it, he drank its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34040">
     blood and cut off the raw flesh in strips for food. Finally one day he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34050">
     had crawled to the river for water and had fainted.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34070">
     The professor and his guides made for the Indian a hut of rocks and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34080">
     bark, and threw a great pile of moss into the corner of it for him to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34090">
     lie on. They carved a splint for his leg and bound it up, and cut a huge
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34100">
     heap of firewood for him, smoking caribou meat and hanging it up in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34110">
     hut. Somebody would come up river and find him, or if not, the three men
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34120">
     would pick him up on their return. For this was right and the law of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34130">
     woods. But never a word of particular interest to Prof. Bennie Hooker
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34140">
     did Nichicun speak until the night before their departure, although the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34150">
     reason and manner of his speaking were natural enough. It happened as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34160">
     follows: but first it should be said that the Nascopees are an ignorant
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34170">
     and barbarous tribe, dirty and treacherous, upon whom the Montagnais
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34180">
     look down with contempt and scorn. They do not even wear civilized
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34190">
     clothes, and their ways are not the ways of _les bons sauvages_. They
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34200">
     have no priests; they do not come to the coast; and the Montagnais will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34210">
     not mingle with them. Thus it bespoke the hunger of Nichicun that he was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34220">
     willing to go into their country.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34240">
     As he sat round the fire with Marc and Edouard on that last night,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34250">
     Nichicun spoke his mind of the Nascopees, and Marc translated freely for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34260">

     No, the injured Montagnais told them, the Nascopees were not nice; they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34290">
     were dirty. They ate decayed food and they never went to mass. Moreover,

     they were half-witted. While he was there they were all planning to

     migrate for the most absurd reason--what do you suppose? Magic! They
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34320">
     claimed the end of the world was coming! Of course it was coming some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34330">
     time. But they said now, right away. But why? Because the marionettes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34340">
     were dancing so much. And they had seen the Father of the Marionettes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34350">
     floating in the sky and making thunder! Fools! But the strangest thing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34360">
     of all, they said they could hunt no longer, for they were afraid to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34370">
     cross something--an iron serpent that stung with fire if you touched it,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34380">
     and killed you! What foolishness! An iron serpent! But he had asked them
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34390">
     and they had sworn on the holy cross that it was true.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34410">
     Bennie listened with a chill creeping up his spine. But it would never
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34420">
     do to hint what this disclosure meant to him. Between puffs of his pipe
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34430">
     he asked casual, careless questions of Nichicun. These Nascopees, for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34440">
     instance, how far off might their land be? And where did they assert
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34450">
     this extraordinary serpent of iron to be? Were there rivers in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34460">
     Nascopee country? Did white men ever go there? All these things the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34470">
     wounded Montagnais told him. It appeared, moreover, that the Rassini
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34480">
     River was near the Nascopee territory, and that it flowed into the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34490">
     Moisie only seven miles above the camp. All that night the marionettes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34500">
     danced in Bennie's brain.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34520">
     Next morning they propped Nichicun on his bed of moss, laid a rifle and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34530">
     a box of matches beside him, and bade him farewell. At the mouth of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34540">
     Rassini River Prof. Bennie Hooker held up his hand and announced that he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34550">
     was going to the Nascopee country. The canoe halted abruptly. Old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34560">
     Edouard declared that they had been engaged only to go to the big cache,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34570">
     and that their present trip was merely by way of a little excursion to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34580">
     see the river. They had no supplies for such a journey, no proper amount
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34590">
     of ammunition. No, they would deposit the professor on the nearest
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34600">
     sandbar if he wished, but they were going back.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34620">
     Bennie arose unsteadily in the canoe and dug into his pocket, producing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34630">
     a roll of gold coin. Two hundred and fifty dollars he promised them if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34640">
     they would take him to the nearest tribe of Nascopees; five hundred if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34650">
     they could find the Iron Serpent.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34670">
     "_Bien!_" exclaimed both Indians without a moment's hesitation, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34680">
     canoe plunged forward up the Rassini.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34700">
     Once more a dreamlike succession of brilliant, frosty days; once more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34710">
     the star-studded sky in which always the marionettes danced. And then at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34720">
     last the great falls of the Rassini, beyond which no white man had gone.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34730">
     They hid the canoe in the bushes and placed beneath it the iron stove
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34740">
     and half their supply of food. Then they plunged into the brush,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34750">
     eastward. Bennie had never known such grueling work and heartbreaking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34760">
     fatigue; and the clouds of flies pursued them venomously and with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34770">
     unrelenting persistence. At first they had to cut their way through
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34780">
     acres of brush, and then the land rose and they saw before them miles of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34790">
     swamp and barren land dotted with dwarf trees and lichen-grown rocks.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34800">
     Here it was easier and they made better time; but the professor's legs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34810">
     ached and his rifle wore a red bruise on his shoulder. And then after
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34820">
     five days of torment they came upon the Iron Rail. It ran in almost a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34830">
     direct line from northwest to southwest, with hardly a waver, straight
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34840">
     over the barrens and through the forests of scrub, with a five-foot
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34850">
     clearing upon either side. At intervals it was elevated to a height of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34860">
     eight or ten inches upon insulated iron braces. Both Marc and Edouard
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34870">
     stared at in wonder, while Bennie made them a little speech.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34890">
     It was, he said, a thing called a "monorail," made by a man who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34900">
     possessed strange secrets concerning the earth and the properties of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34910">
     matter. That man lived over the Height of Land toward Ungava. He was a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34920">
     good man and would not harm other good men. But he was a great
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34930">
     magician--if you believed in magic. On the rail undoubtedly he ran
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34940">
     something called a gyroscopic engine, and carried his stores and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34950">
     machinery into the wilderness. The Nascopees were not such fools after
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34960">
     all, for here was the something they feared to cross--the iron serpent
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34970">
     that bit and killed. Let them watch while he made it bite. He allowed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34980">
     his rifle to fall against the rail, and instantly a shower of blue
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_34990">
     sparks flashed from it as the current leaped into the earth.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_35010">
     Bennie counted out twenty-five golden eagles and handed them to Edouard.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_35020">
     If they followed the rail to its source he would, he promised, on their

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_35040">
     Indians lifted their packs and swung off to the northwest along the line
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_35050">
     of the rail. The stock of Prof. Bennie Hooker had risen in their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_35060">
     estimation. On they ploughed across the barrens, through swamps, over

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_35070">
     the quaking muskeg, into the patches of scrub growth where the short
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_35080">
     branches slapped their faces, but always they kept in sight of the rail.

     First Artillery Division of the German Army of the Meuse to violate the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_35150">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_35160">
     to destroy Paris had been prevented only by the sudden appearance of the
    </p>

     same mysterious Flying Ring that had shortly before caused the

     about the hour of midnight, as if to observe whether the warring nations

     peacefully along, three thousand feet aloft, deluging the countryside

     see. But he could discern nothing except mosquitoes. And then he thought
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37010">
     he saw a mosquito larger than all the others. He waved at it, but it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37020">
     remained where it was. A slight breeze momentarily wafted the swarm
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37030">
     away, and he still saw the big mosquito hovering over the horizon. Then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37040">
     he heard Marc cry out:
    </p>

     "_Quelque chose vol en l'air!_"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37080">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37100">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37150">
     "It's him," he chattered emphatically, if ungrammatically.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37170">
     Marc and Edouard nodded.

     And then Bennie, without offering any explanation, found himself dancing

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37240">
     up and down upon the rocks in the dizzying sun, waving his hat and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37250">
     shouting to the Father of the Marionettes. What he shouted he never
    </p>

     knew. And Marc and Edouard both shouted, too. But the master of the Ring
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37270">
     heard them not, or if he heard he paid them no attention. Nearer and

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37280">
     nearer came the Ring, until Bennie could see the gleaming cylinder of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37290">
     its great steel circle. At a distance of about two miles it swept
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37300">
     through the air over a low ridge, and settled toward the earth in the

     direction of Ungava.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37330">
     "He only goes ten mile maybe," announced Marc confidently. "_Un petit

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37360">
     On they struggled beside the Rail, but now hope ran high. Bennie sang
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37370">
     and whistled, unmindful of the mosquitoes and black flies that renewed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37380">
     their attacks with unremitting ferocity. The sun lowered itself into the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37390">
     pine trees, shooting dazzling shafts through the low branches, and then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37400">
     sank in a welter of crimson-yellow light. The sky turned gray in the

     east; faint stars twinkled through the quivering waves that still shook
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37420">
     from the overheated rocks. It turned cold and the mosquitoes departed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37430">
     Hugging the Rail, they staggered on, now over shaking muskeg, now

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37480">
     dwarfed trees showed that the moon was rising. They boiled the water,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37490">
     made tea, and cooked some biscuits. Soon they could see to pursue their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37500">
     way.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37520">
     "'Most there now," encouraged Marc.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37590">
     to distinguish.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37610">
     "_Nous sommes arrivees_," he announced.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37630">
     With his heart thumping from the exertion of the climb, Bennie crawled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37640">
     up beside his guide and found himself confronted by a strong barbed-wire
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37650">
     entanglement affixed to iron stanchions firmly imbedded in the rocks.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37660">
     They were on the top of a ridge that dropped away abruptly at their feet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37670">
     into a valley, perhaps a mile in width, terminating on the other side in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37680">
     perpendicular cliffs, estimated by Bennie to be about eight hundred or a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37690">
     thousand feet in height. Although the entanglement was by no means
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37700">
     impassable, it was a distinct obstacle and one they preferred to tackle
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37710">
     by daylight. Moreover, it indicated that their company was undesired.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37720">
     They were in the presence of an unknown quantity, the master of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37730">
     Flying Ring. Whether he was a malign or a benevolent influence, this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37740">
     Father of the Marionettes, they could not tell.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37760">
     With his back propped against a small spruce Bennie focused his glasses
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37770">
     upon dim shapes barely discernible in the midst of the valley. He was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37780">
     thrilled by a deep excitement, a strange fear. What would he see? What
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37790">
     mysteries would those vague forms disclose? The shadows cast by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37800">
     cliffs and a light mist gathering in the low ground made it difficult to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37810">
     see; and then, even as he looked, the moon rose higher and shone through
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37820">
     something in the middle of the valley that looked like a tall, grisly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37830">
     skeleton. It seemed to have legs and arms, an odd mushroom-shaped head,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37840">
     and endless ribs. Below and at its feet were other and vaguer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37850">
     shapes--flat domes or cupolas, bombproofs perhaps, buildings of some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37860">
     sort--Pax's home beyond peradventure.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37880">
     As he looked through the glasses at the skeleton-like tower Bennie had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37890">
     an extraordinary feeling of having seen it all before somewhere. As in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37900">
     long-forgotten dream he remembered Tesla's tower near Smithtown, on Long
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37910">
     Island. And this was Tesla's tower, naught else! It is a strange thing,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37920">
     how at great crises of our lives come feelings of anticipatory
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37930">
     knowledge. There is, indeed, nothing new under the sun; else had Bennie
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37940">
     been more afraid. As it was, he saw only Tesla's Smithtown tower with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37950">
     its head like a young mushroom. And at the same time there flashed into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37960">
     his memory: "Childe Harold to the Dark Tower Came." Over and over he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37970">
     repeated it mechanically, feeling that he might be one of those of whom
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_37980">
     the poet had sung. Yet he had not read the lines for years:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38000">
     _Burningly it came on me all at once,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38010">
     This was the place!...
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38020">
     What in the midst lay but the Tower itself?_
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38040">
     His eyes searched the shadows round the base of the tower, for his ears
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38050">
     had already caught a faint, almost inaudible throbbing that seemed to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38060">
     grow from moment to moment. There certainly was a dull vibration in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38070">
     air, a vibration like the distant hum of machinery. Suddenly old Edouard
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38080">
     touched Bennie upon the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38100">
     "_Regardez!_" he whispered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38120">
     Some transformation was happening in the hood of the tower. From a black
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38130">
     opaque object it began to turn a dull red and to diffuse a subdued glow,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38140">
     while the hum turned into a distinct whir.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38160">
     Bennie became almost hysterical with excitement.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38180">
     Soon the hood of the tower had turned white and the glow had increased
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38190">
     until the whole valley was lit up with a suffused and gentle light. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38200">
     Ring could be distinctly seen about half a mile away, resting upon a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38210">
     huge circular support.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38230">
     "_C'est le feu!_" grunted Marc. "_C'est ainsi que l'on fait danser les
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38240">
     marionettes!_"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38260">
     There was no doubt that the hood of the tower was in fact white hot, for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38270">
     the perpendicular cliffs of the mountain across the valley sharply
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38280">
     reflected the light that it disseminated. The humming whir of the great
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38290">
     alternator rose gradually into a scream like the outcry of some angry
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38300">
     thing. And then unexpectedly a shaft of pale lavender light shot out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38310">
     from the glowing hood and lost itself in the blackness of the midnight
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38320">
     sky. Now appeared a wonderful and beautiful spectacle: immediately above
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38330">
     the point where the rays disappeared into the ether hundreds of points
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38340">
     of yellow fire suddenly sprang into being in the sky, darting hither and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38350">
     thither like fireflies, some moving slowly and others with such speed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38360">
     they appeared as even, luminous lines.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38380">
     "_Les marionettes! Les marionettes!_" Marc cried trembling.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38400">
     "Not at all! Not at all! They are meteorites!" answered Bennie, entirely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38410">
     engrossed in the scientific phase of the matter and forgetting that he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38420">
     did not speak the other's language. "Space is jammed full of meteoric
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38430">
     dust. The larger particles, which strike our atmosphere and which ignite
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38440">
     by friction, form shooting stars. The Ray--the Lavender Ray--reaching
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38450">
     out into the most distant regions of space meets them in countless
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38460">
     numbers and disintegrates them, surrounding them with glowing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38470">
     atmospheres. By George, though, if he starts in playing the Ray upon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38480">
     that cliff we've got to stand from under! Look here, boys," he shouted,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38490">
     "stuff something in your ears." He seized his handkerchief, tore it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38500">
     apart, and, making two plugs, thrust them into the openings of his ears
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38510">
     as far as the drums. The others in wonderment followed his example.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38530">
     "He's going to rock the earth!" cried Bennie Hooker. "He's going to rock
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38540">
     the earth again!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38560">
     Slowly the Lavender Ray swung through the ether, followed by its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38570">
     millions of meteorites, dipping downward toward the northern side of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38580">
     valley and sinking ever lower and lower toward the cliff. Bennie threw
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38590">
     himself flat on his stomach upon the ridge, pressing his hands to his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38600">
     ears, and the others, feeling that something terrible was going to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38610">
     happen, followed his example. Nearer and nearer toward the ridge dropped
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38620">
     the Ray. Bennie held his breath. Another instant and there came a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38630">
     blinding splash of yellow light, a crash like thunder, and a roar that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38640">
     seemed to tear the mountain from its base. The earth shook. Into the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38650">
     zenith sprang a flame of incandescent vapour a mile in height. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38660">
     tumult increased. Vivid blue flashes of lightning shot out from the spot
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38670">
     upon which the Ray played. The air was filled with thunderings, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38680">
     ground beneath them rose and fell and swung from side to side. Then came
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38690">
     a mighty wind, nay, a cyclone, and gravel and broken branches fell upon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38700">
     them, and suffocating clouds of dust filled their eyes and shut out from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38710">
     time to time what was occurring in the valley. The face of the cliff
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38720">
     glowed like the interior of a furnace, and the blazing yellow blast of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38730">
     glowing helium shot over their heads and off into space, making the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38740">
     night sky light as day.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38760">
     For a moment they all lay stunned and sightless. Then the discharge
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38770">
     appeared to diminish both in volume and in intensity. The air cleared
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38780">
     somewhat and the ground no longer trembled. The burst of flame slowly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38790">
     subsided, like a fountain that is being gradually turned off. Either the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38800">
     Ring man wasn't going to rock the earth or he had lost control of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38810">
     machinery.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38830">
     Something was clearly going wrong. Showers of sparks fell from the hood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38840">
     and occasionally huge glowing masses of molten metal dropped from it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38850">
     And now the Lavender Ray began slowly to sweep down the face of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38860">
     cliff; and the yellow blast of helium gradually faded away until it was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38870">
     scarcely visible. The roar of the alternator died down, first to a hum
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38880">
     and then to a purr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38900">
     "Something's busted," thought Bennie, "and he's shut it off."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38920">
     The Ray had now reached the bottom of the cliff and was sweeping across
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38930">
     the ground toward the base of the tower, its path being marked by a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38940">
     small travelling volcano that hurled its smoke and steam high into the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38950">
     air. It was evident to Bennie that the hood of the tower was slowly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38960">
     turning over, and that the now fast-fading Ray would presently play upon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38970">
     its base and the adjacent cupola in which the master of the Ring was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_38980">
     probably attempting to control his recalcitrant machinery.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39000">
     And then Bennie lost consciousness.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39020">
     *       *       *       *       *
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39040">
     A splash of rain. He awoke, and found himself lying by the barbed-wire
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39050">
     fence in the graying light of dawn. His muscles were stiff and sore, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39060">
     he felt a strange sense of exhilaration. A mist was driving across the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39070">
     valley and enshrouding the scene of the night's debacle. Through the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39080">
     rain gusts he could see, still standing, the wreck of the tower, with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39090">
     fragment of melted inductor drooping from its apex--and a long way off
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39100">
     the Ring. The base of the tower and its surroundings were lost in mist.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39110">
     He crawled to his knees and looked about him for Marc and Edouard, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39120">
     they had disappeared. His field glasses lay beside him, and he picked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39130">
     them up and raised himself to his feet. Like stout Cortés, silent upon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39140">
     his peak in Darien, he surveyed the Pacific of his dreams. For the Ring
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39150">
     was still there! Pax might be annihilated, his machinery destroyed, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39160">
     the secret remained--and it was his, Bennie Hooker's, of Appian Way,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39170">
     Cambridge, Massachusetts! In his excitement, in getting over the fence
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39180">
     he tore a jagged hole in what was left of his sporting suit, but in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39190">
     moment more he was scrambling down the ridge into the ravine.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39210">
     He found it no easy task to climb down the jagged face of the cliff, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39220">
     twenty minutes of stiff work landed him in the valley and within a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39230">
     thousand yards of the stark remains of the tower. Between where he stood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39240">
     and the devastation caused by the culminating explosion of the night
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39250">
     before, the surface of the earth showed the customary ledges of barren
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39260">
     rock, the scraggy scattering of firs, and stretches of moss with which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39270">
     he had become so familiar. Behind him the monorail, springing into space
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39280">

     which evidently had terminated in a station, now vanished, near the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39300">
     tower. From his point of observation little of the results of the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39310">
     upheaval was noticeable except the débris, which lay in a film of

     shattered rock and gravel over the surface of the ground, but as he ran

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39330">
     toward the tower the damage caused by the Ray quickly became apparent.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39350">
     At the distance of two hundred yards from the base he paused astounded.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39360">
     Why anything of the tower remained at all was a mystery, explicable only
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39370">
     by reason of the skeleton-like character of its construction. All about

     fragment of the dome or bombproof all trace of buildings had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39400">
     disappeared. A glistening lake of leperous-like molten lead lay in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39410">
     centre of the crater, strangely iridescent. A broad path of destruction,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39420">
     fifty yards or so in width, led from the scene of the disruption to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39430">
     precipice against which the Ray had played. The face of the cliff itself
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39440">
     seemed covered with a white coating or powder which gave it a ghostly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39450">
     sheen. Moreover, the rain had turned to snow and already the entire
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39460">
     aspect of the valley had changed.

     Bennie stood wonderingly on the edge of this inferno. He was cold,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39490">
     famished, horror-stricken. Like a flash in a pan the mechanism which had
    </p>

     rocked the earth and dislocated its axis had blown out; and there was

     now nothing left to tell the story, for its inventor had flashed out
    </p>

     with it into eternity. At his very feet a conscious human being, only
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39530">
     twelve short hours before, had by virtue of his stupendous brain been

     able to generate and control a force capable of destroying the planet

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39560">
     by was hovering amid the whirling snowflakes that which might be his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39570">
     soul. But Pax would send no more messages! Bennie's journey had gone for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39580">
     naught. He had arrived just too late to talk it all over with his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39590">
     fellow-scientist, and discuss those little improvements on Hiroshito's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39600">
     theory. Pax was dead!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39620">
     He sat down wearily, noticing for the first time that his ears pained
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39630">
     him. In his depression and excitement he had totally forgotten the Ring.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39640">
     He wondered how he was ever going to get back to Cambridge. And then as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39650">
     he raised his hand to adjust his Glengarry he saw it awaiting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39660">
     him--unscathed. Far to the westward it rested snugly in its gigantic
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39670">
     nest of crossbeams, like the head of some colossal decapitated Chinese
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39680">
     mandarin. With an involuntary shout he started running down the valley,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39690">
     heedless of his steps. Nearer and higher loomed the steel trestlework
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39700">
     upon which rested the giant engine. Panting, he blindly stumbled on,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39710">
     mindful only of the momentous fact that Pax's secret was not lost.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39730">
     Fifty feet above the ground, supported upon a cylindrical trestle of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39740">
     steel girders, rested the body of the car, constructed of aluminum
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39750">
     plates in the form of an anchor ring some seventy-five feet in diameter,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39760">
     while over the circular structure of the Ring itself rose a skeleton
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39770">
     tower like a tripod, carrying at its summit a huge metal device shaped
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39780">
     like a thimble, the open mouth of which pointed downward through the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39790">
     open centre of the machine. Obviously this must be the tractor or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39800">
     radiant engine. There, too, swung far out from the side of the ring on a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39810">
     framework of steel, was the thermic inductor which had played the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39820">
     disintegrating Ray upon the Atlas Mountains and the great cannon of Von
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39830">
     Heckmann. The whole affair resembled nothing which he had ever conceived
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39840">
     of either in the air, the earth, or the waters under the earth, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39850">
     bizarre invention of a superhuman mind. It seemed as firmly anchored and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39860">
     as immovable as the Eiffel Tower, and yet Bennie knew that the thing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39870">
     could lift itself into the air and sail off like a ball of thistledown
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39880">
     before a breeze. He knew that it could do it, for he had seen it with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39890">
     his own eyes.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39910">
     A few steps more brought him into the centre of the circle of steel
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39920">
     girders which supported the landing stage. Here the surface of the earth
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39930">
     at his feet had been completely denuded and the underlying rock exposed,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39940">
     evidently by some artificial action, the downward blast of gas from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39950">
     tractor. Even the rock itself had been seared by the discharge; little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39960">
     furrows worn smooth as if by a mountain torrent radiating in all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39970">
     directions from the central point. More than anything it reminded Bennie
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39980">
     of the surface of a meteorite, polished and scarred by its rush through
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_39990">
     the atmosphere. He paused, filled with a kind of awe. The most wonderful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40000">
     engine of all time waited his inspection. The great secret was his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40010">
     alone. The inventor and his associates had been wiped out of existence
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40020">
     in a flash, and the Flying Ring was his by every right of treasure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40030">
     trove. In the heart of the Labrador wilderness Prof. Benjamin Hooker of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40040">
     Cambridge, Massachusetts, gave an exultant shout, threw off his coat,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40050">
     and swarmed up the steel ladder leading to the landing stage.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40070">
     He had ascended about halfway when a voice echoed among the girders. A
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40080">
     red face was peering down at him over the edge of the platform.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40100">
     "Hello!" said the face. "I'm all right, I guess."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40120">
     Bennie gripped tight hold of the ladder, stiff with fear. He thought
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40130">
     first of jumping down, changed his mind, and, shutting his eyes,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40140">
     continued automatically climbing up the ladder.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40160">
     Then a hand gripped him under the arm and gave him a lift on to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40170">
     level floor of the platform. He steadied himself and opened his eyes.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40180">
     Before him stood a man in blue overalls, under whose forehead, burned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40190">
     bright red by the Labrador sun, a pair of blue eyes looked out vaguely.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40200">
     The man appeared to be waiting for the visitor to make the next move.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40210">
     "Good morning," said Bennie, sparring for time. "Well"--he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40220">
     hesitated--"where were you when it happened?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40240">
     The man looked at him stupidly. "What?" he mumbled. "I--I don't seem to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40250">
     remember. You see--I was in--the condenser room building up the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40260">
     charge--for to-morrow--I mean to-day--sixty thousand volts at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40270">
     terminals, and the fluid clearing up. I guess I looked out of the window
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40280">
     a minute--to see--the fireworks--and then--somehow--I was out on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40290">
     platform." He shaded his eyes and looked off down the valley at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40300">
     half-shattered, wrecked tower. "The wind and the smoke!" he muttered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40310">
     "The wind and the smoke--and the dust in my eyes--and now it's all gone
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40320">
     to hell! But I guess everything's all right now, if you want to fly." He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40330">
     touched his cap automatically. "We can start whenever you are ready,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40340">
     sir. You see I thought you were gone, too! That would have been a mess!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40350">
     I'm sure you can handle the balancer without Perkins. Poor old Perk! And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40360">
     Hoskins--and the others. All gone, by God! All wiped out! Only me and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40370">
     you left, sir!" He laughed hysterically.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40390">
     "Bats in his belfry!" thought Bennie. "Something hit him!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40410">
     Slowly it came over him that the half-stunned creature thought that he,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40420">
     Bennie Hooker, was Pax, the Master of the World!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40440">
     He took the fellow by the arm. "Come on inside," he said. A plan had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40450">
     already formulated itself in his brain. Even as he was the man might be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40460">
     able to go through his customary duties in handling the Ring. It was not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40470">
     impossible. He had heard of such things, and the thought of the long
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40480">
     marches over the frozen barrens and the perilous canoe trip down the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40490">
     coast, contrasted with a swift rush for an hour or two through the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40500">
     sunlit air, gave the professor the courage which might not have availed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40510">
     him otherwise. At the top of a short ladder a trapdoor opened inward,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40520">
     and Bennie found himself in a small compartment scarcely large enough to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40530">
     turn around in, from which a second door opened into the body of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40540">
     Ring proper.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40560">
     "It's all right--to-day," said the man hesitatingly. "I fixed--the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40570">
     air-lock--yesterday, sir. The leak--was here--at the hinge--but it's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40580">
     quite tight--now." He pointed at the door.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40600">
     "Good," remarked Bennie. "I'll look around and see how things are."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40620">
     This seemed to him to be eminently safe--and allowing for a program of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40630">
     investigation absolutely essential at the moment. Once he could master
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40640">
     the secret of the Ring and be sure that the part of the fellow's brain
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40650">
     which controlled the performance of his customary duties had not been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40660">
     injured by the shock of the night before, it might be possible to carry
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40670">
     out the daring project which had suggested itself.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40690">
     Passing through the inner door of the air-lock he entered the chart room
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40700">
     of the Ring, followed stumblingly by his companion. It was warm and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40710">
     cozy; the first warmth Hooker had experienced for nearly a month. It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40720">
     made him feel faint, and he dropped into an armchair and pulled off his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40730">
     Glengarry. The survivor of the explosion, standing awkwardly at his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40740">
     side, fumbled with his cap. Ever and anon he rubbed his head.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40760">
     Bennie sank back into the cushions and looked about him. On the opposite
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40770">
     wall hung a map of the world on Mercator's Projection, and from a spot
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40780">
     in Northern Labrador red lines radiated in all directions, which formed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40790">
     great curved loops, returning to the starting-point.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40810">
     "The flights of the Ring," thought Bennie. "There's the one where they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40820">
     busted the Atlas Mountains," following with his eyes the crimson thread
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40830">
     which ran diagonally across the Atlantic, traversed Spain and the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40850">
     Africa turned back into its original track. Visions came to him of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40860">
     guiding the car for an afternoon jaunt across the Sahara, the gloomy

     afternoon tea, via the Easter Islands, Hawaii, and Alaska. But why stop
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40890">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40930">
     "Excuse me," said the machinist suddenly, "I just forgot--whether you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40940">
     take--cigars or cigarettes. You see I only acted as--table
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40950">
     orderly--once--when Smith had that sprain." His hands moved uncertainly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40960">
     on the shelves, beyond the map. The heart of Professor Hooker leaped.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_40980">
     "Cigars!" he almost shouted.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41000">
     The man found a box of Havanas and struck a match.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41020">
     The bliss of it! And if there was tobacco there must be food and drink
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41030">
     as well. He began to feel strangely exhilarated. But how to handle the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41040">
     man beside him? Pax would certainly never ask the questions that he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41050">
     wished to ask. He smoked rapidly, thinking hard. Of course he might
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41060">
     pretend that he, too, had forgotten things. And at first this seemed to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41070">
     be the only way out of the difficulty. Then he had an inspiration.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41090">
     "Look here," he remarked, rather severely. "Something's happened to you.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41100">
     You say you've forgotten what occurred yesterday? How do I know but you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41110">
     have forgotten everything you ever knew? You remember your name?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41130">
     "My name, sir?" The man laughed in a foolish fashion. "Why--of course I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41140">
     remember--my name. I wouldn't--be likely--to forget--that:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41150">
     Atterbury--I'm Atterbury--electrician of the _Chimaera_." And he drew
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41160">
     himself up.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41180">
     "That's all right," said Bennie, "but what were we doing yesterday? What
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41190">
     is the very last thing that you can go back to?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41210">
     The man wrinkled his forehead. "The last thing? Why, sir, you told us
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41220">
     you were going--to turn over the pole a bit--and freeze up Europe. I was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41230">
     up here--loading the condenser--when you cut me off from the alternator.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41240">
     I opened the switch--and put on the electrometer to see--if we had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41250">
     enough. Next--everything was clouded, and I went--over to the window to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41260">
     see--what was going on."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41280">
     "Yes," commented Bennie approvingly, "all right so far. What happened
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41290">
     then?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41310">
     "Why, after that, sir, after that, there was the Ray of course, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41320">
     er--I don't seem to remember--oh, yes, a short circuit--and I ran--out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41330">
     on the platform--forgot all about the danger! After that, everything's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41340">
     confused. It's like a dream. Your coming up--the ladder--seemed--to wake
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41350">
     me up." The machinist smiled sheepishly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41370">
     The plan was working well. Professor Hooker was learning things fast.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41390">
     "Do you think that the two of us can fly the _Chimaera_ south again?" he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41400">
     asked, inspecting the map.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41420">
     "Why not?" answered Atterbury. "The balancer is working--better
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41430">
     now--and--doesn't take--much attention--and you can lay the course--and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41440">
     manage--the landing. I was going to put a fresh uranium cylinder in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41450">
     tractor this morning--but I--forgot."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41470">
     "There you go, forgetting again!" growled Bennie, realizing that his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41480">
     only excuse for asking questions hung on this fiction. And there were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41490">
     many, many more questions that he must ask before he would be able to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41500">
     fly. "You don't seem quite right in your coco this morning, Atterbury,"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41510">
     he said. "I think we'll look things over a bit--the condenser first."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41530">
     "Very well, sir." Atterbury turned and groped his way through a doorway,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41540">
     and they passed first into what appeared to be a storage-battery room.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41550">
     Huge glass tanks filled with amber-coloured fluid, in which numerous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41560">
     parallel plates were supported, lined the walls from floor to ceiling.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41580">
     An ammeter on the wall caught Bennie's attention. "Weston Direct Reading
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41590">
     A. C. Ammeter," he read on the dial. Alternate current! What were they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41600">
     doing with an alternating current in the storage-battery room? His eyes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41610">
     followed the wires along the wall. Yes, they ran to the terminals of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41620">
     battery. It dawned upon him that there might be something here undreamed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41630">
     of in electrical engineering--a storage battery for an alternating
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41640">
     current!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41660">
     The electrician closed a row of switches, brought the two polished brass
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41670">
     spheres of the discharger within striking distance, and instantly a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41680">
     blinding current of sparks roared between the terminals. He had been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41690">
     right. This battery not only was charged by an alternating current, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41700">
     delivered one of high potential. He peered into the cells, racking his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41710">
     brain for an explanation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41730">
     "Atterbury," said he meditatively, "did I ever tell you why they do
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41740">
     that?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41760">
     "Yes," answered the man. "You--told me--once. The two metals--in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41770">
     electrolyte--come down--on the plates--in alternate films--as--the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41780">
     current changes direction. But you never told me--what the electrolyte
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41790">
     was--I don't suppose--you--would be willing to now, would you?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41810">
     "H'm," said Bennie, "some time, maybe."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41830">
     But this cue was all that he required. A clever scheme! Pax had formed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41840">
     layers of molecular thickness of two different metals in alternation by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41850">
     the to-and-fro swing of his charging current. When the battery
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41860">
     discharged the metals went into solution, each plate becoming
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41870">
     alternately positive and negative. He wondered what Pax had used for an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41880">
     electrolyte that enabled him to get a metallic deposit at each
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41890">
     electrode. And he wondered also why the metals did not alloy. But it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41900">
     would not do for him to linger too long over a mere detail of equipment.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41910">
     And he turned away to continue his tour of inspection, a tour which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41920">
     occupied most of the morning, and during which he found a well-stocked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41930">
     gallery and made himself a cup of coffee.[5]
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41950">
     [Footnote 5: He even climbed with Atterbury to the very summit of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41960">
     tractor, where he discovered that his original guess had been correct
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41970">
     and that the car rose from the earth rocket fashion, due to the back
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41980">
     pressure of the radiant discharge from a massive cylinder of uranium
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_41990">
     contained in the tractor. Against this block played a disintegrating ray
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42000">
     from a small thermic inductor, the inner construction of which he was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42010">
     not able to determine, although it was obviously different from his own,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42020">
     and the coils were wound in a curious manner which he did not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42030">
     understand. There might be something in Hiroshito's theory after all.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42040">
     The cylinder of the tractor pointed directly downward so that the blast
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42050">
     was discharged through the very centre of the Ring, but it could be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42060">
     swung through a small angle in any direction, and by means of this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42070">
     slight deflection the horizontal motion of the machine secured. Perhaps
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42080">
     the most interesting feature of the mechanism was that the Ring appeared
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42090">
     to have automatic stability, for the angle of the direction in which the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42100">
     tractor was pointed was controlled not only by a pair of gyroscopes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42110">
     which kept the Ring on an even keel, but also by a manometric valve
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42120">
     causing it to fly at a fixed height above the earth's surface. Should it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42130">
     start to rise, the diminished pressure of the atmosphere operating on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42140">
     the valve swung the tractor more to one side, and the horizontal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42150">
     acceleration was thus increased at the expense of the vertical.]
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42170">
     But the more he learned about the mechanism of the Ring the greater
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42180">
     became his misgivings about undertaking the return journey alone with

     Atterbury through the air. If they were to go, the start must be made

     within a few days, for the condenser held its charge but a comparatively
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42210">
     short time, and its energy was necessary for starting the Ring. When
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42220">
     freshly charged it supplied current for the thermic inductor for nearly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42230">
     three minutes, but the metallic films, deposited on the plates,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42240">
     dissolved slowly in the fluid, and after three or four days there
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42250">
     remained only enough for a thirty-second run, hardly enough to lift the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42260">
     Ring from the earth. Once in the air, the downward blast from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42270">
     tractor operated a turbine alternator mounted on a skeleton framework at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42280">
     the centre of the Ring, and the current supplied by this machine enabled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42290">
     the Ring to continue its flight indefinitely, or until the cylinder of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42300">
     uranium was completely disintegrated.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42320">
     Yet to trek back over the route by which he had come appeared to be
    </p>

     would return; they were probably already thirty miles on their way back
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42350">
     to the coast. If only he could get word to Thornton or some of those
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42360">
     chaps at Washington they might send a relief expedition! But a ship
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42370">
     would be weeks in getting to the coast, and how could he live in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42380">
     meantime? There were provisions for only a few days in the Ring, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42390">
     storehouse in the valley had been wiped out of existence. Only an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42400">
     aeroplane could do the trick. And then he thought of Burke, his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42410">
     classmate--Burke who had devoted his life to heavier-than-air machines,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42420">
     and who, since his memorable flight across the Atlantic in the _Stormy

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42430">
     Petrol_, had been a national hero. Burke could reach him in ten hours,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42440">
     but how could _he_ reach Burke? In the heart of the frozen wilderness of

     with the civilized world was concerned.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42480">
     A burst of sunlight shot through the window and formed an oval patch on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42490">
     the floor at his feet. The weather was clearing. He went out upon the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42500">
     platform. Patches of blue sky appeared overhead. As he gazed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42510">
     disconsolately across the valley toward the tower, his eye caught the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42520">
     glisten of something high in the air. From the top of the wreckage five
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42530">
     thin shining lines ran parallel across the sky and disappeared in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42540">
     small cloud which hung low over the face of the cliff.

     remembered the complete destruction in the valley. The wireless plant

     Atterbury.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42650">
     "Can we get off a message to Washington?" he demanded. "The wires are

     "We'll try it, anyway," announced Bennie.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_42760">
     He inspected the chart and measured the distance in an airline from

     Boston to the point where the red lines converged. It was a trifle less

     drive his machine by dead reckoning and strike within a few leagues of a

     A muffled roar outside interrupted his musings, and running out on the

     platform again he found Atterbury attaching the cord of the aluminum

     reëntered the chart room to compose his message.

     the story, and, above all, it must be compelling.

     brilliancy, and a dull roar, like that of a waterfall, added itself to

     you see the fire. If he thought the vertical beam was a searchlight and

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44090">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44100">
     his aeroplane through the Ray that had shattered the Atlas Mountains.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44120">
     So it was arranged. Half an hour after sunset Atterbury shut himself up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44130">
     in the Ring, and while Bennie climbed the trail leading to his post on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44140">
     the plateau, he heard the creaking of the great inductor as it slowly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44150">
     turned on its trunions.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44170">
     It was pitch dark by the time he reached the pitifully small pile of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44180">
     brush which they had collected, and he poured some of the oil over it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44190">
     and sat down, drawing a blanket around his shoulders. He felt very much
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44200">
     alone. Suppose the inductor failed to work? Suppose Atterbury turned the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44220">
     the valley, a sound like that of escaping steam, and a moment later the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44230">
     Lavender Ray shot up toward the zenith. Bennie lay on his back and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44240">
     watched it, mindful of the night before the last when he had watched the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44250">
     Ray from the tower descending upon the cliff. He wondered if he should
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44260">
     see any meteorites kindle in its path, but nothing appeared and the Ray
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44270">
     died down, leaving everything in darkness again. Fifteen minutes passed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44280">
     and again the ghostly beam shot up into the night sky. Bennie looked at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44290">
     his watch. It was nearly half-past eight. The cold made him sleepy. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44300">
     drew the blanket about him....
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44320">
     Two hours later through his half-dreams he caught the faint sound for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44330">
     which he had been listening. At first he was not sure. It might be the
    </p>

     turbine alternator of the Ring running by its own inertia for some time
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44350">
     after the discharge had ceased. But no, it was growing louder
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44360">
     momentarily, and appeared to come from high up in the air. Now it died
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44370">
     away to nothingness, and now it swelled in volume, and again died away.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44380">
     But at each subsequent recurrence it was louder than before. There was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44390">
     no longer any doubt. Burke was coming! It was time to start the brush
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44400">
     pile. He lit match after match, only for the wind to blow them out. Yet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44410">
     all the time the machine in the air was coming nearer, the roar of its

     twin engines beating on the stillness of the Labrador night. In despair

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44430">
     Bennie threw himself flat on his face by the brush pile and made a tent

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44440">
     of the blanket, under which he at last succeeded in starting a blaze
    </p>

     among the oil-soaked twigs. Then he pushed the half-empty keg into the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44460">
     fire, arose and stared up at the sky.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44480">
     The machine was somewhere directly above him--just where he could not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44490">
     say. Presently the motors stopped. He shouted feebly, running up and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44500">
     down with his eyes turned skyward, and several times nearly fell into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44510">
     the fire. He wondered why it didn't appear. It seemed hours since the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44520">
     motors stopped! Then unexpectedly against the black background of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44530">
     sky the great wings of the machine appeared, illuminated on their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44540">
     underside by the light of the fire. Silently it swung around on its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44550">
     descending spiral, instantly to be swallowed up in the darkness again, a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44560">
     moment later reappearing from the opposite direction, this time low down
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44570">
     and headed straight for him. He jumped hastily to one side and fell
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44580">
     flat. The machine grounded, rose once or twice as it ran along the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44590">
     ground, and came to a stop twenty yards from the fire. A man climbed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44600">
     out, slowly removed his goggles, and shook himself. Bennie scrambled to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44610">
     his feet and ran forward waving his hat.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44630">
     "Well, Hooker!" remarked the man. "What th' hell are you doing _here_?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44640">
     You sure have some searchlight!"

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44680">
     How Hooker and Burke, under the guidance of Atterbury, who gradually
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44690">
     regained his normal mental status, explored and charted the valley of

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44700">
     the Ring is strictly no part of this tale which deals solely with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44710">
     end of War upon the Earth. But next day, after several hours of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44720">
     excavation among the débris of the smelter, where Pax had extracted his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44730">
     uranium from the pitch blend mined at the cliff, they uncovered eight
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44740">
     cylinders of the precious metal weighing about one hundred pounds
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44750">
     apiece--the fuel of the Flying Ring. Now they were safe. Nay, more:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44760">
     universal space was theirs to traffic in.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44780">
     Curious as to the reason why Pax had isolated himself in this frozen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44790">
     wilderness, they next examined the high cliffs which shut in the valley
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44800">
     on the west and against the almost perpendicular walls of which he had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44810">
     played the Lavender Ray. These cliffs proved, as Bennie had already
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44820">
     suspected, to be a gigantic outcrop of pitchblende or black oxide of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44830">
     uranium. He estimated that nature had stored more uranium in but one of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44840">
     the abutments of this cliff than in all the known mines of the entire
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44850">
     world. This radioactive mountain was the fulcrum by which this modern

     Archimedes had moved the earth. The vast amount of matter disintegrated

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44870">
     by the Ray and thrown off into space with a velocity a thousandfold
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44880">
     greater than the blast of a siege gun produced a back pressure or recoil
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44890">
     against the face of the cliff, which thus became the "thrust block" of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44900">
     the force which had slowed down the period of the earth's rotation.

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44940">
     The day of the start dawned with a blazing sun. From the landing stage
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44950">
     of the Ring Bennie could see stretching away to the east, west, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44960">
     south, the interminable plains, dotted with firs, which had formed the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44970">
     natural barrier to the previous discovery of Pax's secret. Overhead the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44980">
     dome of the sky fitted the horizon like an enormous shell--a shell
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_44990">
     which, with a thrill, he realized that he could crack and escape from,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45000">
     like a fledgling ready for its first flight. And yet in this moment of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45010">
     triumph little Bennie Hooker felt the qualm which must inevitably come
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45020">
     to those who take their lives in their hands. An hour and he would be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45030">
     either soaring Phoebus-like toward the south, or lying crushed and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45040">
     mangled within a tangled mass of wreckage. Even here in this desolate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45050">
     waste life seemed sweet, and he had much, so much to do. Wasn't it,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45060">
     after all, a crazy thing to try to navigate the complicated mechanism
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45070">
     back to civilization? Yet something told him that unless he put his fate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45080">
     to the test now he would never return. He had the utmost confidence in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45090">
     Burke--he might never be able to secure his services again--no, it was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45100">
     now or never. He entered the air-lock, closing and bolting the door, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45110">
     passed on into the chart room.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45130">
     At all events, he thought, they were no worse off than Pax when he had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45140">
     made his first trial flight, and they were working with a proven
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45150">
     machine, tuned to its fullest efficiency, and one which apparently
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45160">
     possessed automatic stability. Atterbury had gone to the condenser room
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45170">
     and was waiting for the order to start, while Burke was making the final
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45180">
     adjustment of the gyroscopes which would put the Ring on its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45190">
     predetermined course. He came through the door and joined Bennie.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45210">
     "Hooker," he said, "we're sure going to have some experience. If I can
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45220">
     keep her from turning over, I think I can manage her. The trouble will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45230">
     come when we slant the tractor. I'm not sure how much depends on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45240">
     atmospheric valve, and how much on me. Things may happen quickly. If we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45250">
     turn over we're done for."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45270">
     He held out his hand to Bennie, who gripped it tremulously.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45290">
     "Well," remarked the aviator, tossing away his cigarette, "we might as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45300">
     well die now as any time!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45320">
     He walked swiftly over to the speaking-tube which communicated with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45330">
     condenser room and blew sharply into it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45350">
     "Let her go, _Gallagher_!" he directed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45370">
     "My God!" ejaculated Bennie. "Wait a second, can't you?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45390">
     But it was too late. He grabbed the rail, trembling. A humming sound
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45400">
     filled the air, and the gyroscopes slowly began to revolve. He looked up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45410">
     through the window at the tractor, from which shot streaks of pale
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45420">
     vapour with a noise like escaping steam. Somehow it seemed alive.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45440">
     The Ring was throbbing as if it, too, was impregnated with life. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45450">
     discharge of the tractor had risen to a muffled roar. Shaking all over,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45460">
     Bennie crossed to the inside window and looked across the inner space of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45470">
     the Ring. As yet the yellow glow of the discharge was scarcely visible,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45480">
     but the steel sides of the Ring danced and quivered, undulating in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45490">
     waves, and, as the intensity of the blast increased and the turbine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45500">
     commenced to revolve, everything outside went suddenly blurred and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45510">
     indistinct.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45530">
     Dropping to his knees, Bennie looked down through the observation window
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45540">
     in the floor. A blinding cloud of yellow dust was driving out and away
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45550">
     from the base of the landing stage in the form of a gigantic ring. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45560">
     earth at their feet was hidden in whirls of vapour; and ripples of light
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45570">
     and shade chased each other outward in all directions, like shadows on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45580">
     the bottom of a sandy pond rippled by a breeze. It made him dizzy to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45590">
     look down there, and he arose from the window. Burke stood grimly at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45600">
     control, unmindful of his associate. Bennie crossed to the other side,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45610">
     and as he passed the gyroscopes, the air from the swiftly spinning discs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45620">
     blew back his hair. He could see nothing through the tumult that roared
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45630">
     down through the centre of the Ring, like a Niagara of hot steam shot
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45640">
     through with a pale yellow phosphorescent light. The floor quivered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45650">
     under his feet, and ominous creaking and snapping sounds reverberated
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45660">
     through the outer shell, as the steel girders of the landing stage were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45670">
     gradually relieved of its weight. Just as it seemed to him that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45680">
     everything was going to pieces, suddenly there was silence, save for the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45690">
     purr of the machinery, and Bennie felt his knees sink under him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45710">
     "We're off!" cried Burke. "Watch out!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45730">
     The floor swayed as the Ring, lifted by the tractor, swung to and fro
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45740">
     like a pendulum. Bennie threw himself upon his stomach. The earth was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45750">
     dropping away from them like a stone. He felt a sickening sensation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45770">
     "Two thousand feet already," gasped Burke. "The atmospheric valve is set
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45780">
     for five thousand. I'll make it ten! It will give us more room to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45790">
     recover in--if anything--goes wrong!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45810">
     He gave the knob another half turn and laid his hand lightly on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45820">
     lever which controlled the movements of the tractor. Bennie, flattened
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45830">
     against the window, gazed below. The great dust ring showed indistinctly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45840">
     through a blue haze no longer directly beneath them, but a quarter of a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45850">
     mile to the north. Evidently they were not rising vertically.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45870">
     The valley of the Ring looked like a black crack in a greenish-gray
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45880">
     desert of rock and moss, the landing stage like a tiny bird's nest. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45890">
     floor of the car moved slightly from side to side. Burke's face had gone
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45900">
     gray, and he crouched unsteadily, one hand gripping a steel bracket on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45910">
     the wall.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45930">
     "My Lord!" he mumbled with dry lips. "My Lord!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45950">
     Bennie, momentarily expecting annihilation, crawled on all fours to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45960">
     Burke's side.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45980">
     The needle of the manometer indicated nine thousand five hundred feet,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_45990">
     and was rapidly nearing the next division. Suddenly Burke felt the lever
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46000">
     move slowly under his hand as though operated by some outside
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46010">
     intelligence, and at the same moment the axis of one gyroscope swung
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46020">
     slowly in a horizontal plane through an angle of nearly ninety degrees,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46030">
     while that of the other dipped slightly from the vertical. Both men had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46040">
     a ghastly feeling that the ghost of Pax had somehow returned and assumed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46050">
     control of the car. Bennie rotated the map under the gyroscope until the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46060">
     fine black line on the dial again lay across their destination. Then he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46070">
     crept back to his window again. The earth, far below and dimly visible,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46080">
     was sliding slowly northward, and the dust ring which marked their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46090">
     starting-point now lay as a flattened ellipse on the distant horizon.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46100">
     Beneath and behind them in their flight trailed a thin streak of pale
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46110">
     bluish fog--the wake of the Flying Ring.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46130">
     They were now searing the atmosphere at a height of nearly two miles,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46140">
     and the car was flying on a firm and even keel. There was no sound save
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46150">
     the dull roar of the tractor and a slight humming from the vibration of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46160">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46180">
     a mighty river appeared to the south--the Moisie--and they followed it

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46190">
     as a fishhawk might have done, until the wilderness broke away before

     And then he lost control of himself for the first time and sobbed like a

     EPILOGUE
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46400">
     Meanwhile, during the weeks that Hooker had been engaged in finding the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46410">
     valley of the Ring, unbelievable things had happened in world politics.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46420">
     In spite of the fact that Pax, having decreed the shifting of the Pole
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46430">
     and the transformation of Central Europe into the Arctic zone, had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46440">
     refused further communication with mankind, all the nations--and none
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46450">
     more zealously than the German Republic--had proceeded immediately to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46460">
     withdraw their armies within their own borders, and under the personal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46470">
     supervision of a General Commission to destroy all their armaments and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46480">
     munitions of war. The lyddite bombs, manufactured in vast quantities by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46490">
     the Krupps for the Relay Gun and all other high explosives, were used to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46500">
     demolish the fortresses upon every frontier of Europe. The contents of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46510">
     every arsenal was loaded upon barges and sunk in mid-Atlantic. And every
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46520">
     form of military organization, rank, service, and even uniform, was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46530">
     abolished throughout the world.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46550">
     A coalition of nations was formed under a single general government,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46560">
     known as the United States of Europe, which in coöperation with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46570">
     United States of North and South America, of Asia, and of Africa,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46580">
     arranged for an annual world congress at The Hague, and which enforced
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46590">
     its decrees by means of an International Police. In effect all the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46600">
     inhabitants of the globe came under a single control, as far as language
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46610">
     and geographical boundaries would permit. Each state enforced local
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46620">
     laws, but all were obedient to the higher law--the Law of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46630">
     Humanity--which was uniform through the earth. If an individual offended
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46640">
     against the law of one nation, he was held to have offended against all,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46650">
     and was dealt with as such. The international police needed no treaties
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46660">
     of extradition. The New York embezzler who fled to Nairobi was sent back
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46670">
     as a matter of course without delay.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46690">
     Any man was free to go and live where he chose, to manufacture, buy, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46700">
     sell as he saw fit. And, because the fear and shadow of war were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46710">
     removed, the nations grew rich beyond the imagination of men; great
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46720">
     hospitals and research laboratories, universities, schools, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46730">
     kindergartens, opera houses, theatres, and gardens of every sort sprang
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46740">
     up everywhere, paid for no one quite knew how. The nations ceased to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46750">
     build dreadnoughts, and instead used the money to send great troops of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46760">
     children with the teachers travelling over the world. It was against the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46770">
     law to own or manufacture any weapon that could be used to take human
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46780">
     life. And because the nations had nothing to fear from one another, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46790">
     because there were no scheming diplomatists and bureaucrats to make a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46800">
     living out of imaginary antagonisms, people forgot that they were French
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46810">
     or German or Russian or English, just as the people of the United States
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46820">
     of America had long before practically disregarded the fact that they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46830">
     came from Ohio or Oregon or Connecticut or Nevada. Russians with weak
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46840">
     throats went to live in Italy as a matter of course, and Spaniards who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46850">
     liked German cooking settled in Münich.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46870">
     All this, of course, did not happen at once, but came about quite
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46880">
     naturally after the abolition of war. And after it had been done,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46890">
     everybody wondered why it had not been done ten centuries before; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46900">
     people became so interested in destroying all the relics of that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46910">
     despicable employment, warfare, that they almost forgot that the Man Who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46920">
     Rocked the Earth had threatened that he would shift the axis of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46930">
     globe. So that when the day fixed by him came and everything remained
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46940">
     just as it always had been--and everybody still wore linen-mesh
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46950">
     underwear in Strassburg and flannels in Archangel--nobody thought very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46960">
     much about it, or commented on the fact that the Flying Ring was no

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46970">
     longer to be seen. And the only real difference was that you could take

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_46980">
     a P. &amp; O. steamer at Marseilles and buy a through ticket to Tasili

     Ahaggar--if you wanted to go there--and that the shores of the Sahara
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_47000">
     became the Riviera of the world, crowded with health resorts and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000024_47010">
