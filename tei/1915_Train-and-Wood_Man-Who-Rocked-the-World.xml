    The Man Who Rocked the Earth
   </p>
   <p>
    PROLOGUE
   </p>
   <p>
    By July 1, 1916, the war had involved every civilized nation upon the
   </p>
   <p>
    globe except the United States of North and of South America, which had
   </p>
   <p>
    up to that time succeeded in maintaining their neutrality. Belgium,
   </p>
   <p>
    Holland, Denmark, Switzerland, Poland, Austria Hungary, Lombardy, and
   </p>
   <p>
    Servia, had been devastated. Five million adult male human beings had
   </p>
   <p>
    been exterminated by the machines of war, by disease, and by famine. Ten
   </p>
   <p>
    million had been crippled or invalided. Fifteen million women and
   </p>
   <p>
    children had been rendered widows or orphans. Industry there was none.
   </p>
   <p>
    No crops were harvested or sown. The ocean was devoid of sails.
   </p>
   <p>
    Throughout European Christendom women had taken the place of men as
   </p>
   <p>
    field hands, labourers, mechanics, merchants, and manufacturers. The
   </p>
   <p>
    amalgamated debt of the involved nations, amounting to more than
   </p>
   <p>
    $100,000,000,000, had bankrupted the world. Yet the starving armies
   </p>
   <p>
    continued to slaughter one another.
   </p>
   <p>
    Siberia was a vast charnel-house of Tartars, Chinese, and Russians.
   </p>
   <p>
    Northern Africa was a holocaust. Within sixty miles of Paris lay an army
   </p>
   <p>
    of two million Germans, while three million Russians had invested
   </p>
   <p>
    Berlin. In Belgium an English army of eight hundred and fifty thousand
   </p>
   <p>
    men faced an equal force of Prussians and Austrians, neither daring to
   </p>
   <p>
    take the offensive.
   </p>
   <p>
    The inventive genius of mankind, stimulated by the exigencies of war,
   </p>
   <p>
    had produced a multitude of death-dealing mechanisms, most of which had
   </p>
   <p>
    in turn been rendered ineffective by some counter-invention of another
   </p>
   <p>
    nation. Three of these products of the human brain, however, remained
   </p>
   <p>
    unneutralized and in large part accounted for the impasse at which the
   </p>
   <p>
    hostile armies found themselves. One of these had revolutionized warfare
   </p>
   <p>
    in the field, and the other two had destroyed those two most important
   </p>
   <p>
    factors of the preliminary campaign--the aeroplane and the submarine.
   </p>
   <p>
    The German dirigibles had all been annihilated within the first ten
   </p>
   <p>
    months of the war in their great cross-channel raid by Pathé contact
   </p>
   <p>
    bombs trailed at the ends of wires by high-flying French planes. This,
   </p>
   <p>
    of course, had from the beginning been confidently predicted by the
   </p>
   <p>
    French War Department. But by November, 1915, both the allied and the
   </p>
   <p>
    German aerial fleets had been wiped from the clouds by Federston's
   </p>
   <p>
    vortex guns, which by projecting a whirling ring of air to a height of
   </p>
   <p>
    over five thousand feet crumpled the craft in mid-sky like so many
   </p>
   <p>
    butterflies in a simoon.
   </p>
   <p>
    The second of these momentous inventions was Captain Barlow's device for
   </p>
   <p>
    destroying the periscopes of submarines, thus rendering them blind and
   </p>
   <p>
    helpless. Once they were forced to the surface such craft were easily
   </p>
   <p>
    destroyed by gun fire or driven to a sullen refuge in protecting
   </p>
   <p>
    harbours.
   </p>
   <p>
    The third, and perhaps the most vital, invention was Dufay's
   </p>
   <p>
    nitrogen-iodide pellets, which when sown by pneumatic guns upon the
   </p>
   <p>
    slopes of a battlefield, the ground outside intrenchments, or round the
   </p>
   <p>
    glacis of a fortification made approach by an attacking army impossible
   </p>
   <p>
    and the position impregnable. These pellets, only the size of No. 4 bird
   </p>
   <p>
    shot and harmless out of contact with air, became highly explosive two
   </p>
   <p>
    minutes after they had been scattered broadcast upon the soil, and any
   </p>
   <p>
    friction would discharge them with sufficient force to fracture or
   </p>
   <p>
    dislocate the bones of the human foot or to put out of service the leg
   </p>
   <p>
    of a horse. The victim attempting to drag himself away inevitably
   </p>
   <p>
    sustained further and more serious injuries, and no aid could be given
   </p>
   <p>
    to the injured, as it was impossible to reach them. A field well planted
   </p>
   <p>
    with such pellets was an impassable barrier to either infantry or
   </p>
   <p>
    cavalry, and thus any attack upon a fortified position was doomed to
   </p>
   <p>
    failure. By surprise alone could a general expect to achieve a victory.
   </p>
   <p>
    Offensive warfare had come almost to a standstill.
   </p>
   <p>
    Germany had seized Holland, Denmark, and Switzerland. Italy had annexed
   </p>
   <p>
    Dalmatia and the Trentino; and a new Slav republic had arisen out of
   </p>
   <p>
    what had been Hungary, Croatia, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Servia, Roumania,
   </p>
   <p>
    Montenegro, Albania, and Bulgaria. Turkey had vanished from the map of
   </p>
   <p>
    Europe; while the United States of South America, composed of the
   </p>
   <p>
    Spanish-speaking South American Republics, had been formed. The
   </p>
   <p>
    mortality continued at an average of two thousand a day, of which 75 per
   </p>
   <p>
    cent. was due to starvation and the plague. Maritime commerce had ceased
   </p>
   <p>
    entirely, and in consequence of this the merchant ships of all nations
   </p>
   <p>
    rotted at the docks.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Emperor of Germany, and the kings of England and of Italy, had all
   </p>
   <p>
    voluntarily abdicated in favour of a republican form of government.
   </p>
   <p>
    Europe and Asia had run amuck, hysterical with fear and blood. As well
   </p>
   <p>
    try to pacify a pack of mad and fighting dogs as these frenzied myriads
   </p>
   <p>
    with their half-crazed generals. They lay, these armies, across the fair
   </p>
   <p>
    bosom of the earth like dying monsters, crimson in their own blood, yet
   </p>
   <p>
    still able to writhe upward and deal death to any other that might
   </p>
   <p>
    approach. They were at a deadlock, yet each feared to make the first
   </p>
   <p>
    overtures for peace. There was, in actuality, no longer even an English
   </p>
   <p>
    or a German nation. It was an orgy of homicide, in which the best of
   </p>
   <p>
    mankind were wantonly destroyed, leaving only the puny, the
   </p>
   <p>
    feeble-minded, the deformed, and the ineffectual to perpetuate the race.
   </p>
   <p>
    I
   </p>
   <p>
    It was three minutes past three postmeridian in the operating room of
   </p>
   <p>
    the new Wireless Station recently installed at the United States Naval
   </p>
   <p>
    Observatory at Georgetown. Bill Hood, the afternoon operator, was
   </p>
   <p>
    sitting in his shirt sleeves with his receivers at his ears, smoking a
   </p>
   <p>
    corncob pipe and awaiting a call from the flagship _Lincoln_ of the
   </p>
   <p>
    North Atlantic Patrol with which, somewhere just off Hatteras, he had
   </p>
   <p>
    been in communication a few moments before. The air was quiet.
   </p>
   <p>
    Hood was a fat man, and so of course good-natured; but he was serious
   </p>
   <p>
    about his work and hated all interfering amateurs. Of late these
   </p>
   <p>
    wireless pests had become particularly obnoxious, as practically
   </p>
   <p>
    everything was sent out in code and they had nothing with which to
   </p>
   <p>
    occupy themselves. But it was a hot day and none of them seemed to be at
   </p>
   <p>
    work. On one side of his desk a tall thermometer indicated that the
   </p>
   <p>
    temperature of the room was 91 degrees Fahrenheit; on the other a big
   </p>
   <p>
    clock, connected with some extraneous mechanism by a complicated system
   </p>
   <p>
    of brass rods and wires, ticked off the minutes and seconds with a
   </p>
   <p>
    peculiar metallic self-consciousness, as if aware of its own importance
   </p>
   <p>
    in being the official timepiece, as far as there was an official
   </p>
   <p>
    timepiece, for the entire United States of America.
   </p>
   <p>
    Hood from time to time tested his converters and detector, and then
   </p>
   <p>
    resumed his non-official study of the adventures of a great detective
   </p>
   <p>
    who pursued the baffling criminal by the aid of all the latest
   </p>
   <p>
    scientific discoveries. Hood thought it was good stuff, although at the
   </p>
   <p>
    same time he knew, of course, that it was rot. He was a practical man of
   </p>
   <p>
    little imagination, and, though the detective did not interest him
   </p>
   <p>
    particularly, he liked the scientific part of the stories. He was
   </p>
   <p>
    thrifty, of Scotch-Irish descent, and at two minutes past three had
   </p>
   <p>
    never had an adventure in his life. At three minutes past three he began
   </p>
   <p>
    his career as one of the celebrities of the world.
   </p>
   <p>
    As the minute hand of the official clock dropped into its slot somebody
   </p>
   <p>
    called the Naval Observatory. The call was so faint as to be barely
   </p>
   <p>
    audible, in spite of the fact that Hood's instrument was tuned for a
   </p>
   <p>
    three-thousand-metre wave. Supposing quite naturally that the person
   </p>
   <p>
    calling had a shorter wave, he gradually cut out the inductance of his
   </p>
   <p>
    receiver; but the sound faded out entirely, and he returned to his
   </p>
   <p>
    original inductance and shunted in his condenser, upon which the call
   </p>
   <p>
    immediately increased in volume. Evidently the other chap was using a
   </p>
   <p>
    big wave, bigger than Georgetown.
   </p>
   <p>
    Hood puckered his brows and looked about him. Lying on a shelf above his
   </p>
   <p>
    instrument was one of the new ballast coils that Henderson had used with
   </p>
   <p>
    the long waves from lightning flashes, and he leaned over and connected
   </p>
   <p>
    the heavy spiral of closely wound wire, throwing it into his circuit.
   </p>
   <p>
    Instantly the telephones spoke so loud that he could hear the shrill cry
   </p>
   <p>
    of the spark even from where the receivers lay beside him on the table.
   </p>
   <p>
    Quickly fastening them to his ears he listened. The sound was clear,
   </p>
   <p>
    sharp, and metallic, and vastly higher in pitch than a ship's call. It
   </p>
   <p>
    couldn't be the _Lincoln_.
   </p>
   <p>
    "By gum!" muttered Hood. "That fellow must have a twelve-thousand-metre
   </p>
   <p>
    wave length with fifty kilowatts behind it, sure! There ain't another
   </p>
   <p>
    station in the world but this can pick him up!"
   </p>
   <p>
    "NAA--NAA--NAA," came the call.
   </p>
   <p>
    Throwing in his rheostat he sent an "O.K" in reply, and waited
   </p>
   <p>
    expectantly, pencil in hand. A moment more and he dropped his pencil in
   </p>
   <p>
    disgust.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Just another bug!" he remarked aloud to the thermometer. "Ought to be
   </p>
   <p>
    poisoned! What a whale of a wave length, though!"
   </p>
   <p>
    For several minutes he listened intently, for the amateur was sending
   </p>
   <p>
    insistently, repeating everything twice as if he meant business.
   </p>
   <p>
    "He's a jolly joker all right," muttered Hood, this time to the clock.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Must be pretty hard up for something to do!"
   </p>
   <p>
    Then he laughed out loud and took up the pencil again. This amateur,
   </p>
   <p>
    whoever he was, was almost as good as his detective story. The "bug"
   </p>
   <p>
    called the Naval Observatory once more and began repeating his entire
   </p>
   <p>
    message for the third time.
   </p>
   <p>
    "To all mankind"--he addressed himself modestly--"To all mankind--To all
   </p>
   <p>
    mankind--I am the dictator--of human destiny--Through the earth's
   </p>
   <p>
    rotation--I control--day and night--summer and winter--I command
   </p>
   <p>
    the--cessation of hostilities and--the abolition of war upon the
   </p>
   <p>
    globe--I appoint the--United States--as my agent for this purpose--As
   </p>
   <p>
    evidence of my power I shall increase the length of the day--from
   </p>
   <p>
    midnight to midnight--of Thursday, July 22d, by the period of five
   </p>
   <p>
    minutes.--PAX."
   </p>
   <p>
    The jolly joker, having repeated thus his extraordinary message to all
   </p>
   <p>
    mankind, stopped sending.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Well, I'll be hanged!" gasped Bill Hood. Then he wound up his magnetic
   </p>
   <p>
    detector and sent an answering challenge into the ether.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Can--the--funny--stuff!" he snapped. "And tune out--or--we'll
   </p>
   <p>
    revoke--your license!"
   </p>
   <p>
    "What a gall!" he grunted, folding up the yellow sheet of pad paper upon
   </p>
   <p>
    which he had taken down the message to all mankind and thrusting it into
   </p>
   <p>
    his book for a marker. "All the fools aren't dead yet!"
   </p>
   <p>
    Then he picked up the _Lincoln_ and got down to real work. The "bug" and
   </p>
   <p>
    his message passed from memory.
   </p>
   <p>
    II
   </p>
   <p>
    The following Thursday afternoon a perspiring and dusty stranger from
   </p>
   <p>
    St. Louis, who, with the Metropolitan Art Museum as his objective, was
   </p>
   <p>
    trudging wearily through Central Park, New York City, at two o'clock,
   </p>
   <p>
    paused to gaze with some interest at the obelisk known as Cleopatra's
   </p>
   <p>
    Needle. The heat rose in shimmering waves from the asphalt of the
   </p>
   <p>
    roadway, but the stranger was used to heat and he was conscientiously
   </p>
   <p>
    engaged in the duty of seeing New York. Opposite the Museum he seated
   </p>
   <p>
    himself upon a bench in the shade of a faded dogwood and wiped the
   </p>
   <p>
    moisture from his eyes. The glare from the unprotected boulevards was
   </p>
   <p>
    terrific. Under these somewhat unfavourable conditions he was occupied
   </p>
   <p>
    in studying the monument of Egypt's past magnificence when he felt a
   </p>
   <p>
    slight dragging sensation. It was indefinable and had no visual
   </p>
   <p>
    concomitant. But it was as though the brakes were being gently applied
   </p>
   <p>
    to a Pullman train. He was the only human being in the neighbourhood;
   </p>
   <p>
    not even a policeman was visible; and the experience gave him a creepy
   </p>
   <p>
    feeling. Then to his amazement Cleopatra's Needle slowly toppled from
   </p>
   <p>
    its pedestal and fell with a crash across the roadway. At first he
   </p>
   <p>
    thought it an optical illusion and wiped his eyes again, but it was
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing of the kind. The monument, which had a moment before pointed to
   </p>
   <p>
    the zenith, now lay shattered in three pieces upon the softening
   </p>
   <p>
    concrete of the drive. The stranger arose and examined the fragments of
   </p>
   <p>
    the monolith, one of which lay squarely across the road, barring all
   </p>
   <p>
    passage. Round the pedestal were scattered small pieces of broken
   </p>
   <p>
    granite, and from these, after looking about cautiously, he chose one
   </p>
   <p>
    with care and placed it in his pocket.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Gosh!" he whispered to himself as he hurried toward Fifth Avenue.
   </p>
   <p>
    "That'll just be something to tell 'em at home! Eh, Bill?"
   </p>
   <p>
    The dragging sensation experienced by the tourist from St. Louis was
   </p>
   <p>
    felt by many millions of people all over the world, but, as in most
   </p>
   <p>
    countries it occurred coincidently with pronounced earthquake shocks and
   </p>
   <p>
    tremblings, for the most part it passed unnoticed as a specific,
   </p>
   <p>
    individual phenomenon.
   </p>
   <p>
    Hood, in the wireless room at Georgetown, suddenly heard in his
   </p>
   <p>
    receivers a roar like that of Niagara and quickly removed them from his
   </p>
   <p>
    ears. He had never known such statics. He was familiar with electrical
   </p>
   <p>
    disturbances in the ether, but this was beyond anything in his
   </p>
   <p>
    experience. Moreover, when he next tried to use his instruments he
   </p>
   <p>
    discovered that something had put the whole apparatus out of commission.
   </p>
   <p>
    About an hour later he felt a pronounced pressure in his eardrums, which
   </p>
   <p>
    gradually passed off. The wireless refused to work for nearly eight
   </p>
   <p>
    hours, and it was still recalcitrant when he went off duty at seven
   </p>
   <p>
    o'clock. He had not felt the quivering of the earth round Washington,
   </p>
   <p>
    and being an unimaginative man he accepted the other facts of the
   </p>
   <p>
    situation philosophically. The statics would pass, and then Georgetown
   </p>
   <p>
    would be in communication with the rest of the world again, that was
   </p>
   <p>
    all. At seven o'clock the night shift came in, and Hood borrowed a
   </p>
   <p>
    pipeful of tobacco from him and put on his coat.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Say, Bill, did you feel the shock?" asked the shift, hanging up his hat
   </p>
   <p>
    and taking a match from Hood.
   </p>
   <p>
    "No," answered the latter, "but the statics have put the machine on the
   </p>
   <p>
    blink. She'll come round all right in an hour or so. The air's gummy
   </p>
   <p>
    with ions. Shock, did you say?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Sure. Had 'em all over the country. Say, the boys at the magnetic
   </p>
   <p>
    observatory claim their compass shifted east and west instead of north
   </p>
   <p>
    and south, and stayed that way for five minutes. Didn't you feel the air
   </p>
   <p>
    pressure? I should worry! And say, I just dropped into the
   </p>
   <p>
    Meteorological Department's office and looked at the barometer. She'd
   </p>
   <p>
    jumped up half an inch in about two seconds, wiggled round some, and
   </p>
   <p>
    then come back to normal. You can see the curve yourself if you ask
   </p>
   <p>
    Fraser to show you the self-registering barograph. Some doin's, I tell
   </p>
   <p>
    you!"
   </p>
   <p>
    He nodded his head with an air of importance.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Take your word for it," answered Hood without emotion, save for a
   </p>
   <p>
    slight annoyance at the other's arrogation of superior information.
   </p>
   <p>
    "'Tain't the first time there's been an earthquake since creation." And
   </p>
   <p>
    he strolled out, swinging to the doors behind him.
   </p>
   <p>
    The night shift settled himself before the instruments with a look of
   </p>
   <p>
    dreary resignation.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Say," he muttered aloud, "you couldn't jar that feller with a
   </p>
   <p>
    thirteen-inch bomb! He wouldn't even rub himself!"
   </p>
   <p>
    Hood, meantime, bought an evening paper and walked slowly to the
   </p>
   <p>
    district where he lived. It was a fine night and there was no particular
   </p>
   <p>
    excitement in the streets. His wife opened the door.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Well," she greeted him, "I'm glad you've come home at last. I was plumb
   </p>
   <p>
    scared something had happened to you. Such a shaking and rumbling and
   </p>
   <p>
    rattling I never did hear! Did you feel it?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "I didn't feel nothin'!" answered Bill Hood. "Some one said there was a
   </p>
   <p>
    shock, that was all I heard about it. The machine's out of kilter."
   </p>
   <p>
    "They won't blame you, will they?" she asked anxiously.
   </p>
   <p>
    "You bet they won't!" he replied. "Look here, I'm hungry. Are the
   </p>
   <p>
    waffles ready?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Have 'em in a jiffy!" she smiled. "You go in and read your paper."
   </p>
   <p>
    He did as he was directed, and seated himself in a rocker under the
   </p>
   <p>
    gaslight. After perusing the baseball news he turned back to the front
   </p>
   <p>
    page. The paper was a fairly late edition, containing up-to-the-minute
   </p>
   <p>
    telegraphic notes. In the centre column, alongside the announcement of
   </p>
   <p>
    the annihilation of three entire regiments of Silesians by the explosion
   </p>
   <p>
    of nitroglycerine concealed in dummy gun carriages, was the following:
   </p>
   <p>
    CLEOPATRA'S NEEDLE FALLS
   </p>
   <p>
    EARTHQUAKE DESTROYS FAMOUS MONUMENT
   </p>
   <p>
    SHOCKS FELT HERE AND ALL OVER U. S.
   </p>
   <p>
    Washington was visited by a succession of earthquake shocks early
   </p>
   <p>
    this afternoon, which, in varying force, were felt throughout the
   </p>
   <p>
    United States and Europe. Little damage was done, but those having
   </p>
   <p>
    offices in tall buildings had an unpleasant experience which they
   </p>
   <p>
    will not soon forget. A peculiar phenomenon accompanying this
   </p>
   <p>
    seismic disturbance was the variation of the magnetic needle by over
   </p>
   <p>
    eighty degrees from north to east and an extraordinary rise and fall
   </p>
   <p>
    of the barometer. All wireless communication had to be abandoned,
   </p>
   <p>
    owing to the ionizing of the atmosphere, and up to the time this
   </p>
   <p>
    edition went to press had not been resumed. Telegrams by way of
   </p>
   <p>
    Colon report similar disturbances in South America. In New York the
   </p>
   <p>
    monument in Central Park known as Cleopatra's Needle was thrown from
   </p>
   <p>
    its pedestal and broken into three pieces. The contract for its
   </p>
   <p>
    repair and replacement has already been let. The famous monument was
   </p>
   <p>
    a present from the Khedive of Egypt to the United States, and
   </p>
   <p>
    formerly stood in Alexandria. The late William H. Vanderbilt
   </p>
   <p>
    defrayed the expense of transporting it to this country.
   </p>
   <p>
    Bill Hood read this with scant interest. The Giants had knocked the
   </p>
   <p>
    Braves' pitcher out of the box, and an earthquake seemed a small matter.
   </p>
   <p>
    His mind did not once revert to the mysterious message from Pax the day
   </p>
   <p>
    before. He was thinking of something far more important.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Say, Nellie," he demanded, tossing aside the paper impatiently, "ain't
   </p>
   <p>
    those waffles ready yet?"
   </p>
   <p>
    III
   </p>
   <p>
    On that same evening, Thursday, July 22d, two astronomers attached to
   </p>
   <p>
    the Naval Observatory sat in the half darkness of the meridian-circle
   </p>
   <p>
    room watching the firmament sweep slowly across the aperture of the
   </p>
   <p>
    giant lens. The chamber was as quiet as the grave, the two men rarely
   </p>
   <p>
    speaking as they noted their observations. Paris might be taken, Berlin
   </p>
   <p>
    be razed, London put to the torch; a million human beings might be blown
   </p>
   <p>
    into eternity, or the shrieks of mangled creatures lying in heaps before
   </p>
   <p>
    pellet-strewn barbed-wire entanglements rend the summer night; great
   </p>
   <p>
    battleships of the line might plunge to the bottom, carrying their crews
   </p>
   <p>
    with them; and the dead of two continents rot unburied--yet unmoved the
   </p>
   <p>
    stars would pursue their nightly march across the heavens, cruel day
   </p>
   <p>
    would follow pitiless night, and the careless earth follow its
   </p>
   <p>
    accustomed orbit as though the race were not writhing in its death
   </p>
   <p>
    agony. Gazing into the infinity of space human existence seemed but the
   </p>
   <p>
    scum upon a rainpool, human warfare but the frenzy of insectivora.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unmindful of the starving hordes of Paris and Berlin, of plague-swept
   </p>
   <p>
    Russia, or of the drowned thousands of the North Baltic Fleet, these two
   </p>
   <p>
    men calmly studied the procession of the stars--the onward bore of the
   </p>
   <p>
    universe through space, and the spectra of newborn or dying worlds.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was a suffocatingly hot night and their foreheads reeked with sweat.
   </p>
   <p>
    Dim shapes on the walls of the room indicated what by day was a tangle
   </p>
   <p>
    of clockwork and recording instruments, connected by electricity with
   </p>
   <p>
    various buttons and switches upon the table. The brother of the big
   </p>
   <p>
    clock in the wireless operating room hung nearby, its face illuminated
   </p>
   <p>
    by a tiny electric lamp, showing the hour to be eleven-fifty.
   </p>
   <p>
    Occasionally the younger man made a remark in a low tone, and the elder
   </p>
   <p>
    wrote something on a card.
   </p>
   <p>
    "The 'seeing' is poor to-night," said Evarts, the younger man. "The
   </p>
   <p>
    upper air is full of striae and, though it seems like a clear night,
   </p>
   <p>
    everything looks dim--a volcanic haze probably. Perhaps the Aleutian
   </p>
   <p>
    Islands are in eruption again."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Very likely," answered Thornton, the elder astronomer. "The shocks this
   </p>
   <p>
    afternoon would indicate something of the sort."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Curious performance of the magnetic needle. They say it held due east
   </p>
   <p>
    for several minutes," continued Evarts, hoping to engage his senior in
   </p>
   <p>
    conversation--almost an impossibility, as he well knew.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thornton did not reply. He was carefully observing the infinitesimal
   </p>
   <p>
    approach of a certain star to the meridian line, marked by a thread
   </p>
   <p>
    across the circle's aperture. When that point of light should cross the
   </p>
   <p>
    thread it would be midnight, and July 22, 1916, would be gone forever.
   </p>
   <p>
    Every midnight the indicating stars crossed the thread exactly on time,
   </p>
   <p>
    each night a trifle earlier than the night before by a definite and
   </p>
   <p>
    calculable amount, due to the march of the earth around the sun. So they
   </p>
   <p>
    had crossed the lines in every observatory since clocks and telescopes
   </p>
   <p>
    had been invented. Heretofore, no matter what cataclysm of nature had
   </p>
   <p>
    occurred, the star had always crossed the line not a second too soon or
   </p>
   <p>
    a second too late, but exactly on time. It was the one positively
   </p>
   <p>
    predictable thing, foretellable for ten or for ten thousand years by a
   </p>
   <p>
    simple mathematical calculation. It was surer than death or the tax-man.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was absolute.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thornton was a reserved man of few words--impersonal, methodical,
   </p>
   <p>
    serious. He spent many nights there with Evarts, hardly exchanging a
   </p>
   <p>
    phrase with him, and then only on some matter immediately concerned with
   </p>
   <p>
    their work. Evarts could dimly see his long, grave profile bending over
   </p>
   <p>
    his eyepiece, shrouded in the heavy shadows across the table. He felt a
   </p>
   <p>
    great respect, even tenderness, for this taciturn, high-principled,
   </p>
   <p>
    devoted scientist. He had never seen him excited, hardly ever aroused.
   </p>
   <p>
    He was a man of figures, whose only passion seemed to be the "music of
   </p>
   <p>
    the spheres."
   </p>
   <p>
    A long silence followed, during which Thornton seemed to bend more
   </p>
   <p>
    intently than ever over his eyepiece. The hand of the big clock slipped
   </p>
   <p>
    gradually to midnight.
   </p>
   <p>
    "There's something wrong with the clock," said Thornton suddenly, and
   </p>
   <p>
    his voice sounded curiously dry, almost unnatural. "Telephone to the
   </p>
   <p>
    equatorial room for the time."
   </p>
   <p>
    Puzzled by Thornton's manner Evarts did as instructed.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Forty seconds past midnight," came the reply from the equatorial
   </p>
   <p>
    observer.
   </p>
   <p>
    Evarts repeated the answer for Thornton's benefit, looking at their own
   </p>
   <p>
    clock at the same time. It pointed to exactly forty seconds past the
   </p>
   <p>
    hour. He heard Thornton suppress something like an oath.
   </p>
   <p>
    "There's something the matter!" repeated Thornton dumbly. "Aeta isn't
   </p>
   <p>
    within five minutes of crossing. Both clocks can't be wrong!"
   </p>
   <p>
    He pressed a button that connected with the wireless room.
   </p>
   <p>
    "What's the time?" he called sharply through the nickel-plated
   </p>
   <p>
    speaking-tube.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Forty-five seconds past the hour," came the answer. Then: "But I want
   </p>
   <p>
    to see you, sir. There's something queer going on. May I come in?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Come!" almost shouted Thornton.
   </p>
   <p>
    A moment later the flushed face of Williams, the night operator,
   </p>
   <p>
    appeared in the doorway.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Excuse me, sir," he stammered, "but something fierce must have
   </p>
   <p>
    happened! I thought you ought to know. The Eiffel Tower has been trying
   </p>
   <p>
    to talk to us for over two hours, but I can't get what he's saying."
   </p>
   <p>
    "What's the matter--atmospherics?" snapped Evarts.
   </p>
   <p>
    "No; the air _was_ full of them, sir--shrieking with them you might say;
   </p>
   <p>
    but they've stopped now. The trouble has been that I've been jammed by
   </p>
   <p>
    the Brussels station talking to the Belgian Congo--same wave length--and
   </p>
   <p>
    I couldn't tune Brussels out. Every once in a while I'd get a word of
   </p>
   <p>
    what Paris was saying, and it's always the same word--'_heure_.' But
   </p>
   <p>
    just now Brussels stopped sending and I got the complete message of the
   </p>
   <p>
    Eiffel Tower. They wanted to know our time by Greenwich. I gave it to
   </p>
   <p>
    'em. Then Paris said to tell you to take your transit with great care
   </p>
   <p>
    and send result to them immediately----"
   </p>
   <p>
    The ordinarily calm Thornton gave a great suspiration and his face was
   </p>
   <p>
    livid. "Aeta's just crossed--we're five minutes out! Evarts, am I crazy?
   </p>
   <p>
    Am I talking straight?"
   </p>
   <p>
    Evarts laid his hand on the other's arm.
   </p>
   <p>
    "The earthquake's knocked out your transit," he suggested.
   </p>
   <p>
    "And Paris--how about Paris?" asked Thornton. He wrote something down on
   </p>
   <p>
    a card mechanically and started for the door. "Get me the Eiffel Tower!"
   </p>
   <p>
    he ordered Williams.
   </p>
   <p>
    The three men stood motionless, as the wireless man sent the Eiffel
   </p>
   <p>
    Tower call hurtling across the Atlantic:
   </p>
   <p>
    "ETA--ETA--ETA."
   </p>
   <p>
    "All right," whispered Williams, "I've got 'em."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Tell Paris that our clocks are all out five minutes according to the
   </p>
   <p>
    meridian."
   </p>
   <p>
    Williams worked the key rapidly, and then listened.
   </p>
   <p>
    "The Eiffel Tower says that their chronometers also appear to be out by
   </p>
   <p>
    the same time, and that Greenwich and Moscow both report the same thing.
   </p>
   <p>
    Wait a minute! He says Moscow has wired that at eight o'clock last
   </p>
   <p>
    evening a tremendous aurora of bright yellow light was seen to the
   </p>
   <p>
    northwest, and that their spectroscopes showed the helium line only. He
   </p>
   <p>
    wants to know if we have any explanation to offer----"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Explanation!" gasped Evarts. "Tell Paris that we had earthquake shocks
   </p>
   <p>
    here together with violent seismic movements, sudden rise in barometer,
   </p>
   <p>
    followed by fall, statics, and erratic variation in the magnetic
   </p>
   <p>
    needle."
   </p>
   <p>
    "What does it all mean?" murmured Thornton, staring blankly at the
   </p>
   <p>
    younger man.
   </p>
   <p>
    The key rattled and the rotary spark whined into a shriek. Then silence.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Paris says that the same manifestations have been observed in Russia,
   </p>
   <p>
    Algeria, Italy, and London," called out Williams. "Ah! What's that?
   </p>
   <p>
    Nauen's calling." Again he sent the blue flame crackling between the
   </p>
   <p>
    coils. "Nauen reports an error of five minutes in their meridian
   </p>
   <p>
    observations according to the official clocks. And hello! He says Berlin
   </p>
   <p>
    has capitulated and that the Russians began marching through at
   </p>
   <p>
    daylight--that is about two hours ago. He says he is about to turn the
   </p>
   <p>
    station over to the Allied Commissioners, who will at once assume
   </p>
   <p>
    charge."
   </p>
   <p>
    Evarts whistled.
   </p>
   <p>
    "How about it?" he asked of Thornton.
   </p>
   <p>
    The latter shook his head gravely.
   </p>
   <p>
    "It may be--explainable--or," he added hoarsely, "it may mean the end of
   </p>
   <p>
    the world."
   </p>
   <p>
    Williams sprang from his chair and confronted Thornton.
   </p>
   <p>
    "What do you mean?" he almost shouted.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Perhaps the universe is running down!" said Evarts soothingly. "At any
   </p>
   <p>
    rate, keep it to yourself, old chap. If the jig is up there's no use
   </p>
   <p>
    scaring people to death a month or so too soon!"
   </p>
   <p>
    Thornton grasped an arm of each.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Not a word of this to anybody!" he ground out through compressed lips.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Absolute silence, or hell may break loose on earth!"
   </p>

    Free translation of the Official Report of the Imperial Commission of
   </p>
   <p>
    the Berlin Academy of Science to the Imperial Commissioners of the
   </p>
   <p>
    German Federated States:
   </p>
   <p>
    The unprecedented cosmic phenomena which occurred on the 22d and
   </p>
   <p>
    27th days of the month of July, and which were felt over the entire
   </p>
   <p>
    surface of the globe, have left a permanent effect of such
   </p>
   <p>
    magnitude on the position of the earth's axis in space and the
   </p>
   <p>
    duration of the period of the rotation, that it is impossible to
   </p>
   <p>
    predict at the present time the ultimate changes or modifications
   </p>
   <p>
    in the climatic conditions which may follow. This commission has
   </p>
   <p>
    considered most carefully the possible causes that may have been
   </p>
   <p>
    responsible for this catastrophe--(_Weltunfall_)--and by
   </p>
   <p>
    eliminating every hypothesis that was incapable of explaining all
   </p>
   <p>
    of the various disturbances, is now in a position to present two
   </p>
   <p>
    theories, either one of which appears to be capable of explaining
   </p>
   <p>
    the recent disturbances.
   </p>
   <p>
    The phenomena in question may be briefly summarized as follows;

     1. THE YELLOW AURORA. In Northern Europe this appeared suddenly on
    </head>
    <p>
     the night of July 22d as a broad, faint sheaf--(_Lichtbündel_)--of
    </p>
    <p>
     clear yellow light in the western sky. Reports from America show
    </p>
    <p>
     that at Washington it appeared in the north as a narrow shaft of
    </p>
    <p>
     light, inclined at an angle of about thirty degrees with the
    </p>
    <p>
     horizon, and shooting off to the east. Near the horizon it was
    </p>
    <p>
     extremely brilliant, and the spectroscope showed that the light was
    </p>
    <p>
     due to glowing helium gas.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Potsdam Observatory reported that the presence of sodium has
    </p>
    <p>
     been detected in the aurora; but this appears to have been a mistake
    </p>
    <p>
     due to the faintness of the light and the circumstance that no
    </p>
    <p>
     comparison spectrum was impressed on the plate. On the photograph
    </p>
    <p>
     made at the Washington Observatory the helium line is certain, as a
    </p>
    <p>
     second exposure was made with a sodium flame; and the two lines are
    </p>
    <p>
     shown distinctly separated.

     2. THE NEGATIVE ACCELERATION. This phenomenon was observed
    </head>
    <p>
     to a greater or less extent all over the globe. It was especially
    </p>
    <p>
     marked near the equator; but in Northern Europe it was noted by only
    </p>
    <p>
     a few observers, though many clocks were stopped and other
    </p>
    <p>
     instruments deranged. There appears to be no doubt that a force of
    </p>
    <p>
     terrific magnitude was applied in a tangential direction to the
    </p>
    <p>
     surface of the earth, in such a direction as to oppose its axial
    </p>
    <p>
     rotation, with the effect that the surface velocity was diminished
    </p>
    <p>
     by about one part in three hundred, resulting in a lengthening of
    </p>
    <p>
     the day by five minutes, thirteen and a half seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
     The application of this brake--(_Bremsekraft_), as we may term
    </p>
    <p>
     it--caused acceleration phenomena to manifest themselves precisely
    </p>
    <p>
     as on a railroad train when being brought to a stop. The change in
    </p>
    <p>
     the surface speed of the earth at the equator has amounted to about
    </p>
    <p>
     6.4 kilometres an hour; and various observations show that this
    </p>
    <p>
     change of velocity was brought about by the operation of the unknown
    </p>
    <p>
     force for a period of time of less than three minutes. The negative
    </p>
    <p>
     acceleration thus represented would certainly be too small to
    </p>
    <p>
     produce any marked physiological sensations, and yet the reports
    </p>
    <p>
     from various places indicate that they were certainly observed. The
    </p>
    <p>
     sensations felt are usually described as similar to those
    </p>
    <p>
     experienced in a moving automobile when the brake is very gently
    </p>
    <p>
     applied.
    </p>
    <p>
     Moreover, certain destructive actions are reported from localities
    </p>
    <p>
     near the equator--chimneys fell and tall buildings swayed; while
    </p>
    <p>
     from New York comes the report that the obelisk in Central Park was
    </p>
    <p>
     thrown from its pedestal. It appears that these effects were due to
    </p>
    <p>
     the circumstance that the alteration of velocity was propagated
    </p>
    <p>
     through the earth as a wave similar to an earthquake wave, and that
    </p>
    <p>
     the effects were cumulative at certain points--a theory that is
    </p>
    <p>
     substantiated by reports that at certain localities, even near the
    </p>
    <p>
     equator, no effects were noted.

     3. TIDAL WAVES. These were observed everywhere and were
    </head>
    <p>
     very destructive in many places. In the Panama Canal, which is near
    </p>
    <p>
     the equator and which runs nearly east and west, the sweep of the
    </p>
    <p>
     water was so great that it flowed over the Gatun Lock. On the
    </p>
    <p>
     eastern coasts of the various continents there was a recession of
    </p>
    <p>
     the sea, the fall of the tide being from three to five metres below
    </p>
    <p>
     the low-water mark. On the western coasts there was a corresponding
    </p>
    <p>
     rise, which in some cases reached a level of over twelve metres.
    </p>
    <p>
     That the tidal phenomena were not more marked and more destructive
    </p>
    <p>
     is a matter of great surprise, and has been considered as evidence
    </p>
    <p>
     that the retarding force was not applied at a single spot on the
    </p>
    <p>
     earth's surface, but was a distributed force, which acted on the
    </p>
    <p>
     water as well as on the land, though to a less extent. It is
    </p>
    <p>
     difficult, however, to conceive of a force capable of acting in such
    </p>
    <p>
     a way; and Björnson's theory of the magnetic vortex in the ether has
    </p>
    <p>
     been rejected by this commission.

     4. ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCES. Some time after the appearance
    </head>
    <p>
     of the yellow aurora a sudden rise in atmospheric pressure, followed
    </p>
    <p>
     by a gradual fall considerably below the normal pressure, was
    </p>
    <p>
     recorded over the entire surface of the globe. Calculations based on
    </p>
    <p>
     the time of arrival of this disturbance at widely separated points
    </p>
    <p>
     show that it proceeded with the velocity of sound from a point
    </p>
    <p>
     situated probably in Northern Labrador. The maximum rise of pressure
    </p>
    <p>
     recorded was registered at Halifax, the self-recording barographs
    </p>
    <p>
     showing that the pressure rose over six centimetres in less than
    </p>
    <p>
     five minutes.

     5. SHIFT IN DIRECTION OF THE EARTH'S AXIS. The axis of the
    </head>
    <p>
     earth has been shifted in space by the disturbance and now points
    </p>
    <p>
     almost exactly toward the double star Delta Ursæ Minoris. This
    </p>
    <p>
     change appears to have resulted from the circumstance that the force
    </p>
    <p>
     was applied to the surface of the globe in a direction not quite
    </p>
    <p>
     parallel to the direction of rotation, the result being the
    </p>
    <p>
     development of a new axis and a shift in the positions of the poles,
    </p>
    <p>
     which it will now be necessary to rediscover.
    </p>
    <p>
     It appears that these most remarkable cosmic phenomena can be
    </p>
    <p>
     explained in either of two ways: they may have resulted from an
    </p>
    <p>
     explosive or volcanic discharge from the surface of the earth, or
    </p>
    <p>
     from the oblique impact of a meteoric stream moving at a very high
    </p>
    <p>
     velocity. It seems unlikely that sufficient energy to bring about
    </p>
    <p>
     the observed changes could have been developed by a volcanic
    </p>
    <p>
     disturbance of the ordinary type; but if radioactive forces are
    </p>
    <p>
     allowed to come into play the amount of energy available is
    </p>
    <p>
     practically unlimited.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is difficult, however, to conceive of any way in which a sudden
    </p>
    <p>
     liberation of atomic energy could have been brought about by any
    </p>
    <p>
     terrestrial agency; so that the first theory, though able to account
    </p>
    <p>
     for the facts, seems to be the less tenable of the two. The meteoric
    </p>
    <p>
     theory offers no especial difficulty. The energy delivered by a
    </p>
    <p>
     comparatively small mass of finely divided matter, moving at a
    </p>
    <p>
     velocity of several hundred kilometres a second--and such a velocity
    </p>
    <p>
     is by no means unknown--would be amply sufficient to alter the
    </p>
    <p>
     velocity of rotation by the small amount observed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Moreover, the impact of such a meteoric stream may have
    </p>
    <p>
     developed a temperature sufficiently high to bring about
    </p>
    <p>
     radioactive changes, the effect of which would be to expel
    </p>
    <p>
     helium and other disintegration products at cathode-ray
    </p>
    <p>
     velocity--(_Kathoden-Strahlen-Fortpflanzung-Geschwindigkeit_)--from
    </p>
    <p>
     the surface of the earth; and the recoil exerted by this expulsion
    </p>
    <p>
     would add itself to the force of the meteoric impact.
    </p>
    <p>
     The presence of helium makes this latter hypothesis not altogether
    </p>
    <p>
     improbable, while the atmospheric wave of pressure would result at
    </p>
    <p>
     once from the disruption of the air by the passage of the meteor
    </p>
    <p>
     stream through it. Exploration of the region in which it seems
    </p>
    <p>
     probable that the disturbance took place will undoubtedly furnish
    </p>
    <p>
     the data necessary for the complete solution of the problem."

    </p>
    <p>
     At ten o'clock one evening, shortly after the occurrences heretofore
    </p>
    <p>
     described, an extraordinary conference occurred at the White House,
    </p>
    <p>
     probably the most remarkable ever held there or elsewhere. At the long
    </p>
    <p>
     table at which the cabinet meetings took place sat six gentlemen in
    </p>
    <p>
     evening dress, each trying to appear unconcerned, if not amused. At the
    </p>
    <p>
     head of the table was the President of the United States; next to him
    </p>
    <p>
     Count von Koenitz, the German Ambassador, representing the Imperial[1]
    </p>
    <p>
     German Commissioners, who had taken over the reins of the German
    </p>
    <p>
     Government after the abdication of the Kaiser; and, on the opposite
    </p>
    <p>
     side, Monsieur Emil Liban, Prince Rostoloff, and Sir John Smith, the
    </p>
    <p>
     respective ambassadors of France, Russia, and Great Britain. The sixth
    </p>
    <p>
     person was Thornton, the astronomer.
    </p>
    <p>
     [Footnote 1: The Germans were unwilling to surrender the use of the
    </p>
    <p>
     words "Empire" and "Imperial," even after they had adopted a republican
    </p>
    <p>
     form of government.]
    </p>
    <p>
     The President had only succeeded in bringing this conference about after
    </p>
    <p>
     the greatest effort and the most skilful diplomacy--in view of the
    </p>
    <p>
     extreme importance which, he assured them all, he attached to the
    </p>
    <p>
     matters which he desired to lay before them. Only for this reason had
    </p>
    <p>
     the ambassadors of warring nations consented to meet--unofficially as it
    </p>
    <p>
     were.
    </p>
    <p>
     "With great respect, your Excellency," said Count von Koenitz, "the
    </p>
    <p>
     matter is preposterous--as much so as a fairy tale by Grimm! This
    </p>
    <p>
     wireless operator of whom you speak is lying about these messages. If he
    </p>
    <p>
     received them at all--a fact which hangs solely upon his word--he
    </p>
    <p>
     received them _after_ and not _before_ the phenomena recorded."
    </p>
    <p>
     The President shook his head. "That might hold true of the first
    </p>
    <p>
     message--the one received July 19th," said he, "but the second message,
    </p>
    <p>
     foretelling the lengthening of July 27th, _was delivered on that day,
    </p>
    <p>
     and was in my hands before the disturbances occurred_."
    </p>
    <p>
     Von Koenitz fingered his moustache and shrugged his shoulders. It was
    </p>
    <p>
     clear that he regarded the whole affair as absurd, undignified.
    </p>
    <p>
     Monsieur Liban turned impatiently from him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Your Excellency," he said, addressing the President, "I cannot share
    </p>
    <p>
     the views of Count von Koenitz. I regard this affair as of the most
    </p>
    <p>
     stupendous importance. Messages or no messages, extraordinary natural
    </p>
    <p>
     phenomena are occurring which may shortly end in the extinction of human
    </p>
    <p>
     life upon the planet. A power which can control the length of the day
    </p>
    <p>
     can annihilate the globe."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You cannot change the facts," remarked Prince Rostoloff sternly to the
    </p>
    <p>
     German Ambassador. "The earth has changed its orbit. Professor
    </p>
    <p>
     Vaskofsky, of the Imperial College, has so declared. There is some
    </p>
    <p>
     cause. Be it God or devil, there is a cause. Are we to sit still and do
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing while the globe's crust freezes and our armies congeal into
    </p>
    <p>
     corpses?" He trembled with agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Calm yourself, _mon cher Prince_!" said Monsieur Liban. "So far we have
    </p>
    <p>
     gained fifteen minutes and have lost nothing! But, as you say, whether
    </p>
    <p>
     or not the sender of these messages is responsible, there is a cause,
    </p>
    <p>
     and we must find it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But how? That is the question," exclaimed the President almost
    </p>
    <p>
     apologetically, for he felt, as did Count von Koenitz, that somehow an
    </p>
    <p>
     explanation would shortly be forthcoming that would make this conference
    </p>
    <p>
     seem the height of the ridiculous. "I have already," he added hastily,
    </p>
    <p>
     "instructed the entire force of the National Academy of Sciences to
    </p>
    <p>
     direct its energies toward the solution of these phenomena. Undoubtedly
    </p>
    <p>
     Great Britain, Russia, Germany, and France are doing the same. The
    </p>
    <p>
     scientists report that the yellow aurora seen in the north, the
    </p>
    <p>
     earthquakes, the variation of the compass, and the eccentricities of the
    </p>
    <p>
     barometer are probably all connected more or less directly with the
    </p>
    <p>
     change in the earth's orbit. But they offer no explanation. They do not
    </p>
    <p>
     suggest what the aurora is nor why its appearance should have this
    </p>
    <p>
     effect. It, therefore, seems to me clearly my duty to lay before you all
    </p>
    <p>
     the facts as far as they are known to me. Among these facts are the
    </p>
    <p>
     mysterious messages received by wireless at the Naval Observatory
    </p>
    <p>
     immediately preceding these events."
    </p>
    <p>
     "_Post hoc, ergo propter hoc!_" half sneered Von Koenitz.
    </p>
    <p>
     The President smiled wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What do you wish me to do?" he asked, glancing round the table. "Shall
    </p>
    <p>
     we remain inactive? Shall we wait and see what may happen?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No! No!" shouted Rostoloff, jumping to his feet. "Another week and we
    </p>
    <p>
     may all be plunged into eternity. It is suicidal not to regard this
    </p>
    <p>
     matter seriously. We are sick from war. And perhaps Count von Koenitz,
    </p>
    <p>
     in view of the fall of Berlin, would welcome something of the sort as an
    </p>
    <p>
     honourable way out of his country's difficulties."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sir!" cried the count, leaping to his feet. "Have a care! It has cost
    </p>
    <p>
     Russia four million men to reach Berlin. When we have taken Paris we
    </p>
    <p>
     shall recapture Berlin and commence the march of our victorious eagles
    </p>
    <p>
     toward Moscow and the Winter Palace."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Be seated, I implore you!" exclaimed the
    </p>
    <p>
     President.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Russian and German ambassadors somewhat ungraciously resumed their
    </p>
    <p>
     former places, casting at each other glances of undisguised contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
     "As I see the matter," continued the President, "there are two distinct
    </p>
    <p>
     propositions before you: The first relates to how far the extraordinary
    </p>
    <p>
     events of the past week are of such a character as to demand joint
    </p>
    <p>
     investigation and action by the Powers. The second involves the cause of
    </p>
    <p>
     these events and their connection with and relation to the sender of the
    </p>
    <p>
     messages signed Pax. I shall ask you to signify your opinion as to each
    </p>
    <p>
     of these questions."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I believe that some action should be taken, based on the assumption
    </p>
    <p>
     that they are manifestations of one and the same power or cause," said
    </p>
    <p>
     Monsieur Liban emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I agree with the French Ambassador," growled Rostoloff.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I am of opinion that the phenomena should be the subject of proper
    </p>
    <p>
     scientific investigation," remarked Count von Koenitz more calmly. "But
    </p>
    <p>
     as far as these messages are concerned they are, if I may be pardoned
    </p>
    <p>
     for saying so, a foolish joke. It is undignified to take any cognizance
    </p>
    <p>
     of them."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What do you think, Sir John?" asked the President, turning to the
    </p>
    <p>
     English Ambassador.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Before making up my mind," returned the latter quietly, "I should like
    </p>
    <p>
     to see the operator who received them."
    </p>
    <p>
     "By all means!" exclaimed Von Koenitz.
    </p>
    <p>
     The President pressed a button and his secretary entered.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I had anticipated such a desire on the part of all of you," he
    </p>
    <p>
     announced, "and arranged to have him here. He is waiting outside. Shall
    </p>
    <p>
     I have him brought in?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes! Yes!" answered Rostoloff. And the others nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     The door opened, and Bill Hood, wearing his best new blue suit and
    </p>
    <p>
     nervously twisting a faded bicycle cap between his fingers, stumbled
    </p>
    <p>
     awkwardly into the room. His face was bright red with embarrassment and
    </p>
    <p>
     one of his cheeks exhibited a marked protuberance. He blinked in the
    </p>
    <p>
     glare of the electric light.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mr. Hood," the President addressed him courteously, "I have sent for
    </p>
    <p>
     you to explain to these gentlemen, who are the ambassadors of the great
    </p>
    <p>
     European Powers, the circumstances under which you received the wireless
    </p>
    <p>
     messages from the unknown person describing himself as 'Pax.'"
    </p>
    <p>
     Hood shifted from his right to his left foot and pressed his lips
    </p>
    <p>
     together. Von Koenitz fingered the waxed ends of his moustache and
    </p>
    <p>
     regarded the operator whimsically.
    </p>
    <p>
     "In the first place," went on the President, "we desire to know whether
    </p>
    <p>
     the messages which you have reported were received under ordinary or
    </p>
    <p>
     under unusual conditions. In a word, could you form any opinion as to
    </p>
    <p>
     the whereabouts of the sender?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Hood scratched the side of his nose in a manner politely doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sure thing, your Honour," he answered at last. "Sure the conditions was
    </p>
    <p>
     unusual. That feller has some juice and no mistake."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Juice?" inquired Von Koenitz.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yare--current. Whines like a steel top. Fifty kilowatts sure, and maybe
    </p>
    <p>
     more! And a twelve-thousand-metre wave."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I do not fully understand," interjected Rostoloff. "Please explain,
    </p>
    <p>
     sir."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ain't nothin' to explain," returned Hood. "He's just got a hell of a
    </p>
    <p>
     wave length, that's all. Biggest on earth. We're only tuned for a
    </p>
    <p>
     three-thousand-metre wave. At first I could hardly take him at all. I
    </p>
    <p>
     had to throw in our new Henderson ballast coils before I could hear
    </p>
    <p>
     properly. I reckon there ain't another station in Christendom can get
    </p>
    <p>
     him."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ah," remarked Von Koenitz. "One of your millionaire amateurs, I
    </p>
    <p>
     suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yare," agreed Hood. "I thought sure he was a nut."
    </p>
    <p>
     "A what?" interrupted Sir John Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
     "A nut," answered Hood. "A crank, so to speak."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ah, 'krank'!" nodded the German. "Exactly--a lunatic! That is precisely
    </p>
    <p>
     what I say!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "But I don't think it's no nut now," countered Hood valiantly. "If he is
    </p>
    <p>
     a bug he's the biggest bug in all creation, that's all I can say. He's
    </p>
    <p>
     got the goods, that's what he's got. He'll do some damage before he gets
    </p>
    <p>
     through."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are these messages addressed to anybody in particular?" inquired Sir
    </p>
    <p>
     John, who was studying Hood intently.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, they are and they ain't. Pax--that's what he calls
    </p>
    <p>
     himself--signals NAA, our number, you understand, and then says what he
    </p>
    <p>
     has to say to the whole world, care of the United States. The first
    </p>
    <p>
     message I thought was a joke and stuck it in a book I was reading,
    </p>
    <p>
     '_Silas Snooks_'----"
    </p>
    <p>
     "What?" ejaculated Von Koenitz impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Snooks--man's name--feller in the book--nothing to do with this
    </p>
    <p>
     business," explained the operator. "I forgot all about it. But after the
    </p>
    <p>
     earthquake and all the rest of the fuss I dug it out and gave it to Mr.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thornton. Then on the 27th came the next one, saying that Pax was
    </p>
    <p>
     getting tired of waiting for us and was going to start something. That
    </p>
    <p>
     came at one o'clock in the afternoon, and the fun began at three sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
     The whole observatory went on the blink. Say, there ain't any doubt in
    </p>
    <p>
     your minds that it's _him_, is there?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Von Koenitz looked cynically round the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There is not!" exclaimed Rostoloff and Liban in the same breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     The German laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Speak for yourselves, Excellencies," he sneered. His tone nettled the
    </p>
    <p>
     wireless representative of the sovereign American people.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you think I'm a liar?" he demanded, clenching his jaw and glaring at
    </p>
    <p>
     Von Koenitz.
    </p>
    <p>
     The German Ambassador shrugged his shoulders again. Such things were
    </p>
    <p>
     impossible in a civilized country--at Potsdam--but what could you
    </p>
    <p>
     expect----
    </p>
    <p>
     "Steady, Hood!" whispered Thornton.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Remember, Mr. Hood, that you are here to answer our questions," said
    </p>
    <p>
     the President sternly. "You must not address his Excellency, Baron von
    </p>
    <p>
     Koenitz, in this fashion."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But the man was making a monkey of me!" muttered Hood. "All I say is,
    </p>
    <p>
     look out. This Pax is on his job and means business. I just got another
    </p>
    <p>
     call before I came over here--at nine o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What was its purport?" inquired the President.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, it said Pax was getting tired of nothing being done and wanted
    </p>
    <p>
     action of some sort. Said that men were dying like flies, and he
    </p>
    <p>
     proposed to put an end to it at any cost. And--and----"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes! Yes!" ejaculated Liban breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And he would give further evidence of his control over the forces of
    </p>
    <p>
     nature to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ha! Ha!" Von Koenitz leaned back in amusement. "My friend," he
    </p>
    <p>
     chuckled, "you--are--the 'nut'!"
    </p>
    <p>
     What form Hood's resentment might have taken is problematical; but as
    </p>
    <p>
     the German's words left his mouth the electric lights suddenly went out
    </p>
    <p>
     and the windows rattled ominously. At the same moment each occupant of
    </p>
    <p>
     the room felt himself sway slightly toward the east wall, on which
    </p>
    <p>
     appeared a bright yellow glow. Instinctively they all turned to the
    </p>
    <p>
     window which faced the north. The whole sky was flooded with an
    </p>
    <p>
     orange-yellow aurora that rivalled the sunlight in intensity.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What'd I tell you?" mumbled Hood.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Executive Mansion quivered, and even in that yellow light the faces
    </p>
    <p>
     of the ambassadors seemed pale with fear. And then as the glow slowly
    </p>
    <p>
     faded in the north there floated down across the aperture of the window
    </p>
    <p>
     something soft and fluffy like feathers. Thicker and faster it came
    </p>
    <p>
     until the lawn of the White House was covered with it. The air in the
    </p>
    <p>
     room turned cold. Through the window a large flake circled and lit on
    </p>
    <p>
     the back of Rostoloff's head.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Snow!" he cried. "A snowstorm--in August!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The President arose and closed the window. Almost immediately the
    </p>
    <p>
     electric lights burned up again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now are you satisfied?" cried Liban to the German.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Satisfied?" growled Von Koenitz. "I have seen plenty of snowstorms in
    </p>
    <p>
     August. They have them daily in the Alps. You ask me if I am satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of what? That earthquakes, the aurora borealis, electrical disturbances,
    </p>
    <p>
     snowstorms exist--yes. That a mysterious bugaboo is responsible for
    </p>
    <p>
     these things--no!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "What, then, do you require?" gasped Liban.
    </p>
    <p>
     "More than a snowstorm!" retorted the German. "When I was a boy at the
    </p>
    <p>
     gymnasium we had a thunderstorm with fishes in it. They were everywhere
    </p>
    <p>
     one stepped, all over the ground. But we did not conclude that Jonah was
    </p>
    <p>
     giving us a demonstration of his power over the whale."
    </p>
    <p>
     He faced the others defiantly; in his voice was mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You may retire, Mr. Hood," said the President. "But you will kindly
    </p>
    <p>
     wait outside."
    </p>
    <p>
     "That is an honest man if ever I saw one, Mr. President," announced Sir
    </p>
    <p>
     John, after the operator had gone out. "I am satisfied that we are in
    </p>
    <p>
     communication with a human being of practically supernatural powers."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What, then, shall be done?" inquired Rostoloff anxiously. "The world
    </p>
    <p>
     will be annihilated!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Your Excellencies"--Von Koenitz arose and took up a graceful position
    </p>
    <p>
     at the end of the table--"I must protest against what seems to me to be
    </p>
    <p>
     an extraordinary credulity upon the part of all of you. I speak to you
    </p>
    <p>
     as a rational human being, not as an ambassador. Something has occurred
    </p>
    <p>
     to affect the earth's orbit. It may result in a calamity. None can
    </p>
    <p>
     foretell. This planet may be drawn off into space by the attraction of
    </p>
    <p>
     some wandering world that has not yet come within observation. But one
    </p>
    <p>
     thing we know: No power on or of the earth can possibly derange its
    </p>
    <p>
     relation to the other celestial bodies. That would be, as you say here,
    </p>
    <p>
     'lifting one's self by one's own boot-straps.' I do not doubt the
    </p>
    <p>
     accuracy of your clocks and scientific instruments. Those of my own
    </p>
    <p>
     country are in harmony with yours. But to say that the cause of all this
    </p>
    <p>
     is a _man_ is preposterous. If the mysterious Pax makes the heavens
    </p>
    <p>
     fall, they will tumble on his own head. Is he going to send himself to
    </p>
    <p>
     eternity along with the rest of us? Hardly! This Hood is a monstrous
    </p>
    <p>
     liar or a dangerous lunatic. Even if he has received these messages,
    </p>
    <p>
     they are the emanations of a crank, as, he says, he himself first
    </p>
    <p>
     suspected. Let us master this hysteria born of the strain of constant
    </p>
    <p>
     war. In a word, let us go to bed."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Count von Koenitz," replied Sir John after a pause, "you speak
    </p>
    <p>
     forcefully, even persuasively. But your argument is based upon a
    </p>
    <p>
     proposition that is scientifically fallacious. An atom of gunpowder can
    </p>
    <p>
     disintegrate itself, 'lift itself by its own boot-straps!' Why not the
    </p>
    <p>
     earth? Have we as yet begun to solve all the mysteries of nature? Is it
    </p>
    <p>
     inconceivable that there should be an undiscovered explosive capable of
    </p>
    <p>
     disrupting the globe? We have earthquakes. Is it beyond imagination that
    </p>
    <p>
     the forces which produce them can be controlled?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "My dear Sir John," returned Von Koenitz courteously, "my ultimate
    </p>
    <p>
     answer is that we have no adequate reason to connect the phenomena which
    </p>
    <p>
     have disturbed the earth's rotation with any human agency."
    </p>
    <p>
     "That," interposed the President, "is something upon which individuals
    </p>
    <p>
     may well differ. I suppose that under other conditions you would be open
    </p>
    <p>
     to conviction?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Assuredly," answered Von Koenitz. "Should the sender of these messages
    </p>
    <p>
     prophesy the performance of some miracle that could not be explained by
    </p>
    <p>
     natural causes, I would be forced to admit my error."
    </p>
    <p>
     Monsieur Liban had also arisen and was walking nervously up and down the
    </p>
    <p>
     room. Suddenly he turned to Von Koenitz and in a voice shaking with
    </p>
    <p>
     emotion cried: "Let us then invite Pax to give us a sign that will
    </p>
    <p>
     satisfy you."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Monsieur Liban," replied Von Koenitz stiffly, "I refuse to place myself
    </p>
    <p>
     in the position of communicating with a lunatic."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Very well," shouted the Frenchman, "I will take the responsibility of
    </p>
    <p>
     making myself ridiculous. I will request the President of the United
    </p>
    <p>
     States to act as the agent of France for this purpose."
    </p>
    <p>
     He drew a notebook and a fountain pen from his pocket and carefully
    </p>
    <p>
     wrote out a message which he handed to the President. The latter read it
    </p>
    <p>
     aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
     "_Pax_: The Ambassador of the French Republic requests me to
    </p>
    <p>
     communicate to you the fact that he desires some further evidence
    </p>
    <p>
     of your power to control the movements of the earth and the
    </p>
    <p>
     destinies of mankind, such phenomena to be preferably of a harmless
    </p>
    <p>
     character, but inexplicable by any theory of natural causation. I
    </p>
    <p>
     await your reply.
    </p>
    <p>
     "THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Send for Hood," ordered the President to the secretary who answered the
    </p>
    <p>
     bell. "Gentlemen, I suggest that we ourselves go to Georgetown and
    </p>
    <p>
     superintend the sending of this message."
    </p>
    <p>
     Half an hour later Bill Hood sat in his customary chair in the wireless
    </p>
    <p>
     operating room surrounded by the President of the United States, the
    </p>
    <p>
     ambassadors of France, Germany, Great Britain, and Russia, and Professor
    </p>
    <p>
     Thornton. The faces of all wore expressions of the utmost seriousness,
    </p>
    <p>
     except that of Von Koenitz, who looked as if he were participating in an
    </p>
    <p>
     elaborate hoax. Several of these distinguished gentlemen had never seen
    </p>
    <p>
     a wireless apparatus before, and showed some excitement as Hood made
    </p>
    <p>
     ready to send the most famous message ever transmitted through the
    </p>
    <p>
     ether. At last he threw over his rheostat and the hum of the rotary
    </p>
    <p>
     spark rose into its staccato song. Hood sent out a few V's and then
    </p>
    <p>
     began calling:
    </p>
    <p>
     "PAX--PAX--PAX."
    </p>
    <p>
     Breathlessly the group waited while he listened for a reply. Again he
    </p>
    <p>
     called:
    </p>
    <p>
     "PAX--PAX--PAX."
    </p>
    <p>
     He had already thrown in his Henderson ballast coils and was ready for
    </p>
    <p>
     the now familiar wave. He closed his eyes, waiting for that sharp
    </p>
    <p>
     metallic cry that came no one knew whence. The others in the group also
    </p>
    <p>
     listened intently, as if by so doing they, too, might hear the answer if
    </p>
    <p>
     any there should be. Suddenly Hood stiffened.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There he is!" he whispered. The President handed him the message, and
    </p>
    <p>
     Hood's fingers played over the key while the spark sent its singing note
    </p>
    <p>
     through the ether.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Such phenomena to be preferably of a harmless character, but
    </p>
    <p>
     inexplicable by any theory of natural causation," he concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
     An uncanny dread seized on Thornton, who had withdrawn himself into the
    </p>
    <p>
     background. What was this strange communion? Who was this mysterious
    </p>
    <p>
     Pax? Were these real men or creatures of a grotesque dream? Was he not
    </p>
    <p>
     drowsing over his eyepiece in the meridian-circle room? Then a
    </p>
    <p>
     simultaneous movement upon the part of those gathered round the operator
    </p>
    <p>
     convinced him of the reality of what was taking place. Hood was
    </p>
    <p>
     laboriously writing upon a sheet of yellow pad paper, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     ambassadors were unceremoniously crowding each other in their eagerness
    </p>
    <p>
     to read.
    </p>
    <p>
     "To the President of the United States," wrote Hood: "In reply to your
    </p>
    <p>
     message requesting further evidence of my power to compel the cessation
    </p>
    <p>
     of hostilities within twenty-four hours, I"--there was a pause for
    </p>
    <p>
     nearly a minute, during which the ticking of the big clock sounded to
    </p>
    <p>
     Thornton like revolver shots--"I will excavate a channel through the
    </p>
    <p>
     Atlas Mountains and divert the Mediterranean into the Sahara Desert.
    </p>
    <p>
     PAX."
    </p>
    <p>
     Silence followed the final transcription of the message from the
    </p>
    <p>
     unknown--a silence broken only by Bill Hood's tremulous, half-whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
     "He'll do it all right!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Then the German Ambassador laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And thus save your ingenious nation a vast amount of trouble, Monsieur
    </p>
    <p>
     Liban," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
     VI
    </p>
    <p>
     A Tripolitan fisherman, Mohammed Ben Ali el Bad, a holy man nearly
    </p>
    <p>
     seventy years of age, who had twice made the journey to Mecca and who
    </p>
    <p>
     now in his declining years occupied himself with reading the Koran and
    </p>
    <p>
     instructing his grandsons in the profession of fishing for mullet along
    </p>
    <p>
     the reefs of the Gulf of Cabes, had anchored for the night off the
    </p>
    <p>
     Tunisian coast, about midway between Sfax and Lesser Syrtis. The mullet
    </p>
    <p>
     had been running thick and he was well satisfied, for by the next
    </p>
    <p>
     evening he would surely complete his load and be able to return home to
    </p>
    <p>
     the house of his daughter, Fatima, the wife of Abbas, the confectioner.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her youngest son, Abdullah, a lithe lad of seventeen, was at that moment
    </p>
    <p>
     engaged in folding their prayer rugs, which had been spread in the bow
    </p>
    <p>
     of the falukah in order that they might have a clearer view as they
    </p>
    <p>
     knelt toward the Holy City. Chud, their slave, was cleaning mullet in
    </p>
    <p>
     the waist and chanting some weird song of his native land.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mohammed Ben Ali el Bad was sitting cross-legged in the stern, smoking a
    </p>
    <p>
     hookah and watching the full moon sail slowly up above the Atlas Range
    </p>
    <p>
     to the southwest. The wind had died down and the sea was calm, heaving
    </p>
    <p>
     slowly with great orange-purple swells resembling watered silk. In the
    </p>
    <p>
     west still lingered the fast-fading afterglow, above which the stars
    </p>
    <p>
     glimmered faintly. Along the coast lights twinkled in scattered coves.
    </p>
    <p>
     Half a mile astern the Italian cruiser _Fiala_ lay slowly swinging at
    </p>
    <p>
     anchor. From the forecastle came the smell of fried mullet. Mohammed Ben
    </p>
    <p>
     Ali was at peace with himself and with the world, including even the
    </p>
    <p>
     irritating Chud. The west darkened and the stars burned more
    </p>
    <p>
     brilliantly. With the hookah gurgling softly at his feet, Mohammed
    </p>
    <p>
     leaned back his head and gazed in silent appreciation at the wonders of
    </p>
    <p>
     the heavens. There was Turka Kabar, the crocodile; and Menish el Tabir,
    </p>
    <p>
     the sleeping beauty; and Rook Hamana, the leopard, and there--up there
    </p>
    <p>
     to the far north--was a shooting star. How gracefully it shot across the
    </p>
    <p>
     sky, leaving its wake of yellow light behind it! It was the season for
    </p>
    <p>
     shooting stars, he recollected. In an instant it would be gone--like a
    </p>
    <p>
     man's life! Saddened, he looked down at his hookah. When he should look
    </p>
    <p>
     up again--if in only an instant--the star would be gone. Presently he
    </p>
    <p>
     did look up again. But the star was still there, coming his way!
    </p>
    <p>
     He rubbed his old eyes, keen as they were from habituation to the
    </p>
    <p>
     blinding light of the desert. Yes, the star was coming--coming fast.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Abdullah!" he called in his high-pitched voice. "Chud! Come, see the
    </p>
    <p>
     star!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Together they watched it sweep onward.
    </p>
    <p>
     "By Allah! That is no star!" suddenly cried Abdullah. "It is an
    </p>
    <p>
     air-flying fire chariot! I can see it with my eyes--black, and spouting
    </p>
    <p>
     flames from behind."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Black," echoed Chud gutturally. "Black and round! Oh, Allah!" He fell
    </p>
    <p>
     on his knees and knocked his head against the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
     The star, or whatever it was, swung in a wide circle toward the coast,
    </p>
    <p>
     and Mohammed and Abdullah now saw that what they had taken to be a trail
    </p>
    <p>
     of fire behind was in fact a broad beam of yellow light that pointed
    </p>
    <p>
     diagonally earthward. It swept nearer and nearer, illuminating the whole
    </p>
    <p>
     sky and casting a shimmering reflection upon the waves.
    </p>
    <p>
     A shrill whistle trilled across the water, accompanied by the sound of
    </p>
    <p>
     footsteps running along the decks of the cruiser. Lights flashed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Muffled orders were shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
     "By the beard of the Prophet!" cried Mohammed Ali. "Something is going
    </p>
    <p>
     to happen!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The small black object from which the incandescent beam descended passed
    </p>
    <p>
     at that moment athwart the face of the moon, and Abdullah saw that it
    </p>
    <p>
     was round and flat like a ring. The ray of light came from a point
    </p>
    <p>
     directly above it, passing through its aperture downward to the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Boom!" The fishing-boat shook to the thunder of the _Fiala's_
    </p>
    <p>
     eight-inch gun, and a blinding spurt of flame leaped from the cruiser's
    </p>
    <p>
     bows. With a whining shriek a shell rose toward the moon. There was a
    </p>
    <p>
     quick flash followed by a dull concussion. The shell had not reached a
    </p>
    <p>
     tenth of the distance to the flying machine.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then everything happened at once. Mohammed described afterward to a
    </p>
    <p>
     gaping multitude of dirty villagers, while he sat enthroned upon his
    </p>
    <p>
     daughter's threshold, how the star-ship had sailed across the face of
    </p>
    <p>
     the moon and come to a standstill above the mountains, with its beam of
    </p>
    <p>
     yellow light pointing directly downward so that the coast could be seen
    </p>
    <p>
     bright as day from Sfax to Cabes. He saw, he said, genii climbing up and
    </p>
    <p>
     down on the beam. Be that as it may, he swears upon the Beard of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Prophet that a second ray of light--of a lavender colour, like the eye
    </p>
    <p>
     of a long-dead mullet--flashed down alongside the yellow beam. Instantly
    </p>
    <p>
     the earth blew up like a cannon--up into the air, a thousand miles up.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was as light as noonday. Deafened by titanic concussions he fell half
    </p>
    <p>
     dead. The sea boiled and gave off thick clouds of steam through which
    </p>
    <p>
     flashed dazzling discharges of lightning accompanied by a thundering,
    </p>
    <p>
     grinding sound like a million mills. The ocean heaved spasmodically and
    </p>
    <p>
     the air shook with a rending, ripping noise, as if Nature were bent upon
    </p>
    <p>
     destroying her own handiwork. The glare was so dazzling that sight was
    </p>
    <p>
     impossible. The falukah was tossed this way and that, as if caught in a
    </p>
    <p>
     simoon, and he was rolled hither and yon in the company of Chud,
    </p>
    <p>
     Abdullah, and the headless mullet.
    </p>
    <p>
     This earsplitting racket continued, he says, without interruption for
    </p>
    <p>
     two days. Abdullah says it was several hours; the official report of the
    </p>
    <p>
     _Fiala_ gives it as six minutes. And then it began to rain in torrents
    </p>
    <p>
     until he was almost drowned. A great wind arose and lashed the ocean,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a whirlpool seized the falukah and whirled it round and round.
    </p>
    <p>
     Darkness descended upon the earth, and in the general mess Mohammed hit
    </p>
    <p>
     his head a terrific blow against the mast. He was sure it was but a
    </p>
    <p>
     matter of seconds before they would be dashed to pieces by the waves.
    </p>
    <p>
     The falukah spun like a marine top with a swift sideways motion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Something was dragging them along, sucking them in. The _Fiala_ went
    </p>
    <p>
     careening by, her fighting masts hanging in shreds. The air was full of
    </p>
    <p>
     falling rocks, trees, splinters, and thick clouds of dust that turned
    </p>
    <p>
     the water yellow in the lightning flashes. The mast went crashing over
    </p>
    <p>
     and a lemon tree descended to take its place. Great streams of lava
    </p>
    <p>
     poured down out of the air, and masses of opaque matter plunged into the
    </p>
    <p>
     sea all about the falukah. Scalding mud, stones, hail, fell upon the
    </p>
    <p>
     deck.
    </p>
    <p>
     And still the fishing-boat, gyrating like a leaf, remained afloat with
    </p>
    <p>
     its crew of half-crazed Arabs. Suffocated, stunned, scalded, petrified
    </p>
    <p>
     with fear, they lay among the mullet while the falukah raced along in
    </p>
    <p>
     its wild dance with death. Mohammed recalls seeing what he thought to be
    </p>
    <p>
     a great cliff rush by close beside them. The falukah plunged over a
    </p>
    <p>
     waterfall and was almost submerged, was caught again in a maelstrom, and
    </p>
    <p>
     went twirling on in the blackness. They all were deathly sick, but were
    </p>
    <p>
     too terrified to move.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then the nearer roaring ceased. The air was less congested. They
    </p>
    <p>
     were still showered with sand, clods of earth, twigs, and pebbles, it is
    </p>
    <p>
     true, but the genii had stopped hurling mountains at each other. The
    </p>
    <p>
     darkness became less opaque, the water smoother. Soon they could see the
    </p>
    <p>
     moon through the clouds of settling dust, and gradually they could
    </p>
    <p>
     discern the stars. The falukah was rocking gently upon a broad expanse
    </p>
    <p>
     of muddy ocean, surrounded by a yellow scum broken here and there by a
    </p>
    <p>
     floating tree. The _Fiala_ had vanished. No light shone upon the face of
    </p>
    <p>
     the waters. But death had not overtaken them. Overcome by exhaustion and
    </p>
    <p>
     terror Mohammed lay among the mullet, his legs entangled in the lemon
    </p>
    <p>
     tree. Did he dream it? He cannot tell. But as he lost consciousness he
    </p>
    <p>
     thinks he saw a star shooting toward the north.
    </p>
    <p>
     When he awoke the falukah lay motionless upon a boundless ochre sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were beyond sight of land. Out of a sky slightly dim the sun burned
    </p>
    <p>
     pitilessly down, sending warmth into their bodies and courage to their
    </p>
    <p>
     hearts. All about them upon the water floated the evidences of the
    </p>
    <p>
     cataclysm of the preceding night--trees, shrubs, dead birds, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     distorted corpse of a camel. Kneeling without their prayer rugs among
    </p>
    <p>
     the mullet they raised their voices in praise of Allah and his Prophet.
    </p>
    <p>
     VII
    </p>
    <p>
     Within twenty-four hours of the destruction of the Mountains of Atlas by
    </p>
    <p>
     the Flying Ring and the consequent flooding of the Sahara, the official
    </p>
    <p>
     gazettes and such newspapers as were still published announced that the
    </p>
    <p>
     Powers had agreed upon an armistice and accepted a proposition of
    </p>
    <p>
     mediation on the part of the United States looking toward permanent
    </p>
    <p>
     peace. The news of the devastation and flood caused by this strange and
    </p>
    <p>
     terrible dreadnought of the air created the profoundest apprehension and
    </p>
    <p>
     caused the wildest rumours, for what had happened in Tunis was assumed
    </p>
    <p>
     as likely to occur in London, Paris, or New York. Wireless messages
    </p>
    <p>
     flashed the story from Algiers to Cartagena, and it was thence
    </p>
    <p>
     disseminated throughout the civilized world by the wireless stations at
    </p>
    <p>
     Paris, Nauen, Moscow, and Georgetown.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fact that the rotation of the earth had been retarded was still a
    </p>
    <p>
     secret, and the appearance of the Ring had not as yet been connected
    </p>
    <p>
     with any of the extraordinary phenomena surrounding it; but the
    </p>
    <p>
     newspaper editorials universally agreed that whatever nation owned and
    </p>
    <p>
     controlled this new instrument of war could dictate its own terms. It
    </p>
    <p>
     was generally supposed that the blasting of the mountain chain of
    </p>
    <p>
     Northern Africa had been an experiment to test and demonstrate the
    </p>
    <p>
     powers of this new demoniacal invention, and in view of its success it
    </p>
    <p>
     did not seem surprising that the nations had hastened to agree to an
    </p>
    <p>
     armistice, for the Power that controlled a force capable of producing
    </p>
    <p>
     such an extraordinary physical cataclysm could annihilate every capital,
    </p>
    <p>
     every army, every people upon the globe or even the globe itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     The flight of the Ring machine had been observed at several different
    </p>
    <p>
     points, beginning at Cape Race, where at about four A.M. the
    </p>
    <p>
     wireless operator reported what he supposed to be a large comet
    </p>
    <p>
     discharging earthward a diagonal shaft of orange-yellow light and moving
    </p>
    <p>
     at incredible velocity in a southeasterly direction. During the
    </p>
    <p>
     following day the lookout on the _Vira_, a fishguard and scout cruiser
    </p>
    <p>
     of the North Atlantic Patrol, saw a black speck soaring among the clouds
    </p>
    <p>
     which he took to be a lost monoplane fighting to regain the coast of
    </p>
    <p>
     Ireland. At sundown an amateur wireless operator at St. Michael's in the
    </p>
    <p>
     Azores noted a small comet sweeping across the sky far to the north.
    </p>
    <p>
     This comet an hour or so later passed directly over the cities of
    </p>
    <p>
     Lisbon, Linares, Lorca, Cartagena, and Algiers, and was clearly
    </p>
    <p>
     observable from Badajoz, Almadén, Seville, Cordova, Grenada, Oran,
    </p>
    <p>
     Biskra, and Tunis, and at the latter places it was easily possible for
    </p>
    <p>
     telescopic observers to determine its size, shape, and general
    </p>
    <p>
     construction.
    </p>
    <p>
     Daniel W. Quinn, Jr., the acting United States Consul stationed at
    </p>
    <p>
     Biskra, who happened to be dining with the abbot of the Franciscan
    </p>
    <p>
     monastery at Linares, sent the following account of the flight of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Ring to the State Department at Washington, where it is now on file.
    </p>
    <p>
     [See Vol. 27, pp. 491-498, with footnote, of Official Records of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Consular Correspondence for 1915-1916.] After describing general
    </p>
    <p>
     conditions in Algeria he continues:
    </p>
    <p>
     We had gone upon the roof in the early evening to look at the sky
    </p>
    <p>
     through the large telescope presented to the Franciscans by Count
    </p>
    <p>
     Philippe d'Ormay, when Father Antoine called my attention to a
    </p>
    <p>
     comet that was apparently coming straight toward us. Instead,
    </p>
    <p>
     however, of leaving a horizontal trail of fire behind it, this
    </p>
    <p>
     comet or meteorite seemed to shoot an almost vertical beam of
    </p>
    <p>
     orange light toward the earth. It produced a very strange effect on
    </p>
    <p>
     all of us, since a normal comet or other celestial body that left a
    </p>
    <p>
     wake of light of that sort behind it would naturally be expected to
    </p>
    <p>
     be moving upward toward the zenith, instead of in a direction
    </p>
    <p>
     parallel to the earth. It looked somehow as if the tail of the
    </p>
    <p>
     comet had been bent over. As soon as it came near enough so that we
    </p>
    <p>
     could focus the telescope upon it we discovered that it was a new
    </p>
    <p>
     sort of flying machine. It passed over our heads at a height no
    </p>
    <p>
     greater than ten thousand feet, if as great as that, and we could
    </p>
    <p>
     see that it was a cylindrical ring like a doughnut or an anchor
    </p>
    <p>
     ring, constructed, I believe, of highly polished metal, the inner
    </p>
    <p>
     aperture being about twenty-five yards in diameter. The tube of the
    </p>
    <p>
     cylinder looked to be about twenty feet thick, and had circular
    </p>
    <p>
     windows or portholes that were brilliantly lighted.
    </p>
    <p>
     The strangest thing about it was that it carried a superstructure
    </p>
    <p>
     consisting of a number of arms meeting at a point above the centre
    </p>
    <p>
     of the opening and supporting some sort of apparatus from which the
    </p>
    <p>
     beam of light emanated. This appliance, which we supposed to be a
    </p>
    <p>
     gigantic searchlight, was focused down through the Ring and could
    </p>
    <p>
     apparently be moved at will over a limited radius of about fifteen
    </p>
    <p>
     degrees. We could not understand this, nor why the light was thrown
    </p>
    <p>
     from outside and above instead of from inside the flying machine,
    </p>
    <p>
     but the explanation may be found in the immense heat that must have
    </p>
    <p>
     been required to generate the light, since it illuminated the entire
    </p>
    <p>
     country for fifty miles or so, and we were able to read without
    </p>
    <p>
     trouble the fine print of the abbot's rubric. This Flying Ring moved
    </p>
    <p>
     on an even keel at the tremendous velocity of about two hundred
    </p>
    <p>
     miles an hour. We wondered what would happen if it turned turtle,
    </p>
    <p>
     for in that case the weight of the superstructure would have
    </p>
    <p>
     rendered it impossible for the machine to right itself. In fact,
    </p>
    <p>
     none of us had ever imagined any such air monster before. Beside it
    </p>
    <p>
     a Zeppelin seemed like a wooden toy.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Ring passed over the mountains toward Cabes and within a short
    </p>
    <p>
     time a volcanic eruption occurred that destroyed a section of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Atlas Range. [Mr. Quinn here describes with considerable detail the
    </p>
    <p>
     destruction of the mountains.] The next morning I found Biskra
    </p>
    <p>
     crowded with Arabs, who reported that the ocean had poured through
    </p>
    <p>
     the passage made by the eruption and was flooding the entire desert
    </p>
    <p>
     as far south as the oasis of Wargla, and that it had come within
    </p>
    <p>
     twelve miles of the walls of our own city. I at once hired a donkey
    </p>
    <p>
     and made a personal investigation, with the result that I can report
    </p>
    <p>
     as a fact that the entire desert east and south of Biskra is
    </p>
    <p>
     inundated to a depth of from seven to ten feet and that the water
    </p>
    <p>
     gives no sign of going down. The loss of life seems to have been
    </p>
    <p>
     negligible, owing to the fact that the height of the water is not
    </p>
    <p>
     great and that many unexpected islands have provided safety for the
    </p>
    <p>
     caravans that were _in transitu_. These are now marooned and waiting
    </p>
    <p>
     for assistance, which I am informed will be sent from Cabes in the
    </p>
    <p>
     form of flat-bottomed boats fitted with motor auxiliaries.
    </p>
    <p>
     Respectfully submitted,
    </p>
    <p>
     D. W. QUINN, Jr.,
    </p>
    <p>
     Acting U. S. Consul.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Italian cruiser _Fiala_, which had been carried one hundred and
    </p>
    <p>
     eighty miles into the desert on the night of the eruption, grounded
    </p>
    <p>
     safely on the plateau of Tasili, but the volcanic tidal wave on which
    </p>
    <p>
     she had been swept along, having done its work, receded, leaving too
    </p>
    <p>
     little water for the _Fiala's_ draft of thirty-seven feet. Four launches
    </p>
    <p>
     sent out in different directions to the south and east reported no sign
    </p>
    <p>
     of land, but immense quantities of floating vegetable matter, yellow
    </p>
    <p>
     dust, and the bodies of jackals, camels, zebras, and lions. The fifth
    </p>
    <p>
     launch after great hardships reached the seacoast through the new
    </p>
    <p>
     channel and arrived at Sfax after eight days.
    </p>
    <p>
     The mean tide level of the Mediterranean sank fifteen inches, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     water showed marked discoloration for several months, while a volcanic
    </p>
    <p>
     haze hung over Northern Africa, Sicily, Malta, and Sardinia for an even
    </p>
    <p>
     longer period.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though many persons must have lost their lives the records are
    </p>
    <p>
     incomplete in this respect; but there is a curious document in the
    </p>
    <p>
     mosque at Sfax touching the effect of the Lavender Ray. It appears that
    </p>
    <p>
     an Arab mussel-gatherer was in a small boat with his two brothers at the
    </p>
    <p>
     time the Ring appeared above the mountains. As they looked up toward the
    </p>
    <p>
     sky the Ray flashed over and illuminated their faces. They thought
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing of it at the time, for almost immediately the mountains were
    </p>
    <p>
     rent asunder and in the titanic upheaval that followed they were all
    </p>
    <p>
     cast upon the shore, as they thought, dead men. Reaching Sfax they
    </p>
    <p>
     reported their adventures and offered prayers in gratitude for their
    </p>
    <p>
     extraordinary escape; but five days later all three began to suffer
    </p>
    <p>
     excruciating torment from internal burns, the skin upon their heads and
    </p>
    <p>
     bodies began to peel off, and they died in agony within the week.
    </p>
    <p>
     VIII
    </p>
    <p>
     It was but a few days thereafter that the President of the United States
    </p>
    <p>
     received the official note from Count von Koenitz, on behalf of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Imperial German Commissioners, to the effect that Germany would join
    </p>
    <p>
     with the other Powers in an armistice looking toward peace and
    </p>
    <p>
     ultimately a universal disarmament. Similar notes had already been
    </p>
    <p>
     received by the President from France, Great Britain, Russia, Italy,
    </p>
    <p>
     Austria, Spain, and Slavia, and a multitude of the other smaller Powers
    </p>
    <p>
     who were engaged in the war, and there was no longer any reason for
    </p>
    <p>
     delaying the calling of an international council or diet for the purpose
    </p>
    <p>
     of bringing about what Pax demanded as a ransom for the safety of the
    </p>
    <p>
     globe.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the files of the State Department at Washington there is secreted the
    </p>
    <p>
     only record of the diplomatic correspondence touching these momentous
    </p>
    <p>
     events, and a transcript of the messages exchanged between the President
    </p>
    <p>
     of the United States and the Arbiter of Human Destiny. They are
    </p>
    <p>
     comparatively few in number, for Pax seemed to be satisfied to leave all
    </p>
    <p>
     details to the Powers themselves. In the interest of saving time,
    </p>
    <p>
     however, he made the simple suggestion that the present ambassadors
    </p>
    <p>
     should be given plenary powers to determine the terms and conditions
    </p>
    <p>
     upon which universal peace should be declared. All these proceedings and
    </p>
    <p>
     the reasons therefore were kept profoundly secret. It began to look as
    </p>
    <p>
     though the matter would be put through with characteristic Yankee
    </p>
    <p>
     promptness. Pax's suggestion was acceded to, and the ambassadors and
    </p>
    <p>
     ministers were given unrestricted latitude in drawing the treaty that
    </p>
    <p>
     should abolish war forever.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now that he had been won over no one was more indefatigable than Von
    </p>
    <p>
     Koenitz, none more fertile in suggestions. It was he who drafted with
    </p>
    <p>
     his own hand the forty pages devoted to the creation of the commission
    </p>
    <p>
     charged with the duty of destroying all arms, munitions, and implements
    </p>
    <p>
     of war; and he not only acted as chairman of the preliminary drafting
    </p>
    <p>
     committee, but was an active member of at least half a dozen other
    </p>
    <p>
     important subcommittees. The President daily communicated the progress
    </p>
    <p>
     of this conference of the Powers to Pax through Bill Hood, and received
    </p>
    <p>
     daily in return a hearty if laconic approval.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I am satisfied of the sincerity of the Powers and with the
    </p>
    <p>
     progress made. PAX."
    </p>
    <p>
     was the ordinary type of message received. Meantime word had been sent
    </p>
    <p>
     to all the governments that an indefinite armistice had been declared,
    </p>
    <p>
     to commence at the end of ten days, for it had been found necessary to
    </p>
    <p>
     allow for the time required to transmit the orders to the various fields
    </p>
    <p>
     of military operations throughout Europe. In the interim the war
    </p>
    <p>
     continued.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was at this time that Count von Koenitz, who now was looked upon as
    </p>
    <p>
     the leading figure of the conference, arose and said: "Your
    </p>
    <p>
     Excellencies, this distinguished diet will, I doubt not, presently
    </p>
    <p>
     conclude its labours and receive not only the approval of the Powers
    </p>
    <p>
     represented but the gratitude of the nations of the world. I voice the
    </p>
    <p>
     sentiments of the Imperial Commissioners when I say that no Power looks
    </p>
    <p>
     forward with greater eagerness than Germany to the accomplishment of our
    </p>
    <p>
     purpose. But we should not forget that there is one menace to mankind
    </p>
    <p>
     greater than that of war--namely, the lurking danger from the power of
    </p>
    <p>
     this unknown possessor of superhuman knowledge of explosives. So far his
    </p>
    <p>
     influence has been a benign one, but who can say when it may become
    </p>
    <p>
     malignant? Will our labours please him? Perhaps not. Shall we agree? I
    </p>
    <p>
     hope so, but who can tell? Will our armies lay down their arms even
    </p>
    <p>
     after we have agreed? I believe all will go well; but is it wise for us
    </p>
    <p>
     to refrain from jointly taking steps to ascertain the identity of this
    </p>
    <p>
     unknown juggler with Nature, and the source of his power? It is my own
    </p>
    <p>
     opinion, since we cannot exert any influence or control upon this
    </p>
    <p>
     individual, that we should take whatever steps are within our grasp to
    </p>
    <p>
     safeguard ourselves in the event that he refuses to keep faith with us.
    </p>
    <p>
     To this end I suggest an international conference of scientific men from
    </p>
    <p>
     all the nations to be held here in Washington coincidently with our own
    </p>
    <p>
     meetings, with a view to determining these questions."
    </p>
    <p>
     His remarks were greeted with approval by almost all the representatives
    </p>
    <p>
     present except Sir John Smith, who mildly hinted that such a course
    </p>
    <p>
     might be regarded as savouring a trifle of double dealing. Should Pax
    </p>
    <p>
     receive knowledge of the suggested conference he might question their
    </p>
    <p>
     sincerity and view all their doings with suspicion. In a word, Sir John
    </p>
    <p>
     believed in following a consistent course and treating Pax as a friend
    </p>
    <p>
     and ally and not as a possible enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sir John's speech, however, left the delegates unconvinced and with the
    </p>
    <p>
     feeling that his argument was over-refined. They felt that there could
    </p>
    <p>
     be no objection to endeavouring to ascertain the source of Pax's
    </p>
    <p>
     power--the law of self-preservation seemed to indicate such a course as
    </p>
    <p>
     necessary. And it had, in fact, already been discussed vaguely by
    </p>
    <p>
     several less conspicuous delegates. Accordingly it was voted, with but
    </p>
    <p>
     two dissenting voices,[2] to summon what was known as Conference No. 2,
    </p>
    <p>
     to be held as soon as possible, its proceedings to be conducted in
    </p>
    <p>
     secret under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences, with the
    </p>
    <p>
     president of the Academy acting as permanent chairman. To this
    </p>
    <p>
     conference the President appointed Thornton as one of the three
    </p>
    <p>
     delegates from the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
     [Footnote 2: The President of the United States also voted in the
    </p>
    <p>
     negative.]
    </p>
    <p>
     The council of the Powers having so voted, Count von Koenitz at once
    </p>
    <p>
     transmitted, by way of Sayville, a message which in code appeared to be
    </p>
    <p>
     addressed to a Herr Karl Heinweg, Notary, at 12^{BIS} Bunden Strasse,
    </p>
    <p>
     Strassburg, and related to a mortgage about to fall due upon some of Von
    </p>
    <p>
     Koenitz's properties in Thüringen. When decoded it read:
    </p>
    <p>
     "_To the Imperial Commissioners of the German Federated States:_
    </p>
    <p>
     "I have the honour to report that acting according to your
    </p>
    <p>
     distinguished instructions I have this day proposed an international
    </p>
    <p>
     conference to consider the scientific problems presented by certain
    </p>
    <p>
     recent phenomena and that my proposition was adopted. I believe that
    </p>
    <p>
     in this way the proceedings here may be delayed indefinitely and
    </p>
    <p>
     time thus secured to enable an expedition to be organized and
    </p>
    <p>
     dispatched for the purpose of destroying this unknown person or
    </p>
    <p>
     ascertaining the secret of his power, in accordance with my previous
    </p>
    <p>
     suggestion. It would be well to send as delegates to this Conference
    </p>
    <p>
     No. 2 several professors of physics who can by plausible arguments
    </p>
    <p>
     and ingenious theories so confuse the matter that no determination
    </p>
    <p>
     can be reached. I suggest Professors Gasgabelaus, of München, and
    </p>
    <p>
     Leybach, of the Hague.
    </p>
    <p>
     "VON KOENITZ."
    </p>
    <p>
     And having thus fulfilled his duty the count took a cab to the
    </p>
    <p>
     Metropolitan Club and there played a discreet game of billiards with
    </p>
    <p>
     Señor Tomasso Varilla, the ex-minister from Argentina.
    </p>
    <p>
     Von Koenitz from the first had played his hand with a skill which from a
    </p>
    <p>
     diplomatic view left nothing to be desired. The extraordinary natural
    </p>
    <p>
     phenomena which had occurred coincidentally with the first message of
    </p>
    <p>
     Pax to the President of the United States and the fall of Cleopatra's
    </p>
    <p>
     Needle had been immediately observed by the scientists attached to the
    </p>
    <p>
     Imperial and other universities throughout the German Federated States,
    </p>
    <p>
     and had no sooner been observed than their significance had been
    </p>
    <p>
     realized. These most industrious and thorough of all human investigators
    </p>
    <p>
     had instantly reported the facts and their preliminary conclusions to
    </p>
    <p>
     the Imperial Commissioners, with the recommendation that no stone be
    </p>
    <p>
     left unturned in attempting to locate and ascertain the causes of this
    </p>
    <p>
     disruption of the forces of nature. The Commissioners at once demanded
    </p>
    <p>
     an exhaustive report from the faculty of the Imperial German University,
    </p>
    <p>
     and notified Von Koenitz by cable that until further notice he must seek
    </p>
    <p>
     in every way to delay investigation by other nations and to belittle the
    </p>
    <p>
     importance of what had occurred, for these astute German scientists had
    </p>
    <p>
     at once jumped to the conclusion that the acceleration of the earth's
    </p>
    <p>
     motion had been due to some human agency possessed of a hitherto
    </p>
    <p>
     unsuspected power.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was for this reason that at the first meeting at the White House the
    </p>
    <p>
     Ambassador had pooh-poohed the whole matter and talked of snowstorms in
    </p>
    <p>
     the Alps and showers of fish at Heidelburg, but with the rending of the
    </p>
    <p>
     northern coast of Africa and the well-attested appearances of "The Ring"
    </p>
    <p>
     he soon reached the conclusion that his wisest course was to cause such
    </p>
    <p>
     a delay on the part of the other Powers that the inevitable race for the
    </p>
    <p>
     secret would be won by the nation which he so astutely represented. He
    </p>
    <p>
     reasoned, quite accurately, that the scientists of England, Russia, and
    </p>
    <p>
     America would not remain idle in attempting to deduce the cause and
    </p>
    <p>
     place the origin of the phenomena and the habitat of the master of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Ring, and that the only effectual means to enable Germany to capture
    </p>
    <p>
     this, the greatest of all prizes of war, was to befuddle the
    </p>
    <p>
     representatives of the other nations while leaving his own unhampered in
    </p>
    <p>
     their efforts to accomplish that which would make his countrymen, almost
    </p>
    <p>
     without further effort, the masters of the world. Now the easiest way to
    </p>
    <p>
     befuddle the scientists of the world was to get them into one place and
    </p>
    <p>
     befuddle them all together, and this, after communicating with his
    </p>
    <p>
     superiors, he had proceeded to do. He was a clever man, trained in the
    </p>
    <p>
     devious ways of the Wilhelmstrasse, and when he set out to accomplish
    </p>
    <p>
     something he was almost inevitably successful. Yet in spite of the
    </p>
    <p>
     supposed alliance between Kaiser and Deity man proposes and God
    </p>
    <p>
     disposes, and sometimes the latter uses the humblest of human
    </p>
    <p>
     instruments in that disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
     IX
    </p>
    <p>
     The Imperial German Commissioner for War, General Hans von Helmuth, was
    </p>
    <p>
     a man of extraordinary decision and farsightedness. Sixty years of age,
    </p>
    <p>
     he had been a member of the general staff since he was forty. He had sat
    </p>
    <p>
     at the feet of Bismarck and Von Moltke, and during his active
    </p>
    <p>
     participation in the management of German military affairs he had seen
    </p>
    <p>
     but slight changes in their policy: Mass--overwhelming mass; sudden
    </p>
    <p>
     momentous onslaught, and, above all, an attack so quick that your
    </p>
    <p>
     adversary could not regain his feet. It worked nine times out of ten,
    </p>
    <p>
     and when it didn't it was usually better than taking the defensive.
    </p>
    <p>
     General von Helmuth having an approved system was to that extent
    </p>
    <p>
     relieved of anxiety, for all he had to do was to work out details. In
    </p>
    <p>
     this his highly efficient organization was almost automatic. He himself
    </p>
    <p>
     was a human compendium of knowledge, and he had but to press a button
    </p>
    <p>
     and emit a few gutturals and any information that he wanted lay
    </p>
    <p>
     typewritten before him. Now he sat in his office smoking a Bremen cigar
    </p>
    <p>
     and studying a huge Mercatorial projection of the Atlantic and adjacent
    </p>
    <p>
     countries, while with the fingers of his left hand he combed his heavy
    </p>
    <p>
     beard.
    </p>
    <p>
     From the window he looked down upon the inner fortifications of
    </p>
    <p>
     Mainz--to which city the capital had been removed three months
    </p>
    <p>
     before--and upon the landing stage for the scouting planes which were
    </p>
    <p>
     constantly arriving or whirring off toward Holland or Strassburg. Across
    </p>
    <p>
     the river, under the concealed guns of a sunken battery, stood the huge
    </p>
    <p>
     hangars of the now useless dirigibles Z^{51~57}. The landing stage
    </p>
    <p>
     communicated directly by telephone with the adjutant's office, an
    </p>
    <p>
     enormous hall filled with maps, with which Von Helmuth's private room
    </p>
    <p>
     was connected. The adjutant himself, a worried-looking man with a bullet
    </p>
    <p>
     head and an iron-gray moustache, stood at a table in the centre of the
    </p>
    <p>
     hall addressing rapid-fire sentences to various persons who appeared in
    </p>
    <p>
     the doorway, saluted, and hurried off again. Several groups were
    </p>
    <p>
     gathered about the table and the adjutant carried on an interrupted
    </p>
    <p>
     conversation with all of them, pausing to read the telegrams and
    </p>
    <p>
     messages that shot out of the pneumatic tubes upon the table from the
    </p>
    <p>
     telegraph and telephone office on the floor below.
    </p>
    <p>
     An elderly man in rather shabby clothes entered, looking about
    </p>
    <p>
     helplessly through the thick lenses of his double spectacles, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     adjutant turned at once from the officers about him with an "Excuse me,
    </p>
    <p>
     gentlemen."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good afternoon, Professor von Schwenitz; the general is waiting for
    </p>
    <p>
     you," said he. "This way, please."
    </p>
    <p>
     He stalked across to the door of the inner office.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Professor von Schwenitz is here," he announced, and immediately
    </p>
    <p>
     returned to take up the thread of his conversation in the centre of the
    </p>
    <p>
     hall.
    </p>
    <p>
     The general turned gruffly to greet his visitor. "I have sent for you,
    </p>
    <p>
     Professor," said he, without removing his cigar, "in order that I may
    </p>
    <p>
     fully understand the method by which you say you have ascertained the
    </p>
    <p>
     place of origin of the wireless messages and electrical disturbances
    </p>
    <p>
     referred to in our communications of last week. This may be a serious
    </p>
    <p>
     matter. The accuracy of your information is of vital importance."
    </p>
    <p>
     The professor hesitated in embarrassment, and the general scowled.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well?" he demanded, biting off the chewed end of his cigar. "Well? This
    </p>
    <p>
     is not a lecture room. Time is short. Out with it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Your Excellency!" stammered the poor professor, "I--I----The
    </p>
    <p>
     observations are so--inadequate--one cannot determine----"
    </p>
    <p>
     "What?" roared Von Helmuth. "But you said you _had_!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Only approximately, your Excellency. One cannot be positive, but within
    </p>
    <p>
     a reasonable distance----" He paused.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What do you call a reasonable distance? I supposed your physics was an
    </p>
    <p>
     exact science!" retorted the general.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But the data----"
    </p>
    <p>
     "What do you call a reasonable distance?" bellowed the Imperial
    </p>
    <p>
     Commissioner.
    </p>
    <p>
     "A hundred kilometres!" suddenly shouted the overwrought professor,
    </p>
    <p>
     losing control of himself. "I won't be talked to this way, do you hear?
    </p>
    <p>
     I won't! How can a man think? I'm a member of the faculty of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Imperial University. I've been decorated twice--twice!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fiddlesticks!" returned the general, amused in spite of himself. "Don't
    </p>
    <p>
     be absurd. I merely wish you to hurry. Have a cigar?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, your Excellency!" protested the professor, now both ashamed and
    </p>
    <p>
     frightened. "You must excuse me. The war has shattered my nerves. May I
    </p>
    <p>
     smoke? Thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sit down. Take your time," said Von Helmuth, looking out and up at a
    </p>
    <p>
     monoplane descending toward the landing in slowly lessening spirals.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You see, your Excellency," explained Von Schwenitz, "the data are
    </p>
    <p>
     fragmentary, but I used three methods, each checking the others."
    </p>
    <p>
     "The first?" shot back the general. The monoplane had landed safely.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I compared the records of all the seismographs that had registered the
    </p>
    <p>
     earthquake wave attendant on the electrical discharges accompanying the
    </p>
    <p>
     great yellow auroras of July. These shocks had been felt all over the
    </p>
    <p>
     globe, and I secured reports from Java, New Guinea, Lima, Tucson,
    </p>
    <p>
     Greenwich, Algeria, and Moscow. These showed the wave had originated
    </p>
    <p>
     somewhere in Eastern Labrador."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, yes. Go on!" ordered the general.
    </p>
    <p>
     "In the second place, the violent magnetic storms produced by the helium
    </p>
    <p>
     aurora appear to have left their mark each time upon the earth in a
    </p>
    <p>
     permanent, if slight, deflection of the compass needle. The earth's
    </p>
    <p>
     normal magnetic field seems to have had superimposed upon it a new field
    </p>
    <p>
     comprised of lines of force nearly parallel to the equator. My
    </p>
    <p>
     computations show that these great circles of magnetism centre at
    </p>
    <p>
     approximately the same point in Labrador as that indicated by the
    </p>
    <p>
     seismographs--about fifty-five degrees north and seventy-five degrees
    </p>
    <p>
     west."
    </p>
    <p>
     The general seemed struck with this.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Permanent deflection, you say!" he ejaculated.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, apparently permanent. Finally the barometer records told the same
    </p>
    <p>
     story, although in less precise form. A compressional wave of air had
    </p>
    <p>
     been started in the far north and had spread out over the earth with the
    </p>
    <p>
     velocity of sound. Though the barographs themselves gave no indication
    </p>
    <p>
     whence this wave had come, the variation in its intensity at different
    </p>
    <p>
     meteorological observatories could be accounted for by the law of
    </p>
    <p>
     inverse squares on the supposition that the explosion which started the
    </p>
    <p>
     wave had occurred at fifty-five degrees north, seventy-five degrees
    </p>
    <p>
     west."
    </p>
    <p>
     The professor paused and wiped his glasses. With a roar a Taube slid off
    </p>
    <p>
     the landing stage, shot over toward the hangars, and soared upward.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is that all?" inquired the general, turning again to the chart.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That is all, your Excellency," answered Von Schwenitz.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Then you may go!" muttered the Imperial Commissioner. "If we find the
    </p>
    <p>
     source of these disturbances where you predict you will receive the
    </p>
    <p>
     Black Eagle."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, your Excellency!" protested the professor, his face shining with
    </p>
    <p>
     satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And if we do _not_ find it--there will be a vacancy on the faculty of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Imperial University!" he added grimly. "Good afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
     He pressed a button and the departing scholar was met by an orderly and
    </p>
    <p>
     escorted from the War Bureau, while the adjutant joined Von Helmuth.
    </p>
    <p>
     "He's got him! I'm satisfied!" remarked the Commissioner. "Now outline
    </p>
    <p>
     your plan."
    </p>
    <p>
     The bullet-headed man took up the calipers and indicated a spot on the
    </p>
    <p>
     coast of Labrador:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Our expedition will land, subject to your approval, at Hamilton Inlet,
    </p>
    <p>
     using the town of Rigolet as a base. By availing ourselves of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Nascopee River and the lakes through which it flows, we can easily
    </p>
    <p>
     penetrate to the highland where the inventor of the Ring machine has
    </p>
    <p>
     located himself. The auxiliary brigantine _Sea Fox_ is lying now under
    </p>
    <p>
     American colours at Amsterdam, and as she can steam fifteen knots an
    </p>
    <p>
     hour she should reach the Inlet in about ten days, passing to the north
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Orkneys."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What force have you in mind?" inquired Von Helmuth, his cold gray eyes
    </p>
    <p>
     narrowing.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Three full companies of sappers and miners, ten mountain howitzers, a
    </p>
    <p>
     field battery, fifty rapid-fire standing rifles, and a complete outfit
    </p>
    <p>
     for throwing lyddite. Of course we shall rely principally on high
    </p>
    <p>
     explosives if it becomes necessary to use force, but what we want is a
    </p>
    <p>
     hostage who may later become an ally."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, of course," said the general with a laugh. "This is a scientific,
    </p>
    <p>
     not a military, expedition."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I have asked Lieutenant Münster to report upon the necessary
    </p>
    <p>
     equipment."
    </p>
    <p>
     Von Helmuth nodded, and the adjutant stepped to the door and called out:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Lieutenant Münster!"
    </p>
    <p>
     A trim young man in naval uniform appeared upon the threshold and
    </p>
    <p>
     saluted.
    </p>
    <p>
     "State what you regard as necessary as equipment for the proposed
    </p>
    <p>
     expedition," said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Twenty motor boats, each capable of towing several flat-bottomed barges
    </p>
    <p>
     or native canoes, forty mules, a field telegraph, and also a
    </p>
    <p>
     high-powered wireless apparatus, axes, spades, wire cables and drums,
    </p>
    <p>
     windlasses, dynamite for blasting, and provisions for sixty days. We
    </p>
    <p>
     shall live off the country and secure artisans and bearers from among
    </p>
    <p>
     the natives."
    </p>
    <p>
     "When will it be possible to start?" inquired the general.
    </p>
    <p>
     "In twelve days if you give the order now," answered the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Very well, you may go. And good luck to you!" he added.
    </p>
    <p>
     The young lieutenant saluted and turned abruptly on his heel.
    </p>
    <p>
     Over the parade ground a biplane was hovering, darting this way and
    </p>
    <p>
     that, rising and falling with startling velocity.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Who's that?" inquired the general approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Schöningen," answered the adjutant.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Imperial Commissioner felt in his breast-pocket for another cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you know, Ludwig," he remarked amiably as he struck a meditative
    </p>
    <p>
     match, "sometimes I more than half believe this 'Flying Ring' business
    </p>
    <p>
     is all rot!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The adjutant looked pained.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And yet," continued Von Helmuth, "if Bismarck could see one of those
    </p>
    <p>
     things," he waved his cigar toward the gyrating aeroplane, "he wouldn't
    </p>
    <p>
     believe it."
    </p>
    <p>
     X
    </p>
    <p>
     All day the International Assembly of Scientists, officially known as
    </p>
    <p>
     Conference No. 2, had been sitting, but not progressing, in the large
    </p>
    <p>
     lecture hall of the Smithsonian Institution, which probably had never
    </p>
    <p>
     before seen so motley a gathering. Each nation had sent three
    </p>
    <p>
     representatives, two professional scientists, and a lay delegate, the
    </p>
    <p>
     latter some writer or thinker renowned in his own country for his wide
    </p>
    <p>
     knowledge and powers of ratiocination. They had come together upon the
    </p>
    <p>
     appointed day, although the delegates from the remoter countries had not
    </p>
    <p>
     yet arrived, and the Committee on Credentials had already reported.
    </p>
    <p>
     Germany had sent Gasgabelaus, Leybach, and Wilhelm Lamszus;
    </p>
    <p>
     France--Sortell, Amand, and Buona Varilla; Great Britain--Sir William
    </p>
    <p>
     Crookes, Sir Francis Soddy, and Mr. H. G. Wells, celebrated for his "The
    </p>
    <p>
     War of the Worlds" and The "World Set Free," and hence supposedly just
    </p>
    <p>
     the man to unravel a scientific mystery such as that which confronted
    </p>
    <p>
     this galaxy of immortals.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Committee on Data, of which Thornton was a member, having been
    </p>
    <p>
     actively at work for nearly two weeks through wireless communication
    </p>
    <p>
     with all the observatories--seismic, meteorological, astronomical, and
    </p>
    <p>
     otherwise--throughout the world, had reduced its findings to print, and
    </p>
    <p>
     this matter, translated into French, German, and Italian, had already
    </p>
    <p>
     been distributed among those present. Included in its pages was Quinn's
    </p>
    <p>
     letter to the State Department.
    </p>
    <p>
     The roll having been called, the president of the National Academy of
    </p>
    <p>
     Sciences made a short speech in which he outlined briefly the purpose
    </p>
    <p>
     for which the committee had been summoned and commented to some extent
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the character of the phenomena it was required to analyze.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then began an unending series of discussions and explanations in
    </p>
    <p>
     French, German, Dutch, Russian, and Italian, by goggle-eyed,
    </p>
    <p>
     bushy-whiskered, long-haired men who looked like anarchists or
    </p>
    <p>
     sociologists and apparently had never before had an unrestricted
    </p>
    <p>
     opportunity to air their views on anything.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thornton, listening to this hodgepodge of technicalities, was dismayed
    </p>
    <p>
     and distrustful. These men spoke a language evidently familiar to them,
    </p>
    <p>
     which he, although a professional scientist, found a meaningless jargon.
    </p>
    <p>
     The whole thing seemed unreal, had a purely theoretic or literary
    </p>
    <p>
     quality about it that made him question even their premises. In the
    </p>
    <p>
     tainted air of the council room, listening to these little pot-bellied
    </p>
    <p>
     _Professoren_ from Amsterdam and Münich, doubt assailed him, doubt even
    </p>
    <p>
     that the earth had changed its orbit, doubt even of his own established
    </p>
    <p>
     formulæ and tables. Weren't they all just talking through their hats?
    </p>
    <p>
     Wasn't it merely a game in which an elaborate system of equivalents gave
    </p>
    <p>
     a semblance of actuality to what in fact was nothing but mind-play? Even
    </p>
    <p>
     Wells, whose literary style he admired as one of the beauties as well as
    </p>
    <p>
     one of the wonders of the world, had been a disappointment. He had
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed singularly halting and unconvincing.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I wish I knew a practical man--I wish Bennie Hooker were here!"
    </p>
    <p>
     muttered Thornton to himself. He had not seen his classmate Hooker for
    </p>
    <p>
     twenty-six years; but that was one thing about Hooker: you knew he'd be
    </p>
    <p>
     exactly the same--only more so--as he was when you last saw him. In
    </p>
    <p>
     those years Bennie had become the Lawson Professor of Applied Physics at
    </p>
    <p>
     Harvard. Thornton had read his papers on induced radiation, thermic
    </p>
    <p>
     equilibrium, and had one of Bennie's famous Gem Home Cookers in his own
    </p>
    <p>
     little bachelor apartment. Hooker would know. And if he didn't he'd tell
    </p>
    <p>
     you so, without befogging the atmosphere with a lot of things he _did_
    </p>
    <p>
     know, but that wouldn't help you in the least. Thornton clutched at the
    </p>
    <p>
     thought of him like a falling aeronaut at a dangling rope. He'd be worth
    </p>
    <p>
     a thousand of these dreaming lecturers, these beer-drinking visionaries!
    </p>
    <p>
     But where could he be found? It was August, vacation time. Still, he
    </p>
    <p>
     might be in Cambridge giving a summer course or something.
    </p>
    <p>
     At that moment Professor Gasgabelaus, the temporary chairman, a huge
    </p>
    <p>
     man, the periphery of whose abdomen rivalled the circumference of the
    </p>
    <p>
     "working terrestrial globe" at the other end of the platform, pounded
    </p>
    <p>
     perspiringly with his gavel and announced that the conference would
    </p>
    <p>
     adjourn until the following Monday morning. It was Friday afternoon, so
    </p>
    <p>
     he had sixty hours in which to connect with Bennie, if Bennie could be
    </p>
    <p>
     discovered. A telegram of inquiry brought no response, and he took the
    </p>
    <p>
     midnight train to Boston, reaching Cambridge about two o'clock the
    </p>
    <p>
     following afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
     The air trembled with heat. Only by dodging from the shadow of one big
    </p>
    <p>
     elm to another did he manage to reach the Appian Way--the street given
    </p>
    <p>
     in the university catalogue as Bennie's habitat--alive. As he swung open
    </p>
    <p>
     the little wicket gate he realized with an odd feeling that it was the
    </p>
    <p>
     same house where Hooker had lived when a student, twenty-five years
    </p>
    <p>
     before.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Board" was printed on a yellow, fly-blown card in the corner of the
    </p>
    <p>
     window beside the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Up there over the porch was the room Bennie had inhabited from '85 to
    </p>
    <p>
     '89. He recalled vividly the night he, Thornton, had put his foot
    </p>
    <p>
     through the lower pane. They had filled up the hole with an old golf
    </p>
    <p>
     stocking. His eyes searched curiously for the pane. There it was, still
    </p>
    <p>
     broken and still stuffed--it couldn't be!--with some colourless material
    </p>
    <p>
     strangely resembling disintegrating worsted. The sun smote him in the
    </p>
    <p>
     back of his neck and drove him to seek the relief of the porch. Had he
    </p>
    <p>
     ever left Cambridge? Wasn't it a dream about his becoming an astronomer
    </p>
    <p>
     and working at the Naval Observatory? And all this stuff about the earth
    </p>
    <p>
     going on the loose? If he opened the door wouldn't he find Bennie with a
    </p>
    <p>
     towel round his head cramming for the "exams"? For a moment he really
    </p>
    <p>
     imagined that he was an undergraduate. Then as he fanned himself with
    </p>
    <p>
     his straw hat he caught, on the silk band across the interior, the
    </p>
    <p>
     words: "Smith's Famous Headwear, Washington, D.C." No, he was really an
    </p>
    <p>
     astronomer.
    </p>
    <p>
     He shuddered in spite of the heat as he pulled the bell knob. What
    </p>
    <p>
     ghosts would its jangle summon? The bell, however, gave no sound; in
    </p>
    <p>
     fact the knob came off in his hand, followed by a foot or so of copper
    </p>
    <p>
     wire. He laughed, gazing at it blankly. No one had ever used the bell in
    </p>
    <p>
     the old days. They had simply kicked open the door and halloed: "O-o-h,
    </p>
    <p>
     Bennie Hooker!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Thornton laid the knob on the piazza and inspected the front of the
    </p>
    <p>
     house. The windows were thick with dust, the "yard" scraggly with weeds.
    </p>
    <p>
     A piece of string held the latch of the gate together. Then
    </p>
    <p>
     automatically, and without intending to do so at all, Thornton turned
    </p>
    <p>
     the handle of the front door, assisting it coincidentally with a gentle
    </p>
    <p>
     kick from his right toe, and found himself in the narrow cabbage-scented
    </p>
    <p>
     hallway. The old, familiar, battered black-walnut hatrack of his student
    </p>
    <p>
     days leaned drunkenly against the wall--Thornton knew one of its back
    </p>
    <p>
     legs was missing--and on the imitation marble slab was a telegram
    </p>
    <p>
     addressed to "Professor Benjamin Hooker." And also, instinctively,
    </p>
    <p>
     Thornton lifted up his adult voice and yelled:
    </p>
    <p>
     "O-o-h, ye-ay! Bennie Hooker!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The volume of his own sound startled him. Instantly he saw the
    </p>
    <p>
     ridiculousness of it--he, the senior astronomer at the Naval
    </p>
    <p>
     Observatory, yelling like that----
    </p>
    <p>
     "O-o-h, ye-ay!" came in smothered tones from above.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thornton bounded up the stairs, two, three steps at a time, and pounded
    </p>
    <p>
     on the old door over the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Go away!" came back the voice of Bennie Hooker. "Don't want any lunch!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Thornton continued to bang on the door while Professor Hooker wrathfully
    </p>
    <p>
     besought the intruder to depart before he took active measures. There
    </p>
    <p>
     was the cracking of glass.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, damn!" came from inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thornton rattled the knob and kicked. Somebody haltingly crossed the
    </p>
    <p>
     room, the key turned, and Prof. Bennie Hooker opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well?" he demanded, scowling over his thick spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hello, Bennie!" said Thornton, holding out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hello, Buck!" returned Hooker. "Come in. I thought it was that
    </p>
    <p>
     confounded Ethiopian."
    </p>
    <p>
     As far as Thornton could see, it was the same old room, only now crammed
    </p>
    <p>
     with books and pamphlets and crowded with tables of instruments. Hooker,
    </p>
    <p>
     clad in sneakers, white ducks, and an undershirt, was smoking a small
    </p>
    <p>
     "T. D." pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where on earth did you come from?" he inquired good-naturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Washington," answered Thornton, and something told him that this was
    </p>
    <p>
     the real thing--the "goods"--that his journey would be repaid.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hooker waved the "T. D." in a general sort of way toward some
    </p>
    <p>
     broken-down horsehair armchairs and an empty crate.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sit down, won't you?" he said, as if he had seen his guest only the day
    </p>
    <p>
     before. He looked vaguely about for something that Thornton might smoke,
    </p>
    <p>
     then seated himself on a cluttered bench holding a number of retorts,
    </p>
    <p>
     beside which flamed an oxyacetylene blowpipe. He was a wizened little
    </p>
    <p>
     chap, with scrawny neck and protruding Adam's apple. His long hair gave
    </p>
    <p>
     no evidence of the use of the comb, and his hands were the hands of
    </p>
    <p>
     Esau. He had an alertness that suggested a robin, but at the same time
    </p>
    <p>
     gave the impression that he looked through things rather than at them.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the mantel was a saucer containing the fast oxidizing cores of
    </p>
    <p>
     several apples and a half-eaten box of oatmeal biscuits.
    </p>
    <p>
     "My Lord! This is an untidy hole! No more order than when you were an
    </p>
    <p>
     undergrad!" exclaimed Thornton, looking about him in amused horror.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Order?" returned Bennie indignantly. "Everything's in perfect order!
    </p>
    <p>
     This chair is filled with the letters I _have_ already answered; this
    </p>
    <p>
     chair with the letters I've _not_ answered; and this chair with the
    </p>
    <p>
     letters I shall _never_ answer!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Thornton took a seat on the crate, laughing. It was the same old Bennie!
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're an incorrigible!" he sighed despairingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, you're a star gazer, aren't you?" inquired Hooker, relighting his
    </p>
    <p>
     pipe. "Some one told me so--I forget who. You must have a lot of
    </p>
    <p>
     interesting problems. They tell me that new planet of yours is full of
    </p>
    <p>
     uranium."
    </p>
    <p>
     Thornton laughed. "You mustn't believe all that you read in the papers.
    </p>
    <p>
     What are you working at particularly?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, radium and thermic induction mostly," answered Hooker. "And when I
    </p>
    <p>
     want a rest I take a crack at the fourth dimension--spacial curvature's
    </p>
    <p>
     my hobby. But I'm always working at radio stuff. That's where the big
    </p>
    <p>
     things are going to be pulled off, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, of course," answered Thornton. He wondered if Hooker ever saw a
    </p>
    <p>
     paper, how long since he had been out of the house. "By the way, did you
    </p>
    <p>
     know Berlin had been taken?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Berlin--in Germany, you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, by the Russians."
    </p>
    <p>
     "No! Has it?" inquired Hooker with politeness. "Oh, I think some one did
    </p>
    <p>
     mention it."
    </p>
    <p>
     Thornton fumbled for a cigarette and Bennie handed him a match. They
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to have extraordinarily little to say for men who hadn't seen
    </p>
    <p>
     each other for twenty-six years.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I suppose," went on the astronomer, "you think it's deuced funny my
    </p>
    <p>
     dropping in casually this way after all this time, but the fact is I
    </p>
    <p>
     came on purpose. I want to get some information from you straight."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Go ahead!" said Bennie. "What's it about?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, in a word," answered Thornton, "the earth's nearly a quarter of
    </p>
    <p>
     an hour behind time."
    </p>
    <p>
     Hooker received this announcement with a polite interest but no
    </p>
    <p>
     astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's a how-de-do!" he remarked. "What's done it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's what I want you to tell _me_," said Thornton sternly. "What
    </p>
    <p>
     _could_ do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Hooker unlaced his legs and strolled over to the mantel.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have a cracker?" he asked, helping himself. Then he picked up a piece
    </p>
    <p>
     of wood and began whittling. "I suppose there's the devil to pay?" he
    </p>
    <p>
     suggested. "Things upset and so on? Atmospheric changes? When did it
    </p>
    <p>
     happen?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "About three weeks ago. Then there's this Sahara business."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What Sahara business?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Haven't you heard?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No," answered Hooker rather impatiently. "I haven't heard anything. I
    </p>
    <p>
     haven't any time to read the papers; I'm too busy. My thermic inductor
    </p>
    <p>
     transformers melted last week and I'm all in the air. What was it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, never mind now," said Thornton hurriedly, perceiving that Hooker's
    </p>
    <p>
     ignorance was an added asset. He'd get his science pure, uncontaminated
    </p>
    <p>
     by disturbing questions of fact. "How about the earth's losing that
    </p>
    <p>
     quarter of an hour?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of course she's off her orbit," remarked Hooker in a detached way. "And
    </p>
    <p>
     you want to know what's done it? Don't blame you. I suppose you've gone
    </p>
    <p>
     into the possibilities of stellar attraction."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Discount that!" ordered Thornton. "What I want to know is whether it
    </p>
    <p>
     could happen from the inside?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why not?" inquired Hooker. "A general shift in the mass would do it. So
    </p>
    <p>
     would the mere application of force at the proper point."
    </p>
    <p>
     "It never happened before."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of course not. Neither had seedless oranges until Burbank came along,"
    </p>
    <p>
     said Hooker.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you regard it as possible by any human agency?" inquired Thornton.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why not?" repeated Hooker. "All you need is the energy. And it's lying
    </p>
    <p>
     all round if you could only get at it. That's just what I'm working at
    </p>
    <p>
     now. Radium, uranium, thorium, actinium--all the radioactive
    </p>
    <p>
     elements--are, as everybody knows, continually disintegrating,
    </p>
    <p>
     discharging the enormous energy that is imprisoned in their molecules.
    </p>
    <p>
     It may take generations, epochs, centuries, for them to get rid of it
    </p>
    <p>
     and transform themselves into other substances, but they will inevitably
    </p>
    <p>
     do so eventually. They're doing with more or less of a rush what all the
    </p>
    <p>
     elements are doing at their leisure. A single ounce of uranium contains
    </p>
    <p>
     about the same amount of energy that could be produced by the combustion
    </p>
    <p>
     of ten tons of coal--but it won't let the energy go. Instead it holds on
    </p>
    <p>
     to it, and the energy leaks slowly, almost imperceptibly, away, like
    </p>
    <p>
     water from a big reservoir tapped only by a tiny pipe. 'Atomic energy'
    </p>
    <p>
     Rutherford calls it. Every element, every substance, has its ready to be
    </p>
    <p>
     touched off and put to use. The chap who can find out how to release
    </p>
    <p>
     that energy all at once will revolutionize the civilized world. It will
    </p>
    <p>
     be like the discovery that water could be turned into steam and made to
    </p>
    <p>
     work for us--multiplied a million times. If, instead of that energy just
    </p>
    <p>
     oozing away and the uranium disintegrating infinitesimally each year, it
    </p>
    <p>
     could be exploded at a given moment you could drive an ocean liner with
    </p>
    <p>
     a handful of it. You could make the old globe stagger round and turn
    </p>
    <p>
     upside down! Mankind could just lay off and take a holiday. But _how_?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Bennie enthusiastically waved his pipe at Thornton.
    </p>
    <p>
     "How! That's the question. Everybody's known about the possibilities,
    </p>
    <p>
     for Soddy wrote a book about it; but nobody's ever suggested where the
    </p>
    <p>
     key could be found to unlock that treasure-house of energy. Some chap
    </p>
    <p>
     made up a novel once and pretended it was done, but he didn't say _how_.
    </p>
    <p>
     But"--and he lowered his voice passionately--"I'm working at it,
    </p>
    <p>
     and--and--I've nearly--nearly got it."
    </p>
    <p>
     Thornton, infected by his friend's excitement, leaned forward in his
    </p>
    <p>
     chair.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes--nearly. If only my transformers hadn't melted! You see I got the
    </p>
    <p>
     idea from Savaroff, who noticed that the activity of radium and other
    </p>
    <p>
     elements wasn't constant, but varied with the degree of solar activity,
    </p>
    <p>
     reaching its maximum at the periods when the sun spots were most
    </p>
    <p>
     numerous. In other words, he's shown that the breakdown of the atoms of
    </p>
    <p>
     radium and the other radioactive elements isn't spontaneous, as Soddy
    </p>
    <p>
     and others had thought, but is due to the action of certain extremely
    </p>
    <p>
     penetrating rays given out by the sun. These particular rays are the
    </p>
    <p>
     result of the enormous temperature of the solar atmosphere, and their
    </p>
    <p>
     effect upon radioactive substances is analogous to that of the
    </p>
    <p>
     detonating cap upon dynamite. No one has been able to produce these rays
    </p>
    <p>
     in the laboratory, although Hempel has suspected sometimes that traces
    </p>
    <p>
     of them appeared in the radiations from powerful electric sparks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everything came to a halt until Hiroshito discovered thermic induction,
    </p>
    <p>
     and we were able to elevate temperature almost indefinitely through a
    </p>
    <p>
     process similar to the induction of high electric potentials by means of
    </p>
    <p>
     transformers and the Ruhmkorff coil.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hiroshito wasn't looking for a detonating ray and didn't have time to
    </p>
    <p>
     bother with it, but I started a series of experiments with that end in
    </p>
    <p>
     view. I got close--I am close, but the trouble has been to control the
    </p>
    <p>
     forces set in motion, for the rapid rise in temperature has always
    </p>
    <p>
     destroyed the apparatus."
    </p>
    <p>
     Thornton whistled. "And when you succeed?" he asked in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hooker's face was transfigured.
    </p>
    <p>
     "When I succeed I shall control the world," he cried, and his voice
    </p>
    <p>
     trembled. "But the damn thing either melts or explodes," he added with a
    </p>
    <p>
     tinge of indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You know about Hiroshito's experiments, of course; he used a quartz
    </p>
    <p>
     bulb containing a mixture of neon gas and the vapour of mercury, placed
    </p>
    <p>
     at the centre of a coil of silver wire carrying a big oscillatory
    </p>
    <p>
     current. This induced a ring discharge in the bulb, and the temperature
    </p>
    <p>
     of the vapour mixture rose until the bulb melted. He calculated that the
    </p>
    <p>
     temperature of that part of the vapour which carried the current was
    </p>
    <p>
     over 6,000°. You see, the ring discharge is not in contact with the wall
    </p>
    <p>
     of the bulb, and can consequently be much hotter. It's like this." Here
    </p>
    <p>
     Bennie drew with a burnt match on the back of an envelope a diagram of
    </p>
    <p>
     something which resembled a doughnut in a chianti flask.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thornton scratched his head. "Yes," he said, "but that's an old
    </p>
    <p>
     principle, isn't it? Why does Hiro--what's his name--call it--thermic
    </p>
    <p>
     induction?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oriental imagination, probably," replied Bennie. "Hiroshito observed
    </p>
    <p>
     that a sudden increase in the temperature of the discharge occurred at
    </p>
    <p>
     the moment when the silver coil of his transformer became white hot,
    </p>
    <p>
     which he explained by some mysterious inductive action of the heat
    </p>
    <p>
     vibrations. I don't follow him at all. His theory's probably all wrong,
    </p>
    <p>
     but he delivered the goods. He gave me the right tip, even if I have got
    </p>
    <p>
     him lashed to the mast now. I use a tungsten spiral in a nitrogen
    </p>
    <p>
     atmosphere in my transformer and replace the quartz bulb with a capsule
    </p>
    <p>
     of zircorundum."
    </p>
    <p>
     "A capsule of what?" asked Thornton, whose chemistry was mid-Victorian.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Zircorundum," said Bennie, groping around in a drawer of his work
    </p>
    <p>
     table. "It's an absolute nonconductor of heat. Look here, just stick
    </p>
    <p>
     your finger in that." He held out to Thornton what appeared to be a
    </p>
    <p>
     small test tube of black glass. Thornton, with a slight moral
    </p>
    <p>
     hesitation, did as he was told, and Bennie, whistling, picked up the
    </p>
    <p>
     oxyacetylene blowpipe, regarding it somewhat as a dog fancier might gaze
    </p>
    <p>
     at an exceptionally fine pup. "Hold up your finger," said he to the
    </p>
    <p>
     astronomer. "That's right--like that!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Thrusting the blowpipe forward, he allowed the hissing blue-white flame
    </p>
    <p>
     to wrap itself round the outer wall of the tube--a flame which Thornton
    </p>
    <p>
     knew could melt its way through a block of steel--but the astronomer
    </p>
    <p>
     felt no sensation of heat, although he not unnaturally expected the
    </p>
    <p>
     member to be incinerated.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Queer, eh?" said Bennie. "Absolute insulation! Beats the thermos
    </p>
    <p>
     bottle, and requires no vacuum. It isn't quite what I want though,
    </p>
    <p>
     because the disintegrating rays which the ring discharge gives out break
    </p>
    <p>
     down the zirconium, which isn't an end-product of radioactivity. The
    </p>
    <p>
     pressure in the capsule rises, due to the liberation of helium, and it
    </p>
    <p>
     blows up, and the landlady or the police come up and bother me."
    </p>
    <p>
     Thornton was scrutinizing Bennie's rough diagram. "This ring discharge,"
    </p>
    <p>
     he meditated; "I wonder if it isn't something like a sunspot. You know
    </p>
    <p>
     the spots are electron vortices with strong magnetic fields. I'll bet
    </p>
    <p>
     you the Savaroff disintegrating rays come from the spots and not from
    </p>
    <p>
     the whole surface of the sun!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "My word," said Bennie, with a grin of delight, "you occasionally have
    </p>
    <p>
     an illuminating idea, even if you are a musty astronomer. I always
    </p>
    <p>
     thought you were a sort of calculating machine, who slept on a logarithm
    </p>
    <p>
     table. I owe you two drinks for that suggestion, and to scare a thirst
    </p>
    <p>
     into you I'll show you an experiment that no living human being has ever
    </p>
    <p>
     seen before. I can't make very powerful disintegrating rays yet, but I
    </p>
    <p>
     can break down uranium, which is the easiest of all. Later on I'll be
    </p>
    <p>
     able to disintegrate anything, if I have luck--that is, anything except
    </p>
    <p>
     end-products. Then you'll see things fly. But, for the present, just
    </p>
    <p>
     this." He picked up a thin plate of white metal. "This is the metal
    </p>
    <p>
     we're going to attack, uranium--the parent of radium--and the whole
    </p>
    <p>
     radioactive series, ending with the end-product lead."
    </p>
    <p>
     He hung the plate by two fine wires fastened to its corners, and
    </p>
    <p>
     adjusted a coil of wire opposite its centre, while within the coil he
    </p>
    <p>
     slipped a small black capsule.
    </p>
    <p>
     "This is the best we can do now," he said. "The capsule is made of
    </p>
    <p>
     zircorundum, and we shall get only a trace of the disintegrating rays
    </p>
    <p>
     before it blows up. But you'll see 'em, or, rather, you'll see the
    </p>
    <p>
     lavender phosphorescence of the air through which they pass."
    </p>
    <p>
     He arranged a thick slab of plate glass between Thornton and the thermic
    </p>
    <p>
     transformer, and stepping to the wall closed a switch. An oscillatory
    </p>
    <p>
     spark discharge started off with a roar in a closed box, and the coil of
    </p>
    <p>
     wire became white hot.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Watch the plate!" shouted Bennie.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Thornton watched.
    </p>
    <p>
     For ten or fifteen seconds nothing happened, and then a faint beam of
    </p>
    <p>
     pale lavender light shot out from the capsule, and the metal plate swung
    </p>
    <p>
     away from the incandescent coil as if blown by a gentle breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
     Almost instantly there was a loud report and a blinding flash of yellow
    </p>
    <p>
     light so brilliant that for the next instant or two to Thornton's eyes
    </p>
    <p>
     the room seemed dark. Slowly the afternoon light regained its normal
    </p>
    <p>
     quality. Bennie relit his pipe unconcernedly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's the germ of the idea," he said between puffs. "That capsule
    </p>
    <p>
     contains a mixture of vapours that give out disintegrating rays when the
    </p>
    <p>
     temperature is raised by thermic induction above six thousand. Most of
    </p>
    <p>
     'em are stopped by the zirconium atoms in the capsule, which break down
    </p>
    <p>
     and liberate helium; and the temperature rises in the capsule until it
    </p>
    <p>
     explodes, as you saw just now, with a flash of yellow helium light. The
    </p>
    <p>
     rays that get out strike the uranium plate and cause the surface layer
    </p>
    <p>
     of molecules to disintegrate, their products being driven off by the
    </p>
    <p>
     atomic explosions with a velocity about equal to that of light, and it's
    </p>
    <p>
     the recoil that deflects and swings the plate. The amount of uranium
    </p>
    <p>
     decomposed in this experiment couldn't be detected by the most delicate
    </p>
    <p>
     balance--small mass, but enormous velocity. See?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, I understand," answered Thornton. "It's the old, 'momentum equals
    </p>
    <p>
     mass times velocity,' business we had in mechanics."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of course this is only a toy experiment," Bennie continued. "It is what
    </p>
    <p>
     the dancing pithballs of Franklin's time were to the multipolar,
    </p>
    <p>
     high-frequency dynamo. But if we could control this force and handle it
    </p>
    <p>
     on a large scale we could do anything with it--destroy the world, drive
    </p>
    <p>
     a car against gravity off into space, shift the axis of the earth
    </p>
    <p>
     perhaps!"
    </p>
    <p>
     It came to Thornton as he sat there, cigarette in hand, that poor Bennie
    </p>
    <p>
     Hooker was going to receive the disappointment of his life. Within the
    </p>
    <p>
     next five minutes his dreams would be dashed to earth, for he would
    </p>
    <p>
     learn that another had stepped down to the pool of discovery before him.
    </p>
    <p>
     For how many years, he wondered, had Bennie toiled to produce his
    </p>
    <p>
     mysterious ray that should break down the atom and release the store of
    </p>
    <p>
     energy that the genii of Nature had concealed there. And now Thornton
    </p>
    <p>
     must tell him that all his efforts had gone for nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
     "And you believe that any one who could generate a ray such as you
    </p>
    <p>
     describe could control the motion of the earth?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of course, certainly," answered Hooker. "He could either disintegrate
    </p>
    <p>
     such huge quantities of matter that the mass of the earth would be
    </p>
    <p>
     shifted and its polar axis be changed, or if radioactive
    </p>
    <p>
     substances--pitchblende, for example--lay exposed upon the earth's
    </p>
    <p>
     surface he could cause them to discharge their helium and other products
    </p>
    <p>
     at such an enormous velocity that the recoil or reaction would
    </p>
    <p>
     accelerate or retard the motion of the globe. It would be quite
    </p>
    <p>
     feasible, quite simple--all one would need would be the disintegrating
    </p>
    <p>
     ray."
    </p>
    <p>
     And then Thornton told Hooker of the flight of the giant Ring machine
    </p>
    <p>
     from the north and the destruction of the Mountains of Atlas through the
    </p>
    <p>
     apparent instrumentality of a ray of lavender light. Hooker's face
    </p>
    <p>
     turned slightly pale and his unshaven mouth tightened. Then a smile of
    </p>
    <p>
     exaltation illuminated his features.
    </p>
    <p>
     "He's done it!" he cried joyously. "He's done it on an engineering
    </p>
    <p>
     scale. We pure-science dreamers turn up our noses at the engineers, but
    </p>
    <p>
     I tell you the improvements in the apparatus part of the game come when
    </p>
    <p>
     there is a big commercial demand for a thing and the engineering chaps
    </p>
    <p>
     take hold of it. But _who_ is he and _where_ is he? I must get to him. I
    </p>
    <p>
     don't suppose I can teach him much, but I've got a magnificent
    </p>
    <p>
     experiment that we can try together."
    </p>
    <p>
     He turned to a littered writing-table and poked among the papers that
    </p>
    <p>
     lay there.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You see," he explained excitedly, "if there is anything in the quantum
    </p>
    <p>
     theory----Oh! but you don't care about that. The point is where _is_ the
    </p>
    <p>
     chap?"
    </p>
    <p>
     And so Thornton had to begin at the beginning and tell Hooker all about
    </p>
    <p>
     the mysterious messages and the phenomena that accompanied them. He
    </p>
    <p>
     enlarged upon Pax's benignant intentions and the great problems
    </p>
    <p>
     presented by the proposed interference of the United States Government
    </p>
    <p>
     in Continental affairs, but Bennie swept them aside. The great thing, to
    </p>
    <p>
     his mind, was to find and get into communication with Pax.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ah! How he must feel! The greatest achievement of all time!" cried
    </p>
    <p>
     Hooker radiantly. "How ecstatically happy! Earth blossoming like the
    </p>
    <p>
     rose! Well-watered valleys where deserts were before. War abolished,
    </p>
    <p>
     poverty, disease! Who can it be? Curie? No; she's bottled in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
     Posky, Langham, Varanelli--it can't be any one of those fellows. It
    </p>
    <p>
     beats me! Some Hindoo or Jap maybe, but never Hiroshito! Now we must get
    </p>
    <p>
     to him right away. So much to talk over." He walked round the room,
    </p>
    <p>
     blundering into things, dizzy with the thought that his great dream had
    </p>
    <p>
     come true. Suddenly he swept everything off the table on to the floor
    </p>
    <p>
     and kicked his heels in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hooray!" he shouted, dancing round the room like a freshman. "Hooray!
    </p>
    <p>
     Now I can take a holiday. And come to think of it, I'm as hungry as a
    </p>
    <p>
     brontosaurus!"
    </p>
    <p>
     That night Thornton returned to Washington and was at the White House by
    </p>
    <p>
     nine o'clock the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's all straight," he told the President. "The honestest man in the
    </p>
    <p>
     United States has said so."
    </p>
    <p>
     XI
    </p>
    <p>
     The moon rose over sleeping Paris, silvering the silent reaches of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Seine, flooding the deserted streets with mellow light, yet gently
    </p>
    <p>
     retouching all the disfigurements of the siege. No lights illuminated
    </p>
    <p>
     the cafés, no taxis dashed along the boulevards, no crowds loitered in
    </p>
    <p>
     the Place de l'Opéra or the Place Vendôme. Yet save for these facts it
    </p>
    <p>
     might have been the Paris of old time, unvisited by hunger, misery, or
    </p>
    <p>
     death. The curfew had sounded. Every citizen had long since gone within,
    </p>
    <p>
     extinguished his lights, and locked his door. Safe in the knowledge that
    </p>
    <p>
     the Germans' second advance had been finally met and effectually blocked
    </p>
    <p>
     sixty miles outside the walls, and that an armistice had been declared
    </p>
    <p>
     to go into effect at midnight, Paris slumbered peacefully.
    </p>
    <p>
     Beyond the pellet-strewn fields and glacis of the second line of defence
    </p>
    <p>
     the invader, after a series of terrific onslaughts, had paused,
    </p>
    <p>
     retreated a few miles and intrenched himself, there to wait until the
    </p>
    <p>
     starving city should capitulate. For four months he had waited, yet
    </p>
    <p>
     Paris gave no sign of surrendering. On the contrary, it seemed to have
    </p>
    <p>
     some mysterious means of self-support, and the war office, in daily
    </p>
    <p>
     communication with London, reported that it could withstand the
    </p>
    <p>
     investment for an indefinite period. Meantime the Germans reintrenched
    </p>
    <p>
     themselves, built forts of their own upon which they mounted the siege
    </p>
    <p>
     guns intended for the walls, and constructed an impregnable line of
    </p>
    <p>
     entanglements, redoubts, and defences, which rendered it impossible for
    </p>
    <p>
     any army outside the city to come to its relief.
    </p>
    <p>
     So rose the moon, turning white the millions of slate roofs, gilding the
    </p>
    <p>
     traceries of the towers of Notre Dame, dimming the searchlights which,
    </p>
    <p>
     like the antennæ of gigantic fireflies, constantly played round the city
    </p>
    <p>
     from the summit of the Eiffel Tower. So slept Paris, confident that no
    </p>
    <p>
     crash of descending bombs would shatter the blue vault of the starlit
    </p>
    <p>
     sky or rend the habitations in which lay two millions of human beings,
    </p>
    <p>
     assured that the sun would rise through the gray mists of the Seine upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the ancient beauties of the Tuilleries and the Louvre unmarred by the
    </p>
    <p>
     enemy's projectiles, and that its citizens could pass freely along its
    </p>
    <p>
     boulevards without menace of death from flying missiles. For no shell
    </p>
    <p>
     could be hurled a distance of sixty miles, and an armistice had been
    </p>
    <p>
     declared.
    </p>
    <p>
     *       *       *       *       *
    </p>
    <p>
     Behind a small hill within the German fortifications a group of officers
    </p>
    <p>
     stood in the moonlight, examining what looked superficially like the
    </p>
    <p>
     hangar of a small dirigible. Nestling behind the hill it cast a black
    </p>
    <p>
     rectangular shadow upon the trampled sand of the redoubt. A score of
    </p>
    <p>
     artisans were busy filling a deep trench through which a huge pipe led
    </p>
    <p>
     off somewhere--a sort of deadly plumbing, for the house sheltered a
    </p>
    <p>
     monster cannon reënforced by jackets of lead and steel, the whole
    </p>
    <p>
     encased in a cooling apparatus of intricate manufacture. From the open
    </p>
    <p>
     end of the house the cylindrical barrel of the gigantic engine of war
    </p>
    <p>
     raised itself into the air at an angle of forty degrees, and from the
    </p>
    <p>
     muzzle to the ground below it was a drop of over eighty feet. On a track
    </p>
    <p>
     running off to the north rested the projectiles side by side, resembling
    </p>
    <p>
     in the dim light a row of steam boilers in the yard of a locomotive
    </p>
    <p>
     factory.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well," remarked one of the officers, turning to the only one of his
    </p>
    <p>
     companions not in uniform. "'Thanatos' is ready."
    </p>
    <p>
     The man addressed was Von Heckmann, the most famous inventor of military
    </p>
    <p>
     ordnance in the world, already four times decorated for his services to
    </p>
    <p>
     the Emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The labour of nine years!" he answered with emotion. "Nine long years
    </p>
    <p>
     of self-denial and unremitting study! But to-night I shall be repaid,
    </p>
    <p>
     repaid a thousand times."
    </p>
    <p>
     The officers shook hands with him one after the other, and the group
    </p>
    <p>
     broke up; the men who were filling the trench completed their labours
    </p>
    <p>
     and departed; and Von Heckmann and the major-general of artillery alone
    </p>
    <p>
     remained, except for the sentries beside the gun. The night was balmy
    </p>
    <p>
     and the moon rode in a cloudless sky high above the hill. They crossed
    </p>
    <p>
     the enclosure, followed by the two sentinels, and entering a passage
    </p>
    <p>
     reached the outer wall of the redoubt, which was in turn closed and
    </p>
    <p>
     locked. Here the sentries remained, but Von Heckmann and the general
    </p>
    <p>
     continued on behind the fortifications for some distance.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, shall we start the ball?" asked the general, laying his hand on
    </p>
    <p>
     Von Heckmann's shoulder. But the inventor found it so hard to master his
    </p>
    <p>
     emotion that he could only nod his head. Yet the ball to which the
    </p>
    <p>
     general alluded was the discharging of a fiendish war machine toward an
    </p>
    <p>
     unsuspecting and harmless city alive with sleeping people, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     emotion of the inventor was due to the fact that he had devised and
    </p>
    <p>
     completed the most atrocious engine of death ever conceived by the mind
    </p>
    <p>
     of man--the Relay Gun. Horrible as is the thought, this otherwise normal
    </p>
    <p>
     man had devoted nine whole years to the problem of how to destroy human
    </p>
    <p>
     life at a distance of a hundred kilometres, and at last he had been
    </p>
    <p>
     successful, and an emperor had placed with his own divinely appointed
    </p>
    <p>
     hands a ribbon over the spot beneath which his heart should have been.
    </p>
    <p>
     The projectile of this diabolical invention was ninety-five centimetres
    </p>
    <p>
     in diameter, and was itself a rifled mortar, which in full flight,
    </p>
    <p>
     twenty miles from the gun and at the top of its trajectory, exploded in
    </p>
    <p>
     mid-air, hurling forward its contained projectile with an additional
    </p>
    <p>
     velocity of three thousand feet per second. This process repeated
    </p>
    <p>
     itself, the final or core bomb, weighing over three hundred pounds and
    </p>
    <p>
     filled with lyddite, reaching its mark one minute and thirty-five
    </p>
    <p>
     seconds after the firing of the gun. This crowning example of the human
    </p>
    <p>
     mind's destructive ingenuity had cost the German Government five million
    </p>
    <p>
     marks and had required three years for its construction, and by no means
    </p>
    <p>
     the least of its devilish capacities was that of automatically reloading
    </p>
    <p>
     and firing itself at the interval of every ten seconds, its muzzle
    </p>
    <p>
     rising, falling, or veering slightly from side to side with each
    </p>
    <p>
     discharge, thus causing the shells to fall at wide distances. The
    </p>
    <p>
     poisonous nature of the immense volumes of gas poured out by the
    </p>
    <p>
     mastodon when in action necessitated the withdrawal of its crew to a
    </p>
    <p>
     safe distance. But once set in motion it needed no attendant. It had
    </p>
    <p>
     been tested by a preliminary shot the day before, which had been
    </p>
    <p>
     directed to a point several miles outside the walls of Paris, the effect
    </p>
    <p>
     of which had been observed and reported by high-flying German aeroplanes
    </p>
    <p>
     equipped with wireless. Everything was ready for the holocaust.
    </p>
    <p>
     Von Heckmann and the general of artillery continued to make their way
    </p>
    <p>
     through the intrenchments and other fortifications, until at a distance
    </p>
    <p>
     of about a quarter of a mile from the redoubt where they had left the
    </p>
    <p>
     Relay Gun they arrived at a small whitewashed cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I have invited a few of my staff to join us," said the general to the
    </p>
    <p>
     inventor, "in order that they may in years to come describe to their
    </p>
    <p>
     children and their grandchildren this, the most momentous occasion in
    </p>
    <p>
     the history of warfare."
    </p>
    <p>
     They turned the corner of the cottage and came upon a group of officers
    </p>
    <p>
     standing by the wooden gate of the cottage, all of whom saluted at their
    </p>
    <p>
     approach.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good evening, gentlemen," said the general. "I beg to present the
    </p>
    <p>
     members of my staff," turning to Von Heckmann.
    </p>
    <p>
     The officers stood back while the general led the way into the cottage,
    </p>
    <p>
     the lower floor of which consisted of but a single room, used by the
    </p>
    <p>
     recent tenants as a kitchen, dining-room, and living-room. At one end of
    </p>
    <p>
     a long table, constructed by the regimental carpenter, supper had been
    </p>
    <p>
     laid, and a tub filled with ice contained a dozen or more quarts of
    </p>
    <p>
     champagne. Two orderlies stood behind the table, at the other end of
    </p>
    <p>
     which was affixed a small brass switch connected with the redoubt and
    </p>
    <p>
     controlled by a spring and button. The windows of the cottage were open,
    </p>
    <p>
     and through them poured the light of the full moon, dimming the
    </p>
    <p>
     flickering light of the candles upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     In spite of the champagne, the supper, and the boxes of cigars and
    </p>
    <p>
     cigarettes, an atmosphere of solemnity was distinctly perceptible. It
    </p>
    <p>
     was as if each one of these officers, hardened to human suffering by a
    </p>
    <p>
     lifetime of discipline and active service, to say nothing of the years
    </p>
    <p>
     of horror through which they had just passed, could not but feel that in
    </p>
    <p>
     the last analysis the hurling upon an unsuspecting city of a rain of
    </p>
    <p>
     projectiles containing the highest explosive known to warfare, at a
    </p>
    <p>
     distance three times greater than that heretofore supposed to be
    </p>
    <p>
     possible to science, and the ensuing annihilation of its inhabitants,
    </p>
    <p>
     was something less for congratulation and applause than for sorrow and
    </p>
    <p>
     regret. The officers, who had joked each other outside the gate, became
    </p>
    <p>
     singularly quiet as they entered the cottage and gathered round the
    </p>
    <p>
     table where Von Heckmann and the general had taken their stand by the
    </p>
    <p>
     instrument. Utter silence fell upon the group. The mercury of their
    </p>
    <p>
     spirits dropped from summer heat to below freezing. What was this thing
    </p>
    <p>
     which they were about to do?
    </p>
    <p>
     Through the windows, at a distance of four hundred yards, the pounding
    </p>
    <p>
     of the machinery which flooded the water jacket of the Relay Gun was
    </p>
    <p>
     distinctly audible in the stillness of the night. The pressure of a
    </p>
    <p>
     finger--a little finger--upon that electric button was all that was
    </p>
    <p>
     necessary to start the torrent of iron and high explosives toward Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time the first shell would reach its mark nine more would be on
    </p>
    <p>
     their way, stretched across the midnight sky at intervals of less than
    </p>
    <p>
     eight miles. And once started the stream would continue uninterrupted
    </p>
    <p>
     for two hours. The fascinated eyes of all the officers fastened
    </p>
    <p>
     themselves upon the key. None spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, well, gentlemen!" exclaimed the general brusquely, "what is the
    </p>
    <p>
     matter with you? You act as if you were at a funeral! Hans," turning to
    </p>
    <p>
     the orderly, "open the champagne there. Fill the glasses. Bumpers all,
    </p>
    <p>
     gentlemen, for the greatest inventor of all times, Herr von Heckmann,
    </p>
    <p>
     the inventor of the Relay Gun!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The orderly sprang forward and hastily commenced uncorking bottles,
    </p>
    <p>
     while Von Heckmann turned away to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Here, this won't do, Schelling! You must liven things up a bit!"
    </p>
    <p>
     continued the general to one of the officers. "This is a great occasion
    </p>
    <p>
     for all of us! Give me that bottle." He seized a magnum of champagne
    </p>
    <p>
     from the orderly and commenced pouring out the foaming liquid into the
    </p>
    <p>
     glasses beside the plates. Schelling made a feeble attempt at a joke at
    </p>
    <p>
     which the officers laughed loudly, for the general was a martinet and
    </p>
    <p>
     had to be humoured.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now, then," called out the general as he glanced toward the window,
    </p>
    <p>
     "Herr von Heckmann, we are going to drink your health! Officers of the
    </p>
    <p>
     First Artillery, I give you a toast--a toast which you will all remember
    </p>
    <p>
     to your dying day! Bumpers, gentlemen! No heel taps! I give you the
    </p>
    <p>
     health of 'Thanatos'--the leviathan of artillery, the winged bearer of
    </p>
    <p>
     death and destruction--and of its inventor, Herr von Heckmann. Bumpers,
    </p>
    <p>
     gentlemen!" The general slapped Von Heckmann upon the shoulder and
    </p>
    <p>
     drained his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Thanatos!' Von Heckmann!" shouted the officers. And with one accord
    </p>
    <p>
     they dashed their goblets to the stone flagging upon which they stood.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And now, my dear inventor," said the general, "to you belongs the
    </p>
    <p>
     honour of arousing 'Thanatos' into activity. Are you ready, gentlemen? I
    </p>
    <p>
     warn you that when 'Thanatos' snores the rafters will ring."
    </p>
    <p>
     Von Heckmann had stood with bowed head while the officers had drunk his
    </p>
    <p>
     health, and he now hesitatingly turned toward the little brass switch
    </p>
    <p>
     with its button of black rubber that glistened so innocently in the
    </p>
    <p>
     candlelight. His right hand trembled. He dashed the back of his left
    </p>
    <p>
     across his eyes. The general took out a large silver watch from his
    </p>
    <p>
     pocket. "Fifty-nine minutes past eleven," he announced. "At one minute
    </p>
    <p>
     past twelve Paris will be disembowelled. Put your finger on the button,
    </p>
    <p>
     my friend. Let us start the ball rolling."
    </p>
    <p>
     Von Heckmann cast a glance almost of disquietude upon the faces of the
    </p>
    <p>
     officers who were leaning over the table in the intensity of their
    </p>
    <p>
     excitement. His elation, his exaltation, had passed from him. He seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     overwhelmed at the momentousness of the act which he was about to
    </p>
    <p>
     perform. Slowly his index finger crept toward the button and hovered
    </p>
    <p>
     half suspended over it. He pressed his lips together and was about to
    </p>
    <p>
     exert the pressure required to transmit the current of electricity to
    </p>
    <p>
     the discharging apparatus when unexpectedly there echoed through the
    </p>
    <p>
     night the sharp click of a horse's hoofs coming at a gallop down the
    </p>
    <p>
     village street. The group turned expectantly to the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
     An officer dressed in the uniform of an aide-de-camp of artillery
    </p>
    <p>
     entered abruptly, saluted, and produced from the inside pocket of his
    </p>
    <p>
     jacket a sealed envelope which he handed to the general. The interest of
    </p>
    <p>
     the officers suddenly centred upon the contents of the envelope. The
    </p>
    <p>
     general grumbled an oath at the interruption, tore open the missive, and
    </p>
    <p>
     held the single sheet which it contained to the candlelight.
    </p>
    <p>
     "An armistice!" he cried disgustedly. His eye glanced rapidly over the
    </p>
    <p>
     page.
    </p>
    <p>
     "_To the Major-General commanding the First Division of Artillery,
    </p>
    <p>
     Army of the Meuse:_
    </p>
    <p>
     "An armistice has been declared, to commence at midnight, pending
    </p>
    <p>
     negotiations for peace. You will see that no acts of hostility
    </p>
    <p>
     occur until you receive notice that war is to be resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "VON HELMUTH,
    </p>
    <p>
     "Imperial Commissioner for War."
    </p>
    <p>
     The officers broke into exclamations of impatience as the general
    </p>
    <p>
     crumpled the missive in his hand and cast it upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     "_Donnerwetter!_" he shouted. "Why were we so slow? Curse the
    </p>
    <p>
     armistice!" He glanced at his watch. It already pointed to after
    </p>
    <p>
     midnight. His face turned red and the veins in his forehead swelled.
    </p>
    <p>
     "To hell with peace!" he bellowed, turning back his watch until the
    </p>
    <p>
     minute hand pointed to five minutes to twelve. "To hell with peace, I
    </p>
    <p>
     say! Press the button, Von Heckmann!"
    </p>
    <p>
     But in spite of the agony of disappointment which he now acutely
    </p>
    <p>
     experienced, Von Heckmann did not fire. Sixty years of German respect
    </p>
    <p>
     for orders held him in a viselike grip and paralyzed his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I can't," he muttered. "I can't."
    </p>
    <p>
     The general seemed to have gone mad. Thrusting Von Heckmann out of the
    </p>
    <p>
     way, he threw himself into a chair at the end of the table and with a
    </p>
    <p>
     snarl pressed the black handle of the key.
    </p>
    <p>
     The officers gasped. Hardened as they were to the necessities of war, no
    </p>
    <p>
     act of insubordination like the present had ever occurred within their
    </p>
    <p>
     experience. Yet they must all uphold the general; they must all swear
    </p>
    <p>
     that the gun was fired before midnight. The key clicked and a blue bead
    </p>
    <p>
     snapped at the switch. They held their breaths, looking through the
    </p>
    <p>
     window to the west.
    </p>
    <p>
     At first the night remained still. Only the chirp of the crickets and
    </p>
    <p>
     the fretting of the aide-de-camp's horse outside the cottage could be
    </p>
    <p>
     heard. Then, like the grating of a coffee mill in a distant kitchen when
    </p>
    <p>
     one is just waking out of a sound sleep, they heard the faint, smothered
    </p>
    <p>
     whir of machinery, a sharper metallic ring of steel against steel
    </p>
    <p>
     followed by a gigantic detonation which shook the ground upon which the
    </p>
    <p>
     cottage stood and overthrew every glass upon the table. With a roar like
    </p>
    <p>
     the fall of a skyscraper the first shell hurled itself into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Half terrified the officers gripped their chairs, waiting for the second
    </p>
    <p>
     discharge. The reverberation was still echoing among the hills when the
    </p>
    <p>
     second detonation occurred, shortly followed by the third and fourth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, in intervals between the crashing explosions, a distant rumbling
    </p>
    <p>
     growl, followed by a shuddering of the air, as if the night were
    </p>
    <p>
     frightened, came up out of the west toward Paris, showing that the
    </p>
    <p>
     projectiles were at the top of their flight and going into action. A
    </p>
    <p>
     lake of yellow smoke formed in the pocket behind the hill where lay the
    </p>
    <p>
     redoubt in which "Thanatos" was snoring.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the great race track of Longchamps, in the Bois de Boulogne, the vast
    </p>
    <p>
     herd of cows, sheep, horses, and goats, collected together by the city
    </p>
    <p>
     government of Paris and attended by fifty or sixty shepherds especially
    </p>
    <p>
     imported from _les Landes_, had long since ceased to browse and had
    </p>
    <p>
     settled themselves down into the profound slumber of the animal world,
    </p>
    <p>
     broken only by an occasional bleating or the restless whinnying of a
    </p>
    <p>
     stallion. On the race course proper, in front of the grandstand and
    </p>
    <p>
     between it and the judge's box, four of these shepherds had built a
    </p>
    <p>
     small fire and by its light were throwing dice for coppers. They were
    </p>
    <p>
     having an easy time of it, these shepherds, for their flocks did not
    </p>
    <p>
     wander, and all that they had to do was to see that the animals were
    </p>
    <p>
     properly driven to such parts of the Bois as would afford proper
    </p>
    <p>
     nourishment.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, _mes enfants_," exclaimed old Adrian Bannalec, pulling a
    </p>
    <p>
     turnip-shaped watch from beneath his blouse and holding it up to the
    </p>
    <p>
     firelight, "it's twelve o'clock and time to turn in. But what do you say
    </p>
    <p>
     to a cup of chocolate first?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The others greeted the suggestion with approval, and going somewhere
    </p>
    <p>
     underneath the grandstand, Bannalec produced a pot filled with water,
    </p>
    <p>
     which he suspended with much dexterity over the fire upon the end of a
    </p>
    <p>
     pointed stick. The water began to boil almost immediately, and they were
    </p>
    <p>
     on the point of breaking their chocolate into it when, from what
    </p>
    <p>
     appeared to be an immense distance, through the air there came a curious
    </p>
    <p>
     rumble.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What was that?" muttered Bannalec. The sound was followed within a few
    </p>
    <p>
     seconds by another, and after a similar interval by a third and fourth.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There was going to be an armistice," suggested one of the younger
    </p>
    <p>
     herdsmen. He had hardly spoken before a much louder and apparently
    </p>
    <p>
     nearer detonation occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That must be one of our guns," said old Adrian proudly. "Do you hear
    </p>
    <p>
     how much louder it speaks than those of the Germans?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Other discharges now followed in rapid succession, some fainter, some
    </p>
    <p>
     much louder. And then somewhere in the sky they saw a flash of flame,
    </p>
    <p>
     followed by a thunderous concussion which rattled the grandstand, and a
    </p>
    <p>
     great fiery serpent came soaring through the heavens toward Paris. Each
    </p>
    <p>
     moment it grew larger, until it seemed to be dropping straight toward
    </p>
    <p>
     them out of the sky, leaving a trail of sparks behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's coming our way," chattered Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
     "God have mercy upon us!" murmured the others.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rigid with fear, they stood staring with open mouths at the shell that
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to have selected them for the object of its flight.
    </p>
    <p>
     "God have mercy on our souls!" repeated Adrian after the others.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then there came a light like that of a million suns....
    </p>
    <p>
     Alas for the wives and children of the herdsmen! And alas for the herds!
    </p>
    <p>
     But better that the eight core bombs projected by "Thanatos" through the
    </p>
    <p>
     midnight sky toward Paris should have torn the foliage of the Bois,
    </p>
    <p>
     destroyed the grandstands of Auteuil and Longchamps, with sixteen
    </p>
    <p>
     hundred innocent sheep and cattle, than that they should have sought
    </p>
    <p>
     their victims among the crowded streets of the inner city. Lucky for
    </p>
    <p>
     Paris that the Relay Gun had been sighted so as to sweep the metropolis
    </p>
    <p>
     from the west to the east, and that though each shell approached nearer
    </p>
    <p>
     to the walls than its preceding brother, none reached the ramparts. For
    </p>
    <p>
     with the discharge of the eighth shell and the explosion of the first
    </p>
    <p>
     core bomb filled with lyddite among the sleeping animals huddled on the
    </p>
    <p>
     turf in front of the grandstands, something happened which the poor
    </p>
    <p>
     shepherds did not see.
    </p>
    <p>
     The watchers in the Eiffel Tower, seeing the heavens with their
    </p>
    <p>
     searchlights for German planes and German dirigibles, saw the first core
    </p>
    <p>
     bomb bore through the sky from the direction of Verdun, followed by its
    </p>
    <p>
     seven comrades, and saw each bomb explode in the Bois below. But as the
    </p>
    <p>
     first shell shattered the stillness of the night and spread its
    </p>
    <p>
     sulphureous and death-dealing fumes among the helpless cattle, the
    </p>
    <p>
     watchers on the Tower saw a vast light burst skyward in the far-distant
    </p>
    <p>
     east.

    </p>
    <p>
     Two miles up the road from the village of Champaubert, Karl Biedenkopf,
    </p>
    <p>
     a native of Hesse-Nassau and a private of artillery, was doing picket
    </p>
    <p>
     duty. The moonlight turned the broad highroad toward Épernay into a
    </p>
    <p>
     gleaming white boulevard down which he could see, it seemed to him, for
    </p>
    <p>
     miles. The air was soft and balmy, and filled with the odour of hay
    </p>
    <p>
     which the troopers had harvested "on behalf of the Kaiser." Across the
    </p>
    <p>
     road "Gretchen," Karl's mare, grazed ruminatively, while the picket
    </p>
    <p>
     himself sat on the stone wall by the roadside, smoking the Bremen cigar
    </p>
    <p>
     which his corporal had given him after dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
     The night was thick with stars. They were all so bright that at first he
    </p>
    <p>
     did not notice the comet which sailed slowly toward him from the
    </p>
    <p>
     northwest, seemingly following the line of the German intrenchments from
    </p>
    <p>
     Amiens, St.-Quentin, and Laon toward Rheims and Épernay. But the comet
    </p>
    <p>
     was there, dropping a long yellow beam of light upon the sleeping hosts
    </p>
    <p>
     that were beleaguering the outer ring of the French fortifications.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly the repose of Biedenkopf's retrospections was abruptly
    </p>
    <p>
     disconcerted by the distant pounding of hoofs far down the road from
    </p>
    <p>
     Verdun. He sprang off the wall, took up his rifle, crossed the road,
    </p>
    <p>
     hastily adjusted "Gretchen's" bridle, leaped into the saddle, and
    </p>
    <p>
     awaited the night rider, whoever he might be. At a distance of three
    </p>
    <p>
     hundred feet he cried: "Halt!" The rider drew rein, hastily gave the
    </p>
    <p>
     countersign, and Biedenkopf, recognizing the aide-de-camp, saluted and
    </p>
    <p>
     drew aside.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There goes a lucky fellow," he said aloud. "Nothing to do but ride up
    </p>
    <p>
     and down the roads, stopping wherever he sees a pleasant inn or a pretty
    </p>
    <p>
     face, spending money like water, and never risking a hair of his head."
    </p>
    <p>
     It never occurred to him that maybe his was the luck. And while the
    </p>
    <p>
     aide-de-camp galloped on and the sound of his horse's hoofs grew fainter
    </p>
    <p>
     and fainter down the road toward the village, the comet came sailing
    </p>
    <p>
     swiftly on overhead, deluging the fortifications with a blinding
    </p>
    <p>
     orange-yellow light. It could not have been more than a mile away when
    </p>
    <p>
     Biedenkopf saw it. Instantly his trained eye recognized the fact that
    </p>
    <p>
     this strange round object shooting through the air was no wandering
    </p>
    <p>
     celestial body.
    </p>
    <p>
     "_Ein Flieger!_" he cried hoarsely, staring at it in astonishment,
    </p>
    <p>
     knowing full well that no dirigible or aeroplane of German manufacture
    </p>
    <p>
     bore any resemblance to this extraordinary voyager of the air.
    </p>
    <p>
     A hundred yards down the road his field telephone was attached to a
    </p>
    <p>
     poplar, and casting one furtive look at the Flying Ring he galloped to
    </p>
    <p>
     the tree and rang up the corporal of the guard. But at the very instant
    </p>
    <p>
     that his call was answered a series of terrific detonations shook the
    </p>
    <p>
     earth and set the wires roaring in the receiver, so that he could hear
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing. One--two--three--four of them, followed by a distant answering
    </p>
    <p>
     boom in the west.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then the whole sky seemed full of fire. He was hurled backward upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the road and lay half-stunned, while the earth discharged itself into
    </p>
    <p>
     the air with a roar like that of ten thousand shells exploding all
    </p>
    <p>
     together. The ground shook, groaned, grumbled, grated, and showers of
    </p>
    <p>
     boards, earth, branches, rocks, vegetables, tiles, and all sorts of
    </p>
    <p>
     unrecognizable and grotesque objects fell from the sky all about him. It
    </p>
    <p>
     was like a gigantic and never-ending mine, or series of mines, in
    </p>
    <p>
     continuous explosion, a volcano pouring itself upward out of the bowels
    </p>
    <p>
     of an incandescent earth. Above the earsplitting thunder of the eruption
    </p>
    <p>
     he heard shrill cries and raucous shoutings. Mounted men dashed past him
    </p>
    <p>
     down the road, singly and in squadrons. A molten globe dropped through
    </p>
    <p>
     the branches of the poplar, and striking the hard surface of the road at
    </p>
    <p>
     a distance of fifty yards scattered itself like a huge ingot dropped
    </p>
    <p>
     from a blast furnace. Great clouds of dust descended and choked him. A
    </p>
    <p>
     withering heat enveloped him....
    </p>
    <p>
     It was noon next day when Karl Biedenkopf raised his head and looked
    </p>
    <p>
     about him. He thought first there had been a battle. But the sight that
    </p>
    <p>
     met his eyes bore no resemblance to a field of carnage. Over his head he
    </p>
    <p>
     noticed that the uppermost branches of the poplar had been seared as by
    </p>
    <p>
     fire. The road looked as if the countryside had been traversed by a
    </p>
    <p>
     hurricane. All sorts of débris filled the fields and everywhere there
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to be a thick deposit of blackened earth. Vaguely realizing that
    </p>
    <p>
     he must report for duty, he crawled, in spite of his bursting head and
    </p>
    <p>
     aching limbs, on all fours down the road toward the village.
    </p>
    <p>
     But he could not find the village. There was no village there; and soon
    </p>
    <p>
     he came to what seemed to be the edge of a gigantic crater, where the
    </p>
    <p>
     earth had been uprooted and tossed aside as if by some huge convulsion
    </p>
    <p>
     of nature. Here and there masses of inflammable material smoked and
    </p>
    <p>
     flickered with red flames. His eyes sought the familiar outlines of the
    </p>
    <p>
     redoubts and fortifications, but found them not. And where the village
    </p>
    <p>
     had been there was a great cavern in the earth, and the deepest part of
    </p>
    <p>
     the cavern, or so it seemed to his half-blinded sight, was at about the
    </p>
    <p>
     point where the cottage had stood which his general had used as his
    </p>
    <p>
     headquarters, the spot where the night before that general had raised
    </p>
    <p>
     his glass of bubbling wine and toasted "Thanatos," the personification
    </p>
    <p>
     of death, and called his officers to witness that this was the greatest
    </p>
    <p>
     moment in the history of warfare, a moment that they would all remember
    </p>
    <p>
     to their dying day.

    </p>
    <p>
     The shabby-genteel little houses of the Appian Way, in Cambridge, whose
    </p>
    <p>
     window-eyes with their blue-green lids had watched Bennie Hooker come
    </p>
    <p>
     and go, trudging back and forth to lectures and recitations, first as
    </p>
    <p>
     boy and then as man, for thirty years, must have blinked with amazement
    </p>
    <p>
     at the sight of the little professor as he started on the afterward
    </p>
    <p>
     famous Hooker Expedition to Labrador in search of the Flying Ring.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the five days following Thornton's unexpected visit Bennie, existing
    </p>
    <p>
     without sleep and almost without food save for his staple of
    </p>
    <p>
     ready-to-serve chocolate, was the centre of a whirl of books,
    </p>
    <p>
     logarithms, and calculations in the University Library, and constituted
    </p>
    <p>
     himself an unmitigated, if respected, pest at the Cambridge Observatory.
    </p>
    <p>
     Moreover--and this was the most iconoclastic spectacle of all to his
    </p>
    <p>
     conservative pedagogical neighbours in the Appian Way--telegraph boys on
    </p>
    <p>
     bicycles kept rushing to and fro in a stream between the Hooker
    </p>
    <p>
     boarding-house and Harvard Square at all hours of the day and night.
    </p>
    <p>
     For Bennie had lost no time and had instantly started in upon the same
    </p>
    <p>
     series of experiments to locate the origin of the phenomena which had
    </p>
    <p>
     shaken the globe as had been made use of by Professor von Schwenitz at
    </p>
    <p>
     the direction of General von Helmuth, the Imperial German Commissioner
    </p>
    <p>
     for War, at Mainz. The result had been approximately identical, and
    </p>
    <p>
     Hooker had satisfied himself that somewhere in the centre of Labrador
    </p>
    <p>
     his fellow-scientist--the discoverer of the Lavender Ray--was conducting
    </p>
    <p>
     the operations that had resulted in the dislocation of the earth's axis
    </p>
    <p>
     and retardation of its motion. Filled with a pure and unselfish
    </p>
    <p>
     scientific joy, it became his sole and immediate ambition to find the
    </p>
    <p>
     man who had done these things, to shake him by the hand, and to compare
    </p>
    <p>
     notes with him upon the now solved problems of thermic induction and of
    </p>
    <p>
     atomic disintegration.
    </p>
    <p>
     But how to get there? How to reach him? For Prof. Bennie Hooker had
    </p>
    <p>
     never been a hundred miles from Cambridge in his life, and a journey to
    </p>
    <p>
     Labrador seemed almost as difficult as an attempt to reach the pole. Off
    </p>
    <p>
     again then to the University Library, with pale but polite young ladies
    </p>
    <p>
     hastening to fetch him atlases, charts, guidebooks, and works dealing
    </p>
    <p>
     with sport and travel, until at last the great scheme unfolded itself to
    </p>
    <p>
     his mind--the scheme that was to result in the perpetuation of atomic
    </p>
    <p>
     disintegration for the uses of mankind and the subsequent alteration of
    </p>
    <p>
     civilization, both political and economic. Innocently, ingeniously,
    </p>
    <p>
     ingenuously, he mapped it all out. No one must know what he was about.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, no! He must steal away, in disguise if need be, and reach Pax alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Three would be a crowd in that communion of scientific thought! He must
    </p>
    <p>
     take with him the notes of his own experiments, the diagrams of his
    </p>
    <p>
     apparatus, and his precious zirconium; and he must return with the great
    </p>
    <p>
     secret of atomic disintegration in his breast, ready, with the
    </p>
    <p>
     discoverer's permission, to give it to the dry and thirsty world. And
    </p>
    <p>
     then, indeed, the earth would blossom like the rose!
    </p>
    <p>
     A strange sight, the start of the Hooker Expedition!
    </p>
    <p>
     Doctor Jelly's coloured housemaid had just thrown a pail of blue-gray
    </p>
    <p>
     suds over his front steps--it was 6:30 A.M.--and was on the point of
    </p>
    <p>
     resignedly kneeling and swabbing up the doctor's porch, when she saw the
    </p>
    <p>
     door of the professor's residence open cautiously and a curious human
    </p>
    <p>
     exhibit, the like of which had ne'er before been seen on sea or land,
    </p>
    <p>
     surreptitiously emerge. It was Prof. Bennie Hooker--disguised as a
    </p>
    <p>
     salmon fisherman!
    </p>
    <p>
     Over a brand-new sportsman's knickerbocker suit of screaming yellow
    </p>
    <p>
     check he had donned an English mackintosh. On his legs were gaiters, and
    </p>
    <p>
     on his head a helmetlike affair of cloth with a visor in front and
    </p>
    <p>
     another behind, with eartabs fastened at the crown with a piece of black
    </p>
    <p>
     ribbon--in other words a "Glengarry." The suit had been manufactured in
    </p>
    <p>
     Harvard Square, and was a triumph of sartorial art on the part of one
    </p>
    <p>
     who had never been nearer to a real fisherman than a coloured fashion
    </p>
    <p>
     plate. However, it did suggest a sportsman of the variety usually
    </p>
    <p>
     portrayed in the comic supplements, and, to complete the picture, in
    </p>
    <p>
     Professor Hooker's hands and under his arms were yellow pigskin bags and
    </p>
    <p>
     rod cases, so that he looked like the show window of a harness store.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fo' de land sakes!" exclaimed the Jellys' coloured maid, oblivious of
    </p>
    <p>
     her suds. "Fo' de Lawd! Am dat Perfesser Hookey?"
    </p>
    <p>
     It was! But a new and glorified professor, with a soul thrilling to the
    </p>
    <p>
     joy of discovery and romance, with a flash in his eyes, and the savings
    </p>
    <p>
     of ten years in a large roll in his left-hand knickerbocker pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus started the Hooker Expedition, which discovered the Flying Ring and
    </p>
    <p>
     made the famous report to the Smithsonian Institution after the
    </p>
    <p>
     disarmament of the nations. But could the nations have seen the
    </p>
    <p>
     expedition as it emerged from its boarding-house that September morning
    </p>
    <p>
     they would have rubbed their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     With the utmost difficulty Prof. Bennie Hooker negotiated his bags and
    </p>
    <p>
     rod cases as far as Harvard Square, where, through the assistance of a
    </p>
    <p>
     friendly conductor with a sense of humour, he was enabled to board an
    </p>
    <p>
     electric surface car to the North Station.
    </p>
    <p>
     Beyond the start up the River Moisie his imagination refused to carry
    </p>
    <p>
     him. But he had a faith that approximated certainty that over the Height
    </p>
    <p>
     of Land--just over the edge--he would find Pax and the Flying Ring.
    </p>
    <p>
     During all the period required for his experiments and preparations he
    </p>
    <p>
     had never once glanced at a newspaper or inquired as to the progress of
    </p>
    <p>
     the war that was rapidly exterminating the inhabitants of the globe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thermic induction, atomic disintegration, the Lavender Ray, these were
    </p>
    <p>
     the Alpha, the Sigma, the Omega of his existence.
    </p>
    <p>
     But meantime[3] the war had gone on with all its concomitant horror,
    </p>
    <p>
     suffering, and loss of life, and the representatives of the nations
    </p>
    <p>
     assembled at Washington had been feverishly attempting to unite upon the
    </p>
    <p>
     terms of a universal treaty that should end militarism and war forever.
    </p>
    <p>
     And thereafter, also, although Professor Hooker was sublimely
    </p>
    <p>
     unconscious of the fact, the celebrated conclave, known as Conference
    </p>
    <p>
     No. 2, composed of the best-known scientific men from every laud, was
    </p>
    <p>
     sitting, perspiring, in the great lecture hall of the Smithsonian
    </p>
    <p>
     Institution, its members shouting at one another in a dozen different
    </p>
    <p>
     languages, telling each other what they did and didn't know, and
    </p>
    <p>
     becoming more and more confused and entangled in an underbrush of
    </p>
    <p>
     contradictory facts and observations and irreconcilable theories until
    </p>
    <p>
     they were making no progress whatever--which was precisely what the
    </p>
    <p>
     astute and plausible Count von Koenitz, the German Ambassador, had
    </p>
    <p>
     planned and intended.
    </p>
    <p>
     [Footnote 3: Up to the date of the armistice.]
    </p>
    <p>
     The Flying Ring did not again appear, and in spite of the uncontroverted
    </p>
    <p>
     testimony of Acting-Consul Quinn, Mohammed Ben Ali el Bad, and a
    </p>
    <p>
     thousand others who had actually seen the Lavender Ray, people began
    </p>
    <p>
     gradually, almost unconsciously, to assume that the destruction of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Atlas Mountains had been the work of an unsuspected volcano and that the
    </p>
    <p>
     presence of the Flying Ring had been a coincidence and not the cause of
    </p>
    <p>
     the disruption. So the incident passed by and public attention
    </p>
    <p>
     refocussed itself upon the conflict on the plains of Châlons-sur-Marne.
    </p>
    <p>
     Only Bill Hood, Thornton, and a few others in the secret, together with
    </p>
    <p>
     the President, the Cabinet, and the members of Conference No. 1 and of
    </p>
    <p>
     Conference No. 2, truly apprehended the significance of what had
    </p>
    <p>
     occurred, and realized that either war or the human race must pass away
    </p>
    <p>
     forever. And no one at all, save only the German Ambassador and the
    </p>
    <p>
     Imperial German Commissioners, suspected that one of the nations had
    </p>
    <p>
     conceived and was putting into execution a plan designed to result in
    </p>
    <p>
     the acquirement of the secret of how the earth could be rocked and in
    </p>
    <p>
     the capture of the discoverer. For the _Sea Fox_, bearing the German
    </p>
    <p>
     expeditionary force, had sailed from Amsterdam twelve days after the
    </p>
    <p>
     conference held at Mainz between Professor von Schwenitz and General von
    </p>
    <p>
     Helmuth, and having safely rounded the Orkneys was now already well on
    </p>
    <p>
     its course toward Labrador. Bennie Hooker, however, was ignorant of all
    </p>
    <p>
     these things. Like an immigrant with a tag on his arm, he sat on the
    </p>
    <p>
     train which bore him toward Quebec, his ticket stuck into the band on
    </p>
    <p>
     his hat, dreaming of a transformer that wouldn't--couldn't--melt at only
    </p>
    <p>
     six thousand degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Professor Hooker awoke in his room at the hotel in Quebec the
    </p>
    <p>
     morning after his arrival there, he ate a leisurely breakfast, and
    </p>
    <p>
     having smoked a pipe on the terrace, strolled down to the wharves along
    </p>
    <p>
     the river front. Here to his disgust he learned that the Labrador
    </p>
    <p>
     steamer, the _Druro_, would not sail until the following Thursday--a
    </p>
    <p>
     three days' wait. Apparently Labrador was a less-frequented locality
    </p>
    <p>
     than he had supposed. He mastered his impatience, however, and
    </p>
    <p>
     discovering a library presided over by a highly intelligent graduate of
    </p>
    <p>
     Edinburgh, he became so interested in various profound treatises on
    </p>
    <p>
     physics which he discovered that he almost missed his boat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Assisted by the head porter, and staggering under the weight of his new
    </p>
    <p>
     rod cases and other impedimenta, Bennie boarded the _Druro_ on Thursday
    </p>
    <p>
     morning, engaged a stateroom, and purchased a ticket for Seven Islands,
    </p>
    <p>
     which is the nearest harbour to the mouth of the River Moisie. She was a
    </p>
    <p>
     large and comfortable river steamer of about eight hundred and fifty
    </p>
    <p>
     tons, and from her appearance belied the fact that she was the
    </p>
    <p>
     connecting link between civilization and the desolate and ice-clad
    </p>
    <p>
     wastes of the Far North, as in fact she was. The captain regarded Bennie
    </p>
    <p>
     with indifference, if not disrespect, grunted, and ascending to the
    </p>
    <p>
     pilot house blew the whistle. Quebec, with its teeming wharves and
    </p>
    <p>
     crowded shipping, overlooked by the cliffs that made Wolfe famous,
    </p>
    <p>
     slowly fell behind. Off their leeward bow the Isle of Orléans swung
    </p>
    <p>
     nearer and swept past, its neat homesteads inviting the weary traveller
    </p>
    <p>
     to pastoral repose. The river cleared. Low, farm-clad shores began to
    </p>
    <p>
     slip by. The few tourists and returning habitans settled themselves in
    </p>
    <p>
     the bow and made ready for their voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
     There would have been much to interest the ordinary American traveller
    </p>
    <p>
     in this comparatively unfrequented corner of his native continent; but
    </p>
    <p>
     our salmon fisherman, having conveniently disposed of his baggage,
    </p>
    <p>
     immediately retired to his stateroom and, intent on saving time,
    </p>
    <p>
     proceeded, wholly oblivious of the _Druro_, to read passionately several
    </p>
    <p>
     exceedingly uninviting looking books which he produced from his valise.
    </p>
    <p>
     The _Druro_, quite as oblivious to Professor Hooker, proceeded on her
    </p>
    <p>
     accustomed way, passed by Tadousac, and made her first stop at the
    </p>
    <p>
     Godbout. Bennie, finding the boat no longer in motion, reappeared on
    </p>
    <p>
     deck under the mistaken impression that they had reached the end of the
    </p>
    <p>
     voyage, for he was unfamiliar with the topography of the St. Lawrence,
    </p>
    <p>
     and in fact had very vague ideas as to distances and the time required
    </p>
    <p>
     to traverse them by rail or boat.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the Godbout the _Druro_ dropped a habitan or two, a few boatloads of
    </p>
    <p>
     steel rods, crates of crockery and tobacco, and then thrust her bow out
    </p>
    <p>
     into the stream and steered down river, rounding at length the Pointe
    </p>
    <p>
     des Monts and winding in behind the Isles des Oeufs to the River
    </p>
    <p>
     Pentecoute, where she deposited some more habitans, including a priest
    </p>
    <p>
     in a black soutane, who somewhat incongruously was smoking a large
    </p>
    <p>
     cigar. Then, nosing through a fog bank and breaking out at last into
    </p>
    <p>
     sunlight again, she steamed across and put in past the Carousel, that
    </p>
    <p>
     picturesque and rocky headland, into Seven Islands Bay. Here she
    </p>
    <p>
     anchored, and, having discharged cargo, steamed out by the Grand Boule,
    </p>
    <p>
     where eighteen miles beyond the islands Bennie saw the pilot house of
    </p>
    <p>
     the old _St. Olaf_, of unhappy memory, just lifting above the water.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had emerged from the retirement of his stateroom only on being asked
    </p>
    <p>
     by the steward for his ticket and learning that the _Druro_ was nearing
    </p>
    <p>
     the end of her journey. For nearly two days he had been submerged in
    </p>
    <p>
     Soddy on The Interpretation of Radium. The _Druro_ was running along a
    </p>
    <p>
     sandy, low-lying beach about half a mile offshore. They were nearing the
    </p>
    <p>
     mouth of a wide river. The volume of black fresh water from the Moisie
    </p>
    <p>
     rushed out into the St. Lawrence until it met the green sea water,
    </p>
    <p>
     causing a sharp demarcation of colour and a no less pronounced conflict
    </p>
    <p>
     of natural forces. For, owing to the pressure of the tide against the
    </p>
    <p>
     solid mass of the fresh stream, acres of water unexpectedly boiled on
    </p>
    <p>
     all sides, throwing geysers of foam twenty feet or more into the air,
    </p>
    <p>
     and then subsided. Off the point the engine bell rang twice, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     _Druro_ came to a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bennie, standing in the bow, in his sportsman's cap and waterproof,
    </p>
    <p>
     hugging his rod cases to his breast, watched while a heterogeneous fleet
    </p>
    <p>
     of canoes, skiffs, and sailboats came racing out from shore, for the
    </p>
    <p>
     steamer does not land here, but hangs in the offing and lighters its
    </p>
    <p>
     cargo ashore. Leading the lot was a sort of whaleboat propelled by two
    </p>
    <p>
     oars on one side and one on the other, and in the sternsheets sat a
    </p>
    <p>
     rosy-cheeked, good-natured looking man with a smooth-shaven face who
    </p>
    <p>
     Bennie knew must be Malcolm Holliday.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hello, Cap!" shouted Holliday. "Any passengers?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The captain from the pilot house waved contemptuously in Bennie's
    </p>
    <p>
     general direction.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Howdy!" said Holliday. "What do you want? What can I do for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I thought I'd try a little salmon fishing," shrieked Bennie back at
    </p>
    <p>
     him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Holliday shook his head. "Sorry," he bellowed, "river's leased. Besides,
    </p>
    <p>
     the officers[4] are here."
    </p>
    <p>
     [Footnote 4: Along the St. Lawrence and the Labrador coast a salmon
    </p>
    <p>
     fisherman is always spoken of by natives and local residents as an
    </p>
    <p>
     "officer," the reason being that most of the sportsmen who visit these
    </p>
    <p>
     waters are English army officers. Hence salmon fishermen are universally
    </p>
    <p>
     termed "officers," and a habitan will describe the sportsmen who have
    </p>
    <p>
     rented a certain river as "_les officiers de la Moisie_" or "_les
    </p>
    <p>
     officiers de la Romaine_."]
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh!" answered Bennie ruefully. "I didn't know. I supposed I could fish
    </p>
    <p>
     anywhere."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, you can't!" snapped Holliday, puzzled by the little man's curious
    </p>
    <p>
     appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I suppose I can go ashore, can't I?" insisted Bennie somewhat
    </p>
    <p>
     indignantly. "I'll just take a camping trip then. I'd like to see the
    </p>
    <p>
     big salmon cache up at the forks if I can't do anything else."
    </p>
    <p>
     Instantly Holliday scented something. "Another fellow after gold," he
    </p>
    <p>
     muttered to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just at that moment, the tide being at the ebb, a hundred acres of green
    </p>
    <p>
     water off the _Druro's_ bow broke into whirling waves and jets of foam
    </p>
    <p>
     again. All about them, and a mile to seaward, these merry men danced by
    </p>
    <p>
     the score. Bennie thrilled at the beauty of it. The whaleboat containing
    </p>
    <p>
     Holliday was now right under the ship's bows.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I want to look round anyhow," expostulated Bennie. "I've come all the
    </p>
    <p>
     way from Boston." He felt himself treated like a criminal, felt the
    </p>
    <p>
     suspicion in Holliday's eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     The factor laughed. "In that case you certainly deserve sympathy." Then
    </p>
    <p>
     he hesitated. "Oh, well, come along," he said finally. "We'll see what
    </p>
    <p>
     we can do for you."
    </p>
    <p>
     A rope ladder had been thrown over the side and one of the sailors now
    </p>
    <p>
     lowered Bennie's luggage into the boat. The professor followed, avoiding
    </p>
    <p>
     with difficulty stepping on his mackintosh as he climbed down the
    </p>
    <p>
     slippery rounds. Holliday grasped his hand and yanked him to a seat in
    </p>
    <p>
     the stern.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," he repeated, "if you've come all the way from Boston I guess
    </p>
    <p>
     we'll have to put you up for a few days anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
     A crate of canned goods, a parcel of mail, and a huge bundle of
    </p>
    <p>
     newspapers were deposited in the bow. Holliday waved his hand. The
    </p>
    <p>
     _Druro_ churned the water and swung out into midstream again. Bennie
    </p>
    <p>
     looked curiously after her. To the north lay a sandy shore dotted by a
    </p>
    <p>
     scraggy forest of dwarf spruce and birch. A few fishing huts and a mass
    </p>
    <p>
     of wooden shanties fringed the forest. To the east, seaward, many miles
    </p>
    <p>
     down that great stretch of treacherous, sullen river waited a gray bank
    </p>
    <p>
     of fog. But overhead the air was crystalline with that sparkling,
    </p>
    <p>
     scratchy brilliance that is found only in northern climes. Nature seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     hard, relentless. With his feet entangled in rod cases Professor Hooker
    </p>
    <p>
     wondered for a moment what on earth he was there for, landing on this
    </p>
    <p>
     inhospitable coast. Then his eyes sought the genial face of Malcolm
    </p>
    <p>
     Holliday and hope sprang up anew. For there is that about this genial
    </p>
    <p>
     frontiersman that draws all men to him alike, be they Scotch or English,
    </p>
    <p>
     Canadian habitans or Montagnais, and he is the king of the coast, as his
    </p>
    <p>
     father was before him, or as was old Peter McKenzie, the head factor,
    </p>
    <p>
     who incidentally cast the best salmon fly ever thrown east of Montreal
    </p>
    <p>
     or south of Ungava. Bennie found comfort in Holliday's smile, and felt
    </p>
    <p>
     toward him as a child does toward its mother.
    </p>
    <p>
     They neared shore and ran alongside a ramshackle pier, up the slippery
    </p>
    <p>
     poles of which Bennie was instructed to clamber. Then, dodging rotten
    </p>
    <p>
     boards and treacherous places, he gained the sand of the beach and stood
    </p>
    <p>
     at last on Labrador. A group of Montagnais picked up the professor's
    </p>
    <p>
     luggage and, headed by Holliday, they started for the latter's house. It
    </p>
    <p>
     was a strange and amusing landing of an expedition the results of which
    </p>
    <p>
     have revolutionized the life of the inhabitants of the entire globe. No
    </p>
    <p>
     such inconspicuous event has ever had so momentous a conclusion. And now
    </p>
    <p>
     when Malcolm Holliday makes his yearly trip home to Quebec, to report to
    </p>
    <p>
     the firm of Holliday Brothers, who own all the nets far east of
    </p>
    <p>
     Anticosti, he spends hours at the Club des Voyageurs, recounting in
    </p>
    <p>
     detail all the circumstances surrounding the arrival of Professor Hooker
    </p>
    <p>
     and how he took him for a gold hunter.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Anyhow," he finishes, "I knew he wasn't a salmon fisherman in spite of
    </p>
    <p>
     his rods and cases, for he didn't know a Black Dose from a Thunder and
    </p>
    <p>
     Lightning or a Jock Scott, and he thought you could catch salmon with a
    </p>
    <p>
     worm!"
    </p>
    <p>
     It was true wholly. Bennie did suppose one killed the king of game fish
    </p>
    <p>
     as he had caught minnows in his childhood, and his geologic researches
    </p>
    <p>
     in the Harvard Library had not taught him otherwise. Neither had his
    </p>
    <p>
     tailor.
    </p>
    <p>
     "My dear fellow," said Holliday as they smoked their pipes on the narrow
    </p>
    <p>
     board piazza at the Post, "of course I'll help you all I can, but you've
    </p>
    <p>
     come at a bad season of the year all round. In the first place, you'll
    </p>
    <p>
     be eaten alive by black flies, gnats, and mosquitoes." He slapped
    </p>
    <p>
     vigorously as he spoke. "And you'll have the devil of a job getting
    </p>
    <p>
     canoe men. You see all the Montagnais are down here at the settlement
    </p>
    <p>
     'making their mass.' Once a year they leave the hunting grounds up by
    </p>
    <p>
     the Divide and beyond and come down river to '_faire la messe_'--it's a
    </p>
    <p>
     sacred duty with 'em. They're very religious, as you probably know--a
    </p>
    <p>
     fine lot, too, take 'em altogether, gentle, obedient, industrious,
    </p>
    <p>
     polite, cheerful, and fair to middling honest. They have a good deal of
    </p>
    <p>
     French blood--a bit diluted, but it's there."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can't I get a few to go along with me?" asked Bennie anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's a question," answered the factor meditatively. "You know how the
    </p>
    <p>
     birds--how caribou--migrate every year. Well, these Montagnais are just
    </p>
    <p>
     like them. They have a regular routine. Each man has a line of traps of
    </p>
    <p>
     his own, all the way up to the Height of Land. They all go up river in
    </p>
    <p>
     the autumn with their winter's supply of pork, flour, tea, powder, lead,
    </p>
    <p>
     axes, files, rosin to mend their canoes, and castoreum--made out of
    </p>
    <p>
     beaver glands, you know--to take away the smell of their hands from the
    </p>
    <p>
     baited traps. They go up in families, six or seven canoes together, and
    </p>
    <p>
     as each man reaches his own territory his canoe drops out of the
    </p>
    <p>
     procession and he makes a camp for his wife and babies. Then he spends
    </p>
    <p>
     the winter--six or seven months--in the woods following his line of
    </p>
    <p>
     traps. By and by the ice goes out and he begins to want some society. He
    </p>
    <p>
     hasn't seen a priest for ten months or so, and he's afraid of the
    </p>
    <p>
     _loup-garou_, for all I know. So he comes down river, takes his Newport
    </p>
    <p>
     season here at Moisie, and goes to mass and staves off the _loup-garou_.
    </p>
    <p>
     They're all here now. Maybe you can get a couple to go up river and
    </p>
    <p>
     maybe you can't."
    </p>
    <p>
     Then observing Bennie's crestfallen expression, he added:
    </p>
    <p>
     "But we'll see. Perhaps you can get Marc St. Ange and Edouard Moreau,
    </p>
    <p>
     both good fellows. They've made their mass and they know the country
    </p>
    <p>
     from here to Ungava. There's Marc now--_Venez ici_, Marc St. Ange." A
    </p>
    <p>
     swarthy, lithe Montagnais was coming down the road, and Holliday
    </p>
    <p>
     addressed him rapidly in habitan French: "This gentleman wishes to go up
    </p>
    <p>
     river to the forks to see the big cache. Will you go with him?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The Montagnais bowed to Professor Hooker and pondered the suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then he gesticulated toward the north and seemed to Bennie to be telling
    </p>
    <p>
     a long story.
    </p>
    <p>
     Holliday laughed again. "Marc says he will go," he commented shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But he says also that if the Great Father of the Marionettes is angry
    </p>
    <p>
     he will come back."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What does he mean by that?" asked Bennie.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, when the aurora borealis--Northern Lights--plays in the sky the
    </p>
    <p>
     Indians always say that the 'marionettes are dancing.' About four weeks
    </p>
    <p>
     ago we had some electrical disturbances up here and a kind of an
    </p>
    <p>
     earthquake. It scared these Indians silly. There was a tremendous
    </p>
    <p>
     display, almost like a volcano. It beat anything I ever saw, and I've
    </p>
    <p>
     been here fifteen years. The Indians said the Father of the Marionettes
    </p>
    <p>
     was angry because they didn't dance enough to suit him, and that he was
    </p>
    <p>
     making them dance. Then some of them caught a glimpse of a shooting
    </p>
    <p>
     star, or a comet, or something, and called it the Father of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Marionettes. They had quite a time--held masses, and so on--and were
    </p>
    <p>
     really cut up. But the thing is over now, except for the regular,
    </p>
    <p>
     ordinary display."
    </p>
    <p>
     "When can they be ready?" inquired Bennie eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "To-morrow morning," replied Holliday. "Marc will engage his uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
     They're all right. Now how about an outfit? But don't talk any more
    </p>
    <p>
     about salmon. I know what you're after--it's _gold_!"
    </p>
    <p>
     *       *       *       *       *
    </p>
    <p>
     The moon was still hanging low over the firs at four o'clock the next
    </p>
    <p>
     morning when three black and silent shadows emerged from the factor's
    </p>
    <p>
     house and made their way, cautiously and with difficulty, across the
    </p>
    <p>
     sand to where a canoe had been run into the riffles of the beach. Marc
    </p>
    <p>
     came first, carrying a sheet-iron stove with a collapsible funnel; then
    </p>
    <p>
     his Uncle Edouard, shouldering a bundle consisting of a tent and a
    </p>
    <p>
     couple of sacks of flour and pork; and lastly Professor Hooker with his
    </p>
    <p>
     mackintosh and rifle, entirely unaware of the fact that his careful
    </p>
    <p>
     guides had removed all the cartridges from his luggage lest he should
    </p>
    <p>
     shoot too many caribou and so spoil the winter's food supply. It was
    </p>
    <p>
     cold, almost frosty. In the black flood of the river the stars burned
    </p>
    <p>
     with a chill, wavering light. Bennie put on his mackintosh with a
    </p>
    <p>
     shiver. The two guides quietly piled the luggage in the centre of the
    </p>
    <p>
     canoe, arranged a seat for their passenger, picked up their paddles,
    </p>
    <p>
     shoved off, and took their places in bow and stern.
    </p>
    <p>
     No lights gleamed in the windows of Moisie. The lap of the ripples
    </p>
    <p>
     against the birch side of the canoe, the gurgle of the water round the
    </p>
    <p>
     paddle blades, and the rush of the bow as, after it had paused on the
    </p>
    <p>
     withdraw, it leaped forward on the stroke, were the only sounds that
    </p>
    <p>
     broke the deathlike silence of the semi-arctic night. Bennie struck a
    </p>
    <p>
     match, and it flared red against the black water as he lit his pipe, but
    </p>
    <p>
     he felt a great stirring within his little breast, a great courage to
    </p>
    <p>
     dare, to do, for he was off, really off, on his great hunt, his search
    </p>
    <p>
     for the secret that would remake the world. With the current whispering
    </p>
    <p>
     against its sides the canoe swept in a wide circle to midstream. The
    </p>
    <p>
     moon was now partially obscured behind the treetops. To the east a faint
    </p>
    <p>
     glow made the horizon seem blacker than ever. Ahead the wide waste of
    </p>
    <p>
     the dark river seemed like an engulfing chasm. Drowsiness enwrapped
    </p>
    <p>
     Professor Hooker, a drowsiness intensified by the rythmic swinging of
    </p>
    <p>
     the paddles and the pile of bedding against which he reclined. He closed
    </p>
    <p>
     his eyes, content to be driven onward toward the region of his hopes,
    </p>
    <p>
     content almost to fall asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hi!" suddenly whispered Marc St. Ange. "_Voilà! Le père des
    </p>
    <p>
     marionettes!_"
    </p>
    <p>
     Bennie awoke with a start that almost upset the canoe. The blood rushed
    </p>
    <p>
     to his face and sang in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where?" he cried. "Where?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "_Au nord_," answered Marc. "_Mais il descend!_"
    </p>
    <p>
     Professor Hooker stared in the direction of Marc's uplifted paddle. Was
    </p>
    <p>
     he deceived? Was the wish father to the thought? Or did he really see at
    </p>
    <p>
     an immeasurable distance upon the horizon a quickly dying trail of
    </p>
    <p>
     orange-yellow light? He rubbed his eyes--his heart beating wildly under
    </p>
    <p>
     his sportsman's suiting. But the north was black beyond the coming dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
     Old Edouard grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
     "_Vous êtes fou!_" he muttered to his nephew, and drove his paddle deep
    </p>
    <p>
     into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
     Day broke with staccato emphasis. The sun swung up out of Europe and
    </p>
    <p>
     burned down upon the canoe with a heat so equatorial in quality that
    </p>
    <p>
     Bennie discarded both his mackintosh and his sporting jacket. All signs
    </p>
    <p>
     of human life had disappeared from the distant banks of the river and
    </p>
    <p>
     the bow of the canoe faced a gray-blue flood emerging from a wilderness
    </p>
    <p>
     of scrubby trees. A few gulls flopped their way coast-ward, and at rare
    </p>
    <p>
     intervals a salmon leaped and slashed the slow-moving surface into a
    </p>
    <p>
     boiling circle; but for the rest their surroundings were as set, as
    </p>
    <p>
     immobile, as the painted scenery of a stage, save where the current
    </p>
    <p>
     swept the scattered promontories of the shore. But they moved steadily
    </p>
    <p>
     north. So wearied was Bennie with the unaccustomed light and fresh air
    </p>
    <p>
     that by ten o'clock he felt the day must be over, although the sun had
    </p>
    <p>
     not yet reached the zenith. Unexpectedly Marc and Edouard turned the
    </p>
    <p>
     canoe quietly into a shallow, and beached her on a spit of white sand.
    </p>
    <p>
     In three minutes Edouard had a small fire snapping, and handed Bennie a
    </p>
    <p>
     cup of tea. How wonderful it seemed--a genuine elixir! And then he felt
    </p>
    <p>
     the stab of a mosquito, and putting up his hand found it blotched with
    </p>
    <p>
     blood. And the black flies came also. Soon the professor was tramping up
    </p>
    <p>
     and down, waving his handkerchief and clutching wildly at the air. Then
    </p>
    <p>
     they pushed off again.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sun dropped westward as they turned bend after bend, disclosing ever
    </p>
    <p>
     the same view beyond. Shadows of rocks and trees began to jut across the
    </p>
    <p>
     eddies. A great heron, as big as an ostrich, or so he seemed, arose
    </p>
    <p>
     awkwardly and flapped off, trailing yards of legs behind him. Then
    </p>
    <p>
     Bennie put on first his jacket and then his mackintosh. He realized that
    </p>
    <p>
     his hands were numb. The sun was now only a foot or so above the sky
    </p>
    <p>
     line.
    </p>
    <p>
     This time it was Marc who grunted and thrust the canoe toward the
    </p>
    <p>
     river's edge with a sideways push. It grounded on a belt of sand and
    </p>
    <p>
     they dragged it ashore. Bennie, who had been looking forward to the
    </p>
    <p>
     night with vivid apprehension, now discovered to his great happiness
    </p>
    <p>
     that the chill was keeping away the black flies. Joyfully he assisted in
    </p>
    <p>
     gathering dry sticks, driving tent pegs, and picking reindeer moss for
    </p>
    <p>
     bedding. Then as darkness fell Edouard fried eggs and bacon, and with
    </p>
    <p>
     their boots off and their stockinged feet toasting to the blaze the
    </p>
    <p>
     three men ate as becomes men who have laboured fifteen hours in the open
    </p>
    <p>
     air. They drank tin cups of scalding tea, a pint at a time, and found it
    </p>
    <p>
     good; and they smoked their pipes with their backs propped against the
    </p>
    <p>
     tree trunks and found it heaven. Then as the stars came out and the
    </p>
    <p>
     woods behind them snapped with strange noises, Edouard took his pipe
    </p>
    <p>
     from his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's getting cold," said he. "The marionettes will dance to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
     Bennie heard him as if across a great, yawning gulf. Even the firelight
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed hundreds of yards away. The little professor was "all in," and he
    </p>
    <p>
     sat with his chin dropped again to his chest, until he heard Marc
    </p>
    <p>
     exclaim:
    </p>
    <p>
     "_Voilà! Elles dansent!_"
    </p>
    <p>
     He raised his eyes. Just across the black, silent sweep of the river
    </p>
    <p>
     three giant prismatic searchlights were playing high toward the
    </p>
    <p>
     polestar, such searchlights as the gods might be using in some monstrous
    </p>
    <p>
     game. They wavered here and there, shifting and dodging, faded and
    </p>
    <p>
     sprang up again, till Bennie, dizzy, closed his eyes. The lights were
    </p>
    <p>
     still dancing in the north as he stumbled to his couch of moss.
    </p>
    <p>
     "_Toujour les marionettes!_" whispered Marc gently, as he might to a
    </p>
    <p>
     child. "_Bon soir, monsieur._"
    </p>
    <p>
     The tent was hot and dazzling white above his head when low voices,
    </p>
    <p>
     footsteps, and the clink of tin against iron aroused the professor from
    </p>
    <p>
     a profound coma. The guides had already loaded the canoe and were
    </p>
    <p>
     waiting for him. The sun was high. Apologetically he pulled on his
    </p>
    <p>
     boots, and stepping to the sand dashed the icy water into his face. His
    </p>
    <p>
     muscles groaned and rasped. His neck refused to respond to his desires
    </p>
    <p>
     with its accustomed elasticity. But he drank his tea and downed his
    </p>
    <p>
     scrambled eggs with an enthusiasm unknown in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Marc gave him a hand into the canoe and they were off. The day had
    </p>
    <p>
     begun.
    </p>
    <p>
     The river narrowed somewhat and the shores grew more rocky. At noon they
    </p>
    <p>
     lunched on another sand-spit. At sunset they saw a caribou. Night came.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Always the marionettes." Thus passed nine days--like a dream to Bennie;
    </p>
    <p>
     and then came the first adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was about four o'clock on the afternoon of the tenth day of their
    </p>
    <p>
     trip up the Moisie when Marc suddenly stopped paddling and gazed
    </p>
    <p>
     intently shoreward. After a moment he said something in a low tone to
    </p>
    <p>
     Edouard, and they turned the canoe and drove it rapidly toward a small
    </p>
    <p>
     cove half hidden by rocks. Bennie, straining his eyes, could see nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     at first, but when the canoe was but ten yards from shore he caught
    </p>
    <p>
     sight of the motionless figure of a man, lying on his face with his head
    </p>
    <p>
     nearly in the water. Marc turned him over gently, but the limbs fell
    </p>
    <p>
     limp, one leg at a grotesque angle to the knee. Bennie saw instantly
    </p>
    <p>
     that it was broken. The Indian's face was white and drawn, no doubt with
    </p>
    <p>
     pain.
    </p>
    <p>
     "_Il est mort!_" said Marc slowly, crossing himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Edouard shrugged his shoulders and fetched a small flask of brandy from
    </p>
    <p>
     the professor's sack. Forcing open the jaws, he poured a few drops into
    </p>
    <p>
     the man's mouth. The Indian choked and opened his eyes. Edouard grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
     "_La jeunesse pense qu'elle sait tout!_" he remarked scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus they found Nichicun, without whom Bennie might never have
    </p>
    <p>
     accomplished the object of his quest. It took three days to nurse the
    </p>
    <p>
     half-dead and altogether starved Montagnais back to life, but he
    </p>
    <p>
     received the tenderest care. Marc shot a young caribou and gave him the
    </p>
    <p>
     blood to drink, and made a ragout to put the flesh back on his bones.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meanwhile the professor slept long hours on the moss and took a
    </p>
    <p>
     much-needed rest; and by degrees they learned from Nichicun the story of
    </p>
    <p>
     his misfortune--the story that forms a part of the chronicle of the
    </p>
    <p>
     expedition, which can be read at the Smithsonian Institution.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was a Montagnais, he said, with a line of traps to the northeast of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Height of Land, and last winter he had had very bad luck indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
     There had been less and less in his traps and he had seen no caribou. So
    </p>
    <p>
     he had taken his wife, who was sick, and had gone over into the Nascopee
    </p>
    <p>
     country for food, and there his wife had died. He had made up his mind
    </p>
    <p>
     very late in the season to come down to Moisie and make his mass and get
    </p>
    <p>
     a new wife, and start a fresh line of traps in the autumn. All the other
    </p>
    <p>
     Montagnais had descended the river in their canoes long before, so he
    </p>
    <p>
     was alone. His provisions had given out and he saw no caribou. He began
    </p>
    <p>
     to think he would surely starve to death. And then one evening, on the
    </p>
    <p>
     point just above their present camp, he had seen a caribou and shot it,
    </p>
    <p>
     but he had been too weak to take good aim and had only broken its
    </p>
    <p>
     shoulder. It lay kicking among the boulders, pushing itself along by its
    </p>
    <p>
     hind legs, and he had feared that it would escape. In his haste to reach
    </p>
    <p>
     it he had slipped on a wet rock and fallen and broken his leg. In spite
    </p>
    <p>
     of the pain he had crawled on, and then had taken place a wild, terrible
    </p>
    <p>
     fight for life between the dying man and the dying beast.
    </p>
    <p>
     He could not remember all that had occurred--he had been kicked, gored,
    </p>
    <p>
     and bitten; but finally he had got a grip on its throat and slashed it
    </p>
    <p>
     with his knife. Then, lying there on the ground beside it, he drank its
    </p>
    <p>
     blood and cut off the raw flesh in strips for food. Finally one day he
    </p>
    <p>
     had crawled to the river for water and had fainted.
    </p>
    <p>
     The professor and his guides made for the Indian a hut of rocks and
    </p>
    <p>
     bark, and threw a great pile of moss into the corner of it for him to
    </p>
    <p>
     lie on. They carved a splint for his leg and bound it up, and cut a huge
    </p>
    <p>
     heap of firewood for him, smoking caribou meat and hanging it up in the
    </p>
    <p>
     hut. Somebody would come up river and find him, or if not, the three men
    </p>
    <p>
     would pick him up on their return. For this was right and the law of the
    </p>
    <p>
     woods. But never a word of particular interest to Prof. Bennie Hooker
    </p>
    <p>
     did Nichicun speak until the night before their departure, although the
    </p>
    <p>
     reason and manner of his speaking were natural enough. It happened as
    </p>
    <p>
     follows: but first it should be said that the Nascopees are an ignorant
    </p>
    <p>
     and barbarous tribe, dirty and treacherous, upon whom the Montagnais
    </p>
    <p>
     look down with contempt and scorn. They do not even wear civilized
    </p>
    <p>
     clothes, and their ways are not the ways of _les bons sauvages_. They
    </p>
    <p>
     have no priests; they do not come to the coast; and the Montagnais will
    </p>
    <p>
     not mingle with them. Thus it bespoke the hunger of Nichicun that he was
    </p>
    <p>
     willing to go into their country.
    </p>
    <p>
     As he sat round the fire with Marc and Edouard on that last night,
    </p>
    <p>
     Nichicun spoke his mind of the Nascopees, and Marc translated freely for
    </p>
    <p>
     Bennie's edification.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, the injured Montagnais told them, the Nascopees were not nice; they
    </p>
    <p>
     were dirty. They ate decayed food and they never went to mass. Moreover,
    </p>
    <p>
     they were half-witted. While he was there they were all planning to
    </p>
    <p>
     migrate for the most absurd reason--what do you suppose? Magic! They
    </p>
    <p>
     claimed the end of the world was coming! Of course it was coming some
    </p>
    <p>
     time. But they said now, right away. But why? Because the marionettes
    </p>
    <p>
     were dancing so much. And they had seen the Father of the Marionettes
    </p>
    <p>
     floating in the sky and making thunder! Fools! But the strangest thing
    </p>
    <p>
     of all, they said they could hunt no longer, for they were afraid to
    </p>
    <p>
     cross something--an iron serpent that stung with fire if you touched it,
    </p>
    <p>
     and killed you! What foolishness! An iron serpent! But he had asked them
    </p>
    <p>
     and they had sworn on the holy cross that it was true.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bennie listened with a chill creeping up his spine. But it would never
    </p>
    <p>
     do to hint what this disclosure meant to him. Between puffs of his pipe
    </p>
    <p>
     he asked casual, careless questions of Nichicun. These Nascopees, for
    </p>
    <p>
     instance, how far off might their land be? And where did they assert
    </p>
    <p>
     this extraordinary serpent of iron to be? Were there rivers in the
    </p>
    <p>
     Nascopee country? Did white men ever go there? All these things the
    </p>
    <p>
     wounded Montagnais told him. It appeared, moreover, that the Rassini
    </p>
    <p>
     River was near the Nascopee territory, and that it flowed into the
    </p>
    <p>
     Moisie only seven miles above the camp. All that night the marionettes
    </p>
    <p>
     danced in Bennie's brain.
    </p>
    <p>
     Next morning they propped Nichicun on his bed of moss, laid a rifle and
    </p>
    <p>
     a box of matches beside him, and bade him farewell. At the mouth of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Rassini River Prof. Bennie Hooker held up his hand and announced that he
    </p>
    <p>
     was going to the Nascopee country. The canoe halted abruptly. Old
    </p>
    <p>
     Edouard declared that they had been engaged only to go to the big cache,
    </p>
    <p>
     and that their present trip was merely by way of a little excursion to
    </p>
    <p>
     see the river. They had no supplies for such a journey, no proper amount
    </p>
    <p>
     of ammunition. No, they would deposit the professor on the nearest
    </p>
    <p>
     sandbar if he wished, but they were going back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bennie arose unsteadily in the canoe and dug into his pocket, producing
    </p>
    <p>
     a roll of gold coin. Two hundred and fifty dollars he promised them if
    </p>
    <p>
     they would take him to the nearest tribe of Nascopees; five hundred if
    </p>
    <p>
     they could find the Iron Serpent.
    </p>
    <p>
     "_Bien!_" exclaimed both Indians without a moment's hesitation, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     canoe plunged forward up the Rassini.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once more a dreamlike succession of brilliant, frosty days; once more
    </p>
    <p>
     the star-studded sky in which always the marionettes danced. And then at
    </p>
    <p>
     last the great falls of the Rassini, beyond which no white man had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
     They hid the canoe in the bushes and placed beneath it the iron stove
    </p>
    <p>
     and half their supply of food. Then they plunged into the brush,
    </p>
    <p>
     eastward. Bennie had never known such grueling work and heartbreaking
    </p>
    <p>
     fatigue; and the clouds of flies pursued them venomously and with
    </p>
    <p>
     unrelenting persistence. At first they had to cut their way through
    </p>
    <p>
     acres of brush, and then the land rose and they saw before them miles of
    </p>
    <p>
     swamp and barren land dotted with dwarf trees and lichen-grown rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here it was easier and they made better time; but the professor's legs
    </p>
    <p>
     ached and his rifle wore a red bruise on his shoulder. And then after
    </p>
    <p>
     five days of torment they came upon the Iron Rail. It ran in almost a
    </p>
    <p>
     direct line from northwest to southwest, with hardly a waver, straight
    </p>
    <p>
     over the barrens and through the forests of scrub, with a five-foot
    </p>
    <p>
     clearing upon either side. At intervals it was elevated to a height of
    </p>
    <p>
     eight or ten inches upon insulated iron braces. Both Marc and Edouard
    </p>
    <p>
     stared at in wonder, while Bennie made them a little speech.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was, he said, a thing called a "monorail," made by a man who
    </p>
    <p>
     possessed strange secrets concerning the earth and the properties of
    </p>
    <p>
     matter. That man lived over the Height of Land toward Ungava. He was a
    </p>
    <p>
     good man and would not harm other good men. But he was a great
    </p>
    <p>
     magician--if you believed in magic. On the rail undoubtedly he ran
    </p>
    <p>
     something called a gyroscopic engine, and carried his stores and
    </p>
    <p>
     machinery into the wilderness. The Nascopees were not such fools after
    </p>
    <p>
     all, for here was the something they feared to cross--the iron serpent
    </p>
    <p>
     that bit and killed. Let them watch while he made it bite. He allowed
    </p>
    <p>
     his rifle to fall against the rail, and instantly a shower of blue
    </p>
    <p>
     sparks flashed from it as the current leaped into the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bennie counted out twenty-five golden eagles and handed them to Edouard.
    </p>
    <p>
     If they followed the rail to its source he would, he promised, on their
    </p>
    <p>
     return to civilization give them as much again. Without more ado the
    </p>
    <p>
     Indians lifted their packs and swung off to the northwest along the line
    </p>
    <p>
     of the rail. The stock of Prof. Bennie Hooker had risen in their
    </p>
    <p>
     estimation. On they ploughed across the barrens, through swamps, over
    </p>
    <p>
     the quaking muskeg, into the patches of scrub growth where the short
    </p>
    <p>
     branches slapped their faces, but always they kept in sight of the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
     *       *       *       *       *
    </p>
    <p>
     The extraordinary announcement, transmitted from various European news
    </p>
    <p>
     agencies, that an attempt had been made by the general commanding the
    </p>
    <p>
     First Artillery Division of the German Army of the Meuse to violate the
    </p>
    <p>
     armistice, had caused a profound sensation, particularly as the attempt
    </p>
    <p>
     to destroy Paris had been prevented only by the sudden appearance of the
    </p>
    <p>
     same mysterious Flying Ring that had shortly before caused the
    </p>
    <p>
     destruction of the Atlas Mountains and the flooding of the Sahara Desert
    </p>
    <p>
     by the Mediterranean Sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     The advent of the Flying Ring on this second occasion had been noted by
    </p>
    <p>
     several hundred thousand persons, both soldiers and non-combatants. At
    </p>
    <p>
     about the hour of midnight, as if to observe whether the warring nations
    </p>
    <p>
     intended sincerely to live up to their agreement and bring about an
    </p>
    <p>
     actual cessation of hostilities, the Ring had appeared out of the north
    </p>
    <p>
     and, floating through the sky, had followed the lines of the
    </p>
    <p>
     belligerents from Brussels to Verdun and southward. The blinding yellow
    </p>
    <p>
     light that it had projected toward the earth had roused the soldiers
    </p>
    <p>
     sleeping in their intrenchments and caused great consternation all along
    </p>
    <p>
     the line of fortifications, as it was universally supposed that the
    </p>
    <p>
     director of its flight intended to annihilate the combined armies of
    </p>
    <p>
     France, England, Germany, and Belgium. But the Ring had sailed
    </p>
    <p>
     peacefully along, three thousand feet aloft, deluging the countryside
    </p>
    <p>
     with its dazzling light, sending its beams into the casemates of the
    </p>
    <p>
     huge fortresses of the Rhine and the outer line of the French
    </p>
    <p>
     fortifications, searching the redoubts and trenches, but doing no harm
    </p>
    <p>
     to the sleeping armies that lay beneath it; until at last the silence of
    </p>
    <p>
     the night had been broken by the thunder of "Thanatos," and in the
    </p>
    <p>
     twinkling of an eye the Lavender Ray had descended, to turn the village
    </p>
    <p>
     of Champaubert into the smoking crater of a dying volcano. The entire
    </p>
    <p>
     division of artillery had been annihilated, with the exception of a few
    </p>
    <p>
     stragglers, and of the Relay Gun naught remained but a distorted puddle
    </p>
    <p>
     of steel and iron.
    </p>
    <p>
     Long before the news of the horrible retribution visited by the master
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Ring upon Treitschke, the major-general of artillery, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     inventor, Von Heckmann, had reached the United States, Bill Hood,
    </p>
    <p>
     sitting in the wireless receiving station of the Naval Observatory at
    </p>
    <p>
     Georgetown, had received through the ether a message from his mysterious
    </p>
    <p>
     correspondent in the north that sent him hurrying to the White House.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pax had called the Naval Observatory and had transmitted the following
    </p>
    <p>
     ultimatum, repeating it, as was his custom, three times:
    </p>
    <p>
     "_To the President of the United States and to All Mankind:_
    </p>
    <p>
     "I have put the nations to the test and found them wanting. The
    </p>
    <p>
     solemn treaty entered into by the ambassadors of the belligerent
    </p>
    <p>
     nations at Washington has been violated. My attempt by harmless
    </p>
    <p>
     means to compel the cessation of hostilities and the abolition of
    </p>
    <p>
     war has failed. I cannot trust the nations of the earth. Their
    </p>
    <p>
     selfishness, their bloodthirstiness, and greed, will inevitably
    </p>
    <p>
     prevent their fulfilling their agreements with me or keeping the
    </p>
    <p>
     terms of their treaties with one another, which they regard, as
    </p>
    <p>
     they themselves declare, merely as 'scraps of paper.' The time has
    </p>
    <p>
     come for me to compel peace. I am the dictator of human destiny and
    </p>
    <p>
     my will is law. War shall cease. On the 10th day of September I
    </p>
    <p>
     shall shift the axis of the earth until the North Pole shall be in
    </p>
    <p>
     the region of Strassburg and the South Pole in New Zealand. The
    </p>
    <p>
     habitable zone of the earth will be hereafter in South Africa,
    </p>
    <p>
     South and Central America, and regions now unfrequented by man. The
    </p>
    <p>
     nations must migrate and a new life in which war is unknown must
    </p>
    <p>
     begin upon the globe. This is my last message to the human race.
    </p>
    <p>
     "PAX."
    </p>
    <p>
     The conference of ambassadors summoned by the President to the White
    </p>
    <p>
     House that afternoon exhibited a character in striking contrast with the
    </p>
    <p>
     first, at which Von Koenitz and the ambassadors from France, Russia, and
    </p>
    <p>
     England had had their memorable disagreement. It was a serious,
    </p>
    <p>
     apprehensive, and subdued group of gentlemen that gathered round the
    </p>
    <p>
     great mahogany table in the Cabinet chamber to debate what course of
    </p>
    <p>
     action the nations should pursue to avert the impending calamity to
    </p>
    <p>
     mankind. For that Pax could shift the axis of the earth, or blow the
    </p>
    <p>
     globe clean out of its orbit into space, if he chose to do so, no one
    </p>
    <p>
     doubted any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
     And first it fell as the task of the ambassador representing the
    </p>
    <p>
     Imperial German Commissioners to assure his distinguished colleagues
    </p>
    <p>
     that his nation disavowed and denied all responsibility for the conduct
    </p>
    <p>
     of General Treitschke in bombarding Paris after the hour set for the
    </p>
    <p>
     armistice. It was unjust and contrary to the dictates of reason, he
    </p>
    <p>
     argued, to hold the government of a nation comprising sixty-five
    </p>
    <p>
     millions of human beings and five millions of armed men accountable for
    </p>
    <p>
     the actions of a single individual. He spoke passionately, eloquently,
    </p>
    <p>
     persuasively, and at the conclusion of his speech the ambassadors
    </p>
    <p>
     present were forced to acknowledge that what he said was true, and to
    </p>
    <p>
     accept without reservation his plausible assurances that the Imperial
    </p>
    <p>
     German Commissioners had no thought but to cooperate with the other
    </p>
    <p>
     governments in bringing about a lasting peace such as Pax demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the immediate question was, had not the time for this gone by? Was
    </p>
    <p>
     it not too late to convince the master of the Flying Ring that his
    </p>
    <p>
     orders would be obeyed? Could anything be done to avert the calamity he
    </p>
    <p>
     threatened to bring upon the earth--to prevent the conversion of Europe
    </p>
    <p>
     into a barren waste of ice fields? For Pax had announced that he had
    </p>
    <p>
     spoken for the last time and that the fate of Europe was sealed. All the
    </p>
    <p>
     ambassadors agreed that a general European immigration was practically
    </p>
    <p>
     impossible; and as a last resort it was finally decided to transmit to
    </p>
    <p>
     Pax, through the Georgetown station, a wireless message signed by all
    </p>
    <p>
     the ambassadors of the belligerent nations, solemnly agreeing within one
    </p>
    <p>
     week to disband their armies and to destroy all their munitions and
    </p>
    <p>
     implements of war. This message was delivered to Hood, with instructions
    </p>
    <p>
     for its immediate delivery. All that afternoon and evening the operator
    </p>
    <p>
     sat in the observatory, calling over and over again the three letters
    </p>
    <p>
     that marked mankind's only communication with the controller of its
    </p>
    <p>
     destiny:
    </p>
    <p>
     "PAX--PAX--PAX!"
    </p>
    <p>
     But no answer came. For long, weary hours Hood waited, his ears glued to
    </p>
    <p>
     the receivers. An impenetrable silence surrounded the master of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Ring. Pax had spoken. He would say no more. Late that night Hood
    </p>
    <p>
     reluctantly returned to the White House and informed the President that
    </p>
    <p>
     he was unable to deliver the message of the nations.
    </p>
    <p>
     And meantime Prof. Bennie Hooker, with Marc and Edouard, struggled
    </p>
    <p>
     across the wilderness of Labrador, following the Iron Rail that led to
    </p>
    <p>
     the hiding-place of the master of the world.

    <p>
     The terrible fate of the German expeditionary force is too well known to
    </p>
    <p>
     require comment. As has been already told, the _Sea Fox_ had sailed from
    </p>
    <p>
     Amsterdam twelve days after the conference in the War Office at Mainz
    </p>
    <p>
     between General von Helmuth and Professor von Schwenitz. Once north of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Orkneys it had encountered fair weather, and it had reached Hamilton
    </p>
    <p>
     Inlet in ten days without mishap, and with the men and animals in the
    </p>
    <p>
     best of condition. At Rigolet the men had disembarked and loaded their
    </p>
    <p>
     howitzers, mules, and supplies upon the flat-bottomed barges brought
    </p>
    <p>
     with them for that purpose. Thirty French and Indian guides had been
    </p>
    <p>
     engaged, and five days later the expedition, towed by the powerful motor
    </p>
    <p>
     launches, had started up the river toward the chain of lakes lying
    </p>
    <p>
     northwest toward Ungava. Every one was in the best of spirits and
    </p>
    <p>
     everything moved with customary German precision like clockwork. Nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     had been forgotten, not even the pungent invention of a Berlin chemist
    </p>
    <p>
     to discourage mosquitoes. Without labour, without anxiety, the fourteen
    </p>
    <p>
     barges bored through the swift currents and at last reached a great lake
    </p>
    <p>
     that lay like a silver mirror for miles about them. The moon rose and
    </p>
    <p>
     turned the boats into weird shapes as they ploughed through the gray
    </p>
    <p>
     mists--a strange and terrible sight for the Nascopees lurking in the
    </p>
    <p>
     underbrush along the shore. And while the men smoked and sang "Die Wacht
    </p>
    <p>
     am Rhein," listening to the trill of the ripples against the bows, the
    </p>
    <p>
     foremost motorboat grounded.
    </p>
    <p>
     The momentum of the barge immediately following could not be checked,
    </p>
    <p>
     and she in turn drove into what seemed to be a mud bank. At about the
    </p>
    <p>
     same instant the other barges struck bottom. Intense excitement and
    </p>
    <p>
     confusion prevailed among the members of the expedition, since they were
    </p>
    <p>
     almost out of sight of land and the draft of the motorboats was only
    </p>
    <p>
     nineteen inches. But no efforts could move the barges from where they
    </p>
    <p>
     were. All night long the propellers churned the gleaming water of the
    </p>
    <p>
     lake to foam, but without result. Each and every barge and boat was hard
    </p>
    <p>
     and fast aground, and when the gray daylight came stealing across the
    </p>
    <p>
     lake there was no lake to be seen, only a reeking marsh, covered for
    </p>
    <p>
     miles with a welter of green slime and decaying vegetable matter across
    </p>
    <p>
     which it would seem no human being or animal could flounder. As far as
    </p>
    <p>
     the eye could reach lay only a blackish ooze. And with the sun came
    </p>
    <p>
     millions of mosquitoes and flies, and drove the men and mules frantic
    </p>
    <p>
     with their stings.
    </p>
    <p>
     Only one man, Ludwig Helmer, a gun driver from Potsdam, survived. Half
    </p>
    <p>
     mad with the flies and nearly naked, he found his way somehow across the
    </p>
    <p>
     quaking bog, after all his comrades had died of thirst, and reached a
    </p>
    <p>
     tribe of Nascopees, who took him to the coast. A great explosion, they
    </p>
    <p>
     told him, had torn the River Nascopee from its bed and diverted its
    </p>
    <p>
     course. The lakes that it fed had all dried up.
    </p>
    <p>
     *       *       *       *       *
    </p>
    <p>
     Blinded by perspiration, sweltering under the heavy burden of their
    </p>
    <p>
     outfit, goaded almost to frenzy by the black flies and mosquitoes,
    </p>
    <p>
     Hooker and Marc and Edouard staggered through the brush, following the
    </p>
    <p>
     monorail. They had already reached the summit of the Height of Land and
    </p>
    <p>
     where now working down the northern slope in the direction of Ungava.
    </p>
    <p>
     The land was barren beyond the imagination of the unimaginative Bennie.
    </p>
    <p>
     Small dwarfed trees struggled for a footing amid the lichen-covered
    </p>
    <p>
     outcroppings and sun-dried moss of the hollows. The slightest rise
    </p>
    <p>
     showed mile upon mile of great waste undulating interminably in every
    </p>
    <p>
     direction. The heat shimmering off the rocks was almost suffocating. At
    </p>
    <p>
     noon on September 10th they threw themselves into the shade of a narrow
    </p>
    <p>
     ledge, boiled some tea, and smoked their pipes, wildly fanning the air
    </p>
    <p>
     to drive away the swarms of insects that attacked them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hooker was half drunk from lack of sleep and water. Already once or
    </p>
    <p>
     twice he had caught himself wandering when talking to Marc and Edouard.
    </p>
    <p>
     The whole thing was like a horrible, disgusting nightmare. And then he
    </p>
    <p>
     suddenly became aware that the two Indians were staring intently through
    </p>
    <p>
     the clouds of mosquitoes over the tree tops to the eastward. Through the
    </p>
    <p>
     sweat that trickled into his eyes he tried to make out what they could
    </p>
    <p>
     see. But he could discern nothing except mosquitoes. And then he thought
    </p>
    <p>
     he saw a mosquito larger than all the others. He waved at it, but it
    </p>
    <p>
     remained where it was. A slight breeze momentarily wafted the swarm
    </p>
    <p>
     away, and he still saw the big mosquito hovering over the horizon. Then
    </p>
    <p>
     he heard Marc cry out:
    </p>
    <p>
     "_Quelque chose vol en l'air!_"
    </p>
    <p>
     He rubbed the moisture out of his eyes and stared at the mosquito, which
    </p>
    <p>
     was growing bigger every minute. With the velocity of a projectile, this
    </p>
    <p>
     monstrous insect, or whatever it was, came sweeping up behind them from
    </p>
    <p>
     the Height of Land, soaring into the zenith in a great parabola, until
    </p>
    <p>
     with a shiver of excitement Bennie recognized that it was the Flying
    </p>
    <p>
     Ring.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's him," he chattered emphatically, if ungrammatically.
    </p>
    <p>
     Marc and Edouard nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     "_Oui, oui!_" they cried in unison. "_C'est celui que vous cherchez!_"
    </p>
    <p>
     "_Il retourne chez lui_," said Marc.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then Bennie, without offering any explanation, found himself dancing
    </p>
    <p>
     up and down upon the rocks in the dizzying sun, waving his hat and
    </p>
    <p>
     shouting to the Father of the Marionettes. What he shouted he never
    </p>
    <p>
     knew. And Marc and Edouard both shouted, too. But the master of the Ring
    </p>
    <p>
     heard them not, or if he heard he paid them no attention. Nearer and
    </p>
    <p>
     nearer came the Ring, until Bennie could see the gleaming cylinder of
    </p>
    <p>
     its great steel circle. At a distance of about two miles it swept
    </p>
    <p>
     through the air over a low ridge, and settled toward the earth in the
    </p>
    <p>
     direction of Ungava.
    </p>
    <p>
     "He only goes ten mile maybe," announced Marc confidently. "_Un petit
    </p>
    <p>
     bout de chemin._ We get there to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
     On they struggled beside the Rail, but now hope ran high. Bennie sang
    </p>
    <p>
     and whistled, unmindful of the mosquitoes and black flies that renewed
    </p>
    <p>
     their attacks with unremitting ferocity. The sun lowered itself into the
    </p>
    <p>
     pine trees, shooting dazzling shafts through the low branches, and then
    </p>
    <p>
     sank in a welter of crimson-yellow light. The sky turned gray in the
    </p>
    <p>
     east; faint stars twinkled through the quivering waves that still shook
    </p>
    <p>
     from the overheated rocks. It turned cold and the mosquitoes departed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hugging the Rail, they staggered on, now over shaking muskeg, now
    </p>
    <p>
     through thickets of tangled brush, now on great ledges of barren rock,
    </p>
    <p>
     and then across caribou barrens knee-deep in dry and crackling moss.
    </p>
    <p>
     Darkness fell and prudence dictated that they should make camp. But in
    </p>
    <p>
     their excitement they trudged on, until presently a pale glow behind the
    </p>
    <p>
     dwarfed trees showed that the moon was rising. They boiled the water,
    </p>
    <p>
     made tea, and cooked some biscuits. Soon they could see to pursue their
    </p>
    <p>
     way.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Most there now," encouraged Marc.
    </p>
    <p>
     Presently, instead of descending, they found the land was rising again,
    </p>
    <p>
     and forcing their way through the undergrowth they struggled up a rocky
    </p>
    <p>
     hillside, perhaps three hundred feet in height. Marc was in the lead,
    </p>
    <p>
     with Bennie a few feet behind him. As they reached the crest the Indian
    </p>
    <p>
     turned and pointed to something in front of him that Bennie was unable
    </p>
    <p>
     to distinguish.
    </p>
    <p>
     "_Nous sommes arrivees_," he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
     With his heart thumping from the exertion of the climb, Bennie crawled
    </p>
    <p>
     up beside his guide and found himself confronted by a strong barbed-wire
    </p>
    <p>
     entanglement affixed to iron stanchions firmly imbedded in the rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were on the top of a ridge that dropped away abruptly at their feet
    </p>
    <p>
     into a valley, perhaps a mile in width, terminating on the other side in
    </p>
    <p>
     perpendicular cliffs, estimated by Bennie to be about eight hundred or a
    </p>
    <p>
     thousand feet in height. Although the entanglement was by no means
    </p>
    <p>
     impassable, it was a distinct obstacle and one they preferred to tackle
    </p>
    <p>
     by daylight. Moreover, it indicated that their company was undesired.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were in the presence of an unknown quantity, the master of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Flying Ring. Whether he was a malign or a benevolent influence, this
    </p>
    <p>
     Father of the Marionettes, they could not tell.
    </p>
    <p>
     With his back propped against a small spruce Bennie focused his glasses
    </p>
    <p>
     upon dim shapes barely discernible in the midst of the valley. He was
    </p>
    <p>
     thrilled by a deep excitement, a strange fear. What would he see? What
    </p>
    <p>
     mysteries would those vague forms disclose? The shadows cast by the
    </p>
    <p>
     cliffs and a light mist gathering in the low ground made it difficult to
    </p>
    <p>
     see; and then, even as he looked, the moon rose higher and shone through
    </p>
    <p>
     something in the middle of the valley that looked like a tall, grisly
    </p>
    <p>
     skeleton. It seemed to have legs and arms, an odd mushroom-shaped head,
    </p>
    <p>
     and endless ribs. Below and at its feet were other and vaguer
    </p>
    <p>
     shapes--flat domes or cupolas, bombproofs perhaps, buildings of some
    </p>
    <p>
     sort--Pax's home beyond peradventure.
    </p>
    <p>
     As he looked through the glasses at the skeleton-like tower Bennie had
    </p>
    <p>
     an extraordinary feeling of having seen it all before somewhere. As in a
    </p>
    <p>
     long-forgotten dream he remembered Tesla's tower near Smithtown, on Long
    </p>
    <p>
     Island. And this was Tesla's tower, naught else! It is a strange thing,
    </p>
    <p>
     how at great crises of our lives come feelings of anticipatory
    </p>
    <p>
     knowledge. There is, indeed, nothing new under the sun; else had Bennie
    </p>
    <p>
     been more afraid. As it was, he saw only Tesla's Smithtown tower with
    </p>
    <p>
     its head like a young mushroom. And at the same time there flashed into
    </p>
    <p>
     his memory: "Childe Harold to the Dark Tower Came." Over and over he
    </p>
    <p>
     repeated it mechanically, feeling that he might be one of those of whom
    </p>
    <p>
     the poet had sung. Yet he had not read the lines for years:
    </p>
    <p>
     _Burningly it came on me all at once,
    </p>
    <p>
     This was the place!...
    </p>
    <p>
     What in the midst lay but the Tower itself?_
    </p>
    <p>
     His eyes searched the shadows round the base of the tower, for his ears
    </p>
    <p>
     had already caught a faint, almost inaudible throbbing that seemed to
    </p>
    <p>
     grow from moment to moment. There certainly was a dull vibration in the
    </p>
    <p>
     air, a vibration like the distant hum of machinery. Suddenly old Edouard
    </p>
    <p>
     touched Bennie upon the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     "_Regardez!_" he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some transformation was happening in the hood of the tower. From a black
    </p>
    <p>
     opaque object it began to turn a dull red and to diffuse a subdued glow,
    </p>
    <p>
     while the hum turned into a distinct whir.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bennie became almost hysterical with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
     Soon the hood of the tower had turned white and the glow had increased
    </p>
    <p>
     until the whole valley was lit up with a suffused and gentle light. The
    </p>
    <p>
     Ring could be distinctly seen about half a mile away, resting upon a
    </p>
    <p>
     huge circular support.
    </p>
    <p>
     "_C'est le feu!_" grunted Marc. "_C'est ainsi que l'on fait danser les
    </p>
    <p>
     marionettes!_"
    </p>
    <p>
     There was no doubt that the hood of the tower was in fact white hot, for
    </p>
    <p>
     the perpendicular cliffs of the mountain across the valley sharply
    </p>
    <p>
     reflected the light that it disseminated. The humming whir of the great
    </p>
    <p>
     alternator rose gradually into a scream like the outcry of some angry
    </p>
    <p>
     thing. And then unexpectedly a shaft of pale lavender light shot out
    </p>
    <p>
     from the glowing hood and lost itself in the blackness of the midnight
    </p>
    <p>
     sky. Now appeared a wonderful and beautiful spectacle: immediately above
    </p>
    <p>
     the point where the rays disappeared into the ether hundreds of points
    </p>
    <p>
     of yellow fire suddenly sprang into being in the sky, darting hither and
    </p>
    <p>
     thither like fireflies, some moving slowly and others with such speed
    </p>
    <p>
     they appeared as even, luminous lines.
    </p>
    <p>
     "_Les marionettes! Les marionettes!_" Marc cried trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not at all! Not at all! They are meteorites!" answered Bennie, entirely
    </p>
    <p>
     engrossed in the scientific phase of the matter and forgetting that he
    </p>
    <p>
     did not speak the other's language. "Space is jammed full of meteoric
    </p>
    <p>
     dust. The larger particles, which strike our atmosphere and which ignite
    </p>
    <p>
     by friction, form shooting stars. The Ray--the Lavender Ray--reaching
    </p>
    <p>
     out into the most distant regions of space meets them in countless
    </p>
    <p>
     numbers and disintegrates them, surrounding them with glowing
    </p>
    <p>
     atmospheres. By George, though, if he starts in playing the Ray upon
    </p>
    <p>
     that cliff we've got to stand from under! Look here, boys," he shouted,
    </p>
    <p>
     "stuff something in your ears." He seized his handkerchief, tore it
    </p>
    <p>
     apart, and, making two plugs, thrust them into the openings of his ears
    </p>
    <p>
     as far as the drums. The others in wonderment followed his example.
    </p>
    <p>
     "He's going to rock the earth!" cried Bennie Hooker. "He's going to rock
    </p>
    <p>
     the earth again!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly the Lavender Ray swung through the ether, followed by its
    </p>
    <p>
     millions of meteorites, dipping downward toward the northern side of the
    </p>
    <p>
     valley and sinking ever lower and lower toward the cliff. Bennie threw
    </p>
    <p>
     himself flat on his stomach upon the ridge, pressing his hands to his
    </p>
    <p>
     ears, and the others, feeling that something terrible was going to
    </p>
    <p>
     happen, followed his example. Nearer and nearer toward the ridge dropped
    </p>
    <p>
     the Ray. Bennie held his breath. Another instant and there came a
    </p>
    <p>
     blinding splash of yellow light, a crash like thunder, and a roar that
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to tear the mountain from its base. The earth shook. Into the
    </p>
    <p>
     zenith sprang a flame of incandescent vapour a mile in height. The
    </p>
    <p>
     tumult increased. Vivid blue flashes of lightning shot out from the spot
    </p>
    <p>
     upon which the Ray played. The air was filled with thunderings, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     ground beneath them rose and fell and swung from side to side. Then came
    </p>
    <p>
     a mighty wind, nay, a cyclone, and gravel and broken branches fell upon
    </p>
    <p>
     them, and suffocating clouds of dust filled their eyes and shut out from
    </p>
    <p>
     time to time what was occurring in the valley. The face of the cliff
    </p>
    <p>
     glowed like the interior of a furnace, and the blazing yellow blast of
    </p>
    <p>
     glowing helium shot over their heads and off into space, making the
    </p>
    <p>
     night sky light as day.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment they all lay stunned and sightless. Then the discharge
    </p>
    <p>
     appeared to diminish both in volume and in intensity. The air cleared
    </p>
    <p>
     somewhat and the ground no longer trembled. The burst of flame slowly
    </p>
    <p>
     subsided, like a fountain that is being gradually turned off. Either the
    </p>
    <p>
     Ring man wasn't going to rock the earth or he had lost control of his
    </p>
    <p>
     machinery.
    </p>
    <p>
     Something was clearly going wrong. Showers of sparks fell from the hood
    </p>
    <p>
     and occasionally huge glowing masses of molten metal dropped from it.
    </p>
    <p>
     And now the Lavender Ray began slowly to sweep down the face of the
    </p>
    <p>
     cliff; and the yellow blast of helium gradually faded away until it was
    </p>
    <p>
     scarcely visible. The roar of the alternator died down, first to a hum
    </p>
    <p>
     and then to a purr.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Something's busted," thought Bennie, "and he's shut it off."
    </p>
    <p>
     The Ray had now reached the bottom of the cliff and was sweeping across
    </p>
    <p>
     the ground toward the base of the tower, its path being marked by a
    </p>
    <p>
     small travelling volcano that hurled its smoke and steam high into the
    </p>
    <p>
     air. It was evident to Bennie that the hood of the tower was slowly
    </p>
    <p>
     turning over, and that the now fast-fading Ray would presently play upon
    </p>
    <p>
     its base and the adjacent cupola in which the master of the Ring was
    </p>
    <p>
     probably attempting to control his recalcitrant machinery.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then Bennie lost consciousness.

    <p>
     *       *       *       *       *
    </p>
    <p>
     A splash of rain. He awoke, and found himself lying by the barbed-wire
    </p>
    <p>
     fence in the graying light of dawn. His muscles were stiff and sore, but
    </p>
    <p>
     he felt a strange sense of exhilaration. A mist was driving across the
    </p>
    <p>
     valley and enshrouding the scene of the night's debacle. Through the
    </p>
    <p>
     rain gusts he could see, still standing, the wreck of the tower, with a
    </p>
    <p>
     fragment of melted inductor drooping from its apex--and a long way off
    </p>
    <p>
     the Ring. The base of the tower and its surroundings were lost in mist.
    </p>
    <p>
     He crawled to his knees and looked about him for Marc and Edouard, but
    </p>
    <p>
     they had disappeared. His field glasses lay beside him, and he picked
    </p>
    <p>
     them up and raised himself to his feet. Like stout Cortés, silent upon
    </p>
    <p>
     his peak in Darien, he surveyed the Pacific of his dreams. For the Ring
    </p>
    <p>
     was still there! Pax might be annihilated, his machinery destroyed, but
    </p>
    <p>
     the secret remained--and it was his, Bennie Hooker's, of Appian Way,
    </p>
    <p>
     Cambridge, Massachusetts! In his excitement, in getting over the fence
    </p>
    <p>
     he tore a jagged hole in what was left of his sporting suit, but in a
    </p>
    <p>
     moment more he was scrambling down the ridge into the ravine.
    </p>
    <p>
     He found it no easy task to climb down the jagged face of the cliff, but
    </p>
    <p>
     twenty minutes of stiff work landed him in the valley and within a
    </p>
    <p>
     thousand yards of the stark remains of the tower. Between where he stood
    </p>
    <p>
     and the devastation caused by the culminating explosion of the night
    </p>
    <p>
     before, the surface of the earth showed the customary ledges of barren
    </p>
    <p>
     rock, the scraggy scattering of firs, and stretches of moss with which
    </p>
    <p>
     he had become so familiar. Behind him the monorail, springing into space
    </p>
    <p>
     from the crest of the hill, ended in the dangling wreckage of a trestle
    </p>
    <p>
     which evidently had terminated in a station, now vanished, near the
    </p>
    <p>
     tower. From his point of observation little of the results of the
    </p>
    <p>
     upheaval was noticeable except the débris, which lay in a film of
    </p>
    <p>
     shattered rock and gravel over the surface of the ground, but as he ran
    </p>
    <p>
     toward the tower the damage caused by the Ray quickly became apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the distance of two hundred yards from the base he paused astounded.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why anything of the tower remained at all was a mystery, explicable only
    </p>
    <p>
     by reason of the skeleton-like character of its construction. All about
    </p>
    <p>
     it the surface had been rent as by an earthquake, and save for a
    </p>
    <p>
     fragment of the dome or bombproof all trace of buildings had
    </p>
    <p>
     disappeared. A glistening lake of leperous-like molten lead lay in the
    </p>
    <p>
     centre of the crater, strangely iridescent. A broad path of destruction,
    </p>
    <p>
     fifty yards or so in width, led from the scene of the disruption to the
    </p>
    <p>
     precipice against which the Ray had played. The face of the cliff itself
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed covered with a white coating or powder which gave it a ghostly
    </p>
    <p>
     sheen. Moreover, the rain had turned to snow and already the entire
    </p>
    <p>
     aspect of the valley had changed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bennie stood wonderingly on the edge of this inferno. He was cold,
    </p>
    <p>
     famished, horror-stricken. Like a flash in a pan the mechanism which had
    </p>
    <p>
     rocked the earth and dislocated its axis had blown out; and there was
    </p>
    <p>
     now nothing left to tell the story, for its inventor had flashed out
    </p>
    <p>
     with it into eternity. At his very feet a conscious human being, only
    </p>
    <p>
     twelve short hours before, had by virtue of his stupendous brain been
    </p>
    <p>
     able to generate and control a force capable of destroying the planet
    </p>
    <p>
     itself, and now----! He was gone! It was all gone! Unless somewhere hard
    </p>
    <p>
     by was hovering amid the whirling snowflakes that which might be his
    </p>
    <p>
     soul. But Pax would send no more messages! Bennie's journey had gone for
    </p>
    <p>
     naught. He had arrived just too late to talk it all over with his
    </p>
    <p>
     fellow-scientist, and discuss those little improvements on Hiroshito's
    </p>
    <p>
     theory. Pax was dead!
    </p>
    <p>
     He sat down wearily, noticing for the first time that his ears pained
    </p>
    <p>
     him. In his depression and excitement he had totally forgotten the Ring.
    </p>
    <p>
     He wondered how he was ever going to get back to Cambridge. And then as
    </p>
    <p>
     he raised his hand to adjust his Glengarry he saw it awaiting
    </p>
    <p>
     him--unscathed. Far to the westward it rested snugly in its gigantic
    </p>
    <p>
     nest of crossbeams, like the head of some colossal decapitated Chinese
    </p>
    <p>
     mandarin. With an involuntary shout he started running down the valley,
    </p>
    <p>
     heedless of his steps. Nearer and higher loomed the steel trestlework
    </p>
    <p>
     upon which rested the giant engine. Panting, he blindly stumbled on,
    </p>
    <p>
     mindful only of the momentous fact that Pax's secret was not lost.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fifty feet above the ground, supported upon a cylindrical trestle of
    </p>
    <p>
     steel girders, rested the body of the car, constructed of aluminum
    </p>
    <p>
     plates in the form of an anchor ring some seventy-five feet in diameter,
    </p>
    <p>
     while over the circular structure of the Ring itself rose a skeleton
    </p>
    <p>
     tower like a tripod, carrying at its summit a huge metal device shaped
    </p>
    <p>
     like a thimble, the open mouth of which pointed downward through the
    </p>
    <p>
     open centre of the machine. Obviously this must be the tractor or
    </p>
    <p>
     radiant engine. There, too, swung far out from the side of the ring on a
    </p>
    <p>
     framework of steel, was the thermic inductor which had played the
    </p>
    <p>
     disintegrating Ray upon the Atlas Mountains and the great cannon of Von
    </p>
    <p>
     Heckmann. The whole affair resembled nothing which he had ever conceived
    </p>
    <p>
     of either in the air, the earth, or the waters under the earth, the
    </p>
    <p>
     bizarre invention of a superhuman mind. It seemed as firmly anchored and
    </p>
    <p>
     as immovable as the Eiffel Tower, and yet Bennie knew that the thing
    </p>
    <p>
     could lift itself into the air and sail off like a ball of thistledown
    </p>
    <p>
     before a breeze. He knew that it could do it, for he had seen it with
    </p>
    <p>
     his own eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     A few steps more brought him into the centre of the circle of steel
    </p>
    <p>
     girders which supported the landing stage. Here the surface of the earth
    </p>
    <p>
     at his feet had been completely denuded and the underlying rock exposed,
    </p>
    <p>
     evidently by some artificial action, the downward blast of gas from the
    </p>
    <p>
     tractor. Even the rock itself had been seared by the discharge; little
    </p>
    <p>
     furrows worn smooth as if by a mountain torrent radiating in all
    </p>
    <p>
     directions from the central point. More than anything it reminded Bennie
    </p>
    <p>
     of the surface of a meteorite, polished and scarred by its rush through
    </p>
    <p>
     the atmosphere. He paused, filled with a kind of awe. The most wonderful
    </p>
    <p>
     engine of all time waited his inspection. The great secret was his
    </p>
    <p>
     alone. The inventor and his associates had been wiped out of existence
    </p>
    <p>
     in a flash, and the Flying Ring was his by every right of treasure
    </p>
    <p>
     trove. In the heart of the Labrador wilderness Prof. Benjamin Hooker of
    </p>
    <p>
     Cambridge, Massachusetts, gave an exultant shout, threw off his coat,
    </p>
    <p>
     and swarmed up the steel ladder leading to the landing stage.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had ascended about halfway when a voice echoed among the girders. A
    </p>
    <p>
     red face was peering down at him over the edge of the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hello!" said the face. "I'm all right, I guess."
    </p>
    <p>
     Bennie gripped tight hold of the ladder, stiff with fear. He thought
    </p>
    <p>
     first of jumping down, changed his mind, and, shutting his eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
     continued automatically climbing up the ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then a hand gripped him under the arm and gave him a lift on to the
    </p>
    <p>
     level floor of the platform. He steadied himself and opened his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before him stood a man in blue overalls, under whose forehead, burned
    </p>
    <p>
     bright red by the Labrador sun, a pair of blue eyes looked out vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
     The man appeared to be waiting for the visitor to make the next move.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good morning," said Bennie, sparring for time. "Well"--he
    </p>
    <p>
     hesitated--"where were you when it happened?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The man looked at him stupidly. "What?" he mumbled. "I--I don't seem to
    </p>
    <p>
     remember. You see--I was in--the condenser room building up the
    </p>
    <p>
     charge--for to-morrow--I mean to-day--sixty thousand volts at the
    </p>
    <p>
     terminals, and the fluid clearing up. I guess I looked out of the window
    </p>
    <p>
     a minute--to see--the fireworks--and then--somehow--I was out on the
    </p>
    <p>
     platform." He shaded his eyes and looked off down the valley at the
    </p>
    <p>
     half-shattered, wrecked tower. "The wind and the smoke!" he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The wind and the smoke--and the dust in my eyes--and now it's all gone
    </p>
    <p>
     to hell! But I guess everything's all right now, if you want to fly." He
    </p>
    <p>
     touched his cap automatically. "We can start whenever you are ready,
    </p>
    <p>
     sir. You see I thought you were gone, too! That would have been a mess!
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm sure you can handle the balancer without Perkins. Poor old Perk! And
    </p>
    <p>
     Hoskins--and the others. All gone, by God! All wiped out! Only me and
    </p>
    <p>
     you left, sir!" He laughed hysterically.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bats in his belfry!" thought Bennie. "Something hit him!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly it came over him that the half-stunned creature thought that he,
    </p>
    <p>
     Bennie Hooker, was Pax, the Master of the World!
    </p>
    <p>
     He took the fellow by the arm. "Come on inside," he said. A plan had
    </p>
    <p>
     already formulated itself in his brain. Even as he was the man might be
    </p>
    <p>
     able to go through his customary duties in handling the Ring. It was not
    </p>
    <p>
     impossible. He had heard of such things, and the thought of the long
    </p>
    <p>
     marches over the frozen barrens and the perilous canoe trip down the
    </p>
    <p>
     coast, contrasted with a swift rush for an hour or two through the
    </p>
    <p>
     sunlit air, gave the professor the courage which might not have availed
    </p>
    <p>
     him otherwise. At the top of a short ladder a trapdoor opened inward,
    </p>
    <p>
     and Bennie found himself in a small compartment scarcely large enough to
    </p>
    <p>
     turn around in, from which a second door opened into the body of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Ring proper.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's all right--to-day," said the man hesitatingly. "I fixed--the
    </p>
    <p>
     air-lock--yesterday, sir. The leak--was here--at the hinge--but it's
    </p>
    <p>
     quite tight--now." He pointed at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good," remarked Bennie. "I'll look around and see how things are."
    </p>
    <p>
     This seemed to him to be eminently safe--and allowing for a program of
    </p>
    <p>
     investigation absolutely essential at the moment. Once he could master
    </p>
    <p>
     the secret of the Ring and be sure that the part of the fellow's brain
    </p>
    <p>
     which controlled the performance of his customary duties had not been
    </p>
    <p>
     injured by the shock of the night before, it might be possible to carry
    </p>
    <p>
     out the daring project which had suggested itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Passing through the inner door of the air-lock he entered the chart room
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Ring, followed stumblingly by his companion. It was warm and
    </p>
    <p>
     cozy; the first warmth Hooker had experienced for nearly a month. It
    </p>
    <p>
     made him feel faint, and he dropped into an armchair and pulled off his
    </p>
    <p>
     Glengarry. The survivor of the explosion, standing awkwardly at his
    </p>
    <p>
     side, fumbled with his cap. Ever and anon he rubbed his head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bennie sank back into the cushions and looked about him. On the opposite
    </p>
    <p>
     wall hung a map of the world on Mercator's Projection, and from a spot
    </p>
    <p>
     in Northern Labrador red lines radiated in all directions, which formed
    </p>
    <p>
     great curved loops, returning to the starting-point.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The flights of the Ring," thought Bennie. "There's the one where they
    </p>
    <p>
     busted the Atlas Mountains," following with his eyes the crimson thread
    </p>
    <p>
     which ran diagonally across the Atlantic, traversed Spain and the
    </p>
    <p>
     Mediterranean, and circling in a narrow loop over the coast of Northern
    </p>
    <p>
     Africa turned back into its original track. Visions came to him of
    </p>
    <p>
     guiding the car for an afternoon jaunt across the Sahara, the gloomy
    </p>
    <p>
     forests of the Congo, into the Antarctic, and thence home in time for
    </p>
    <p>
     afternoon tea, via the Easter Islands, Hawaii, and Alaska. But why stop
    </p>
    <p>
     there? What was to prevent a trip to the moon? Or Mars? Or for that
    </p>
    <p>
     matter into the unknown realms outside the solar system--the fourth
    </p>
    <p>
     dimension, perhaps--or even the fifth dimension----
    </p>
    <p>
     "Excuse me," said the machinist suddenly, "I just forgot--whether you
    </p>
    <p>
     take--cigars or cigarettes. You see I only acted as--table
    </p>
    <p>
     orderly--once--when Smith had that sprain." His hands moved uncertainly
    </p>
    <p>
     on the shelves, beyond the map. The heart of Professor Hooker leaped.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Cigars!" he almost shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
     The man found a box of Havanas and struck a match.
    </p>
    <p>
     The bliss of it! And if there was tobacco there must be food and drink
    </p>
    <p>
     as well. He began to feel strangely exhilarated. But how to handle the
    </p>
    <p>
     man beside him? Pax would certainly never ask the questions that he
    </p>
    <p>
     wished to ask. He smoked rapidly, thinking hard. Of course he might
    </p>
    <p>
     pretend that he, too, had forgotten things. And at first this seemed to
    </p>
    <p>
     be the only way out of the difficulty. Then he had an inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Look here," he remarked, rather severely. "Something's happened to you.
    </p>
    <p>
     You say you've forgotten what occurred yesterday? How do I know but you
    </p>
    <p>
     have forgotten everything you ever knew? You remember your name?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "My name, sir?" The man laughed in a foolish fashion. "Why--of course I
    </p>
    <p>
     remember--my name. I wouldn't--be likely--to forget--that:
    </p>
    <p>
     Atterbury--I'm Atterbury--electrician of the _Chimaera_." And he drew
    </p>
    <p>
     himself up.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's all right," said Bennie, "but what were we doing yesterday? What
    </p>
    <p>
     is the very last thing that you can go back to?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The man wrinkled his forehead. "The last thing? Why, sir, you told us
    </p>
    <p>
     you were going--to turn over the pole a bit--and freeze up Europe. I was
    </p>
    <p>
     up here--loading the condenser--when you cut me off from the alternator.
    </p>
    <p>
     I opened the switch--and put on the electrometer to see--if we had
    </p>
    <p>
     enough. Next--everything was clouded, and I went--over to the window to
    </p>
    <p>
     see--what was going on."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," commented Bennie approvingly, "all right so far. What happened
    </p>
    <p>
     then?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, after that, sir, after that, there was the Ray of course, and
    </p>
    <p>
     er--I don't seem to remember--oh, yes, a short circuit--and I ran--out
    </p>
    <p>
     on the platform--forgot all about the danger! After that, everything's
    </p>
    <p>
     confused. It's like a dream. Your coming up--the ladder--seemed--to wake
    </p>
    <p>
     me up." The machinist smiled sheepishly.
    </p>
    <p>
     The plan was working well. Professor Hooker was learning things fast.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you think that the two of us can fly the _Chimaera_ south again?" he
    </p>
    <p>
     asked, inspecting the map.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why not?" answered Atterbury. "The balancer is working--better
    </p>
    <p>
     now--and--doesn't take--much attention--and you can lay the course--and
    </p>
    <p>
     manage--the landing. I was going to put a fresh uranium cylinder in the
    </p>
    <p>
     tractor this morning--but I--forgot."
    </p>
    <p>
     "There you go, forgetting again!" growled Bennie, realizing that his
    </p>
    <p>
     only excuse for asking questions hung on this fiction. And there were
    </p>
    <p>
     many, many more questions that he must ask before he would be able to
    </p>
    <p>
     fly. "You don't seem quite right in your coco this morning, Atterbury,"
    </p>
    <p>
     he said. "I think we'll look things over a bit--the condenser first."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Very well, sir." Atterbury turned and groped his way through a doorway,
    </p>
    <p>
     and they passed first into what appeared to be a storage-battery room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Huge glass tanks filled with amber-coloured fluid, in which numerous
    </p>
    <p>
     parallel plates were supported, lined the walls from floor to ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
     An ammeter on the wall caught Bennie's attention. "Weston Direct Reading
    </p>
    <p>
     A. C. Ammeter," he read on the dial. Alternate current! What were they
    </p>
    <p>
     doing with an alternating current in the storage-battery room? His eyes
    </p>
    <p>
     followed the wires along the wall. Yes, they ran to the terminals of the
    </p>
    <p>
     battery. It dawned upon him that there might be something here undreamed
    </p>
    <p>
     of in electrical engineering--a storage battery for an alternating
    </p>
    <p>
     current!
    </p>
    <p>
     The electrician closed a row of switches, brought the two polished brass
    </p>
    <p>
     spheres of the discharger within striking distance, and instantly a
    </p>
    <p>
     blinding current of sparks roared between the terminals. He had been
    </p>
    <p>
     right. This battery not only was charged by an alternating current, but
    </p>
    <p>
     delivered one of high potential. He peered into the cells, racking his
    </p>
    <p>
     brain for an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Atterbury," said he meditatively, "did I ever tell you why they do
    </p>
    <p>
     that?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," answered the man. "You--told me--once. The two metals--in the
    </p>
    <p>
     electrolyte--come down--on the plates--in alternate films--as--the
    </p>
    <p>
     current changes direction. But you never told me--what the electrolyte
    </p>
    <p>
     was--I don't suppose--you--would be willing to now, would you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "H'm," said Bennie, "some time, maybe."
    </p>
    <p>
     But this cue was all that he required. A clever scheme! Pax had formed
    </p>
    <p>
     layers of molecular thickness of two different metals in alternation by
    </p>
    <p>
     the to-and-fro swing of his charging current. When the battery
    </p>
    <p>
     discharged the metals went into solution, each plate becoming
    </p>
    <p>
     alternately positive and negative. He wondered what Pax had used for an
    </p>
    <p>
     electrolyte that enabled him to get a metallic deposit at each
    </p>
    <p>
     electrode. And he wondered also why the metals did not alloy. But it
    </p>
    <p>
     would not do for him to linger too long over a mere detail of equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
     And he turned away to continue his tour of inspection, a tour which
    </p>
    <p>
     occupied most of the morning, and during which he found a well-stocked
    </p>
    <p>
     gallery and made himself a cup of coffee.[5]
    </p>
    <p>
     [Footnote 5: He even climbed with Atterbury to the very summit of the
    </p>
    <p>
     tractor, where he discovered that his original guess had been correct
    </p>
    <p>
     and that the car rose from the earth rocket fashion, due to the back
    </p>
    <p>
     pressure of the radiant discharge from a massive cylinder of uranium
    </p>
    <p>
     contained in the tractor. Against this block played a disintegrating ray
    </p>
    <p>
     from a small thermic inductor, the inner construction of which he was
    </p>
    <p>
     not able to determine, although it was obviously different from his own,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the coils were wound in a curious manner which he did not
    </p>
    <p>
     understand. There might be something in Hiroshito's theory after all.
    </p>
    <p>
     The cylinder of the tractor pointed directly downward so that the blast
    </p>
    <p>
     was discharged through the very centre of the Ring, but it could be
    </p>
    <p>
     swung through a small angle in any direction, and by means of this
    </p>
    <p>
     slight deflection the horizontal motion of the machine secured. Perhaps
    </p>
    <p>
     the most interesting feature of the mechanism was that the Ring appeared
    </p>
    <p>
     to have automatic stability, for the angle of the direction in which the
    </p>
    <p>
     tractor was pointed was controlled not only by a pair of gyroscopes
    </p>
    <p>
     which kept the Ring on an even keel, but also by a manometric valve
    </p>
    <p>
     causing it to fly at a fixed height above the earth's surface. Should it
    </p>
    <p>
     start to rise, the diminished pressure of the atmosphere operating on
    </p>
    <p>
     the valve swung the tractor more to one side, and the horizontal
    </p>
    <p>
     acceleration was thus increased at the expense of the vertical.]
    </p>
    <p>
     But the more he learned about the mechanism of the Ring the greater
    </p>
    <p>
     became his misgivings about undertaking the return journey alone with
    </p>
    <p>
     Atterbury through the air. If they were to go, the start must be made
    </p>
    <p>
     within a few days, for the condenser held its charge but a comparatively
    </p>
    <p>
     short time, and its energy was necessary for starting the Ring. When
    </p>
    <p>
     freshly charged it supplied current for the thermic inductor for nearly
    </p>
    <p>
     three minutes, but the metallic films, deposited on the plates,
    </p>
    <p>
     dissolved slowly in the fluid, and after three or four days there
    </p>
    <p>
     remained only enough for a thirty-second run, hardly enough to lift the
    </p>
    <p>
     Ring from the earth. Once in the air, the downward blast from the
    </p>
    <p>
     tractor operated a turbine alternator mounted on a skeleton framework at
    </p>
    <p>
     the centre of the Ring, and the current supplied by this machine enabled
    </p>
    <p>
     the Ring to continue its flight indefinitely, or until the cylinder of
    </p>
    <p>
     uranium was completely disintegrated.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet to trek back over the route by which he had come appeared to be
    </p>
    <p>
     equally impossible. There was little likelihood that the two Indians
    </p>
    <p>
     would return; they were probably already thirty miles on their way back
    </p>
    <p>
     to the coast. If only he could get word to Thornton or some of those
    </p>
    <p>
     chaps at Washington they might send a relief expedition! But a ship
    </p>
    <p>
     would be weeks in getting to the coast, and how could he live in the
    </p>
    <p>
     meantime? There were provisions for only a few days in the Ring, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     storehouse in the valley had been wiped out of existence. Only an
    </p>
    <p>
     aeroplane could do the trick. And then he thought of Burke, his
    </p>
    <p>
     classmate--Burke who had devoted his life to heavier-than-air machines,
    </p>
    <p>
     and who, since his memorable flight across the Atlantic in the _Stormy
    </p>
    <p>
     Petrol_, had been a national hero. Burke could reach him in ten hours,
    </p>
    <p>
     but how could _he_ reach Burke? In the heart of the frozen wilderness of
    </p>
    <p>
     Labrador he might as well be on another planet, as far as communication
    </p>
    <p>
     with the civilized world was concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
     A burst of sunlight shot through the window and formed an oval patch on
    </p>
    <p>
     the floor at his feet. The weather was clearing. He went out upon the
    </p>
    <p>
     platform. Patches of blue sky appeared overhead. As he gazed
    </p>
    <p>
     disconsolately across the valley toward the tower, his eye caught the
    </p>
    <p>
     glisten of something high in the air. From the top of the wreckage five
    </p>
    <p>
     thin shining lines ran parallel across the sky and disappeared in a
    </p>
    <p>
     small cloud which hung low over the face of the cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The antennæ!" exclaimed Bennie. "A wireless to Burke." Burke would
    </p>
    <p>
     come; he knew Burke. A thousand miles overland was nothing to him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hadn't he wagered five thousand dollars at the club that he would fly to
    </p>
    <p>
     the pole and bring back Peary's flag--with no takers? Why, Burke would
    </p>
    <p>
     take him home with as little trouble as a taxicab. And then, aghast, he
    </p>
    <p>
     remembered the complete destruction in the valley. The wireless plant
    </p>
    <p>
     had gone with the rest. He ran back into the chart room and called
    </p>
    <p>
     Atterbury.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can we get off a message to Washington?" he demanded. "The wires are
    </p>
    <p>
     still up, and we have the condenser."
    </p>
    <p>
     "We might, sir, if it's not--a long one, though you've always said there
    </p>
    <p>
     was danger in running the engine with the car bolted down. We did it the
    </p>
    <p>
     time the big machine burnt out a coil. I can throw--a wire--over the
    </p>
    <p>
     antennæ with a rocket--and join up--with the turbine machine. It will
    </p>
    <p>
     increase--our wave length, but they ought to pick us up."
    </p>
    <p>
     "We'll try it, anyway," announced Bennie.
    </p>
    <p>
     He inspected the chart and measured the distance in an airline from
    </p>
    <p>
     Boston to the point where the red lines converged. It was a trifle less
    </p>
    <p>
     than the distance between Boston and Chicago. Burke had done that in
    </p>
    <p>
     nine hours on the trial trip of his trans-Atlantic monoplane. If the
    </p>
    <p>
     machine was in order and Burke started in the morning he would be with
    </p>
    <p>
     them by sunset, if he didn't get lost. But Bennie knew that Burke could
    </p>
    <p>
     drive his machine by dead reckoning and strike within a few leagues of a
    </p>
    <p>
     target a thousand miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
     A muffled roar outside interrupted his musings, and running out on the
    </p>
    <p>
     platform again he found Atterbury attaching the cord of the aluminum
    </p>
    <p>
     ribbon, which the rocket had carried up and over the antennæ, to one of
    </p>
    <p>
     the brush bars of the alternator.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nearly ready, sir," he said. "We'd best--lock the storm bolts--to hold
    </p>
    <p>
     her down--in case we have--to crowd on the power. We've got to
    </p>
    <p>
     use--pretty near the full lift--to get the alternator up--to the proper
    </p>
    <p>
     speed."
    </p>
    <p>
     A chill ran down Bennie's spine. They were going to start the engine! In
    </p>
    <p>
     a moment he would be within twenty feet of a blast of disintegration
    </p>
    <p>
     products capable of lifting the whole machine into the air, and it was
    </p>
    <p>
     to be started at his command, after he had worked and pottered for two
    </p>
    <p>
     years with a thermic inductor the size of a thimble! He felt as he used
    </p>
    <p>
     to feel before taking a high dive, or as he imagined a soldier feels
    </p>
    <p>
     when about to go under fire for the first time. How would it turn out?
    </p>
    <p>
     Was he taking too much responsibility, and was Atterbury counting on him
    </p>
    <p>
     for the management of details? He felt singularly helpless as he
    </p>
    <p>
     reëntered the chart room to compose his message.
    </p>
    <p>
     He turned on the electric lamp which hung over the desk, for in the
    </p>
    <p>
     fast-gathering dusk the interior of the Ring was in almost total
    </p>
    <p>
     darkness. How should his message read? It must be brief: it must tell
    </p>
    <p>
     the story, and, above all, it must be compelling.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was joined by the electrician.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I think--we are all--ready now," stammered the latter. "What will you
    </p>
    <p>
     send, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Bennie handed him a scrap of yellow paper, and Atterbury put on a pair
    </p>
    <p>
     of dark amber glasses, to protect his eyes from the light of the spark.
    </p>
    <p>
     "_Thornton, Naval Observatory, Washington:_
    </p>
    <p>
     "Stranded fifty-four thirty-eight north, seventy-four eighteen
    </p>
    <p>
     west. Have the Ring machine. Ask Burke come immediately. Life and
    </p>
    <p>
     death matter.
    </p>
    <p>
     "B. HOOKER."
    </p>
    <p>
     Atterbury read the message and then gazed blankly at Hooker.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I--don't--understand," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Never mind, send it. I'll explain later." Together they went into the
    </p>
    <p>
     condenser room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Atterbury mechanically pushed the brass balls in contact, shoved a
    </p>
    <p>
     bundle of iron wires halfway through the core of a great coil, and
    </p>
    <p>
     closed a switch. A humming sound filled the air, and a few seconds later
    </p>
    <p>
     a glow of yellow light came in through the window. A cone of luminous
    </p>
    <p>
     vapour was shooting downward through the centre of the Ring from the
    </p>
    <p>
     tractor. At first it was soft and nebulous, but it increased rapidly in
    </p>
    <p>
     brilliancy, and a dull roar, like that of a waterfall, added itself to
    </p>
    <p>
     the hum of the alternating current in the wires. And now a third sound
    </p>
    <p>
     came to his ears, the note of the turbine, low at first, but gradually
    </p>
    <p>
     rising like the scream of a siren, and the floor of the Ring beneath his
    </p>
    <p>
     feet throbbed with the vibration.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bennie forgot the dynamometer, forgot his message to Burke, was
    </p>
    <p>
     conscious only that he had wakened a sleeping volcano. Then came the
    </p>
    <p>
     crack of the sparks, and the room seemed filled with the glare of the
    </p>
    <p>
     blue lightning, for Atterbury, with his telephones at his ears, staring
    </p>
    <p>
     through his yellow glasses, was sending out the call for the Naval
    </p>
    <p>
     Observatory.
    </p>
    <p>
     "NAA--NAA--P--A--X."
    </p>
    <p>
     Over and over again he sent the call, while in the meantime the
    </p>
    <p>
     condenser built up its charge from the overflow of current from the
    </p>
    <p>
     turbine generator. Then the electrician opened a switch, and the roar
    </p>
    <p>
     outside diminished and finally ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We can't listen--with the tractor running," he fretted. "The
    </p>
    <p>
     static--from the discharge--would tear--our detector--to pieces." He
    </p>
    <p>
     threw in the receiving instrument. For a few moments the telephones
    </p>
    <p>
     spoke only the whisperings of the arctic aurora, and then suddenly the
    </p>
    <p>
     faint cry of the answering spark was heard. Bennie watched the words as
    </p>
    <p>
     the electrician's pencil scrawled along on the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Waiting for you. Why don't you send? N.A.A."
    </p>
    <p>
     "They must have--called us before--while the discharge--was running
    </p>
    <p>
     down," muttered Atterbury. "I think we can send--with the
    </p>
    <p>
     condenser--now."
    </p>
    <p>
     He picked up the scrap of yellow paper, read it over, and threw out into
    </p>
    <p>
     space the message which he did not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
     "O. K. Wait. Thornton," came in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
     Two hours later came a second message:
    </p>
    <p>
     "P--A--X. Burke starts at daybreak. Expects reach you by nine P. M.
    </p>
    <p>
     Asks you to show large beacon fire if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     "THORNTON, N. A. A."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hurrah!" cried Bennie. "Good for Burke! Atterbury, we're saved--saved,
    </p>
    <p>
     do you hear! Go to bed now and don't ask any questions. And say, before
    </p>
    <p>
     you go see if you can find me a glass of brandy."
    </p>
    <p>
     *       *       *       *       *
    </p>
    <p>
     It was decided that Burke must land on the plateau above the cliff, and
    </p>
    <p>
     here the material for the fire was collected. There was little enough of
    </p>
    <p>
     it and it was hard work carrying the oil up the steep trail. At times
    </p>
    <p>
     Bennie was almost in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It won't burn half an hour," said he, surveying the pile. "And we ought
    </p>
    <p>
     to be able to keep it going all night. There's plenty of stuff in the
    </p>
    <p>
     valley, but we can't have him come down there, with the tower, the
    </p>
    <p>
     antennæ, and all the rest of the mess."
    </p>
    <p>
     "We might--show him--the big Ray," ventured Atterbury. "The thing--can
    </p>
    <p>
     be pointed up--and I can--keep the turbine running. You can start--the
    </p>
    <p>
     fire--as soon as you--hear his motors--and I'll shut down--as soon as I
    </p>
    <p>
     see your fire."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good idea!" agreed Bennie. "Only don't run continuously. Show the Ray
    </p>
    <p>
     for a minute every quarter of an hour, and on no account start up after
    </p>
    <p>
     you see the fire. If he thought the vertical beam was a searchlight and
    </p>
    <p>
     flew through it----" Bennie shuddered at the thought of Burke driving
    </p>
    <p>
     his aeroplane through the Ray that had shattered the Atlas Mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
     So it was arranged. Half an hour after sunset Atterbury shut himself up
    </p>
    <p>
     in the Ring, and while Bennie climbed the trail leading to his post on
    </p>
    <p>
     the plateau, he heard the creaking of the great inductor as it slowly
    </p>
    <p>
     turned on its trunions.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was pitch dark by the time he reached the pitifully small pile of
    </p>
    <p>
     brush which they had collected, and he poured some of the oil over it
    </p>
    <p>
     and sat down, drawing a blanket around his shoulders. He felt very much
    </p>
    <p>
     alone. Suppose the inductor failed to work? Suppose Atterbury turned the
    </p>
    <p>
     Ray on him? Suppose.... But his musings were shattered by a noise from
    </p>
    <p>
     the valley, a sound like that of escaping steam, and a moment later the
    </p>
    <p>
     Lavender Ray shot up toward the zenith. Bennie lay on his back and
    </p>
    <p>
     watched it, mindful of the night before the last when he had watched the
    </p>
    <p>
     Ray from the tower descending upon the cliff. He wondered if he should
    </p>
    <p>
     see any meteorites kindle in its path, but nothing appeared and the Ray
    </p>
    <p>
     died down, leaving everything in darkness again. Fifteen minutes passed
    </p>
    <p>
     and again the ghostly beam shot up into the night sky. Bennie looked at
    </p>
    <p>
     his watch. It was nearly half-past eight. The cold made him sleepy. He
    </p>
    <p>
     drew the blanket about him....
    </p>
    <p>
     Two hours later through his half-dreams he caught the faint sound for
    </p>
    <p>
     which he had been listening. At first he was not sure. It might be the
    </p>
    <p>
     turbine alternator of the Ring running by its own inertia for some time
    </p>
    <p>
     after the discharge had ceased. But no, it was growing louder
    </p>
    <p>
     momentarily, and appeared to come from high up in the air. Now it died
    </p>
    <p>
     away to nothingness, and now it swelled in volume, and again died away.
    </p>
    <p>
     But at each subsequent recurrence it was louder than before. There was
    </p>
    <p>
     no longer any doubt. Burke was coming! It was time to start the brush
    </p>
    <p>
     pile. He lit match after match, only for the wind to blow them out. Yet
    </p>
    <p>
     all the time the machine in the air was coming nearer, the roar of its
    </p>
    <p>
     twin engines beating on the stillness of the Labrador night. In despair
    </p>
    <p>
     Bennie threw himself flat on his face by the brush pile and made a tent
    </p>
    <p>
     of the blanket, under which he at last succeeded in starting a blaze
    </p>
    <p>
     among the oil-soaked twigs. Then he pushed the half-empty keg into the
    </p>
    <p>
     fire, arose and stared up at the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
     The machine was somewhere directly above him--just where he could not
    </p>
    <p>
     say. Presently the motors stopped. He shouted feebly, running up and
    </p>
    <p>
     down with his eyes turned skyward, and several times nearly fell into
    </p>
    <p>
     the fire. He wondered why it didn't appear. It seemed hours since the
    </p>
    <p>
     motors stopped! Then unexpectedly against the black background of the
    </p>
    <p>
     sky the great wings of the machine appeared, illuminated on their
    </p>
    <p>
     underside by the light of the fire. Silently it swung around on its
    </p>
    <p>
     descending spiral, instantly to be swallowed up in the darkness again, a
    </p>
    <p>
     moment later reappearing from the opposite direction, this time low down
    </p>
    <p>
     and headed straight for him. He jumped hastily to one side and fell
    </p>
    <p>
     flat. The machine grounded, rose once or twice as it ran along the
    </p>
    <p>
     ground, and came to a stop twenty yards from the fire. A man climbed
    </p>
    <p>
     out, slowly removed his goggles, and shook himself. Bennie scrambled to
    </p>
    <p>
     his feet and ran forward waving his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, Hooker!" remarked the man. "What th' hell are you doing _here_?
    </p>
    <p>
     You sure have some searchlight!"
    </p>
    <p>
     *       *       *       *       *
    </p>
    <p>
     How Hooker and Burke, under the guidance of Atterbury, who gradually
    </p>
    <p>
     regained his normal mental status, explored and charted the valley of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Ring is strictly no part of this tale which deals solely with the
    </p>
    <p>
     end of War upon the Earth. But next day, after several hours of
    </p>
    <p>
     excavation among the débris of the smelter, where Pax had extracted his
    </p>
    <p>
     uranium from the pitch blend mined at the cliff, they uncovered eight
    </p>
    <p>
     cylinders of the precious metal weighing about one hundred pounds
    </p>
    <p>
     apiece--the fuel of the Flying Ring. Now they were safe. Nay, more:
    </p>
    <p>
     universal space was theirs to traffic in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Curious as to the reason why Pax had isolated himself in this frozen
    </p>
    <p>
     wilderness, they next examined the high cliffs which shut in the valley
    </p>
    <p>
     on the west and against the almost perpendicular walls of which he had
    </p>
    <p>
     played the Lavender Ray. These cliffs proved, as Bennie had already
    </p>
    <p>
     suspected, to be a gigantic outcrop of pitchblende or black oxide of
    </p>
    <p>
     uranium. He estimated that nature had stored more uranium in but one of
    </p>
    <p>
     the abutments of this cliff than in all the known mines of the entire
    </p>
    <p>
     world. This radioactive mountain was the fulcrum by which this modern
    </p>
    <p>
     Archimedes had moved the earth. The vast amount of matter disintegrated
    </p>
    <p>
     by the Ray and thrown off into space with a velocity a thousandfold
    </p>
    <p>
     greater than the blast of a siege gun produced a back pressure or recoil
    </p>
    <p>
     against the face of the cliff, which thus became the "thrust block" of
    </p>
    <p>
     the force which had slowed down the period of the earth's rotation.
    </p>
    <p>
     *       *       *       *       *
    </p>
    <p>
     The day of the start dawned with a blazing sun. From the landing stage
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Ring Bennie could see stretching away to the east, west, and
    </p>
    <p>
     south, the interminable plains, dotted with firs, which had formed the
    </p>
    <p>
     natural barrier to the previous discovery of Pax's secret. Overhead the
    </p>
    <p>
     dome of the sky fitted the horizon like an enormous shell--a shell
    </p>
    <p>
     which, with a thrill, he realized that he could crack and escape from,
    </p>
    <p>
     like a fledgling ready for its first flight. And yet in this moment of
    </p>
    <p>
     triumph little Bennie Hooker felt the qualm which must inevitably come
    </p>
    <p>
     to those who take their lives in their hands. An hour and he would be
    </p>
    <p>
     either soaring Phoebus-like toward the south, or lying crushed and
    </p>
    <p>
     mangled within a tangled mass of wreckage. Even here in this desolate
    </p>
    <p>
     waste life seemed sweet, and he had much, so much to do. Wasn't it,
    </p>
    <p>
     after all, a crazy thing to try to navigate the complicated mechanism
    </p>
    <p>
     back to civilization? Yet something told him that unless he put his fate
    </p>
    <p>
     to the test now he would never return. He had the utmost confidence in
    </p>
    <p>
     Burke--he might never be able to secure his services again--no, it was
    </p>
    <p>
     now or never. He entered the air-lock, closing and bolting the door, and
    </p>
    <p>
     passed on into the chart room.
    </p>
    <p>
     At all events, he thought, they were no worse off than Pax when he had
    </p>
    <p>
     made his first trial flight, and they were working with a proven
    </p>
    <p>
     machine, tuned to its fullest efficiency, and one which apparently
    </p>
    <p>
     possessed automatic stability. Atterbury had gone to the condenser room
    </p>
    <p>
     and was waiting for the order to start, while Burke was making the final
    </p>
    <p>
     adjustment of the gyroscopes which would put the Ring on its
    </p>
    <p>
     predetermined course. He came through the door and joined Bennie.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hooker," he said, "we're sure going to have some experience. If I can
    </p>
    <p>
     keep her from turning over, I think I can manage her. The trouble will
    </p>
    <p>
     come when we slant the tractor. I'm not sure how much depends on the
    </p>
    <p>
     atmospheric valve, and how much on me. Things may happen quickly. If we
    </p>
    <p>
     turn over we're done for."
    </p>
    <p>
     He held out his hand to Bennie, who gripped it tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well," remarked the aviator, tossing away his cigarette, "we might as
    </p>
    <p>
     well die now as any time!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He walked swiftly over to the speaking-tube which communicated with the
    </p>
    <p>
     condenser room and blew sharply into it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Let her go, _Gallagher_!" he directed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "My God!" ejaculated Bennie. "Wait a second, can't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     But it was too late. He grabbed the rail, trembling. A humming sound
    </p>
    <p>
     filled the air, and the gyroscopes slowly began to revolve. He looked up
    </p>
    <p>
     through the window at the tractor, from which shot streaks of pale
    </p>
    <p>
     vapour with a noise like escaping steam. Somehow it seemed alive.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Ring was throbbing as if it, too, was impregnated with life. The
    </p>
    <p>
     discharge of the tractor had risen to a muffled roar. Shaking all over,
    </p>
    <p>
     Bennie crossed to the inside window and looked across the inner space of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Ring. As yet the yellow glow of the discharge was scarcely visible,
    </p>
    <p>
     but the steel sides of the Ring danced and quivered, undulating in
    </p>
    <p>
     waves, and, as the intensity of the blast increased and the turbine
    </p>
    <p>
     commenced to revolve, everything outside went suddenly blurred and
    </p>
    <p>
     indistinct.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dropping to his knees, Bennie looked down through the observation window
    </p>
    <p>
     in the floor. A blinding cloud of yellow dust was driving out and away
    </p>
    <p>
     from the base of the landing stage in the form of a gigantic ring. The
    </p>
    <p>
     earth at their feet was hidden in whirls of vapour; and ripples of light
    </p>
    <p>
     and shade chased each other outward in all directions, like shadows on
    </p>
    <p>
     the bottom of a sandy pond rippled by a breeze. It made him dizzy to
    </p>
    <p>
     look down there, and he arose from the window. Burke stood grimly at the
    </p>
    <p>
     control, unmindful of his associate. Bennie crossed to the other side,
    </p>
    <p>
     and as he passed the gyroscopes, the air from the swiftly spinning discs
    </p>
    <p>
     blew back his hair. He could see nothing through the tumult that roared
    </p>
    <p>
     down through the centre of the Ring, like a Niagara of hot steam shot
    </p>
    <p>
     through with a pale yellow phosphorescent light. The floor quivered
    </p>
    <p>
     under his feet, and ominous creaking and snapping sounds reverberated
    </p>
    <p>
     through the outer shell, as the steel girders of the landing stage were
    </p>
    <p>
     gradually relieved of its weight. Just as it seemed to him that
    </p>
    <p>
     everything was going to pieces, suddenly there was silence, save for the
    </p>
    <p>
     purr of the machinery, and Bennie felt his knees sink under him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We're off!" cried Burke. "Watch out!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The floor swayed as the Ring, lifted by the tractor, swung to and fro
    </p>
    <p>
     like a pendulum. Bennie threw himself upon his stomach. The earth was
    </p>
    <p>
     dropping away from them like a stone. He felt a sickening sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Two thousand feet already," gasped Burke. "The atmospheric valve is set
    </p>
    <p>
     for five thousand. I'll make it ten! It will give us more room to
    </p>
    <p>
     recover in--if anything--goes wrong!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He gave the knob another half turn and laid his hand lightly on the
    </p>
    <p>
     lever which controlled the movements of the tractor. Bennie, flattened
    </p>
    <p>
     against the window, gazed below. The great dust ring showed indistinctly
    </p>
    <p>
     through a blue haze no longer directly beneath them, but a quarter of a
    </p>
    <p>
     mile to the north. Evidently they were not rising vertically.
    </p>
    <p>
     The valley of the Ring looked like a black crack in a greenish-gray
    </p>
    <p>
     desert of rock and moss, the landing stage like a tiny bird's nest. The
    </p>
    <p>
     floor of the car moved slightly from side to side. Burke's face had gone
    </p>
    <p>
     gray, and he crouched unsteadily, one hand gripping a steel bracket on
    </p>
    <p>
     the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     "My Lord!" he mumbled with dry lips. "My Lord!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Bennie, momentarily expecting annihilation, crawled on all fours to
    </p>
    <p>
     Burke's side.
    </p>
    <p>
     The needle of the manometer indicated nine thousand five hundred feet,
    </p>
    <p>
     and was rapidly nearing the next division. Suddenly Burke felt the lever
    </p>
    <p>
     move slowly under his hand as though operated by some outside
    </p>
    <p>
     intelligence, and at the same moment the axis of one gyroscope swung
    </p>
    <p>
     slowly in a horizontal plane through an angle of nearly ninety degrees,
    </p>
    <p>
     while that of the other dipped slightly from the vertical. Both men had
    </p>
    <p>
     a ghastly feeling that the ghost of Pax had somehow returned and assumed
    </p>
    <p>
     control of the car. Bennie rotated the map under the gyroscope until the
    </p>
    <p>
     fine black line on the dial again lay across their destination. Then he
    </p>
    <p>
     crept back to his window again. The earth, far below and dimly visible,
    </p>
    <p>
     was sliding slowly northward, and the dust ring which marked their
    </p>
    <p>
     starting-point now lay as a flattened ellipse on the distant horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
     Beneath and behind them in their flight trailed a thin streak of pale
    </p>
    <p>
     bluish fog--the wake of the Flying Ring.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were now searing the atmosphere at a height of nearly two miles,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the car was flying on a firm and even keel. There was no sound save
    </p>
    <p>
     the dull roar of the tractor and a slight humming from the vibration of
    </p>
    <p>
     the light steel cables. Bennie no longer felt any disagreeable
    </p>
    <p>
     sensation. A strange detachment possessed him. Dark forests, lakes, and
    </p>
    <p>
     a mighty river appeared to the south--the Moisie--and they followed it
    </p>
    <p>
     as a fishhawk might have done, until the wilderness broke away before
    </p>
    <p>
     them and they saw the broad reach of the St. Lawrence streaked with the
    </p>
    <p>
     smoke of ocean liners.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then he lost control of himself for the first time and sobbed like a
    </p>
    <p>
     woman--not from fear, nor weariness, nor excitement, but for joy--the
    </p>
    <p>
     joy of the true scientist who has sought the truth and found it, has
    </p>
    <p>
     achieved that for mankind which but for him it would have lacked,
    </p>
    <p>
     perchance, forever. And he looked up at Burke and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
     The latter nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," he remarked prosaically, "this is sure a little bit of all right!
    </p>
    <p>
     All to the good!"
    </p>
    <p>
     EPILOGUE
    </p>
    <p>
     Meanwhile, during the weeks that Hooker had been engaged in finding the
    </p>
    <p>
     valley of the Ring, unbelievable things had happened in world politics.
    </p>
    <p>
     In spite of the fact that Pax, having decreed the shifting of the Pole
    </p>
    <p>
     and the transformation of Central Europe into the Arctic zone, had
    </p>
    <p>
     refused further communication with mankind, all the nations--and none
    </p>
    <p>
     more zealously than the German Republic--had proceeded immediately to
    </p>
    <p>
     withdraw their armies within their own borders, and under the personal
    </p>
    <p>
     supervision of a General Commission to destroy all their armaments and
    </p>
    <p>
     munitions of war. The lyddite bombs, manufactured in vast quantities by
    </p>
    <p>
     the Krupps for the Relay Gun and all other high explosives, were used to
    </p>
    <p>
     demolish the fortresses upon every frontier of Europe. The contents of
    </p>
    <p>
     every arsenal was loaded upon barges and sunk in mid-Atlantic. And every
    </p>
    <p>
     form of military organization, rank, service, and even uniform, was
    </p>
    <p>
     abolished throughout the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     A coalition of nations was formed under a single general government,
    </p>
    <p>
     known as the United States of Europe, which in coöperation with the
    </p>
    <p>
     United States of North and South America, of Asia, and of Africa,
    </p>
    <p>
     arranged for an annual world congress at The Hague, and which enforced
    </p>
    <p>
     its decrees by means of an International Police. In effect all the
    </p>
    <p>
     inhabitants of the globe came under a single control, as far as language
    </p>
    <p>
     and geographical boundaries would permit. Each state enforced local
    </p>
    <p>
     laws, but all were obedient to the higher law--the Law of
    </p>
    <p>
     Humanity--which was uniform through the earth. If an individual offended
    </p>
    <p>
     against the law of one nation, he was held to have offended against all,
    </p>
    <p>
     and was dealt with as such. The international police needed no treaties
    </p>
    <p>
     of extradition. The New York embezzler who fled to Nairobi was sent back
    </p>
    <p>
     as a matter of course without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
     Any man was free to go and live where he chose, to manufacture, buy, and
    </p>
    <p>
     sell as he saw fit. And, because the fear and shadow of war were
    </p>
    <p>
     removed, the nations grew rich beyond the imagination of men; great
    </p>
    <p>
     hospitals and research laboratories, universities, schools, and
    </p>
    <p>
     kindergartens, opera houses, theatres, and gardens of every sort sprang
    </p>
    <p>
     up everywhere, paid for no one quite knew how. The nations ceased to
    </p>
    <p>
     build dreadnoughts, and instead used the money to send great troops of
    </p>
    <p>
     children with the teachers travelling over the world. It was against the
    </p>
    <p>
     law to own or manufacture any weapon that could be used to take human
    </p>
    <p>
     life. And because the nations had nothing to fear from one another, and
    </p>
    <p>
     because there were no scheming diplomatists and bureaucrats to make a
    </p>
    <p>
     living out of imaginary antagonisms, people forgot that they were French
    </p>
    <p>
     or German or Russian or English, just as the people of the United States
    </p>
    <p>
     of America had long before practically disregarded the fact that they
    </p>
    <p>
     came from Ohio or Oregon or Connecticut or Nevada. Russians with weak
    </p>
    <p>
     throats went to live in Italy as a matter of course, and Spaniards who
    </p>
    <p>
     liked German cooking settled in Münich.
    </p>
    <p>
     All this, of course, did not happen at once, but came about quite
    </p>
    <p>
     naturally after the abolition of war. And after it had been done,
    </p>
    <p>
     everybody wondered why it had not been done ten centuries before; and
    </p>
    <p>
     people became so interested in destroying all the relics of that
    </p>
    <p>
     despicable employment, warfare, that they almost forgot that the Man Who
    </p>
    <p>
     Rocked the Earth had threatened that he would shift the axis of the
    </p>
    <p>
     globe. So that when the day fixed by him came and everything remained
    </p>
    <p>
     just as it always had been--and everybody still wore linen-mesh
    </p>
    <p>
     underwear in Strassburg and flannels in Archangel--nobody thought very
    </p>
    <p>
     much about it, or commented on the fact that the Flying Ring was no
    </p>
    <p>
     longer to be seen. And the only real difference was that you could take
    </p>
    <p>
     a P. &amp; O. steamer at Marseilles and buy a through ticket to Tasili
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahaggar--if you wanted to go there--and that the shores of the Sahara
    </p>
    <p>
     became the Riviera of the world, crowded with health resorts and
    </p>

     watering-places--so that Pax had not lived in vain, nor Thornton, nor
    </p>
    <p>
     Bill Hood, nor Bennie Hooker, nor any of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     The whole thing is a matter of record, as it should be. The
    </p>
    <p>
     deliberations of Conference No. 2 broke up in a hubbub, just as Von
    </p>
    <p>
     Helmuth and Von Koenitz had intended, and the transcripts of their
    </p>
    <p>
     discussions proved to be not of the slightest scientific value. But in
    </p>
    <p>
     the files of the old War Department--now called the Department for the
    </p>
    <p>
     Alleviation of Poverty and Human Suffering--can be read the messages
    </p>
    <p>
     interchanged between The Dictator of Human Destiny and the President of
    </p>
    <p>
     the United States, together with all the reports and observations
    </p>
    <p>
     relating thereto, including Professor Hooker's Report to the Smithsonian
    </p>
    <p>
     Institute of his journey to the valley of the Ring and what he found
    </p>
    <p>
     there. Only the secret of the Ring--of thermic induction and atomic
    </p>
    <p>
     disintegration--in short, of the Lavender Ray, is his by right of
    </p>
    <p>
     discovery, or treasure trove, or what you will, and so is his patent on
    </p>
    <p>
     Hooker's Space-Navigating Car, in which he afterward explored the solar
    </p>
    <p>
     system and the uttermost regions of the sidereal ether. But that shall
    </p>
    <p>
     be told hereafter.
