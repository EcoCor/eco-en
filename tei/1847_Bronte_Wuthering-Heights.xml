    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70">
     1801.--I have just returned from a visit to my landlord--the solitary
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80">
     neighbour that I shall be troubled with.  This is certainly a beautiful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90">
     country!  In all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100">
     situation so completely removed from the stir of society.  A perfect
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110">
     misanthropist's heaven: and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120">
     to divide the desolation between us.  A capital fellow!  He little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_130">
     imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_140">
     withdraw so suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up, and when his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_150">
     fingers sheltered themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_160">
     his waistcoat, as I announced my name.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_180">
     'Mr. Heathcliff?' I said.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_200">
     A nod was the answer.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_220">
     'Mr. Lockwood, your new tenant, sir.  I do myself the honour of calling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_230">
     as soon as possible after my arrival, to express the hope that I have not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_240">
     inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_250">
     Thrushcross Grange: I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts--'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_270">
     'Thrushcross Grange is my own, sir,' he interrupted, wincing.  'I should
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_280">
     not allow any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder it--walk in!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_300">
     The 'walk in' was uttered with closed teeth, and expressed the sentiment,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_310">
     'Go to the Deuce:' even the gate over which he leant manifested no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_320">
     sympathising movement to the words; and I think that circumstance
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_330">
     determined me to accept the invitation: I felt interested in a man who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_340">
     seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_360">
     When he saw my horse's breast fairly pushing the barrier, he did put out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_370">
     his hand to unchain it, and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_380">
     calling, as we entered the court,--'Joseph, take Mr. Lockwood's horse;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_390">
     and bring up some wine.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_410">
     'Here we have the whole establishment of domestics, I suppose,' was the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_420">
     reflection suggested by this compound order.  'No wonder the grass grows
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_430">
     up between the flags, and cattle are the only hedge-cutters.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_450">
     Joseph was an elderly, nay, an old man: very old, perhaps, though hale
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_460">
     and sinewy.  'The Lord help us!' he soliloquised in an undertone of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_470">
     peevish displeasure, while relieving me of my horse: looking, meantime,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_480">
     in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_490">
     divine aid to digest his dinner, and his pious ejaculation had no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_500">
     reference to my unexpected advent.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_520">
     Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff's dwelling.  'Wuthering'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_530">
     being a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the atmospheric
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_540">
     tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather.  Pure, bracing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_550">
     ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed: one may guess
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_560">
     the power of the north wind blowing over the edge, by the excessive slant
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_570">
     of a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and by a range of gaunt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_580">
     thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if craving alms of the sun.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_590">
     Happily, the architect had foresight to build it strong: the narrow
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_600">
     windows are deeply set in the wall, and the corners defended with large
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_610">
     jutting stones.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_630">
     Before passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_640">
     carving lavished over the front, and especially about the principal door;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_650">
     above which, among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_660">
     little boys, I detected the date '1500,' and the name 'Hareton Earnshaw.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_670">
     I would have made a few comments, and requested a short history of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_680">
     place from the surly owner; but his attitude at the door appeared to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_690">
     demand my speedy entrance, or complete departure, and I had no desire to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_700">
     aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_720">
     One stop brought us into the family sitting-room, without any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_730">
     introductory lobby or passage: they call it here 'the house'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_740">
     pre-eminently.  It includes kitchen and parlour, generally; but I believe
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_750">
     at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_760">
     another quarter: at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues, and a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_770">
     clatter of culinary utensils, deep within; and I observed no signs of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_780">
     roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge fireplace; nor any glitter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_790">
     of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls.  One end, indeed,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_800">
     reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_810">
     dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and tankards, towering row after
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_820">
     row, on a vast oak dresser, to the very roof.  The latter had never been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_830">
     under-drawn: its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye, except
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_840">
     where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_850">
     mutton, and ham, concealed it.  Above the chimney were sundry villainous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_860">
     old guns, and a couple of horse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_870">
     gaudily-painted canisters disposed along its ledge.  The floor was of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_880">
     smooth, white stone; the chairs, high-backed, primitive structures,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_890">
     painted green: one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade.  In an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_900">
     arch under the dresser reposed a huge, liver-coloured bitch pointer,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_910">
     surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies; and other dogs haunted other
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_920">
     recesses.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_940">
     The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_950">
     belonging to a homely, northern farmer, with a stubborn countenance, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_960">
     stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee-breeches and gaiters.  Such
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_970">
     an individual seated in his arm-chair, his mug of ale frothing on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_980">
     round table before him, is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_990">
     among these hills, if you go at the right time after dinner.  But Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1000">
     Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living.  He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1010">
     is a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect, in dress and manners a gentleman: that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1020">
     is, as much a gentleman as many a country squire: rather slovenly,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1030">
     perhaps, yet not looking amiss with his negligence, because he has an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1040">
     erect and handsome figure; and rather morose.  Possibly, some people
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1050">
     might suspect him of a degree of under-bred pride; I have a sympathetic
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1060">
     chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort: I know, by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1070">
     instinct, his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1080">
     feeling--to manifestations of mutual kindliness.  He'll love and hate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1090">
     equally under cover, and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1100">
     or hated again.  No, I'm running on too fast: I bestow my own attributes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1110">
     over-liberally on him.  Mr. Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1120">
     reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a would-be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1130">
     acquaintance, to those which actuate me.  Let me hope my constitution is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1140">
     almost peculiar: my dear mother used to say I should never have a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1150">
     comfortable home; and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1160">
     of one.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1180">
     While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea-coast, I was thrown
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1190">
     into the company of a most fascinating creature: a real goddess in my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1200">
     eyes, as long as she took no notice of me.  I 'never told my love'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1210">
     vocally; still, if looks have language, the merest idiot might have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1220">
     guessed I was over head and ears: she understood me at last, and looked a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1230">
     return--the sweetest of all imaginable looks.  And what did I do?  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1240">
     confess it with shame--shrunk icily into myself, like a snail; at every
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1250">
     glance retired colder and farther; till finally the poor innocent was led
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1260">
     to doubt her own senses, and, overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1270">
     mistake, persuaded her mamma to decamp.  By this curious turn of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1280">
     disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness; how
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1290">
     undeserved, I alone can appreciate.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1310">
     I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1320">
     my landlord advanced, and filled up an interval of silence by attempting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1330">
     to caress the canine mother, who had left her nursery, and was sneaking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1340">
     wolfishly to the back of my legs, her lip curled up, and her white teeth
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1350">
     watering for a snatch.  My caress provoked a long, guttural gnarl.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1370">
     'You'd better let the dog alone,' growled Mr. Heathcliff in unison,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1380">
     checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot.  'She's not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1390">
     accustomed to be spoiled--not kept for a pet.'  Then, striding to a side
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1400">
     door, he shouted again, 'Joseph!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1420">
     Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar, but gave no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1430">
     intimation of ascending; so his master dived down to him, leaving me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1440">
     _vis-a-vis_ the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheep-dogs,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1450">
     who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1460">
     anxious to come in contact with their fangs, I sat still; but, imagining
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1470">
     they would scarcely understand tacit insults, I unfortunately indulged
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1480">
     in winking and making faces at the trio, and some turn of my physiognomy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1490">
     so irritated madam, that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1500">
     knees. I flung her back, and hastened to interpose the table between us.
    </p>

     This proceeding aroused the whole hive: half-a-dozen four-footed fiends,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1520">
     of various sizes and ages, issued from hidden dens to the common centre.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1530">
     I felt my heels and coat-laps peculiar subjects of assault; and parrying
    </p>

     off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1550">
     was constrained to demand, aloud, assistance from some of the household

     in re-establishing peace.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1580">
     Mr. Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious

     phlegm: I don't think they moved one second faster than usual, though

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1600">
     the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily, an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1610">
     inhabitant of the kitchen made more despatch: a lusty dame, with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1620">
     tucked-up gown, bare arms, and fire-flushed cheeks, rushed into the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1630">
     midst of us flourishing a frying-pan: and used that weapon, and her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1640">
     tongue, to such purpose, that the storm subsided magically, and she only
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1650">
     remained, heaving like a sea after a high wind, when her master entered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1660">
     on the scene.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1680">
     'What the devil is the matter?' he asked, eyeing me in a manner that I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1690">
     could ill endure, after this inhospitable treatment.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1710">
     'What the devil, indeed!' I muttered.  'The herd of possessed swine could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1720">
     have had no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours, sir.  You
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1730">
     might as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1750">
     'They won't meddle with persons who touch nothing,' he remarked, putting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1760">
     the bottle before me, and restoring the displaced table.  'The dogs do
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1770">
     right to be vigilant.  Take a glass of wine?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1790">
     'No, thank you.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1810">
     'Not bitten, are you?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1830">
     'If I had been, I would have set my signet on the biter.'  Heathcliff's

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1840">
     countenance relaxed into a grin.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1860">
     'Come, come,' he said, 'you are flurried, Mr. Lockwood.  Here, take a

     little wine.  Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my

     dogs, I am willing to own, hardly know how to receive them.  Your health,

     sir?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1910">
     I bowed and returned the pledge; beginning to perceive that it would be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1920">
     foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs; besides, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1930">
     felt loth to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense; since his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1940">
     humour took that turn.  He--probably swayed by prudential consideration
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1950">
     of the folly of offending a good tenant--relaxed a little in the laconic
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1960">
     style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs, and introduced
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1970">
     what he supposed would be a subject of interest to me,--a discourse on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1980">
     the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_1990">
     found him very intelligent on the topics we touched; and before I went
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2000">
     home, I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit to-morrow.  He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2010">
     evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion.  I shall go,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2020">
     notwithstanding.  It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself compared

     with him.

     CHAPTER II
    </head>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2100">
     Yesterday afternoon set in misty and cold.  I had half a mind to spend it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2110">
     by my study fire, instead of wading through heath and mud to Wuthering
    </p>

     Heights.  On coming up from dinner, however, (N.B.--I dine between twelve
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2130">
     and one o'clock; the housekeeper, a matronly lady, taken as a fixture
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2140">
     along with the house, could not, or would not, comprehend my request that

     I might be served at five)--on mounting the stairs with this lazy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2160">
     intention, and stepping into the room, I saw a servant-girl on her knees
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2170">
     surrounded by brushes and coal-scuttles, and raising an infernal dust as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2180">
     she extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders.  This spectacle drove
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2190">
     me back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a four-miles' walk,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2200">
     arrived at Heathcliff's garden-gate just in time to escape the first
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2210">
     feathery flakes of a snow-shower.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2230">
     On that bleak hill-top the earth was hard with a black frost, and the air
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2240">
     made me shiver through every limb.  Being unable to remove the chain, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2250">
     jumped over, and, running up the flagged causeway bordered with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2260">
     straggling gooseberry-bushes, knocked vainly for admittance, till my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2270">
     knuckles tingled and the dogs howled.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2290">
     'Wretched inmates!' I ejaculated, mentally, 'you deserve perpetual
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2300">
     isolation from your species for your churlish inhospitality. At least, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2310">
     would not keep my doors barred in the day-time. I don't care--I will get
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2320">
     in!' So resolved, I grasped the latch and shook it vehemently.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2330">
     Vinegar-faced Joseph projected his head from a round window of the barn.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2350">
     'What are ye for?' he shouted.  'T' maister's down i' t' fowld.  Go round
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2360">
     by th' end o' t' laith, if ye went to spake to him.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2380">
     'Is there nobody inside to open the door?' I hallooed, responsively.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2400">
     'There's nobbut t' missis; and shoo'll not oppen 't an ye mak' yer

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2430">
     'Why?  Cannot you tell her whom I am, eh, Joseph?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2450">
     'Nor-ne me!  I'll hae no hend wi't,' muttered the head, vanishing.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2470">
     The snow began to drive thickly.  I seized the handle to essay another
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2480">
     trial; when a young man without coat, and shouldering a pitchfork,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2490">
     appeared in the yard behind.  He hailed me to follow him, and, after
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2500">
     marching through a wash-house, and a paved area containing a coal-shed,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2510">
     pump, and pigeon-cot, we at length arrived in the huge, warm, cheerful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2520">
     apartment where I was formerly received.  It glowed delightfully in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2530">
     radiance of an immense fire, compounded of coal, peat, and wood; and near
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2540">
     the table, laid for a plentiful evening meal, I was pleased to observe
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2550">
     the 'missis,' an individual whose existence I had never previously
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2560">
     suspected.  I bowed and waited, thinking she would bid me take a seat.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2570">
     She looked at me, leaning back in her chair, and remained motionless and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2580">
     mute.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2600">
     'Rough weather!' I remarked.  'I'm afraid, Mrs. Heathcliff, the door must
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2610">
     bear the consequence of your servants' leisure attendance: I had hard
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2620">
     work to make them hear me.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2640">
     She never opened her mouth.  I stared--she stared also: at any rate, she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2650">
     kept her eyes on me in a cool, regardless manner, exceedingly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2660">
     embarrassing and disagreeable.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2680">
     'Sit down,' said the young man, gruffly.  'He'll be in soon.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2700">
     I obeyed; and hemmed, and called the villain Juno, who deigned, at this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2710">
     second interview, to move the extreme tip of her tail, in token of owning
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2720">
     my acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2740">
     'A beautiful animal!' I commenced again.  'Do you intend parting with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2750">
     little ones, madam?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2770">
     'They are not mine,' said the amiable hostess, more repellingly than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2780">
     Heathcliff himself could have replied.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2800">
     'Ah, your favourites are among these?' I continued, turning to an obscure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2810">
     cushion full of something like cats.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2830">
     'A strange choice of favourites!' she observed scornfully.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2850">
     Unluckily, it was a heap of dead rabbits.  I hemmed once more, and drew
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2860">
     closer to the hearth, repeating my comment on the wildness of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2870">
     evening.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2890">
     'You should not have come out,' she said, rising and reaching from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2900">
     chimney-piece two of the painted canisters.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2920">
     Her position before was sheltered from the light; now, I had a distinct
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2930">
     view of her whole figure and countenance.  She was slender, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2940">
     apparently scarcely past girlhood: an admirable form, and the most
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2950">
     exquisite little face that I have ever had the pleasure of beholding;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2960">
     small features, very fair; flaxen ringlets, or rather golden, hanging
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2970">
     loose on her delicate neck; and eyes, had they been agreeable in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2980">
     expression, that would have been irresistible: fortunately for my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_2990">
     susceptible heart, the only sentiment they evinced hovered between scorn
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3000">
     and a kind of desperation, singularly unnatural to be detected there.  The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3010">
     canisters were almost out of her reach; I made a motion to aid her; she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3020">
     turned upon me as a miser might turn if any one attempted to assist him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3030">
     in counting his gold.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3050">
     'I don't want your help,' she snapped; 'I can get them for myself.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3070">
     'I beg your pardon!' I hastened to reply.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3090">
     'Were you asked to tea?' she demanded, tying an apron over her neat black
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3100">
     frock, and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the pot.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3120">
     'I shall be glad to have a cup,' I answered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3140">
     'Were you asked?' she repeated.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3160">
     'No,' I said, half smiling.  'You are the proper person to ask me.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3180">
     She flung the tea back, spoon and all, and resumed her chair in a pet;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3190">
     her forehead corrugated, and her red under-lip pushed out, like a child's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3200">
     ready to cry.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3220">
     Meanwhile, the young man had slung on to his person a decidedly shabby
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3230">
     upper garment, and, erecting himself before the blaze, looked down on me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3240">
     from the corner of his eyes, for all the world as if there were some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3250">
     mortal feud unavenged between us.  I began to doubt whether he were a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3260">
     servant or not: his dress and speech were both rude, entirely devoid of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3270">
     the superiority observable in Mr. and Mrs. Heathcliff; his thick brown
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3280">
     curls were rough and uncultivated, his whiskers encroached bearishly over
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3290">
     his cheeks, and his hands were embrowned like those of a common labourer:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3300">
     still his bearing was free, almost haughty, and he showed none of a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3310">
     domestic's assiduity in attending on the lady of the house.  In the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3320">
     absence of clear proofs of his condition, I deemed it best to abstain
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3330">
     from noticing his curious conduct; and, five minutes afterwards, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3340">
     entrance of Heathcliff relieved me, in some measure, from my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3350">
     uncomfortable state.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3370">
     'You see, sir, I am come, according to promise!' I exclaimed, assuming
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3380">
     the cheerful; 'and I fear I shall be weather-bound for half an hour, if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3390">
     you can afford me shelter during that space.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3410">
     'Half an hour?' he said, shaking the white flakes from his clothes; 'I

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3420">
     wonder you should select the thick of a snow-storm to ramble about in.  Do

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3430">
     you know that you run a risk of being lost in the marshes?  People
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3440">
     familiar with these moors often miss their road on such evenings; and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3450">
     can tell you there is no chance of a change at present.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3470">
     'Perhaps I can get a guide among your lads, and he might stay at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3480">
     Grange till morning--could you spare me one?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3500">
     'No, I could not.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3520">
     'Oh, indeed!  Well, then, I must trust to my own sagacity.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3540">
     'Umph!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3560">
     'Are you going to mak' the tea?' demanded he of the shabby coat, shifting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3570">
     his ferocious gaze from me to the young lady.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3590">
     'Is _he_ to have any?' she asked, appealing to Heathcliff.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3610">
     'Get it ready, will you?' was the answer, uttered so savagely that I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3620">
     started.  The tone in which the words were said revealed a genuine bad
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3630">
     nature.  I no longer felt inclined to call Heathcliff a capital fellow.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3640">
     When the preparations were finished, he invited me with--'Now, sir, bring
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3650">
     forward your chair.'  And we all, including the rustic youth, drew round
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3660">
     the table: an austere silence prevailing while we discussed our meal.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3680">
     I thought, if I had caused the cloud, it was my duty to make an effort to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3690">
     dispel it.  They could not every day sit so grim and taciturn; and it was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3700">
     impossible, however ill-tempered they might be, that the universal scowl
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3710">
     they wore was their every-day countenance.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3730">
     'It is strange,' I began, in the interval of swallowing one cup of tea
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3740">
     and receiving another--'it is strange how custom can mould our tastes and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3750">
     ideas: many could not imagine the existence of happiness in a life of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3760">
     such complete exile from the world as you spend, Mr. Heathcliff; yet,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3770">
     I'll venture to say, that, surrounded by your family, and with your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3780">
     amiable lady as the presiding genius over your home and heart--'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3800">
     'My amiable lady!' he interrupted, with an almost diabolical sneer on his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3810">
     face.  'Where is she--my amiable lady?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3830">
     'Mrs. Heathcliff, your wife, I mean.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3850">
     'Well, yes--oh, you would intimate that her spirit has taken the post of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3860">
     ministering angel, and guards the fortunes of Wuthering Heights, even
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3870">
     when her body is gone.  Is that it?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3890">
     Perceiving myself in a blunder, I attempted to correct it.  I might have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3900">
     seen there was too great a disparity between the ages of the parties to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3910">
     make it likely that they were man and wife.  One was about forty: a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3920">
     period of mental vigour at which men seldom cherish the delusion of being
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3930">
     married for love by girls: that dream is reserved for the solace of our
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3940">
     declining years.  The other did not look seventeen.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3960">
     Then it flashed upon me--'The clown at my elbow, who is drinking his tea
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3970">
     out of a basin and eating his bread with unwashed hands, may be her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3980">
     husband: Heathcliff junior, of course.  Here is the consequence of being
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_3990">
     buried alive: she has thrown herself away upon that boor from sheer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4000">
     ignorance that better individuals existed!  A sad pity--I must beware how
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4010">
     I cause her to regret her choice.'  The last reflection may seem
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4020">
     conceited; it was not.  My neighbour struck me as bordering on repulsive;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4030">
     I knew, through experience, that I was tolerably attractive.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4050">
     'Mrs. Heathcliff is my daughter-in-law,' said Heathcliff, corroborating
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4060">
     my surmise.  He turned, as he spoke, a peculiar look in her direction: a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4070">
     look of hatred; unless he has a most perverse set of facial muscles that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4080">
     will not, like those of other people, interpret the language of his soul.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4100">
     'Ah, certainly--I see now: you are the favoured possessor of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4110">
     beneficent fairy,' I remarked, turning to my neighbour.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4130">
     This was worse than before: the youth grew crimson, and clenched his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4140">
     fist, with every appearance of a meditated assault.  But he seemed to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4150">
     recollect himself presently, and smothered the storm in a brutal curse,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4160">
     muttered on my behalf: which, however, I took care not to notice.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4180">
     'Unhappy in your conjectures, sir,' observed my host; 'we neither of us
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4190">
     have the privilege of owning your good fairy; her mate is dead.  I said
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4200">
     she was my daughter-in-law: therefore, she must have married my son.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4220">
     'And this young man is--'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4240">
     'Not my son, assuredly.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4260">
     Heathcliff smiled again, as if it were rather too bold a jest to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4270">
     attribute the paternity of that bear to him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4290">
     'My name is Hareton Earnshaw,' growled the other; 'and I'd counsel you to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4300">
     respect it!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4320">
     'I've shown no disrespect,' was my reply, laughing internally at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4330">
     dignity with which he announced himself.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4350">
     He fixed his eye on me longer than I cared to return the stare, for fear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4360">
     I might be tempted either to box his ears or render my hilarity audible.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4370">
     I began to feel unmistakably out of place in that pleasant family circle.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4380">
     The dismal spiritual atmosphere overcame, and more than neutralised, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4390">
     glowing physical comforts round me; and I resolved to be cautious how I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4400">
     ventured under those rafters a third time.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4420">
     The business of eating being concluded, and no one uttering a word of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4430">
     sociable conversation, I approached a window to examine the weather.  A
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4440">
     sorrowful sight I saw: dark night coming down prematurely, and sky and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4450">
     hills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind and suffocating snow.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4470">
     'I don't think it possible for me to get home now without a guide,' I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4480">
     could not help exclaiming.  'The roads will be buried already; and, if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4490">
     they were bare, I could scarcely distinguish a foot in advance.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4510">
     'Hareton, drive those dozen sheep into the barn porch.  They'll be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4520">
     covered if left in the fold all night: and put a plank before them,' said
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4530">
     Heathcliff.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4550">
     'How must I do?' I continued, with rising irritation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4570">
     There was no reply to my question; and on looking round I saw only Joseph
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4580">
     bringing in a pail of porridge for the dogs, and Mrs. Heathcliff leaning
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4590">
     over the fire, diverting herself with burning a bundle of matches which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4600">
     had fallen from the chimney-piece as she restored the tea-canister to its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4610">
     place.  The former, when he had deposited his burden, took a critical
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4620">
     survey of the room, and in cracked tones grated out--'Aw wonder how yah
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4630">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4670">
     I imagined, for a moment, that this piece of eloquence was addressed to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4680">
     me; and, sufficiently enraged, stepped towards the aged rascal with an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4690">
     intention of kicking him out of the door.  Mrs. Heathcliff, however,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4700">
     checked me by her answer.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4720">
     'You scandalous old hypocrite!' she replied.  'Are you not afraid of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4730">
     being carried away bodily, whenever you mention the devil's name?  I warn
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4740">
     you to refrain from provoking me, or I'll ask your abduction as a special
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4750">
     favour!  Stop! look here, Joseph,' she continued, taking a long, dark
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4760">
     book from a shelf; 'I'll show you how far I've progressed in the Black

     didn't die by chance; and your rheumatism can hardly be reckoned among

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4790">
     providential visitations!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4810">
     'Oh, wicked, wicked!' gasped the elder; 'may the Lord deliver us from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4820">
     evil!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4840">
     'No, reprobate! you are a castaway--be off, or I'll hurt you seriously!

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4890">
     The little witch put a mock malignity into her beautiful eyes, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4900">
     Joseph, trembling with sincere horror, hurried out, praying, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4910">
     ejaculating 'wicked' as he went.  I thought her conduct must be prompted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4920">
     by a species of dreary fun; and, now that we were alone, I endeavoured to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4930">
     interest her in my distress.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4950">
     'Mrs. Heathcliff,' I said earnestly, 'you must excuse me for troubling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4960">
     you.  I presume, because, with that face, I'm sure you cannot help being

     good-hearted.  Do point out some landmarks by which I may know my way
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_4980">
     home: I have no more idea how to get there than you would have how to get

     to London!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5010">
     'Take the road you came,' she answered, ensconcing herself in a chair,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5020">
     with a candle, and the long book open before her.  'It is brief advice,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5030">
     but as sound as I can give.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5050">
     'Then, if you hear of me being discovered dead in a bog or a pit full of

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5150">
     'Who?  There is himself, Earnshaw, Zillah, Joseph and I.  Which would you

     have?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5180">
     'Are there no boys at the farm?'

     'Then, it follows that I am compelled to stay.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5240">
     'That you may settle with your host.  I have nothing to do with it.'

     'I hope it will be a lesson to you to make no more rash journeys on these

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5270">
     hills,' cried Heathcliff's stern voice from the kitchen entrance.  'As to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5280">
     staying here, I don't keep accommodations for visitors: you must share a

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5310">
     'I can sleep on a chair in this room,' I replied.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5330">
     'No, no!  A stranger is a stranger, be he rich or poor: it will not suit

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5350">
     the unmannerly wretch.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5370">
     With this insult my patience was at an end.  I uttered an expression of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5380">
     disgust, and pushed past him into the yard, running against Earnshaw in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5390">
     my haste.  It was so dark that I could not see the means of exit; and, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5400">
     I wandered round, I heard another specimen of their civil behaviour
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5410">
     amongst each other.  At first the young man appeared about to befriend
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5420">
     me.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5440">
     'I'll go with him as far as the park,' he said.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5460">
     'You'll go with him to hell!' exclaimed his master, or whatever relation
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5470">
     he bore.  'And who is to look after the horses, eh?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5490">
     'A man's life is of more consequence than one evening's neglect of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5500">
     horses: somebody must go,' murmured Mrs. Heathcliff, more kindly than I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5510">
     expected.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5530">
     'Not at your command!' retorted Hareton.  'If you set store on him, you'd
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5540">
     better be quiet.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5560">
     'Then I hope his ghost will haunt you; and I hope Mr. Heathcliff will

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5570">
     never get another tenant till the Grange is a ruin,' she answered,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5580">
     sharply.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5600">
     'Hearken, hearken, shoo's cursing on 'em!' muttered Joseph, towards whom
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5610">
     I had been steering.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5630">
     He sat within earshot, milking the cows by the light of a lantern, which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5640">
     I seized unceremoniously, and, calling out that I would send it back on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5650">
     the morrow, rushed to the nearest postern.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5670">
     'Maister, maister, he's staling t' lanthern!' shouted the ancient,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5680">
     pursuing my retreat.  'Hey, Gnasher!  Hey, dog!  Hey Wolf, holld him,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5690">
     holld him!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5710">
     On opening the little door, two hairy monsters flew at my throat, bearing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5720">
     me down, and extinguishing the light; while a mingled guffaw from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5730">
     Heathcliff and Hareton put the copestone on my rage and humiliation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5740">
     Fortunately, the beasts seemed more bent on stretching their paws, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5750">
     yawning, and flourishing their tails, than devouring me alive; but they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5760">
     would suffer no resurrection, and I was forced to lie till their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5770">
     malignant masters pleased to deliver me: then, hatless and trembling with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5780">
     wrath, I ordered the miscreants to let me out--on their peril to keep me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5790">
     one minute longer--with several incoherent threats of retaliation that,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5800">
     in their indefinite depth of virulency, smacked of King Lear.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5820">
     The vehemence of my agitation brought on a copious bleeding at the nose,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5830">
     and still Heathcliff laughed, and still I scolded.  I don't know what
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5840">
     would have concluded the scene, had there not been one person at hand
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5850">
     rather more rational than myself, and more benevolent than my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5860">
     entertainer.  This was Zillah, the stout housewife; who at length issued
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5870">
     forth to inquire into the nature of the uproar.  She thought that some of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5880">
     them had been laying violent hands on me; and, not daring to attack her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5890">
     master, she turned her vocal artillery against the younger scoundrel.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5910">
     'Well, Mr. Earnshaw,' she cried, 'I wonder what you'll have agait next?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5920">
     Are we going to murder folk on our very door-stones?  I see this house
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5930">
     will never do for me--look at t' poor lad, he's fair choking!  Wisht,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5940">
     wisht; you mun'n't go on so.  Come in, and I'll cure that: there now,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5950">
     hold ye still.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5970">
     With these words she suddenly splashed a pint of icy water down my neck,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5980">
     and pulled me into the kitchen.  Mr. Heathcliff followed, his accidental
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_5990">
     merriment expiring quickly in his habitual moroseness.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6010">
     I was sick exceedingly, and dizzy, and faint; and thus compelled perforce
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6020">
     to accept lodgings under his roof.  He told Zillah to give me a glass of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6030">
     brandy, and then passed on to the inner room; while she condoled with me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6040">
     on my sorry predicament, and having obeyed his orders, whereby I was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6050">
     somewhat revived, ushered me to bed.

     While leading the way upstairs, she recommended that I should hide the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6130">
     candle, and not make a noise; for her master had an odd notion about the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6140">
     chamber she would put me in, and never let anybody lodge there willingly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6150">
     I asked the reason.  She did not know, she answered: she had only lived
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6160">
     there a year or two; and they had so many queer goings on, she could not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6170">
     begin to be curious.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6190">
     Too stupefied to be curious myself, I fastened my door and glanced round
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6200">
     for the bed.  The whole furniture consisted of a chair, a clothes-press,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6210">
     and a large oak case, with squares cut out near the top resembling coach
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6220">
     windows.  Having approached this structure, I looked inside, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6230">
     perceived it to be a singular sort of old-fashioned couch, very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6240">
     conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6250">
     family having a room to himself.  In fact, it formed a little closet, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6260">
     the ledge of a window, which it enclosed, served as a table.  I slid back
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6270">
     the panelled sides, got in with my light, pulled them together again, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6280">
     felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff, and every one else.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6300">
     The ledge, where I placed my candle, had a few mildewed books piled up in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6310">
     one corner; and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint.  This
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6320">
     writing, however, was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6330">
     characters, large and small--_Catherine Earnshaw_, here and there varied
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6340">
     to _Catherine Heathcliff_, and then again to _Catherine Linton_.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6360">
     In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window, and continued
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6370">
     spelling over Catherine Earnshaw--Heathcliff--Linton, till my eyes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6380">
     closed; but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6390">
     letters started from the dark, as vivid as spectres--the air swarmed with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6400">
     Catherines; and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name, I discovered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6410">
     my candle-wick reclining on one of the antique volumes, and perfuming the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6420">
     place with an odour of roasted calf-skin.  I snuffed it off, and, very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6430">
     ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea, sat up and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6440">
     spread open the injured tome on my knee.  It was a Testament, in lean
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6450">
     type, and smelling dreadfully musty: a fly-leaf bore the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6460">
     inscription--'Catherine Earnshaw, her book,' and a date some quarter of a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6470">
     century back.  I shut it, and took up another and another, till I had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6480">
     examined all.  Catherine's library was select, and its state of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6490">
     dilapidation proved it to have been well used, though not altogether for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6500">
     a legitimate purpose: scarcely one chapter had escaped, a pen-and-ink
    </p>

     commentary--at least the appearance of one--covering every morsel of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6520">
     blank that the printer had left.  Some were detached sentences; other
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6530">
     parts took the form of a regular diary, scrawled in an unformed, childish

     hand.  At the top of an extra page (quite a treasure, probably, when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6550">
     first lighted on) I was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6560">
     of my friend Joseph,--rudely, yet powerfully sketched.  An immediate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_6570">
     interest kindled within me for the unknown Catherine, and I began

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7410">
     I was, half-consciously, worrying my brain to guess what Jabez Branderham
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7430">
     for the effects of bad tea and bad temper!  What else could it be that

     made me pass such a terrible night?  I don't remember another that I can

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7450">
     at all compare with it since I was capable of suffering.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7470">
     I began to dream, almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7480">
     thought it was morning; and I had set out on my way home, with Joseph for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7490">
     a guide.  The snow lay yards deep in our road; and, as we floundered on,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7500">
     my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not brought a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7510">
     pilgrim's staff: telling me that I could never get into the house without
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7520">
     one, and boastfully flourishing a heavy-headed cudgel, which I understood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7530">
     to be so denominated.  For a moment I considered it absurd that I should
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7540">
     need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence.  Then a new
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7550">
     idea flashed across me.  I was not going there: we were journeying to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7560">
     hear the famous Jabez Branderham preach, from the text--'Seventy Times
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7570">
     Seven;' and either Joseph, the preacher, or I had committed the 'First of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7580">
     the Seventy-First,' and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7600">
     We came to the chapel.  I have passed it really in my walks, twice or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7610">
     thrice; it lies in a hollow, between two hills: an elevated hollow, near
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7620">
     a swamp, whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of

     embalming on the few corpses deposited there.  The roof has been kept
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7640">
     whole hitherto; but as the clergyman's stipend is only twenty pounds per
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7650">
     annum, and a house with two rooms, threatening speedily to determine into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7660">
     one, no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor: especially as it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7670">
     is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7680">
     increase the living by one penny from their own pockets.  However, in my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7690">
     dream, Jabez had a full and attentive congregation; and he preached--good
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7700">
     God! what a sermon; divided into _four hundred and ninety_ parts, each
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7710">
     fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit, and each discussing a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7720">
     separate sin!  Where he searched for them, I cannot tell.  He had his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7730">
     private manner of interpreting the phrase, and it seemed necessary the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7740">
     brother should sin different sins on every occasion.  They were of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7750">
     most curious character: odd transgressions that I never imagined
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7760">
     previously.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7780">
     Oh, how weary I grow.  How I writhed, and yawned, and nodded, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7790">
     revived!  How I pinched and pricked myself, and rubbed my eyes, and stood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7800">
     up, and sat down again, and nudged Joseph to inform me if he would _ever_
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7810">
     have done.  I was condemned to hear all out: finally, he reached the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7820">
     '_First of the Seventy-First_.'  At that crisis, a sudden inspiration
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7830">
     descended on me; I was moved to rise and denounce Jabez Branderham as the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7840">
     sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7860">
     'Sir,' I exclaimed, 'sitting here within these four walls, at one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7870">
     stretch, I have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7880">
     your discourse.  Seventy times seven times have I plucked up my hat and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7890">
     been about to depart--Seventy times seven times have you preposterously
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7900">
     forced me to resume my seat.  The four hundred and ninety-first is too
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7910">
     much.  Fellow-martyrs, have at him!  Drag him down, and crush him to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7920">
     atoms, that the place which knows him may know him no more!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7940">
     '_Thou art the Man_!' cried Jabez, after a solemn pause, leaning over his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7950">
     cushion.  'Seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7960">
     visage--seventy times seven did I take counsel with my soul--Lo, this is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7970">
     human weakness: this also may be absolved!  The First of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7980">
     Seventy-First is come.  Brethren, execute upon him the judgment written.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_7990">
     Such honour have all His saints!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8010">
     With that concluding word, the whole assembly, exalting their pilgrim's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8020">
     staves, rushed round me in a body; and I, having no weapon to raise in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8030">
     self-defence, commenced grappling with Joseph, my nearest and most
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8040">
     ferocious assailant, for his.  In the confluence of the multitude,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8050">
     several clubs crossed; blows, aimed at me, fell on other sconces.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8060">
     Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counter rappings:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8070">
     every man's hand was against his neighbour; and Branderham, unwilling to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8080">
     remain idle, poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8090">
     of the pulpit, which responded so smartly that, at last, to my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8100">
     unspeakable relief, they woke me.  And what was it that had suggested the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8110">
     tremendous tumult?  What had played Jabez's part in the row?  Merely the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8120">
     branch of a fir-tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8130">
     rattled its dry cones against the panes!  I listened doubtingly an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8140">
     instant; detected the disturber, then turned and dozed, and dreamt again:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8150">
     if possible, still more disagreeably than before.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8170">
     This time, I remembered I was lying in the oak closet, and I heard
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8180">
     distinctly the gusty wind, and the driving of the snow; I heard, also,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8190">
     the fir bough repeat its teasing sound, and ascribed it to the right
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8200">
     cause: but it annoyed me so much, that I resolved to silence it, if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8210">
     possible; and, I thought, I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8220">
     The hook was soldered into the staple: a circumstance observed by me when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8230">
     awake, but forgotten.  'I must stop it, nevertheless!' I muttered,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8240">
     knocking my knuckles through the glass, and stretching an arm out to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8250">
     seize the importunate branch; instead of which, my fingers closed on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8260">
     fingers of a little, ice-cold hand!  The intense horror of nightmare came
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8270">
     over me: I tried to draw back my arm, but the hand clung to it, and a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8280">
     most melancholy voice sobbed, 'Let me in--let me in!'  'Who are you?' I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8290">
     asked, struggling, meanwhile, to disengage myself.  'Catherine Linton,'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8300">
     it replied, shiveringly (why did I think of _Linton_?  I had read
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8310">
     _Earnshaw_ twenty times for Linton)--'I'm come home: I'd lost my way on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8320">
     the moor!'  As it spoke, I discerned, obscurely, a child's face looking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8330">
     through the window.  Terror made me cruel; and, finding it useless to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8340">
     attempt shaking the creature off, I pulled its wrist on to the broken
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8350">
     pane, and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8360">
     bedclothes: still it wailed, 'Let me in!' and maintained its tenacious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8370">
     grip, almost maddening me with fear.  'How can I!' I said at length.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8380">
     'Let _me_ go, if you want me to let you in!'  The fingers relaxed, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8390">
     snatched mine through the hole, hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8400">
     against it, and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8410">
     seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour; yet, the instant I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8420">
     listened again, there was the doleful cry moaning on!  'Begone!' I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8430">
     shouted.  'I'll never let you in, not if you beg for twenty years.'  'It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8440">
     is twenty years,' mourned the voice: 'twenty years.  I've been a waif for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8450">
     twenty years!'  Thereat began a feeble scratching outside, and the pile
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8460">
     of books moved as if thrust forward.  I tried to jump up; but could not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8470">
     stir a limb; and so yelled aloud, in a frenzy of fright.  To my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8480">
     confusion, I discovered the yell was not ideal: hasty footsteps
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8490">
     approached my chamber door; somebody pushed it open, with a vigorous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8500">
     hand, and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8510">
     sat shuddering yet, and wiping the perspiration from my forehead: the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8520">
     intruder appeared to hesitate, and muttered to himself.  At last, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8530">
     said, in a half-whisper, plainly not expecting an answer, 'Is any one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8540">
     here?'  I considered it best to confess my presence; for I knew
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8550">
     Heathcliff's accents, and feared he might search further, if I kept
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8560">
     quiet.  With this intention, I turned and opened the panels.  I shall not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8570">
     soon forget the effect my action produced.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8590">
     Heathcliff stood near the entrance, in his shirt and trousers; with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8600">
     candle dripping over his fingers, and his face as white as the wall
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8610">
     behind him.  The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8620">
     shock: the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet, and his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8630">
     agitation was so extreme, that he could hardly pick it up.

     'It is only your guest, sir,' I called out, desirous to spare him the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8660">
     humiliation of exposing his cowardice further.  'I had the misfortune to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8670">
     scream in my sleep, owing to a frightful nightmare.  I'm sorry I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8680">
     disturbed you.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8700">
     'Oh, God confound you, Mr. Lockwood!  I wish you were at the--' commenced
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8710">
     my host, setting the candle on a chair, because he found it impossible to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8720">
     hold it steady.  'And who showed you up into this room?' he continued,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8730">
     crushing his nails into his palms, and grinding his teeth to subdue the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8740">
     maxillary convulsions.  'Who was it?  I've a good mind to turn them out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8750">
     of the house this moment?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8770">
     'It was your servant Zillah,' I replied, flinging myself on to the floor,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8780">
     and rapidly resuming my garments.  'I should not care if you did, Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8790">
     Heathcliff; she richly deserves it.  I suppose that she wanted to get
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8800">
     another proof that the place was haunted, at my expense.  Well, it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8810">
     is--swarming with ghosts and goblins!  You have reason in shutting it up,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8820">
     I assure you.  No one will thank you for a doze in such a den!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8840">
     'What do you mean?' asked Heathcliff, 'and what are you doing?  Lie down
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8850">
     and finish out the night, since you _are_ here; but, for heaven's sake!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8860">
     don't repeat that horrid noise: nothing could excuse it, unless you were

     having your throat cut!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8890">
     'If the little fiend had got in at the window, she probably would have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8900">
     strangled me!' I returned.  'I'm not going to endure the persecutions of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8910">
     your hospitable ancestors again.  Was not the Reverend Jabez Branderham
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8920">
     akin to you on the mother's side?  And that minx, Catherine Linton, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8930">
     Earnshaw, or however she was called--she must have been a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8940">
     changeling--wicked little soul!  She told me she had been walking the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8950">
     earth these twenty years: a just punishment for her mortal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8960">
     transgressions, I've no doubt!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8980">
     Scarcely were these words uttered when I recollected the association of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_8990">
     Heathcliff's with Catherine's name in the book, which had completely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9000">
     slipped from my memory, till thus awakened.  I blushed at my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9010">
     inconsideration: but, without showing further consciousness of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9020">
     offence, I hastened to add--'The truth is, sir, I passed the first part
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9030">
     of the night in--'  Here I stopped afresh--I was about to say 'perusing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9040">
     those old volumes,' then it would have revealed my knowledge of their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9050">
     written, as well as their printed, contents; so, correcting myself, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9060">
     went on--'in spelling over the name scratched on that window-ledge.  A
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9070">
     monotonous occupation, calculated to set me asleep, like counting, or--'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9090">
     'What _can_ you mean by talking in this way to _me_!' thundered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9100">
     Heathcliff with savage vehemence.  'How--how _dare_ you, under my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9110">
     roof?--God! he's mad to speak so!'  And he struck his forehead with rage.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9130">
     I did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9140">
     but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and proceeded with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9150">
     my dreams; affirming I had never heard the appellation of 'Catherine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9160">
     Linton' before, but reading it often over produced an impression which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9170">
     personified itself when I had no longer my imagination under control.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9180">
     Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed, as I spoke;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9190">
     finally sitting down almost concealed behind it.  I guessed, however, by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9200">
     his irregular and intercepted breathing, that he struggled to vanquish an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9210">
     excess of violent emotion.  Not liking to show him that I had heard the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9220">
     conflict, I continued my toilette rather noisily, looked at my watch, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9230">
     soliloquised on the length of the night: 'Not three o'clock yet!  I could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9240">
     have taken oath it had been six.  Time stagnates here: we must surely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9250">
     have retired to rest at eight!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9270">
     'Always at nine in winter, and rise at four,' said my host, suppressing a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9280">
     groan: and, as I fancied, by the motion of his arm's shadow, dashing a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9290">
     tear from his eyes.  'Mr. Lockwood,' he added, 'you may go into my room:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9300">
     you'll only be in the way, coming down-stairs so early: and your childish
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9310">
     outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9330">
     'And for me, too,' I replied.  'I'll walk in the yard till daylight, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9340">
     then I'll be off; and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9350">
     I'm now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society, be it country or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9360">
     town.  A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9380">
     'Delightful company!' muttered Heathcliff.  'Take the candle, and go
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9390">
     where you please.  I shall join you directly.  Keep out of the yard,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9400">
     though, the dogs are unchained; and the house--Juno mounts sentinel
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9410">
     there, and--nay, you can only ramble about the steps and passages.  But,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9420">
     away with you!  I'll come in two minutes!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9440">
     I obeyed, so far as to quit the chamber; when, ignorant where the narrow
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9450">
     lobbies led, I stood still, and was witness, involuntarily, to a piece of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9460">
     superstition on the part of my landlord which belied, oddly, his apparent
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9470">
     sense.  He got on to the bed, and wrenched open the lattice, bursting, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9480">
     he pulled at it, into an uncontrollable passion of tears.  'Come in! come
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9490">
     in!' he sobbed.  'Cathy, do come.  Oh, do--_once_ more!  Oh! my heart's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9500">
     darling! hear me _this_ time, Catherine, at last!'  The spectre showed a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9510">
     spectre's ordinary caprice: it gave no sign of being; but the snow and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9520">
     wind whirled wildly through, even reaching my station, and blowing out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9530">
     the light.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9550">
     There was such anguish in the gush of grief that accompanied this raving,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9560">
     that my compassion made me overlook its folly, and I drew off, half angry
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9570">
     to have listened at all, and vexed at having related my ridiculous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9580">
     nightmare, since it produced that agony; though _why_ was beyond my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9590">
     comprehension.  I descended cautiously to the lower regions, and landed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9600">
     in the back-kitchen, where a gleam of fire, raked compactly together,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9610">
     enabled me to rekindle my candle.  Nothing was stirring except a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9620">
     brindled, grey cat, which crept from the ashes, and saluted me with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9630">
     querulous mew.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9650">
     Two benches, shaped in sections of a circle, nearly enclosed the hearth;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9660">
     on one of these I stretched myself, and Grimalkin mounted the other.  We
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9670">
     were both of us nodding ere any one invaded our retreat, and then it was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9680">
     Joseph, shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof, through
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9690">
     a trap: the ascent to his garret, I suppose.  He cast a sinister look at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9700">
     the little flame which I had enticed to play between the ribs, swept the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9710">
     cat from its elevation, and bestowing himself in the vacancy, commenced
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9720">
     the operation of stuffing a three-inch pipe with tobacco.  My presence in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9730">
     his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9740">
     remark: he silently applied the tube to his lips, folded his arms, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9750">
     puffed away.  I let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed; and after sucking out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9760">
     his last wreath, and heaving a profound sigh, he got up, and departed as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9770">
     solemnly as he came.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9790">
     A more elastic footstep entered next; and now I opened my mouth for a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9800">
     'good-morning,' but closed it again, the salutation unachieved; for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9810">
     Hareton Earnshaw was performing his orison _sotto voce_, in a series of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9820">
     curses directed against every object he touched, while he rummaged a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9830">
     corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts.  He glanced over
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9840">
     the back of the bench, dilating his nostrils, and thought as little of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9850">
     exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat.  I guessed,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9860">
     by his preparations, that egress was allowed, and, leaving my hard couch,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9870">
     made a movement to follow him.  He noticed this, and thrust at an inner
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9880">
     door with the end of his spade, intimating by an inarticulate sound that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9890">
     there was the place where I must go, if I changed my locality.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9910">
     It opened into the house, where the females were already astir; Zillah
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9920">
     urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows; and Mrs.

     Heathcliff, kneeling on the hearth, reading a book by the aid of the
    </p>

     blaze.  She held her hand interposed between the furnace-heat and her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9950">
     eyes, and seemed absorbed in her occupation; desisting from it only to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9960">
     chide the servant for covering her with sparks, or to push away a dog,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9970">
     now and then, that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face.  I was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9980">
     surprised to see Heathcliff there also.  He stood by the fire, his back
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_9990">
     towards me, just finishing a stormy scene with poor Zillah; who ever and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10000">
     anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10010">
     heave an indignant groan.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10030">
     'And you, you worthless--' he broke out as I entered, turning to his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10040">
     daughter-in-law, and employing an epithet as harmless as duck, or sheep,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10050">
     but generally represented by a dash--.  'There you are, at your idle

     damnable jade?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10110">
     'I'll put my trash away, because you can make me if I refuse,' answered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10120">
     the young lady, closing her book, and throwing it on a chair.  'But I'll

     not do anything, though you should swear your tongue out, except what I

     please!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10160">
     Heathcliff lifted his hand, and the speaker sprang to a safer distance,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10170">
     obviously acquainted with its weight.  Having no desire to be entertained
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10180">
     by a cat-and-dog combat, I stepped forward briskly, as if eager to

     partake the warmth of the hearth, and innocent of any knowledge of the

     interrupted dispute.  Each had enough decorum to suspend further
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10210">
     hostilities: Heathcliff placed his fists, out of temptation, in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10220">
     pockets; Mrs. Heathcliff curled her lip, and walked to a seat far off,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10230">
     where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10240">
     remainder of my stay.  That was not long.  I declined joining their

     breakfast, and, at the first gleam of dawn, took an opportunity of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10260">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10310">
     for the whole hill-back was one billowy, white ocean; the swells and

     falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the ground:
    </p>

     the refuse of the quarries, blotted from the chart which my yesterday's

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10360">
     at intervals of six or seven yards, a line of upright stones, continued

     through the whole length of the barren: these were erected and daubed
    </p>

     with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark, and also when a

     the firmer path: but, excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there,

     all traces of their existence had vanished: and my companion found it

     necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left, when I
    </p>

     imagined I was following, correctly, the windings of the road.

     limited to a hasty bow, and then I pushed forward, trusting to my own
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10480">
     resources; for the porter's lodge is untenanted as yet.  The distance
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10490">
     from the gate to the grange is two miles; I believe I managed to make it

     four, what with losing myself among the trees, and sinking up to the neck

     in snow: a predicament which only those who have experienced it can
    </p>

     twelve as I entered the house; and that gave exactly an hour for every

     I perished last night; and they were wondering how they must set about
    </p>

     the search for my remains.  I bid them be quiet, now that they saw me

     returned, and, benumbed to my very heart, I dragged up-stairs; whence,

    </p>

     weak wretch, after maintaining till dusk a struggle with low spirits and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10750">
     solitude, was finally compelled to strike my colours; and under pretence
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10760">
     of gaining information concerning the necessities of my establishment, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10770">
     desired Mrs. Dean, when she brought in supper, to sit down while I ate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10780">
     it; hoping sincerely she would prove a regular gossip, and either rouse
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10790">
     me to animation or lull me to sleep by her talk.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10810">
     'You have lived here a considerable time,' I commenced; 'did you not say
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10820">
     sixteen years?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10840">
     'Eighteen, sir: I came when the mistress was married, to wait on her;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10850">
     after she died, the master retained me for his housekeeper.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10870">
     'Indeed.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10890">
     There ensued a pause.  She was not a gossip, I feared; unless about her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10900">
     own affairs, and those could hardly interest me.  However, having studied
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10910">
     for an interval, with a fist on either knee, and a cloud of meditation
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10920">
     over her ruddy countenance, she ejaculated--'Ah, times are greatly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10930">
     changed since then!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10950">
     'Yes,' I remarked, 'you've seen a good many alterations, I suppose?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10970">
     'I have: and troubles too,' she said.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_10990">
     'Oh, I'll turn the talk on my landlord's family!' I thought to myself.  'A
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11000">
     good subject to start!  And that pretty girl-widow, I should like to know
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11010">
     her history: whether she be a native of the country, or, as is more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11020">
     probable, an exotic that the surly _indigenae_ will not recognise for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11030">
     kin.'  With this intention I asked Mrs. Dean why Heathcliff let
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11040">
     Thrushcross Grange, and preferred living in a situation and residence so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11050">
     much inferior.  'Is he not rich enough to keep the estate in good order?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11060">
     I inquired.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11080">
     'Rich, sir!' she returned.  'He has nobody knows what money, and every
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11090">
     year it increases.  Yes, yes, he's rich enough to live in a finer house
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11100">
     than this: but he's very near--close-handed; and, if he had meant to flit
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11110">
     to Thrushcross Grange, as soon as he heard of a good tenant he could not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11120">
     have borne to miss the chance of getting a few hundreds more.  It is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11130">
     strange people should be so greedy, when they are alone in the world!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11150">
     'He had a son, it seems?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11170">
     'Yes, he had one--he is dead.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11190">
     'And that young lady, Mrs. Heathcliff, is his widow?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11210">
     'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11230">
     'Where did she come from originally?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11250">
     'Why, sir, she is my late master's daughter: Catherine Linton was her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11260">
     maiden name.  I nursed her, poor thing!  I did wish Mr. Heathcliff would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11270">
     remove here, and then we might have been together again.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11290">
     'What!  Catherine Linton?' I exclaimed, astonished.  But a minute's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11300">
     reflection convinced me it was not my ghostly Catherine.  'Then,' I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11310">
     continued, 'my predecessor's name was Linton?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11330">
     'It was.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11350">
     'And who is that Earnshaw: Hareton Earnshaw, who lives with Mr.

    </p>

     'No; he is the late Mrs. Linton's nephew.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11400">
     'The young lady's cousin, then?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11420">
     'Yes; and her husband was her cousin also: one on the mother's, the other
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11430">
     on the father's side: Heathcliff married Mr. Linton's sister.'

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11450">
     'I see the house at Wuthering Heights has "Earnshaw" carved over the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11480">
     'Very old, sir; and Hareton is the last of them, as our Miss Cathy is of

     us--I mean, of the Lintons.  Have you been to Wuthering Heights?  I beg
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11500">
     pardon for asking; but I should like to hear how she is!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11520">
     'Mrs. Heathcliff? she looked very well, and very handsome; yet, I think,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11530">
     not very happy.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11550">
     'Oh dear, I don't wonder!  And how did you like the master?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11570">
     'A rough fellow, rather, Mrs. Dean.  Is not that his character?
    </p>

     'Rough as a saw-edge, and hard as whinstone!  The less you meddle with

     you know anything of his history?'

     who were his parents, and how he got his money at first.  And Hareton has
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11670">
     been cast out like an unfledged dunnock!  The unfortunate lad is the only
    </p>

     one in all this parish that does not guess how he has been cheated.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11700">
     'Well, Mrs. Dean, it will be a charitable deed to tell me something of my

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11750">
     as long as you please.  But you've caught cold: I saw you shivering, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11760">
     you must have some gruel to drive it out.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11780">
     The worthy woman bustled off, and I crouched nearer the fire; my head
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11790">
     felt hot, and the rest of me chill: moreover, I was excited, almost to a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11800">
     pitch of foolishness, through my nerves and brain.  This caused me to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11810">
     feel, not uncomfortable, but rather fearful (as I am still) of serious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11820">
     effects from the incidents of to-day and yesterday.  She returned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11830">
     presently, bringing a smoking basin and a basket of work; and, having
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11840">
     placed the former on the hob, drew in her seat, evidently pleased to find
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11850">
     me so companionable.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11870">
     Before I came to live here, she commenced--waiting no farther invitation
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11880">
     to her story--I was almost always at Wuthering Heights; because my mother
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11890">
     had nursed Mr. Hindley Earnshaw, that was Hareton's father, and I got
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11900">
     used to playing with the children: I ran errands too, and helped to make
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11910">
     hay, and hung about the farm ready for anything that anybody would set me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11920">
     to.  One fine summer morning--it was the beginning of harvest, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11930">
     remember--Mr. Earnshaw, the old master, came down-stairs, dressed for a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11940">
     journey; and, after he had told Joseph what was to be done during the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11950">
     day, he turned to Hindley, and Cathy, and me--for I sat eating my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11960">
     porridge with them--and he said, speaking to his son, 'Now, my bonny man,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11970">
     I'm going to Liverpool to-day, what shall I bring you?  You may choose
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11980">
     what you like: only let it be little, for I shall walk there and back:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_11990">
     sixty miles each way, that is a long spell!'  Hindley named a fiddle, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12000">
     then he asked Miss Cathy; she was hardly six years old, but she could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12010">
     ride any horse in the stable, and she chose a whip.  He did not forget
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12020">
     me; for he had a kind heart, though he was rather severe sometimes.  He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12030">
     promised to bring me a pocketful of apples and pears, and then he kissed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12040">
     his children, said good-bye, and set off.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12060">
     It seemed a long while to us all--the three days of his absence--and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12070">
     often did little Cathy ask when he would be home.  Mrs. Earnshaw expected
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12080">
     him by supper-time on the third evening, and she put the meal off hour

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12090">
     after hour; there were no signs of his coming, however, and at last the

     children got tired of running down to the gate to look.  Then it grew

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12110">
     dark; she would have had them to bed, but they begged sadly to be allowed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12120">
     to stay up; and, just about eleven o'clock, the door-latch was raised
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12130">
     quietly, and in stepped the master.  He threw himself into a chair,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12140">
     laughing and groaning, and bid them all stand off, for he was nearly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12150">
     killed--he would not have such another walk for the three kingdoms.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12170">
     'And at the end of it to be flighted to death!' he said, opening his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12180">
     great-coat, which he held bundled up in his arms.  'See here, wife!  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12190">
     was never so beaten with anything in my life: but you must e'en take it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12200">
     as a gift of God; though it's as dark almost as if it came from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12210">
     devil.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12230">
     We crowded round, and over Miss Cathy's head I had a peep at a dirty,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12240">
     ragged, black-haired child; big enough both to walk and talk: indeed, its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12250">
     face looked older than Catherine's; yet when it was set on its feet, it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12260">
     only stared round, and repeated over and over again some gibberish that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12270">
     nobody could understand.  I was frightened, and Mrs. Earnshaw was ready
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12280">
     to fling it out of doors: she did fly up, asking how he could fashion to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12290">
     bring that gipsy brat into the house, when they had their own bairns to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12300">
     feed and fend for?  What he meant to do with it, and whether he were mad?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12310">
     The master tried to explain the matter; but he was really half dead with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12320">
     fatigue, and all that I could make out, amongst her scolding, was a tale
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12330">
     of his seeing it starving, and houseless, and as good as dumb, in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12340">
     streets of Liverpool, where he picked it up and inquired for its owner.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12350">
     Not a soul knew to whom it belonged, he said; and his money and time
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12360">
     being both limited, he thought it better to take it home with him at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12370">
     once, than run into vain expenses there: because he was determined he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12380">
     would not leave it as he found it.  Well, the conclusion was, that my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12390">
     mistress grumbled herself calm; and Mr. Earnshaw told me to wash it, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12400">
     give it clean things, and let it sleep with the children.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12420">
     Hindley and Cathy contented themselves with looking and listening till
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12430">
     peace was restored: then, both began searching their father's pockets
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12440">
     for the presents he had promised them. The former was a boy of fourteen,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12450">
     but when he drew out what had been a fiddle, crushed to morsels in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12460">
     great-coat, he blubbered aloud; and Cathy, when she learned the master
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12470">
     had lost her whip in attending on the stranger, showed her humour by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12480">
     grinning and spitting at the stupid little thing; earning for her pains
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12490">
     a sound blow from her father, to teach her cleaner manners. They
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12500">
     entirely refused to have it in bed with them, or even in their room; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12510">
     I had no more sense, so I put it on the landing of the stairs, hoping it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12520">
     might be gone on the morrow. By chance, or else attracted by hearing his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12530">
     voice, it crept to Mr. Earnshaw's door, and there he found it on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12540">
     quitting his chamber. Inquiries were made as to how it got there; I was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12550">
     obliged to confess, and in recompense for my cowardice and inhumanity
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12560">
     was sent out of the house.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12580">
     This was Heathcliff's first introduction to the family.  On coming back a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12590">
     few days afterwards (for I did not consider my banishment perpetual), I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12600">
     found they had christened him 'Heathcliff': it was the name of a son who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12610">
     died in childhood, and it has served him ever since, both for Christian
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12620">
     and surname.  Miss Cathy and he were now very thick; but Hindley hated
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12630">
     him: and to say the truth I did the same; and we plagued and went on with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12640">
     him shamefully: for I wasn't reasonable enough to feel my injustice, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12650">
     the mistress never put in a word on his behalf when she saw him wronged.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12670">
     He seemed a sullen, patient child; hardened, perhaps, to ill-treatment:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12680">
     he would stand Hindley's blows without winking or shedding a tear, and my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12690">
     pinches moved him only to draw in a breath and open his eyes, as if he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12700">
     had hurt himself by accident, and nobody was to blame.  This endurance
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12710">
     made old Earnshaw furious, when he discovered his son persecuting the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12720">
     poor fatherless child, as he called him.  He took to Heathcliff
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12730">
     strangely, believing all he said (for that matter, he said precious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12740">
     little, and generally the truth), and petting him up far above Cathy, who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12750">
     was too mischievous and wayward for a favourite.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12770">
     So, from the very beginning, he bred bad feeling in the house; and at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12780">
     Mrs. Earnshaw's death, which happened in less than two years after, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12790">
     young master had learned to regard his father as an oppressor rather than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12800">
     a friend, and Heathcliff as a usurper of his parent's affections and his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12810">
     privileges; and he grew bitter with brooding over these injuries.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12820">
     sympathised a while; but when the children fell ill of the measles, and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12830">
     had to tend them, and take on me the cares of a woman at once, I changed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12840">
     my idea.  Heathcliff was dangerously sick; and while he lay at the worst
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12850">
     he would have me constantly by his pillow: I suppose he felt I did a good
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12860">
     deal for him, and he hadn't wit to guess that I was compelled to do it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12870">
     However, I will say this, he was the quietest child that ever nurse
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12880">
     watched over.  The difference between him and the others forced me to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12890">
     less partial.  Cathy and her brother harassed me terribly: he was as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12900">
     uncomplaining as a lamb; though hardness, not gentleness, made him give
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12910">
     little trouble.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12930">
     He got through, and the doctor affirmed it was in a great measure owing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12940">
     to me, and praised me for my care.  I was vain of his commendations, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12950">
     softened towards the being by whose means I earned them, and thus Hindley
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12960">
     lost his last ally: still I couldn't dote on Heathcliff, and I wondered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12970">
     often what my master saw to admire so much in the sullen boy; who never,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12980">
     to my recollection, repaid his indulgence by any sign of gratitude.  He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_12990">
     was not insolent to his benefactor, he was simply insensible; though
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13000">
     knowing perfectly the hold he had on his heart, and conscious he had only
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13010">
     to speak and all the house would be obliged to bend to his wishes.  As an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13020">
     instance, I remember Mr. Earnshaw once bought a couple of colts at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13030">
     parish fair, and gave the lads each one.  Heathcliff took the handsomest,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13040">
     but it soon fell lame, and when he discovered it, he said to Hindley--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13060">
     'You must exchange horses with me: I don't like mine; and if you won't I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13070">
     shall tell your father of the three thrashings you've given me this week,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13080">
     and show him my arm, which is black to the shoulder.'  Hindley put out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13090">
     his tongue, and cuffed him over the ears.  'You'd better do it at once,'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13100">
     he persisted, escaping to the porch (they were in the stable): 'you will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13110">
     have to: and if I speak of these blows, you'll get them again with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13120">
     interest.'  'Off, dog!' cried Hindley, threatening him with an iron
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13130">
     weight used for weighing potatoes and hay.  'Throw it,' he replied,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13140">
     standing still, 'and then I'll tell how you boasted that you would turn
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13150">
     me out of doors as soon as he died, and see whether he will not turn you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13160">
     out directly.'  Hindley threw it, hitting him on the breast, and down he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13170">
     fell, but staggered up immediately, breathless and white; and, had not I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13180">
     prevented it, he would have gone just so to the master, and got full
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13190">
     revenge by letting his condition plead for him, intimating who had caused
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13200">
     it.  'Take my colt, Gipsy, then!' said young Earnshaw.  'And I pray that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13210">
     he may break your neck: take him, and be damned, you beggarly interloper!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13220">
     and wheedle my father out of all he has: only afterwards show him what
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13230">
     you are, imp of Satan.--And take that, I hope he'll kick out your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13240">
     brains!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13260">
     Heathcliff had gone to loose the beast, and shift it to his own stall; he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13270">
     was passing behind it, when Hindley finished his speech by knocking him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13280">
     under its feet, and without stopping to examine whether his hopes were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13290">
     fulfilled, ran away as fast as he could.  I was surprised to witness how
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13300">
     coolly the child gathered himself up, and went on with his intention;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13310">
     exchanging saddles and all, and then sitting down on a bundle of hay to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13320">
     overcome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned, before he entered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13330">
     the house.  I persuaded him easily to let me lay the blame of his bruises
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13340">
     on the horse: he minded little what tale was told since he had what he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13350">
     wanted.  He complained so seldom, indeed, of such stirs as these, that I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13360">
     really thought him not vindictive: I was deceived completely, as you will

     CHAPTER V
    </head>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13440">
     In the course of time Mr. Earnshaw began to fail. He had been active and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13450">
     healthy, yet his strength left him suddenly; and when he was confined to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13460">
     the chimney-corner he grew grievously irritable. A nothing vexed him;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13470">
     and suspected slights of his authority nearly threw him into fits. This
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13480">
     was especially to be remarked if any one attempted to impose upon, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13490">
     domineer over, his favourite: he was painfully jealous lest a word
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13500">
     should be spoken amiss to him; seeming to have got into his head the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13510">
     notion that, because he liked Heathcliff, all hated, and longed to do
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13520">
     him an ill-turn. It was a disadvantage to the lad; for the kinder among
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13530">
     us did not wish to fret the master, so we humoured his partiality; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13540">
     that humouring was rich nourishment to the child's pride and black
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13550">
     tempers. Still it became in a manner necessary; twice, or thrice,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13560">
     Hindley's manifestation of scorn, while his father was near, roused the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13570">
     old man to a fury: he seized his stick to strike him, and shook with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13580">
     rage that he could not do it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13600">
     At last, our curate (we had a curate then who made the living answer by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13610">
     teaching the little Lintons and Earnshaws, and farming his bit of land
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13620">
     himself) advised that the young man should be sent to college; and Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13630">
     Earnshaw agreed, though with a heavy spirit, for he said--'Hindley was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13640">
     nought, and would never thrive as where he wandered.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13660">
     I hoped heartily we should have peace now.  It hurt me to think the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13670">
     master should be made uncomfortable by his own good deed.  I fancied the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13680">
     discontent of age and disease arose from his family disagreements; as he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13690">
     would have it that it did: really, you know, sir, it was in his sinking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13700">
     frame.  We might have got on tolerably, notwithstanding, but for two
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13710">
     people--Miss Cathy, and Joseph, the servant: you saw him, I daresay, up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13720">
     yonder.  He was, and is yet most likely, the wearisomest self-righteous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13730">
     Pharisee that ever ransacked a Bible to rake the promises to himself and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13740">
     fling the curses to his neighbours.  By his knack of sermonising and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13750">
     pious discoursing, he contrived to make a great impression on Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13760">
     Earnshaw; and the more feeble the master became, the more influence he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13770">
     gained.  He was relentless in worrying him about his soul's concerns, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13780">
     about ruling his children rigidly.  He encouraged him to regard Hindley
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13790">
     as a reprobate; and, night after night, he regularly grumbled out a long
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13800">
     string of tales against Heathcliff and Catherine: always minding to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13810">
     flatter Earnshaw's weakness by heaping the heaviest blame on the latter.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13830">
     Certainly she had ways with her such as I never saw a child take up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13840">
     before; and she put all of us past our patience fifty times and oftener
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13850">
     in a day: from the hour she came down-stairs till the hour she went to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13860">
     bed, we had not a minute's security that she wouldn't be in mischief.  Her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13870">
     spirits were always at high-water mark, her tongue always going--singing,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13880">
     laughing, and plaguing everybody who would not do the same.  A wild,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13890">
     wicked slip she was--but she had the bonniest eye, the sweetest smile,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13900">
     and lightest foot in the parish: and, after all, I believe she meant no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13910">
     harm; for when once she made you cry in good earnest, it seldom happened
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13920">
     that she would not keep you company, and oblige you to be quiet that you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13930">
     might comfort her.  She was much too fond of Heathcliff.  The greatest
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13940">
     punishment we could invent for her was to keep her separate from him: yet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13950">
     she got chided more than any of us on his account.  In play, she liked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13960">
     exceedingly to act the little mistress; using her hands freely, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13970">
     commanding her companions: she did so to me, but I would not bear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_13980">
     slapping and ordering; and so I let her know.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14000">
     Now, Mr. Earnshaw did not understand jokes from his children: he had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14010">
     always been strict and grave with them; and Catherine, on her part, had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14020">
     no idea why her father should be crosser and less patient in his ailing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14030">
     condition than he was in his prime.  His peevish reproofs wakened in her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14040">
     a naughty delight to provoke him: she was never so happy as when we were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14050">
     all scolding her at once, and she defying us with her bold, saucy look,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14060">
     and her ready words; turning Joseph's religious curses into ridicule,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14070">
     baiting me, and doing just what her father hated most--showing how her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14080">
     pretended insolence, which he thought real, had more power over
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14090">
     Heathcliff than his kindness: how the boy would do _her_ bidding in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14100">
     anything, and _his_ only when it suited his own inclination.  After
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14110">
     behaving as badly as possible all day, she sometimes came fondling to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14120">
     make it up at night.  'Nay, Cathy,' the old man would say, 'I cannot love
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14130">
     thee, thou'rt worse than thy brother.  Go, say thy prayers, child, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14140">
     ask God's pardon.  I doubt thy mother and I must rue that we ever reared
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14150">
     thee!'  That made her cry, at first; and then being repulsed continually
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14160">
     hardened her, and she laughed if I told her to say she was sorry for her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14170">
     faults, and beg to be forgiven.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14190">
     But the hour came, at last, that ended Mr. Earnshaw's troubles on earth.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14200">
     He died quietly in his chair one October evening, seated by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14210">
     fire-side.  A high wind blustered round the house, and roared in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14220">
     chimney: it sounded wild and stormy, yet it was not cold, and we were all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14230">
     together--I, a little removed from the hearth, busy at my knitting, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14240">
     Joseph reading his Bible near the table (for the servants generally sat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14250">
     in the house then, after their work was done).  Miss Cathy had been sick,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14260">
     and that made her still; she leant against her father's knee, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14270">
     Heathcliff was lying on the floor with his head in her lap.  I remember
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14280">
     the master, before he fell into a doze, stroking her bonny hair--it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14290">
     pleased him rarely to see her gentle--and saying, 'Why canst thou not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14300">
     always be a good lass, Cathy?'  And she turned her face up to his, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14310">
     laughed, and answered, 'Why cannot you always be a good man, father?'  But
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14320">
     as soon as she saw him vexed again, she kissed his hand, and said she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14330">
     would sing him to sleep.  She began singing very low, till his fingers
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14340">
     dropped from hers, and his head sank on his breast.  Then I told her to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14350">
     hush, and not stir, for fear she should wake him.  We all kept as mute as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14360">
     mice a full half-hour, and should have done so longer, only Joseph,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14370">
     having finished his chapter, got up and said that he must rouse the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14380">
     master for prayers and bed.  He stepped forward, and called him by name,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14390">
     and touched his shoulder; but he would not move: so he took the candle
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14400">
     and looked at him.  I thought there was something wrong as he set down
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14410">
     the light; and seizing the children each by an arm, whispered them to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14420">
     'frame up-stairs, and make little din--they might pray alone that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14430">
     evening--he had summut to do.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14450">
     'I shall bid father good-night first,' said Catherine, putting her arms
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14460">
     round his neck, before we could hinder her.  The poor thing discovered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14470">
     her loss directly--she screamed out--'Oh, he's dead, Heathcliff! he's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14480">
     dead!'  And they both set up a heart-breaking cry.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14500">
     I joined my wail to theirs, loud and bitter; but Joseph asked what we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14510">
     could be thinking of to roar in that way over a saint in heaven.  He told
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14520">
     me to put on my cloak and run to Gimmerton for the doctor and the parson.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14530">
     I could not guess the use that either would be of, then.  However, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14540">
     went, through wind and rain, and brought one, the doctor, back with me;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14550">
     the other said he would come in the morning.  Leaving Joseph to explain
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14560">
     matters, I ran to the children's room: their door was ajar, I saw they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14570">
     had never lain down, though it was past midnight; but they were calmer,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14580">
     and did not need me to console them.  The little souls were comforting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14590">
     each other with better thoughts than I could have hit on: no parson in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14600">
     the world ever pictured heaven so beautifully as they did, in their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14610">
     innocent talk; and, while I sobbed and listened, I could not help wishing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14620">
     we were all there safe together.

     Mr. Hindley came home to the funeral; and--a thing that amazed us, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14700">
     set the neighbours gossiping right and left--he brought a wife with him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14710">
     What she was, and where she was born, he never informed us: probably, she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14720">
     had neither money nor name to recommend her, or he would scarcely have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14730">
     kept the union from his father.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14750">
     She was not one that would have disturbed the house much on her own
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14760">
     account.  Every object she saw, the moment she crossed the threshold,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14770">
     appeared to delight her; and every circumstance that took place about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14780">
     her: except the preparing for the burial, and the presence of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14790">
     mourners.  I thought she was half silly, from her behaviour while that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14800">
     went on: she ran into her chamber, and made me come with her, though I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14810">
     should have been dressing the children: and there she sat shivering and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14820">
     clasping her hands, and asking repeatedly--'Are they gone yet?'  Then she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14830">
     began describing with hysterical emotion the effect it produced on her to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14840">
     see black; and started, and trembled, and, at last, fell a-weeping--and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14850">
     when I asked what was the matter, answered, she didn't know; but she felt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14860">
     so afraid of dying!  I imagined her as little likely to die as myself.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14870">
     She was rather thin, but young, and fresh-complexioned, and her eyes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14880">
     sparkled as bright as diamonds.  I did remark, to be sure, that mounting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14890">
     the stairs made her breathe very quick; that the least sudden noise set
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14900">
     her all in a quiver, and that she coughed troublesomely sometimes: but I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14910">
     knew nothing of what these symptoms portended, and had no impulse to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14920">
     sympathise with her.  We don't in general take to foreigners here, Mr.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14930">
     Lockwood, unless they take to us first.

     Young Earnshaw was altered considerably in the three years of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14960">
     absence. He had grown sparer, and lost his colour, and spoke and dressed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14970">
     quite differently; and, on the very day of his return, he told Joseph
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14980">
     and me we must thenceforth quarter ourselves in the back-kitchen, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_14990">
     leave the house for him. Indeed, he would have carpeted and papered a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15000">
     small spare room for a parlour; but his wife expressed such pleasure at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15010">
     the white floor and huge glowing fireplace, at the pewter dishes and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15020">
     delf-case, and dog-kennel, and the wide space there was to move about in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15030">
     where they usually sat, that he thought it unnecessary to her comfort,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15040">
     and so dropped the intention.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15060">
     She expressed pleasure, too, at finding a sister among her new
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15070">
     acquaintance; and she prattled to Catherine, and kissed her, and ran
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15080">
     about with her, and gave her quantities of presents, at the beginning.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15090">
     Her affection tired very soon, however, and when she grew peevish,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15100">
     Hindley became tyrannical.  A few words from her, evincing a dislike to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15110">
     Heathcliff, were enough to rouse in him all his old hatred of the boy.  He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15120">
     drove him from their company to the servants, deprived him of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15130">
     instructions of the curate, and insisted that he should labour out of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15140">
     doors instead; compelling him to do so as hard as any other lad on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15150">
     farm.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15170">
     Heathcliff bore his degradation pretty well at first, because Cathy

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15180">
     taught him what she learnt, and worked or played with him in the fields.

     order Heathcliff a flogging, and Catherine a fast from dinner or supper.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15250">
     But it was one of their chief amusements to run away to the moors in the

     morning and remain there all day, and the after punishment grew a mere

     thing to laugh at.  The curate might set as many chapters as he pleased

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15310">
     revenge; and many a time I've cried to myself to watch them growing more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15320">
     reckless daily, and I not daring to speak a syllable, for fear of losing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15330">
     the small power I still retained over the unfriended creatures.  One
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15340">
     Sunday evening, it chanced that they were banished from the sitting-room,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15350">
     for making a noise, or a light offence of the kind; and when I went to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15360">
     call them to supper, I could discover them nowhere.  We searched the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15370">
     house, above and below, and the yard and stables; they were invisible:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15380">
     and, at last, Hindley in a passion told us to bolt the doors, and swore
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15390">
     nobody should let them in that night.  The household went to bed; and I,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15400">
     too, anxious to lie down, opened my lattice and put my head out to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15410">
     hearken, though it rained: determined to admit them in spite of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15420">
     prohibition, should they return.  In a while, I distinguished steps
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15430">
     coming up the road, and the light of a lantern glimmered through the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15440">
     gate.  I threw a shawl over my head and ran to prevent them from waking

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15450">
     Mr. Earnshaw by knocking.  There was Heathcliff, by himself: it gave me a

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15480">
     'Where is Miss Catherine?' I cried hurriedly. 'No accident, I hope?' 'At

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15510">
     I said: 'you'll never be content till you're sent about your business.

     What in the world led you wandering to Thrushcross Grange?' 'Let me get
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15530">
     off my wet clothes, and I'll tell you all about it, Nelly,' he replied.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15540">
     I bid him beware of rousing the master, and while he undressed and I

     waited to put out the candle, he continued--'Cathy and I escaped from

     father and mother sat eating and drinking, and singing and laughing, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15600">
     burning their eyes out before the fire. Do you think they do? Or reading
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15610">
     sermons, and being catechised by their manservant, and set to learn a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15620">
     column of Scripture names, if they don't answer properly?' 'Probably
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15630">
     not,' I responded. 'They are good children, no doubt, and don't deserve
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15640">
     the treatment you receive, for your bad conduct.' 'Don't cant, Nelly,'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15650">
     he said: 'nonsense! We ran from the top of the Heights to the park,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15660">
     without stopping--Catherine completely beaten in the race, because she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15670">
     was barefoot. You'll have to seek for her shoes in the bog to-morrow. We
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15680">
     crept through a broken hedge, groped our way up the path, and planted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15690">
     ourselves on a flower-plot under the drawing-room window. The light came
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15700">
     from thence; they had not put up the shutters, and the curtains were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15710">
     only half closed. Both of us were able to look in by standing on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15720">
     basement, and clinging to the ledge, and we saw--ah! it was beautiful--a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15730">
     splendid place carpeted with crimson, and crimson-covered chairs and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15740">
     tables, and a pure white ceiling bordered by gold, a shower of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15750">
     glass-drops hanging in silver chains from the centre, and shimmering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15760">
     with little soft tapers. Old Mr. and Mrs. Linton were not there; Edgar
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15770">
     and his sisters had it entirely to themselves. Shouldn't they have been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15780">
     happy? We should have thought ourselves in heaven! And now, guess what
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15790">
     your good children were doing? Isabella--I believe she is eleven, a year
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15800">
     younger than Cathy--lay screaming at the farther end of the room,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15810">
     shrieking as if witches were running red-hot needles into her. Edgar
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15820">
     stood on the hearth weeping silently, and in the middle of the table sat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15830">
     a little dog, shaking its paw and yelping; which, from their mutual
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15840">
     accusations, we understood they had nearly pulled in two between them.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15850">
     The idiots! That was their pleasure! to quarrel who should hold a heap
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15860">
     of warm hair, and each begin to cry because both, after struggling to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15870">
     get it, refused to take it. We laughed outright at the petted things; we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15880">
     did despise them! When would you catch me wishing to have what Catherine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15890">
     wanted? or find us by ourselves, seeking entertainment in yelling, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15900">
     sobbing, and rolling on the ground, divided by the whole room? I'd not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15910">
     exchange, for a thousand lives, my condition here, for Edgar Linton's at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15920">
     Thrushcross Grange--not if I might have the privilege of flinging Joseph
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15930">
     off the highest gable, and painting the house-front with Hindley's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15940">
     blood!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15960">
     'Hush, hush!' I interrupted.  'Still you have not told me, Heathcliff,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15970">
     how Catherine is left behind?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_15990">
     'I told you we laughed,' he answered. 'The Lintons heard us, and with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16000">
     one accord they shot like arrows to the door; there was silence, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16010">
     then a cry, "Oh, mamma, mamma! Oh, papa! Oh, mamma, come here. Oh, papa,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16020">
     oh!" They really did howl out something in that way. We made frightful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16030">
     noises to terrify them still more, and then we dropped off the ledge,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16040">
     because somebody was drawing the bars, and we felt we had better flee. I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16050">
     had Cathy by the hand, and was urging her on, when all at once she fell
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16060">
     down. "Run, Heathcliff, run!" she whispered. "They have let the bull-dog
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16070">
     loose, and he holds me!" The devil had seized her ankle, Nelly: I heard
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16080">
     his abominable snorting. She did not yell out--no! she would have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16090">
     scorned to do it, if she had been spitted on the horns of a mad cow. I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16100">
     did, though: I vociferated curses enough to annihilate any fiend in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16110">
     Christendom; and I got a stone and thrust it between his jaws, and tried
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16120">
     with all my might to cram it down his throat. A beast of a servant came
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16130">
     up with a lantern, at last, shouting--"Keep fast, Skulker, keep fast!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16140">
     He changed his note, however, when he saw Skulker's game. The dog was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16150">
     throttled off; his huge, purple tongue hanging half a foot out of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16160">
     mouth, and his pendent lips streaming with bloody slaver. The man took
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16170">
     Cathy up; she was sick: not from fear, I'm certain, but from pain. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16180">
     carried her in; I followed, grumbling execrations and vengeance. "What
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16190">
     prey, Robert?" hallooed Linton from the entrance. "Skulker has caught a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16200">
     little girl, sir," he replied; "and there's a lad here," he added,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16210">
     making a clutch at me, "who looks an out-and-outer! Very like the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16220">
     robbers were for putting them through the window to open the doors to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16230">
     the gang after all were asleep, that they might murder us at their ease.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16240">
     Hold your tongue, you foul-mouthed thief, you! you shall go to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16250">
     gallows for this. Mr. Linton, sir, don't lay by your gun." "No, no,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16260">
     Robert," said the old fool. "The rascals knew that yesterday was my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16270">
     rent-day: they thought to have me cleverly. Come in; I'll furnish them a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16280">
     reception. There, John, fasten the chain. Give Skulker some water,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16290">
     Jenny. To beard a magistrate in his stronghold, and on the Sabbath, too!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16300">
     Where will their insolence stop? Oh, my dear Mary, look here! Don't be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16310">
     afraid, it is but a boy--yet the villain scowls so plainly in his face;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16320">
     would it not be a kindness to the country to hang him at once, before he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16330">
     shows his nature in acts as well as features?" He pulled me under the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16340">
     chandelier, and Mrs. Linton placed her spectacles on her nose and raised
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16350">
     her hands in horror. The cowardly children crept nearer also, Isabella
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16360">
     lisping--"Frightful thing! Put him in the cellar, papa. He's exactly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16370">
     like the son of the fortune-teller that stole my tame pheasant. Isn't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16380">
     he, Edgar?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16400">
     'While they examined me, Cathy came round; she heard the last speech, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16410">
     laughed.  Edgar Linton, after an inquisitive stare, collected sufficient
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16420">
     wit to recognise her.  They see us at church, you know, though we seldom

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16430">
     meet them elsewhere.  "That's Miss Earnshaw?" he whispered to his mother,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16440">
     "and look how Skulker has bitten her--how her foot bleeds!"

     '"Miss Earnshaw?  Nonsense!" cried the dame; "Miss Earnshaw scouring the

     it is--and she may be lamed for life!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16500">
     '"What culpable carelessness in her brother!" exclaimed Mr. Linton,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16510">
     turning from me to Catherine.  "I've understood from Shielders"' (that

     was the curate, sir) '"that he lets her grow up in absolute heathenism.

     suppose: she was a young lady, and they made a distinction between her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16720">
     treatment and mine.  Then the woman-servant brought a basin of warm
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16730">
     water, and washed her feet; and Mr. Linton mixed a tumbler of negus, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16740">
     Isabella emptied a plateful of cakes into her lap, and Edgar stood gaping
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16750">
     at a distance.  Afterwards, they dried and combed her beautiful hair, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16760">
     gave her a pair of enormous slippers, and wheeled her to the fire; and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16770">
     left her, as merry as she could be, dividing her food between the little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16780">
     dog and Skulker, whose nose she pinched as he ate; and kindling a spark
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16790">
     of spirit in the vacant blue eyes of the Lintons--a dim reflection from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16800">
     her own enchanting face.  I saw they were full of stupid admiration; she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16810">
     is so immeasurably superior to them--to everybody on earth, is she not,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16820">
     Nelly?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16840">
     'There will more come of this business than you reckon on,' I answered,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16850">
     covering him up and extinguishing the light.  'You are incurable,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16860">
     Heathcliff; and Mr. Hindley will have to proceed to extremities, see if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16870">
     he won't.'  My words came truer than I desired.  The luckless adventure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16880">
     made Earnshaw furious.  And then Mr. Linton, to mend matters, paid us a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16890">
     visit himself on the morrow, and read the young master such a lecture on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16900">
     the road he guided his family, that he was stirred to look about him, in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16910">
     earnest.  Heathcliff received no flogging, but he was told that the first
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16920">
     word he spoke to Miss Catherine should ensure a dismissal; and Mrs.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16930">
     Earnshaw undertook to keep her sister-in-law in due restraint when she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_16940">
     returned home; employing art, not force: with force she would have found

     Cathy stayed at Thrushcross Grange five weeks: till Christmas.  By that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17030">
     time her ankle was thoroughly cured, and her manners much improved.  The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17040">
     mistress visited her often in the interval, and commenced her plan of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17050">
     reform by trying to raise her self-respect with fine clothes and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17060">
     flattery, which she took readily; so that, instead of a wild, hatless
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17070">
     little savage jumping into the house, and rushing to squeeze us all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17080">
     breathless, there 'lighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17090">
     person, with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered beaver,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17100">
     and a long cloth habit, which she was obliged to hold up with both hands
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17110">
     that she might sail in.  Hindley lifted her from her horse, exclaiming
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17120">
     delightedly, 'Why, Cathy, you are quite a beauty!  I should scarcely have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17130">
     known you: you look like a lady now.  Isabella Linton is not to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17140">
     compared with her, is she, Frances?'  'Isabella has not her natural
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17150">
     advantages,' replied his wife: 'but she must mind and not grow wild again
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17160">
     here.  Ellen, help Miss Catherine off with her things--Stay, dear, you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17170">
     will disarrange your curls--let me untie your hat.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17190">
     I removed the habit, and there shone forth beneath a grand plaid silk
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17200">
     frock, white trousers, and burnished shoes; and, while her eyes sparkled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17210">
     joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to welcome her, she dared hardly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17220">
     touch them lest they should fawn upon her splendid garments.  She kissed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17230">
     me gently: I was all flour making the Christmas cake, and it would not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17240">
     have done to give me a hug; and then she looked round for Heathcliff.  Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17250">
     and Mrs. Earnshaw watched anxiously their meeting; thinking it would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17260">
     enable them to judge, in some measure, what grounds they had for hoping
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17270">
     to succeed in separating the two friends.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17290">
     Heathcliff was hard to discover, at first.  If he were careless, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17300">
     uncared for, before Catherine's absence, he had been ten times more so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17310">
     since.  Nobody but I even did him the kindness to call him a dirty boy,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17320">
     and bid him wash himself, once a week; and children of his age seldom
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17330">
     have a natural pleasure in soap and water.  Therefore, not to mention his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17340">
     clothes, which had seen three months' service in mire and dust, and his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17350">
     thick uncombed hair, the surface of his face and hands was dismally
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17360">
     beclouded.  He might well skulk behind the settle, on beholding such a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17370">
     bright, graceful damsel enter the house, instead of a rough-headed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17380">
     counterpart of himself, as he expected.  'Is Heathcliff not here?' she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17390">
     demanded, pulling off her gloves, and displaying fingers wonderfully
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17400">
     whitened with doing nothing and staying indoors.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17420">
     'Heathcliff, you may come forward,' cried Mr. Hindley, enjoying his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17430">
     discomfiture, and gratified to see what a forbidding young blackguard he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17440">
     would be compelled to present himself.  'You may come and wish Miss
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17450">
     Catherine welcome, like the other servants.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17470">
     Cathy, catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment, flew to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17480">
     embrace him; she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his cheek within the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17490">
     second, and then stopped, and drawing back, burst into a laugh,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17500">
     exclaiming, 'Why, how very black and cross you look! and how--how funny
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17510">
     and grim!  But that's because I'm used to Edgar and Isabella Linton.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17520">
     Well, Heathcliff, have you forgotten me?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17540">
     She had some reason to put the question, for shame and pride threw double
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17550">
     gloom over his countenance, and kept him immovable.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17570">
     'Shake hands, Heathcliff,' said Mr. Earnshaw, condescendingly; 'once in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17580">
     way that is permitted.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17600">
     'I shall not,' replied the boy, finding his tongue at last; 'I shall not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17610">
     stand to be laughed at.  I shall not bear it!'  And he would have broken
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17620">
     from the circle, but Miss Cathy seized him again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17640">
     'I did not mean to laugh at you,' she said; 'I could not hinder myself:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17650">
     Heathcliff, shake hands at least!  What are you sulky for?  It was only
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17660">
     that you looked odd.  If you wash your face and brush your hair, it will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17670">
     be all right: but you are so dirty!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17690">
     She gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she held in her own, and also
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17700">
     at her dress; which she feared had gained no embellishment from its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17710">
     contact with his.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17730">
     'You needn't have touched me!' he answered, following her eye and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17740">
     snatching away his hand.  'I shall be as dirty as I please: and I like to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17750">
     be dirty, and I will be dirty.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17770">
     With that he dashed headforemost out of the room, amid the merriment of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17780">
     the master and mistress, and to the serious disturbance of Catherine; who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17790">
     could not comprehend how her remarks should have produced such an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17800">
     exhibition of bad temper.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17820">
     After playing lady's-maid to the new-comer, and putting my cakes in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17830">
     oven, and making the house and kitchen cheerful with great fires,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17840">
     befitting Christmas-eve, I prepared to sit down and amuse myself by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17850">
     singing carols, all alone; regardless of Joseph's affirmations that he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17860">
     considered the merry tunes I chose as next door to songs.  He had retired
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17870">
     to private prayer in his chamber, and Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw were engaging
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17880">
     Missy's attention by sundry gay trifles bought for her to present to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17890">
     little Lintons, as an acknowledgment of their kindness.  They had invited
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17900">
     them to spend the morrow at Wuthering Heights, and the invitation had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17910">
     been accepted, on one condition: Mrs. Linton begged that her darlings
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17920">
     might be kept carefully apart from that 'naughty swearing boy.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17940">
     Under these circumstances I remained solitary.  I smelt the rich scent of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17950">
     the heating spices; and admired the shining kitchen utensils, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17960">
     polished clock, decked in holly, the silver mugs ranged on a tray ready
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17970">
     to be filled with mulled ale for supper; and above all, the speckless
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17980">
     purity of my particular care--the scoured and well-swept floor.  I gave
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_17990">
     due inward applause to every object, and then I remembered how old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18000">
     Earnshaw used to come in when all was tidied, and call me a cant lass,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18010">
     and slip a shilling into my hand as a Christmas-box; and from that I went
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18020">
     on to think of his fondness for Heathcliff, and his dread lest he should
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18030">
     suffer neglect after death had removed him: and that naturally led me to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18040">
     consider the poor lad's situation now, and from singing I changed my mind
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18050">
     to crying.  It struck me soon, however, there would be more sense in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18060">
     endeavouring to repair some of his wrongs than shedding tears over them:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18070">
     I got up and walked into the court to seek him.  He was not far; I found
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18080">
     him smoothing the glossy coat of the new pony in the stable, and feeding
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18090">
     the other beasts, according to custom.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18110">
     'Make haste, Heathcliff!' I said, 'the kitchen is so comfortable; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18120">
     Joseph is up-stairs: make haste, and let me dress you smart before Miss
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18130">
     Cathy comes out, and then you can sit together, with the whole hearth to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18140">
     yourselves, and have a long chatter till bedtime.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18160">
     He proceeded with his task, and never turned his head towards me.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18180">
     'Come--are you coming?' I continued.  'There's a little cake for each of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18190">
     you, nearly enough; and you'll need half-an-hour's donning.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18210">
     I waited five minutes, but getting no answer left him.  Catherine supped
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18220">
     with her brother and sister-in-law: Joseph and I joined at an unsociable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18230">
     meal, seasoned with reproofs on one side and sauciness on the other.  His
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18240">
     cake and cheese remained on the table all night for the fairies.  He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18250">
     managed to continue work till nine o'clock, and then marched dumb and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18260">
     dour to his chamber.  Cathy sat up late, having a world of things to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18270">
     order for the reception of her new friends: she came into the kitchen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18280">
     once to speak to her old one; but he was gone, and she only stayed to ask
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18290">
     what was the matter with him, and then went back.  In the morning he rose
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18300">
     early; and, as it was a holiday, carried his ill-humour on to the moors;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18310">
     not re-appearing till the family were departed for church.  Fasting and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18320">
     reflection seemed to have brought him to a better spirit.  He hung about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18330">
     me for a while, and having screwed up his courage, exclaimed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18340">
     abruptly--'Nelly, make me decent, I'm going to be good.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18360">
     'High time, Heathcliff,' I said; 'you _have_ grieved Catherine: she's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18370">
     sorry she ever came home, I daresay!  It looks as if you envied her,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18380">
     because she is more thought of than you.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18400">
     The notion of _envying_ Catherine was incomprehensible to him, but the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18410">
     notion of grieving her he understood clearly enough.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18430">
     'Did she say she was grieved?' he inquired, looking very serious.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18450">
     'She cried when I told her you were off again this morning.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18470">
     'Well, _I_ cried last night,' he returned, 'and I had more reason to cry
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18480">
     than she.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18500">
     'Yes: you had the reason of going to bed with a proud heart and an empty
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18510">
     stomach,' said I.  'Proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves.  But,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18520">
     if you be ashamed of your touchiness, you must ask pardon, mind, when she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18530">
     comes in.  You must go up and offer to kiss her, and say--you know best
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18540">
     what to say; only do it heartily, and not as if you thought her converted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18550">
     into a stranger by her grand dress.  And now, though I have dinner to get
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18560">
     ready, I'll steal time to arrange you so that Edgar Linton shall look
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18570">
     quite a doll beside you: and that he does.  You are younger, and yet,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18580">
     I'll be bound, you are taller and twice as broad across the shoulders;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18590">
     you could knock him down in a twinkling; don't you feel that you could?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18610">
     Heathcliff's face brightened a moment; then it was overcast afresh, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18620">
     he sighed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18640">
     'But, Nelly, if I knocked him down twenty times, that wouldn't make him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18650">
     less handsome or me more so.  I wish I had light hair and a fair skin,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18660">
     and was dressed and behaved as well, and had a chance of being as rich as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18670">
     he will be!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18690">
     'And cried for mamma at every turn,' I added, 'and trembled if a country
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18700">
     lad heaved his fist against you, and sat at home all day for a shower of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18710">
     rain.  Oh, Heathcliff, you are showing a poor spirit!  Come to the glass,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18720">
     and I'll let you see what you should wish.  Do you mark those two lines
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18730">
     between your eyes; and those thick brows, that, instead of rising arched,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18740">
     sink in the middle; and that couple of black fiends, so deeply buried,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18750">
     who never open their windows boldly, but lurk glinting under them, like
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18760">
     devil's spies?  Wish and learn to smooth away the surly wrinkles, to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18770">
     raise your lids frankly, and change the fiends to confident, innocent
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18780">
     angels, suspecting and doubting nothing, and always seeing friends where
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18790">
     they are not sure of foes.  Don't get the expression of a vicious cur
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18800">
     that appears to know the kicks it gets are its dessert, and yet hates all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18810">
     the world, as well as the kicker, for what it suffers.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18830">
     'In other words, I must wish for Edgar Linton's great blue eyes and even
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18840">
     forehead,' he replied.  'I do--and that won't help me to them.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18860">
     'A good heart will help you to a bonny face, my lad,' I continued, 'if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18870">
     you were a regular black; and a bad one will turn the bonniest into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18880">
     something worse than ugly.  And now that we've done washing, and combing,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18890">
     and sulking--tell me whether you don't think yourself rather handsome?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18900">
     I'll tell you, I do.  You're fit for a prince in disguise.  Who knows but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18910">
     your father was Emperor of China, and your mother an Indian queen, each
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18920">
     of them able to buy up, with one week's income, Wuthering Heights and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18930">
     Thrushcross Grange together?  And you were kidnapped by wicked sailors
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18940">
     and brought to England.  Were I in your place, I would frame high notions
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18950">
     of my birth; and the thoughts of what I was should give me courage and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18960">
     dignity to support the oppressions of a little farmer!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18980">
     So I chattered on; and Heathcliff gradually lost his frown and began to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_18990">
     look quite pleasant, when all at once our conversation was interrupted by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19000">
     a rumbling sound moving up the road and entering the court.  He ran to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19010">
     the window and I to the door, just in time to behold the two Lintons
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19020">
     descend from the family carriage, smothered in cloaks and furs, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19030">
     Earnshaws dismount from their horses: they often rode to church in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19040">
     winter.  Catherine took a hand of each of the children, and brought them
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19050">
     into the house and set them before the fire, which quickly put colour
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19060">
     into their white faces.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19080">
     I urged my companion to hasten now and show his amiable humour, and he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19090">
     willingly obeyed; but ill luck would have it that, as he opened the door
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19100">
     leading from the kitchen on one side, Hindley opened it on the other.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19110">
     They met, and the master, irritated at seeing him clean and cheerful, or,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19120">
     perhaps, eager to keep his promise to Mrs. Linton, shoved him back with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19130">
     sudden thrust, and angrily bade Joseph 'keep the fellow out of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19140">
     room--send him into the garret till dinner is over.  He'll be cramming
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19150">
     his fingers in the tarts and stealing the fruit, if left alone with them
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19160">
     a minute.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19180">
     'Nay, sir,' I could not avoid answering, 'he'll touch nothing, not he:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19190">
     and I suppose he must have his share of the dainties as well as we.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19210">
     'He shall have his share of my hand, if I catch him downstairs till
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19220">
     dark,' cried Hindley.  'Begone, you vagabond!  What! you are attempting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19230">
     the coxcomb, are you?  Wait till I get hold of those elegant locks--see
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19240">
     if I won't pull them a bit longer!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19260">
     'They are long enough already,' observed Master Linton, peeping from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19270">
     doorway; 'I wonder they don't make his head ache.  It's like a colt's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19280">
     mane over his eyes!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19300">
     He ventured this remark without any intention to insult; but Heathcliff's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19310">
     violent nature was not prepared to endure the appearance of impertinence
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19320">
     from one whom he seemed to hate, even then, as a rival.  He seized a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19330">
     tureen of hot apple sauce (the first thing that came under his grip) and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19340">
     dashed it full against the speaker's face and neck; who instantly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19350">
     commenced a lament that brought Isabella and Catherine hurrying to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19360">
     place.  Mr. Earnshaw snatched up the culprit directly and conveyed him to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19370">
     his chamber; where, doubtless, he administered a rough remedy to cool the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19380">
     fit of passion, for he appeared red and breathless.  I got the dishcloth,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19390">
     and rather spitefully scrubbed Edgar's nose and mouth, affirming it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19400">
     served him right for meddling.  His sister began weeping to go home, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19410">
     Cathy stood by confounded, blushing for all.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19430">
     'You should not have spoken to him!' she expostulated with Master Linton.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19440">
     'He was in a bad temper, and now you've spoilt your visit; and he'll be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19450">
     flogged: I hate him to be flogged!  I can't eat my dinner.  Why did you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19460">
     speak to him, Edgar?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19480">
     'I didn't,' sobbed the youth, escaping from my hands, and finishing the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19490">
     remainder of the purification with his cambric pocket-handkerchief.  'I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19500">
     promised mamma that I wouldn't say one word to him, and I didn't.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19520">
     'Well, don't cry,' replied Catherine, contemptuously; 'you're not killed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19530">
     Don't make more mischief; my brother is coming: be quiet!  Hush,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19540">
     Isabella!  Has anybody hurt you?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19560">
     'There, there, children--to your seats!' cried Hindley, bustling in.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19570">
     'That brute of a lad has warmed me nicely.  Next time, Master Edgar, take
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19580">
     the law into your own fists--it will give you an appetite!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19600">
     The little party recovered its equanimity at sight of the fragrant feast.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19610">
     They were hungry after their ride, and easily consoled, since no real
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19620">
     harm had befallen them.  Mr. Earnshaw carved bountiful platefuls, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19630">
     mistress made them merry with lively talk.  I waited behind her chair,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19640">
     and was pained to behold Catherine, with dry eyes and an indifferent air,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19650">
     commence cutting up the wing of a goose before her.  'An unfeeling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19660">
     child,' I thought to myself; 'how lightly she dismisses her old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19670">
     playmate's troubles.  I could not have imagined her to be so selfish.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19680">
     She lifted a mouthful to her lips: then she set it down again: her cheeks
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19690">
     flushed, and the tears gushed over them.  She slipped her fork to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19700">
     floor, and hastily dived under the cloth to conceal her emotion.  I did
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19710">
     not call her unfeeling long; for I perceived she was in purgatory
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19720">
     throughout the day, and wearying to find an opportunity of getting by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19730">
     herself, or paying a visit to Heathcliff, who had been locked up by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19740">
     master: as I discovered, on endeavouring to introduce to him a private
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19750">
     mess of victuals.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19770">
     In the evening we had a dance.  Cathy begged that he might be liberated
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19780">
     then, as Isabella Linton had no partner: her entreaties were vain, and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19790">
     was appointed to supply the deficiency.  We got rid of all gloom in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19800">
     excitement of the exercise, and our pleasure was increased by the arrival
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19810">
     of the Gimmerton band, mustering fifteen strong: a trumpet, a trombone,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19820">
     clarionets, bassoons, French horns, and a bass viol, besides singers.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19830">
     They go the rounds of all the respectable houses, and receive
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19840">
     contributions every Christmas, and we esteemed it a first-rate treat to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19850">
     hear them.  After the usual carols had been sung, we set them to songs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19860">
     and glees.  Mrs. Earnshaw loved the music, and so they gave us plenty.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19880">
     Catherine loved it too: but she said it sounded sweetest at the top of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19890">
     the steps, and she went up in the dark: I followed. They shut the house
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19900">
     door below, never noting our absence, it was so full of people. She made
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19910">
     no stay at the stairs'-head, but mounted farther, to the garret where
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19920">
     Heathcliff was confined, and called him. He stubbornly declined
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19930">
     answering for a while: she persevered, and finally persuaded him to hold
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19940">
     communion with her through the boards. I let the poor things converse
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19950">
     unmolested, till I supposed the songs were going to cease, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19960">
     singers to get some refreshment: then I clambered up the ladder to warn
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19970">
     her. Instead of finding her outside, I heard her voice within. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19980">
     little monkey had crept by the skylight of one garret, along the roof,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_19990">
     into the skylight of the other, and it was with the utmost difficulty I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20000">
     could coax her out again. When she did come, Heathcliff came with her,

     fellow-servant had gone to a neighbour's, to be removed from the sound
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20030">
     of our 'devil's psalmody,' as it pleased him to call it. I told them I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20040">
     intended by no means to encourage their tricks: but as the prisoner had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20050">
     never broken his fast since yesterday's dinner, I would wink at his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20060">
     cheating Mr. Hindley that once. He went down: I set him a stool by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20070">
     fire, and offered him a quantity of good things: but he was sick and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20080">
     could eat little, and my attempts to entertain him were thrown away. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20090">
     leant his two elbows on his knees, and his chin on his hands and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20100">
     remained rapt in dumb meditation. On my inquiring the subject of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20110">
     thoughts, he answered gravely--'I'm trying to settle how I shall pay
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20120">
     Hindley back. I don't care how long I wait, if I can only do it at last.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20130">
     I hope he will not die before I do!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20150">
     'For shame, Heathcliff!' said I.  'It is for God to punish wicked people;

     we should learn to forgive.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20180">
     'No, God won't have the satisfaction that I shall,' he returned.  'I only

     wish I knew the best way!  Let me alone, and I'll plan it out: while I'm

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20200">
     thinking of that I don't feel pain.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20220">
     'But, Mr. Lockwood, I forget these tales cannot divert you.  I'm annoyed

     how I should dream of chattering on at such a rate; and your gruel cold,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20240">
     and you nodding for bed!  I could have told Heathcliff's history, all
    </p>

     aside her sewing; but I felt incapable of moving from the hearth, and I

     still another half-hour.  You've done just right to tell the story

     leisurely.  That is the method I like; and you must finish it in the same

     style.  I am interested in every character you have mentioned, more or

     'The clock is on the stroke of eleven, sir.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20390">
     'No matter--I'm not accustomed to go to bed in the long hours.  One or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20400">
     two is early enough for a person who lies till ten.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20420">
     'You shouldn't lie till ten.  There's the very prime of the morning gone

     long before that time.  A person who has not done one-half his day's work
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20440">

     'Nevertheless, Mrs. Dean, resume your chair; because to-morrow I intend

     lengthening the night till afternoon.  I prognosticate for myself an

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20530">
     'No, no, I'll allow nothing of the sort!  Are you acquainted with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20540">
     mood of mind in which, if you were seated alone, and the cat licking its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20550">
     kitten on the rug before you, you would watch the operation so intently
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20560">
     that puss's neglect of one ear would put you seriously out of temper?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20580">
     'A terribly lazy mood, I should say.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20600">
     'On the contrary, a tiresomely active one. It is mine, at present; and,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20610">
     therefore, continue minutely. I perceive that people in these regions
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20620">
     acquire over people in towns the value that a spider in a dungeon does
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20630">
     over a spider in a cottage, to their various occupants; and yet the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20640">
     deepened attraction is not entirely owing to the situation of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20650">
     looker-on. They _do_ live more in earnest, more in themselves, and less
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20660">
     in surface, change, and frivolous external things. I could fancy a love
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20670">
     for life here almost possible; and I was a fixed unbeliever in any love
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20680">
     of a year's standing. One state resembles setting a hungry man down to a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20690">
     single dish, on which he may concentrate his entire appetite and do it
    </p>

     justice; the other, introducing him to a table laid out by French cooks:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20710">
     he can perhaps extract as much enjoyment from the whole; but each part
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20720">
     is a mere atom in his regard and remembrance.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20740">
     'Oh! here we are the same as anywhere else, when you get to know us,'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20750">
     observed Mrs. Dean, somewhat puzzled at my speech.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20770">
     'Excuse me,' I responded; 'you, my good friend, are a striking evidence
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20780">
     against that assertion.  Excepting a few provincialisms of slight

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20790">
     consequence, you have no marks of the manners which I am habituated to
    </p>

     consider as peculiar to your class.  I am sure you have thought a great
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20810">
     deal more than the generality of servants think.  You have been compelled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20820">
     to cultivate your reflective faculties for want of occasions for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20830">
     frittering your life away in silly trifles.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20850">
     Mrs. Dean laughed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20870">
     'I certainly esteem myself a steady, reasonable kind of body,' she said;

     'not exactly from living among the hills and seeing one set of faces, and
    </p>

     one series of actions, from year's end to year's end; but I have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_20900">
     undergone sharp discipline, which has taught me wisdom; and then, I have

     read more than you would fancy, Mr. Lockwood.  You could not open a book

     be content to pass to the next summer--the summer of 1778, that is nearly

     CHAPTER VIII
    </head>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21050">
     On the morning of a fine June day my first bonny little nursling, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21060">
     last of the ancient Earnshaw stock, was born.  We were busy with the hay
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21070">
     in a far-away field, when the girl that usually brought our breakfasts
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21080">
     came running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the lane, calling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21090">
     me as she ran.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21110">
     'Oh, such a grand bairn!' she panted out.  'The finest lad that ever
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21120">
     breathed!  But the doctor says missis must go: he says she's been in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21130">
     consumption these many months.  I heard him tell Mr. Hindley: and now she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21140">
     has nothing to keep her, and she'll be dead before winter.  You must come
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21150">
     home directly.  You're to nurse it, Nelly: to feed it with sugar and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21160">
     milk, and take care of it day and night.  I wish I were you, because it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21170">
     will be all yours when there is no missis!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21190">
     'But is she very ill?' I asked, flinging down my rake and tying my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21200">
     bonnet.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21220">
     'I guess she is; yet she looks bravely,' replied the girl, 'and she talks
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21230">
     as if she thought of living to see it grow a man.  She's out of her head
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21240">
     for joy, it's such a beauty!  If I were her I'm certain I should not die:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21250">
     I should get better at the bare sight of it, in spite of Kenneth.  I was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21260">
     fairly mad at him.  Dame Archer brought the cherub down to master, in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21270">
     house, and his face just began to light up, when the old croaker steps
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21280">
     forward, and says he--"Earnshaw, it's a blessing your wife has been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21290">
     spared to leave you this son.  When she came, I felt convinced we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21300">
     shouldn't keep her long; and now, I must tell you, the winter will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21310">
     probably finish her.  Don't take on, and fret about it too much: it can't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21320">
     be helped.  And besides, you should have known better than to choose such
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21330">
     a rush of a lass!"'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21350">
     'And what did the master answer?' I inquired.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21370">
     'I think he swore: but I didn't mind him, I was straining to see the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21380">
     bairn,' and she began again to describe it rapturously.  I, as zealous as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21390">
     herself, hurried eagerly home to admire, on my part; though I was very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21400">
     sad for Hindley's sake.  He had room in his heart only for two idols--his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21410">
     wife and himself: he doted on both, and adored one, and I couldn't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21420">
     conceive how he would bear the loss.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21440">
     When we got to Wuthering Heights, there he stood at the front door; and,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21450">
     as I passed in, I asked, 'how was the baby?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21470">
     'Nearly ready to run about, Nell!' he replied, putting on a cheerful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21480">
     smile.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21500">
     'And the mistress?' I ventured to inquire; 'the doctor says she's--'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21520">
     'Damn the doctor!' he interrupted, reddening.  'Frances is quite right:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21530">
     she'll be perfectly well by this time next week.  Are you going
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21540">
     up-stairs? will you tell her that I'll come, if she'll promise not to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21550">
     talk.  I left her because she would not hold her tongue; and she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21560">
     must--tell her Mr. Kenneth says she must be quiet.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21580">
     I delivered this message to Mrs. Earnshaw; she seemed in flighty spirits,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21590">
     and replied merrily, 'I hardly spoke a word, Ellen, and there he has gone
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21600">
     out twice, crying.  Well, say I promise I won't speak: but that does not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21610">
     bind me not to laugh at him!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21630">
     Poor soul!  Till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21640">
     her; and her husband persisted doggedly, nay, furiously, in affirming her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21650">
     health improved every day.  When Kenneth warned him that his medicines
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21660">
     were useless at that stage of the malady, and he needn't put him to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21670">
     further expense by attending her, he retorted, 'I know you need not--she's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21680">
     well--she does not want any more attendance from you!  She never was in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21690">
     consumption.  It was a fever; and it is gone: her pulse is as slow as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21700">
     mine now, and her cheek as cool.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21720">
     He told his wife the same story, and she seemed to believe him; but one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21730">
     night, while leaning on his shoulder, in the act of saying she thought
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21740">
     she should be able to get up to-morrow, a fit of coughing took her--a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21750">
     very slight one--he raised her in his arms; she put her two hands about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21760">
     his neck, her face changed, and she was dead.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21780">
     As the girl had anticipated, the child Hareton fell wholly into my hands.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21790">
     Mr. Earnshaw, provided he saw him healthy and never heard him cry, was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21800">
     contented, as far as regarded him.  For himself, he grew desperate: his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21810">
     sorrow was of that kind that will not lament.  He neither wept nor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21820">
     prayed; he cursed and defied: execrated God and man, and gave himself up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21830">
     to reckless dissipation.  The servants could not bear his tyrannical and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21840">
     evil conduct long: Joseph and I were the only two that would stay.  I had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21850">
     not the heart to leave my charge; and besides, you know, I had been his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21860">
     foster-sister, and excused his behaviour more readily than a stranger
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21870">
     would.  Joseph remained to hector over tenants and labourers; and because
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21880">
     it was his vocation to be where he had plenty of wickedness to reprove.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21900">
     The master's bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21910">
     Catherine and Heathcliff.  His treatment of the latter was enough to make
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21920">
     a fiend of a saint.  And, truly, it appeared as if the lad _were_
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21930">
     possessed of something diabolical at that period.  He delighted to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21940">
     witness Hindley degrading himself past redemption; and became daily more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21950">
     notable for savage sullenness and ferocity.  I could not half tell what
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21960">
     an infernal house we had.  The curate dropped calling, and nobody decent
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21970">
     came near us, at last; unless Edgar Linton's visits to Miss Cathy might
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21980">
     be an exception.  At fifteen she was the queen of the country-side; she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_21990">
     had no peer; and she did turn out a haughty, headstrong creature!  I own
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22000">
     I did not like her, after infancy was past; and I vexed her frequently by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22010">
     trying to bring down her arrogance: she never took an aversion to me,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22020">
     though.  She had a wondrous constancy to old attachments: even Heathcliff
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22030">
     kept his hold on her affections unalterably; and young Linton, with all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22040">
     his superiority, found it difficult to make an equally deep impression.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22050">
     He was my late master: that is his portrait over the fireplace.  It used
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22060">
     to hang on one side, and his wife's on the other; but hers has been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22070">
     removed, or else you might see something of what she was.  Can you make
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22080">
     that out?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22100">
     Mrs. Dean raised the candle, and I discerned a soft-featured face,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22110">
     exceedingly resembling the young lady at the Heights, but more pensive
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22120">
     and amiable in expression.  It formed a sweet picture.  The long light
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22130">
     hair curled slightly on the temples; the eyes were large and serious; the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22140">
     figure almost too graceful.  I did not marvel how Catherine Earnshaw
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22150">
     could forget her first friend for such an individual.  I marvelled much
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22160">
     how he, with a mind to correspond with his person, could fancy my idea of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22170">
     Catherine Earnshaw.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22190">
     'A very agreeable portrait,' I observed to the house-keeper.  'Is it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22200">
     like?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22220">
     'Yes,' she answered; 'but he looked better when he was animated; that is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22230">
     his everyday countenance: he wanted spirit in general.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22250">
     Catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the Lintons since her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22260">
     five-weeks' residence among them; and as she had no temptation to show
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22270">
     her rough side in their company, and had the sense to be ashamed of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22280">
     being rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy, she imposed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22290">
     unwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22300">
     gained the admiration of Isabella, and the heart and soul of her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22310">
     brother: acquisitions that flattered her from the first--for she was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22320">
     full of ambition--and led her to adopt a double character without
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22330">
     exactly intending to deceive any one. In the place where she heard
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22340">
     Heathcliff termed a 'vulgar young ruffian,' and 'worse than a brute,'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22350">
     she took care not to act like him; but at home she had small inclination
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22360">
     to practise politeness that would only be laughed at, and restrain an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22370">
     unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor praise.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22390">
     Mr. Edgar seldom mustered courage to visit Wuthering Heights openly.  He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22400">
     had a terror of Earnshaw's reputation, and shrunk from encountering him;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22410">
     and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility: the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22420">
     master himself avoided offending him, knowing why he came; and if he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22430">
     could not be gracious, kept out of the way.  I rather think his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22440">
     appearance there was distasteful to Catherine; she was not artful, never
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22450">
     played the coquette, and had evidently an objection to her two friends
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22460">
     meeting at all; for when Heathcliff expressed contempt of Linton in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22470">
     presence, she could not half coincide, as she did in his absence; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22480">
     when Linton evinced disgust and antipathy to Heathcliff, she dared not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22490">
     treat his sentiments with indifference, as if depreciation of her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22500">
     playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her.  I've had many a laugh
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22510">
     at her perplexities and untold troubles, which she vainly strove to hide
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22520">
     from my mockery.  That sounds ill-natured: but she was so proud it became
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22530">
     really impossible to pity her distresses, till she should be chastened
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22540">
     into more humility.  She did bring herself, finally, to confess, and to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22550">
     confide in me: there was not a soul else that she might fashion into an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22560">
     adviser.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22580">
     Mr. Hindley had gone from home one afternoon, and Heathcliff presumed to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22590">
     give himself a holiday on the strength of it.  He had reached the age of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22600">
     sixteen then, I think, and without having bad features, or being
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22610">
     deficient in intellect, he contrived to convey an impression of inward
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22620">
     and outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22630">
     In the first place, he had by that time lost the benefit of his early
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22640">
     education: continual hard work, begun soon and concluded late, had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22650">
     extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22660">
     any love for books or learning.  His childhood's sense of superiority,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22670">
     instilled into him by the favours of old Mr. Earnshaw, was faded away.  He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22680">
     struggled long to keep up an equality with Catherine in her studies, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22690">
     yielded with poignant though silent regret: but he yielded completely;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22700">
     and there was no prevailing on him to take a step in the way of moving
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22710">
     upward, when he found he must, necessarily, sink beneath his former
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22720">
     level.  Then personal appearance sympathised with mental deterioration:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22730">
     he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look; his naturally reserved
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22740">
     disposition was exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of unsociable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22750">
     moroseness; and he took a grim pleasure, apparently, in exciting the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22760">
     aversion rather than the esteem of his few acquaintances.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22780">
     Catherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of respite
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22790">
     from labour; but he had ceased to express his fondness for her in words,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22800">
     and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses, as if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22810">
     conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22820">
     affection on him.  On the before-named occasion he came into the house to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22830">
     announce his intention of doing nothing, while I was assisting Miss Cathy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22840">
     to arrange her dress: she had not reckoned on his taking it into his head
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22850">
     to be idle; and imagining she would have the whole place to herself, she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22860">
     managed, by some means, to inform Mr. Edgar of her brother's absence, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22870">
     was then preparing to receive him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22890">
     'Cathy, are you busy this afternoon?' asked Heathcliff.  'Are you going
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22900">
     anywhere?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22920">
     'No, it is raining,' she answered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22940">
     'Why have you that silk frock on, then?' he said.  'Nobody coming here, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22950">
     hope?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22970">
     'Not that I know of,' stammered Miss: 'but you should be in the field
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22980">
     now, Heathcliff.  It is an hour past dinnertime: I thought you were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_22990">
     gone.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23010">
     'Hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence,' observed the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23020">
     boy.  'I'll not work any more to-day: I'll stay with you.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23040">
     'Oh, but Joseph will tell,' she suggested; 'you'd better go!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23060">
     'Joseph is loading lime on the further side of Penistone Crags; it will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23070">
     take him till dark, and he'll never know.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23090">
     So, saying, he lounged to the fire, and sat down.  Catherine reflected an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23100">
     instant, with knitted brows--she found it needful to smooth the way for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23110">
     an intrusion.  'Isabella and Edgar Linton talked of calling this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23120">
     afternoon,' she said, at the conclusion of a minute's silence.  'As it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23130">
     rains, I hardly expect them; but they may come, and if they do, you run
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23140">
     the risk of being scolded for no good.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23160">
     'Order Ellen to say you are engaged, Cathy,' he persisted; 'don't turn me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23170">
     out for those pitiful, silly friends of yours!  I'm on the point,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23180">
     sometimes, of complaining that they--but I'll not--'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23200">
     'That they what?' cried Catherine, gazing at him with a troubled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23210">
     countenance.  'Oh, Nelly!' she added petulantly, jerking her head away
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23220">
     from my hands, 'you've combed my hair quite out of curl!  That's enough;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23230">
     let me alone.  What are you on the point of complaining about,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23240">
     Heathcliff?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23260">
     'Nothing--only look at the almanack on that wall;' he pointed to a framed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23270">
     sheet hanging near the window, and continued, 'The crosses are for the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23280">
     evenings you have spent with the Lintons, the dots for those spent with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23290">
     me.  Do you see?  I've marked every day.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23310">
     'Yes--very foolish: as if I took notice!' replied Catherine, in a peevish
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23320">
     tone.  'And where is the sense of that?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23340">
     'To show that I _do_ take notice,' said Heathcliff.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23360">
     'And should I always be sitting with you?' she demanded, growing more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23370">
     irritated.  'What good do I get?  What do you talk about?  You might be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23380">
     dumb, or a baby, for anything you say to amuse me, or for anything you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23390">
     do, either!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23410">
     'You never told me before that I talked too little, or that you disliked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23420">
     my company, Cathy!' exclaimed Heathcliff, in much agitation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23440">
     'It's no company at all, when people know nothing and say nothing,' she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23450">
     muttered.

     further, for a horse's feet were heard on the flags, and having knocked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23490">
     gently, young Linton entered, his face brilliant with delight at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23500">
     unexpected summon she had received.  Doubtless Catherine marked the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23510">
     difference between her friends, as one came in and the other went out.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23520">
     The contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak, hilly, coal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23530">
     country for a beautiful fertile valley; and his voice and greeting were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23540">
     as opposite as his aspect.  He had a sweet, low manner of speaking, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23550">
     pronounced his words as you do: that's less gruff than we talk here, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23560">
     softer.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23580">
     'I'm not come too soon, am I?' he said, casting a look at me: I had begun
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23590">
     to wipe the plate, and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23610">
     'No,' answered Catherine.  'What are you doing there, Nelly?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23630">
     'My work, Miss,' I replied.  (Mr. Hindley had given me directions to make
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23640">
     a third party in any private visits Linton chose to pay.)
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23660">
     She stepped behind me and whispered crossly, 'Take yourself and your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23670">
     dusters off; when company are in the house, servants don't commence
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23680">
     scouring and cleaning in the room where they are!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23700">
     'It's a good opportunity, now that master is away,' I answered aloud: 'he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23710">
     hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence.  I'm sure Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23720">
     Edgar will excuse me.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23740">
     'I hate you to be fidgeting in _my_ presence,' exclaimed the young lady
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23750">
     imperiously, not allowing her guest time to speak: she had failed to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23760">
     recover her equanimity since the little dispute with Heathcliff.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23780">
     'I'm sorry for it, Miss Catherine,' was my response; and I proceeded
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23790">
     assiduously with my occupation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23810">
     She, supposing Edgar could not see her, snatched the cloth from my hand,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23820">
     and pinched me, with a prolonged wrench, very spitefully on the arm.  I've
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23830">
     said I did not love her, and rather relished mortifying her vanity now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23840">
     and then: besides, she hurt me extremely; so I started up from my knees,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23850">
     and screamed out, 'Oh, Miss, that's a nasty trick!  You have no right to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23860">
     nip me, and I'm not going to bear it.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23880">
     'I didn't touch you, you lying creature!' cried she, her fingers tingling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23890">
     to repeat the act, and her ears red with rage.  She never had power to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23900">
     conceal her passion, it always set her whole complexion in a blaze.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23920">
     'What's that, then?' I retorted, showing a decided purple witness to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23930">
     refute her.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23950">
     She stamped her foot, wavered a moment, and then, irresistibly impelled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23960">
     by the naughty spirit within her, slapped me on the cheek: a stinging
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23970">
     blow that filled both eyes with water.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_23990">
     'Catherine, love!  Catherine!' interposed Linton, greatly shocked at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24000">
     double fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24020">
     'Leave the room, Ellen!' she repeated, trembling all over.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24040">
     Little Hareton, who followed me everywhere, and was sitting near me on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24050">
     the floor, at seeing my tears commenced crying himself, and sobbed out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24060">
     complaints against 'wicked aunt Cathy,' which drew her fury on to his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24070">
     unlucky head: she seized his shoulders, and shook him till the poor child
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24080">
     waxed livid, and Edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to deliver
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24090">
     him.  In an instant one was wrung free, and the astonished young man felt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24100">
     it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be mistaken for jest.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24110">
     He drew back in consternation.  I lifted Hareton in my arms, and walked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24120">
     off to the kitchen with him, leaving the door of communication open, for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24130">
     I was curious to watch how they would settle their disagreement.  The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24140">
     insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had laid his hat, pale and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24150">
     with a quivering lip.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24170">
     'That's right!' I said to myself.  'Take warning and begone!  It's a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24180">
     kindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24200">
     'Where are you going?' demanded Catherine, advancing to the door.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24220">
     He swerved aside, and attempted to pass.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24240">
     'You must not go!' she exclaimed, energetically.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24260">
     'I must and shall!' he replied in a subdued voice.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24280">
     'No,' she persisted, grasping the handle; 'not yet, Edgar Linton: sit
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24290">
     down; you shall not leave me in that temper.  I should be miserable all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24300">
     night, and I won't be miserable for you!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24320">
     'Can I stay after you have struck me?' asked Linton.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24340">
     Catherine was mute.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24360">
     'You've made me afraid and ashamed of you,' he continued; 'I'll not come
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24370">
     here again!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24390">
     Her eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24410">
     'And you told a deliberate untruth!' he said.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24430">
     'I didn't!' she cried, recovering her speech; 'I did nothing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24440">
     deliberately.  Well, go, if you please--get away!  And now I'll cry--I'll
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24450">
     cry myself sick!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24470">
     She dropped down on her knees by a chair, and set to weeping in serious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24480">
     earnest.  Edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court; there
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24490">
     he lingered.  I resolved to encourage him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24510">
     'Miss is dreadfully wayward, sir,' I called out.  'As bad as any marred
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24520">
     child: you'd better be riding home, or else she will be sick, only to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24530">
     grieve us.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24550">
     The soft thing looked askance through the window: he possessed the power
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24560">
     to depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse half
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24570">
     killed, or a bird half eaten.  Ah, I thought, there will be no saving
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24580">
     him: he's doomed, and flies to his fate!  And so it was: he turned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24590">
     abruptly, hastened into the house again, shut the door behind him; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24600">
     when I went in a while after to inform them that Earnshaw had come home
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24610">
     rabid drunk, ready to pull the whole place about our ears (his ordinary
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24620">
     frame of mind in that condition), I saw the quarrel had merely effected a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24630">
     closer intimacy--had broken the outworks of youthful timidity, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24640">
     enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship, and confess
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24650">
     themselves lovers.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24670">
     Intelligence of Mr. Hindley's arrival drove Linton speedily to his horse,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24680">
     and Catherine to her chamber.  I went to hide little Hareton, and to take
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24690">
     the shot out of the master's fowling-piece, which he was fond of playing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24700">
     with in his insane excitement, to the hazard of the lives of any who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24710">
     provoked, or even attracted his notice too much; and I had hit upon the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24720">
     plan of removing it, that he might do less mischief if he did go the

     length of firing the gun.

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24810">
     of stowing his son away in the kitchen cupboard.  Hareton was impressed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24820">
     with a wholesome terror of encountering either his wild beast's fondness
    </p>

     or his madman's rage; for in one he ran a chance of being squeezed and

     kissed to death, and in the other of being flung into the fire, or dashed

     against the wall; and the poor thing remained perfectly quiet wherever I

     chose to put him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24880">
     'There, I've found it out at last!' cried Hindley, pulling me back by the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24890">
     skin of my neck, like a dog.  'By heaven and hell, you've sworn between

     you to murder that child!  I know how it is, now, that he is always out

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24960">
     'But I don't like the carving-knife, Mr. Hindley,' I answered; 'it has

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24970">
     been cutting red herrings.  I'd rather be shot, if you please.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_24990">
     'You'd rather be damned!' he said; 'and so you shall.  No law in England

     There was scarcely time to experience a thrill of horror before we saw
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25310">
     that the little wretch was safe.  Heathcliff arrived underneath just at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25320">
     the critical moment; by a natural impulse he arrested his descent, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25330">
     setting him on his feet, looked up to discover the author of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25340">
     accident.  A miser who has parted with a lucky lottery ticket for five
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25350">
     shillings, and finds next day he has lost in the bargain five thousand
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25360">
     pounds, could not show a blanker countenance than he did on beholding the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25370">
     figure of Mr. Earnshaw above.  It expressed, plainer than words could do,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25380">
     the intensest anguish at having made himself the instrument of thwarting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25390">
     his own revenge.  Had it been dark, I daresay he would have tried to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25400">
     remedy the mistake by smashing Hareton's skull on the steps; but, we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25410">
     witnessed his salvation; and I was presently below with my precious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25420">
     charge pressed to my heart.  Hindley descended more leisurely, sobered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25430">
     and abashed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25450">
     'It is your fault, Ellen,' he said; 'you should have kept him out of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25460">
     sight: you should have taken him from me!  Is he injured anywhere?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25480">
     'Injured!' I cried angrily; 'if he is not killed, he'll be an idiot!  Oh!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25490">
     I wonder his mother does not rise from her grave to see how you use him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25500">
     You're worse than a heathen--treating your own flesh and blood in that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25510">
     manner!'  He attempted to touch the child, who, on finding himself with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25520">
     me, sobbed off his terror directly.  At the first finger his father laid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25530">
     on him, however, he shrieked again louder than before, and struggled as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25540">
     if he would go into convulsions.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25560">
     'You shall not meddle with him!' I continued.  'He hates you--they all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25570">
     hate you--that's the truth!  A happy family you have; and a pretty state
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25580">
     you're come to!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25600">
     'I shall come to a prettier, yet, Nelly,' laughed the misguided man,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25610">
     recovering his hardness.  'At present, convey yourself and him away.  And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25620">
     hark you, Heathcliff! clear you too quite from my reach and hearing.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25630">
     wouldn't murder you to-night; unless, perhaps, I set the house on fire:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25640">
     but that's as my fancy goes.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25660">
     While saying this he took a pint bottle of brandy from the dresser, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25670">
     poured some into a tumbler.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25690">
     'Nay, don't!' I entreated.  'Mr. Hindley, do take warning.  Have mercy on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25700">
     this unfortunate boy, if you care nothing for yourself!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25720">
     'Any one will do better for him than I shall,' he answered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25740">
     'Have mercy on your own soul!' I said, endeavouring to snatch the glass
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25750">
     from his hand.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25770">
     'Not I!  On the contrary, I shall have great pleasure in sending it to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25780">
     perdition to punish its Maker,' exclaimed the blasphemer.  'Here's to its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25790">
     hearty damnation!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25810">
     He drank the spirits and impatiently bade us go; terminating his command
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25820">
     with a sequel of horrid imprecations too bad to repeat or remember.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25840">
     'It's a pity he cannot kill himself with drink,' observed Heathcliff,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25850">
     muttering an echo of curses back when the door was shut.  'He's doing his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25860">
     very utmost; but his constitution defies him.  Mr. Kenneth says he would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25870">
     wager his mare that he'll outlive any man on this side Gimmerton, and go
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25880">
     to the grave a hoary sinner; unless some happy chance out of the common
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25890">
     course befall him.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25910">
     I went into the kitchen, and sat down to lull my little lamb to sleep.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25920">
     Heathcliff, as I thought, walked through to the barn.  It turned out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25930">
     afterwards that he only got as far as the other side the settle, when he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25940">
     flung himself on a bench by the wall, removed from the fire and remained
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25950">
     silent.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25970">
     I was rocking Hareton on my knee, and humming a song that began,--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_25990">
     It was far in the night, and the bairnies grat,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26000">
     The mither beneath the mools heard that,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26020">
     when Miss Cathy, who had listened to the hubbub from her room, put her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26030">
     head in, and whispered,--'Are you alone, Nelly?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26050">
     'Yes, Miss,' I replied.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26070">
     She entered and approached the hearth.  I, supposing she was going to say
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26080">
     something, looked up.  The expression of her face seemed disturbed and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26090">
     anxious.  Her lips were half asunder, as if she meant to speak, and she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26100">
     drew a breath; but it escaped in a sigh instead of a sentence.  I resumed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26110">
     my song; not having forgotten her recent behaviour.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26130">
     'Where's Heathcliff?' she said, interrupting me.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26150">
     'About his work in the stable,' was my answer.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26170">
     He did not contradict me; perhaps he had fallen into a doze.  There
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26180">
     followed another long pause, during which I perceived a drop or two
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26190">
     trickle from Catherine's cheek to the flags.  Is she sorry for her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26200">
     shameful conduct?--I asked myself.  That will be a novelty: but she may
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26210">
     come to the point--as she will--I sha'n't help her!  No, she felt small
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26220">
     trouble regarding any subject, save her own concerns.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26240">
     'Oh, dear!' she cried at last.  'I'm very unhappy!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26260">
     'A pity,' observed I.  'You're hard to please; so many friends and so few
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26270">
     cares, and can't make yourself content!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26290">
     'Nelly, will you keep a secret for me?' she pursued, kneeling down by me,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26300">
     and lifting her winsome eyes to my face with that sort of look which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26310">
     turns off bad temper, even when one has all the right in the world to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26320">
     indulge it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26340">
     'Is it worth keeping?' I inquired, less sulkily.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26360">
     'Yes, and it worries me, and I must let it out!  I want to know what I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26370">
     should do.  To-day, Edgar Linton has asked me to marry him, and I've
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26380">
     given him an answer.  Now, before I tell you whether it was a consent or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26390">
     denial, you tell me which it ought to have been.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26410">
     'Really, Miss Catherine, how can I know?' I replied.  'To be sure,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26420">
     considering the exhibition you performed in his presence this afternoon,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26430">
     I might say it would be wise to refuse him: since he asked you after
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26440">
     that, he must either be hopelessly stupid or a venturesome fool.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26460">
     'If you talk so, I won't tell you any more,' she returned, peevishly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26470">
     rising to her feet.  'I accepted him, Nelly.  Be quick, and say whether I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26480">
     was wrong!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26500">
     'You accepted him!  Then what good is it discussing the matter?  You have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26510">
     pledged your word, and cannot retract.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26530">
     'But say whether I should have done so--do!' she exclaimed in an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26540">
     irritated tone; chafing her hands together, and frowning.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26560">
     'There are many things to be considered before that question can be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26570">
     answered properly,' I said, sententiously.  'First and foremost, do you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26580">
     love Mr. Edgar?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26600">
     'Who can help it?  Of course I do,' she answered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26620">
     Then I put her through the following catechism: for a girl of twenty-two
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26630">
     it was not injudicious.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26650">
     'Why do you love him, Miss Cathy?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26670">
     'Nonsense, I do--that's sufficient.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26690">
     'By no means; you must say why?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26710">
     'Well, because he is handsome, and pleasant to be with.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26730">
     'Bad!' was my commentary.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26750">
     'And because he is young and cheerful.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26770">
     'Bad, still.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26790">
     'And because he loves me.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26810">
     'Indifferent, coming there.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26830">
     'And he will be rich, and I shall like to be the greatest woman of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26840">
     neighbourhood, and I shall be proud of having such a husband.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26860">
     'Worst of all.  And now, say how you love him?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26880">
     'As everybody loves--You're silly, Nelly.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26900">
     'Not at all--Answer.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26920">
     'I love the ground under his feet, and the air over his head, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26930">
     everything he touches, and every word he says.  I love all his looks, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26940">
     all his actions, and him entirely and altogether.  There now!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26960">
     'And why?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26980">
     'Nay; you are making a jest of it: it is exceedingly ill-natured!  It's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_26990">
     no jest to me!' said the young lady, scowling, and turning her face to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27000">
     the fire.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27020">
     'I'm very far from jesting, Miss Catherine,' I replied.  'You love Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27030">
     Edgar because he is handsome, and young, and cheerful, and rich, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27040">
     loves you.  The last, however, goes for nothing: you would love him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27050">
     without that, probably; and with it you wouldn't, unless he possessed the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27060">
     four former attractions.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27080">
     'No, to be sure not: I should only pity him--hate him, perhaps, if he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27090">
     were ugly, and a clown.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27110">
     'But there are several other handsome, rich young men in the world:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27120">
     handsomer, possibly, and richer than he is.  What should hinder you from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27130">
     loving them?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27150">
     'If there be any, they are out of my way: I've seen none like Edgar.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27170">
     'You may see some; and he won't always be handsome, and young, and may

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27260">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27330">
     one; and you love Edgar, and Edgar loves you.  All seems smooth and easy:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27340">
     where is the obstacle?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27360">
     '_Here_! and _here_!' replied Catherine, striking one hand on her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27370">
     forehead, and the other on her breast: 'in whichever place the soul
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27380">
     lives.  In my soul and in my heart, I'm convinced I'm wrong!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27400">
     'That's very strange!  I cannot make it out.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27420">
     'It's my secret.  But if you will not mock at me, I'll explain it: I

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27430">
     can't do it distinctly; but I'll give you a feeling of how I feel.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27450">
     She seated herself by me again: her countenance grew sadder and graver,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27460">
     and her clasped hands trembled.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27480">
     'Nelly, do you never dream queer dreams?' she said, suddenly, after some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27490">
     minutes' reflection.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27510">
     'Yes, now and then,' I answered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27530">
     'And so do I.  I've dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27540">
     ever after, and changed my ideas: they've gone through and through me,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27550">
     like wine through water, and altered the colour of my mind.  And this is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27560">
     one: I'm going to tell it--but take care not to smile at any part of it.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27580">
     'Oh! don't, Miss Catherine!' I cried.  'We're dismal enough without
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27590">
     conjuring up ghosts and visions to perplex us.  Come, come, be merry and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27600">
     like yourself!  Look at little Hareton! _he's_ dreaming nothing dreary.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27610">
     How sweetly he smiles in his sleep!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27630">
     'Yes; and how sweetly his father curses in his solitude!  You remember
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27640">
     him, I daresay, when he was just such another as that chubby thing:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27650">
     nearly as young and innocent.  However, Nelly, I shall oblige you to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27660">
     listen: it's not long; and I've no power to be merry to-night.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27680">
     'I won't hear it, I won't hear it!' I repeated, hastily.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27700">
     I was superstitious about dreams then, and am still; and Catherine had an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27710">
     unusual gloom in her aspect, that made me dread something from which I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27720">
     might shape a prophecy, and foresee a fearful catastrophe.  She was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27730">
     vexed, but she did not proceed.  Apparently taking up another subject,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27740">
     she recommenced in a short time.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27760">
     'If I were in heaven, Nelly, I should be extremely miserable.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27780">
     'Because you are not fit to go there,' I answered.  'All sinners would be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27790">
     miserable in heaven.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27810">
     'But it is not for that.  I dreamt once that I was there.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27830">
     'I tell you I won't hearken to your dreams, Miss Catherine!  I'll go to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27840">
     bed,' I interrupted again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27860">
     She laughed, and held me down; for I made a motion to leave my chair.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27880">
     'This is nothing,' cried she: 'I was only going to say that heaven did
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27890">
     not seem to be my home; and I broke my heart with weeping to come back to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27900">
     earth; and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27910">
     middle of the heath on the top of Wuthering Heights; where I woke sobbing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27920">
     for joy.  That will do to explain my secret, as well as the other.  I've
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27930">
     no more business to marry Edgar Linton than I have to be in heaven; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27940">
     if the wicked man in there had not brought Heathcliff so low, I shouldn't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27950">
     have thought of it.  It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; so he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27960">
     shall never know how I love him: and that, not because he's handsome,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27970">
     Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am.  Whatever our souls are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27980">
     made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_27990">
     moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28010">
     Ere this speech ended I became sensible of Heathcliff's presence.  Having
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28020">
     noticed a slight movement, I turned my head, and saw him rise from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28030">
     bench, and steal out noiselessly.  He had listened till he heard
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28040">
     Catherine say it would degrade her to marry him, and then he stayed to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28050">
     hear no further.  My companion, sitting on the ground, was prevented by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28060">
     the back of the settle from remarking his presence or departure; but I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28070">
     started, and bade her hush!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28090">
     'Why?' she asked, gazing nervously round.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28110">
     'Joseph is here,' I answered, catching opportunely the roll of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28120">
     cartwheels up the road; 'and Heathcliff will come in with him.  I'm not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28130">
     sure whether he were not at the door this moment.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28150">
     'Oh, he couldn't overhear me at the door!' said she.  'Give me Hareton,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28160">
     while you get the supper, and when it is ready ask me to sup with you.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28170">
     want to cheat my uncomfortable conscience, and be convinced that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28180">
     Heathcliff has no notion of these things.  He has not, has he?  He does
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28190">
     not know what being in love is!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28210">
     'I see no reason that he should not know, as well as you,' I returned;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28220">
     'and if you are his choice, he'll be the most unfortunate creature that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28230">
     ever was born!  As soon as you become Mrs. Linton, he loses friend, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28240">
     love, and all!  Have you considered how you'll bear the separation, and

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28250">
     how he'll bear to be quite deserted in the world?  Because, Miss

     Catherine--'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28280">
     'He quite deserted! we separated!' she exclaimed, with an accent of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28290">
     indignation.  'Who is to separate us, pray?  They'll meet the fate of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28300">
     Milo!  Not as long as I live, Ellen: for no mortal creature.  Every
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28310">
     Linton on the face of the earth might melt into nothing before I could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28320">
     consent to forsake Heathcliff.  Oh, that's not what I intend--that's not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28330">
     what I mean!  I shouldn't be Mrs. Linton were such a price demanded!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28340">
     He'll be as much to me as he has been all his lifetime.  Edgar must shake
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28350">
     off his antipathy, and tolerate him, at least.  He will, when he learns
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28360">
     my true feelings towards him.  Nelly, I see now you think me a selfish
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28370">
     wretch; but did it never strike you that if Heathcliff and I married, we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28380">
     should be beggars? whereas, if I marry Linton I can aid Heathcliff to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28390">
     rise, and place him out of my brother's power.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28410">
     'With your husband's money, Miss Catherine?' I asked.  'You'll find him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28420">
     not so pliable as you calculate upon: and, though I'm hardly a judge, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28430">
     think that's the worst motive you've given yet for being the wife of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28440">
     young Linton.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28460">
     'It is not,' retorted she; 'it is the best!  The others were the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28470">
     satisfaction of my whims: and for Edgar's sake, too, to satisfy him.  This
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28480">
     is for the sake of one who comprehends in his person my feelings to Edgar
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28490">
     and myself.  I cannot express it; but surely you and everybody have a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28500">
     notion that there is or should be an existence of yours beyond you.  What
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28510">
     were the use of my creation, if I were entirely contained here?  My great
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28520">
     miseries in this world have been Heathcliff's miseries, and I watched and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28530">
     felt each from the beginning: my great thought in living is himself.  If
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28540">
     all else perished, and _he_ remained, _I_ should still continue to be;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28550">
     and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28560">
     turn to a mighty stranger: I should not seem a part of it.--My love for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28570">
     Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28580">
     aware, as winter changes the trees.  My love for Heathcliff resembles the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28590">
     eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28600">
     Nelly, I _am_ Heathcliff!  He's always, always in my mind: not as a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28610">
     pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28620">
     being.  So don't talk of our separation again: it is impracticable; and--'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28640">
     She paused, and hid her face in the folds of my gown; but I jerked it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28650">
     forcibly away.  I was out of patience with her folly!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28670">
     'If I can make any sense of your nonsense, Miss,' I said, 'it only goes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28680">
     to convince me that you are ignorant of the duties you undertake in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28690">
     marrying; or else that you are a wicked, unprincipled girl.  But trouble
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28700">
     me with no more secrets: I'll not promise to keep them.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28720">
     'You'll keep that?' she asked, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28740">
     'No, I'll not promise,' I repeated.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28760">
     She was about to insist, when the entrance of Joseph finished our
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28770">
     conversation; and Catherine removed her seat to a corner, and nursed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28780">
     Hareton, while I made the supper.  After it was cooked, my fellow-servant
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28790">
     and I began to quarrel who should carry some to Mr. Hindley; and we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28800">
     didn't settle it till all was nearly cold.  Then we came to the agreement
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28810">
     that we would let him ask, if he wanted any; for we feared particularly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28820">
     to go into his presence when he had been some time alone.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28840">
     'And how isn't that nowt comed in fro' th' field, be this time?  What is

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28850">
     he about? girt idle seeght!' demanded the old man, looking round for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28860">
     Heathcliff.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28880">
     'I'll call him,' I replied.  'He's in the barn, I've no doubt.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28900">
     I went and called, but got no answer.  On returning, I whispered to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28910">
     Catherine that he had heard a good part of what she said, I was sure; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28920">
     told how I saw him quit the kitchen just as she complained of her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28930">
     brother's conduct regarding him.  She jumped up in a fine fright, flung
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28940">
     Hareton on to the settle, and ran to seek for her friend herself; not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28950">
     taking leisure to consider why she was so flurried, or how her talk would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28960">
     have affected him.  She was absent such a while that Joseph proposed we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28970">
     should wait no longer.  He cunningly conjectured they were staying away
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28980">
     in order to avoid hearing his protracted blessing.  They were 'ill eneugh
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_28990">
     for ony fahl manners,' he affirmed.  And on their behalf he added that

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29000">
     night a special prayer to the usual quarter-of-an-hour's supplication
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29010">
     before meat, and would have tacked another to the end of the grace, had

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29030">
     must run down the road, and, wherever Heathcliff had rambled, find and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29040">
     make him re-enter directly!
    </p>

     'I want to speak to him, and I _must_, before I go upstairs,' she said.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29070">
     'And the gate is open: he is somewhere out of hearing; for he would not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29080">
     reply, though I shouted at the top of the fold as loud as I could.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29100">
     Joseph objected at first; she was too much in earnest, however, to suffer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29110">
     contradiction; and at last he placed his hat on his head, and walked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29120">
     grumbling forth.  Meantime, Catherine paced up and down the floor,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29130">
     exclaiming--'I wonder where he is--I wonder where he can be!  What did I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29140">
     say, Nelly?  I've forgotten.  Was he vexed at my bad humour this

     come.  I do wish he would!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29180">
     'What a noise for nothing!' I cried, though rather uneasy myself.  'What
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29190">
     a trifle scares you!  It's surely no great cause of alarm that Heathcliff

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29200">
     should take a moonlight saunter on the moors, or even lie too sulky to

     don't ferret him out!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29240">
     I departed to renew my search; its result was disappointment, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29250">
     Joseph's quest ended in the same.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29270">
     'Yon lad gets war und war!' observed he on re-entering.  'He's left th'

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29350">
     'Have you found Heathcliff, you ass?' interrupted Catherine.  'Have you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29360">
     been looking for him, as I ordered?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29380">
     'I sud more likker look for th' horse,' he replied.  'It 'ud be to more

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29430">
     It _was_ a very dark evening for summer: the clouds appeared inclined to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29440">
     thunder, and I said we had better all sit down; the approaching rain
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29450">
     would be certain to bring him home without further trouble.  However,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29460">
     Catherine would not be persuaded into tranquillity.  She kept wandering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29470">
     to and fro, from the gate to the door, in a state of agitation which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29480">
     permitted no repose; and at length took up a permanent situation on one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29490">
     side of the wall, near the road: where, heedless of my expostulations and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29500">
     the growling thunder, and the great drops that began to plash around her,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29510">
     she remained, calling at intervals, and then listening, and then crying
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29520">
     outright.  She beat Hareton, or any child, at a good passionate fit of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29530">
     crying.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29550">
     About midnight, while we still sat up, the storm came rattling over the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29560">
     Heights in full fury.  There was a violent wind, as well as thunder, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29570">
     either one or the other split a tree off at the corner of the building: a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29580">
     huge bough fell across the roof, and knocked down a portion of the east
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29590">
     chimney-stack, sending a clatter of stones and soot into the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29600">
     kitchen-fire.  We thought a bolt had fallen in the middle of us; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29610">
     Joseph swung on to his knees, beseeching the Lord to remember the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29620">
     patriarchs Noah and Lot, and, as in former times, spare the righteous,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29630">
     though he smote the ungodly.  I felt some sentiment that it must be a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29640">
     judgment on us also.  The Jonah, in my mind, was Mr. Earnshaw; and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29650">
     shook the handle of his den that I might ascertain if he were yet living.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29660">
     He replied audibly enough, in a fashion which made my companion
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29670">
     vociferate, more clamorously than before, that a wide distinction might
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29680">
     be drawn between saints like himself and sinners like his master.  But
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29690">
     the uproar passed away in twenty minutes, leaving us all unharmed;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29700">
     excepting Cathy, who got thoroughly drenched for her obstinacy in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29710">
     refusing to take shelter, and standing bonnetless and shawlless to catch
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29720">
     as much water as she could with her hair and clothes.  She came in and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29730">
     lay down on the settle, all soaked as she was, turning her face to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29740">
     back, and putting her hands before it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29760">
     'Well, Miss!' I exclaimed, touching her shoulder; 'you are not bent on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29770">
     getting your death, are you?  Do you know what o'clock it is?  Half-past
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29780">
     twelve.  Come, come to bed! there's no use waiting any longer on that

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29800">
     guesses we shouldn't wait for him till this late hour: at least, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29810">
     guesses that only Mr. Hindley would be up; and he'd rather avoid having
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29820">
     the door opened by the master.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29840">
     'Nay, nay, he's noan at Gimmerton,' said Joseph.  'I's niver wonder but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29850">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29890">
     several texts, referring us to chapters and verses where we might find
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29900">
     them.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29920">
     I, having vainly begged the wilful girl to rise and remove her wet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29930">
     things, left him preaching and her shivering, and betook myself to bed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29940">
     with little Hareton, who slept as fast as if everyone had been sleeping
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29950">
     round him.  I heard Joseph read on a while afterwards; then I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29960">
     distinguished his slow step on the ladder, and then I dropped asleep.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29980">
     Coming down somewhat later than usual, I saw, by the sunbeams piercing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_29990">
     the chinks of the shutters, Miss Catherine still seated near the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30000">
     fireplace.  The house-door was ajar, too; light entered from its unclosed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30010">
     windows; Hindley had come out, and stood on the kitchen hearth, haggard
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30020">
     and drowsy.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30040">
     'What ails you, Cathy?' he was saying when I entered: 'you look as dismal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30050">
     as a drowned whelp.  Why are you so damp and pale, child?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30070">
     'I've been wet,' she answered reluctantly, 'and I'm cold, that's all.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30090">
     'Oh, she is naughty!' I cried, perceiving the master to be tolerably
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30100">
     sober.  'She got steeped in the shower of yesterday evening, and there
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30110">
     she has sat the night through, and I couldn't prevail on her to stir.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30130">
     Mr. Earnshaw stared at us in surprise.  'The night through,' he repeated.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30140">
     'What kept her up? not fear of the thunder, surely?  That was over hours
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30150">
     since.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30170">
     Neither of us wished to mention Heathcliff's absence, as long as we could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30180">
     conceal it; so I replied, I didn't know how she took it into her head to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30190">
     sit up; and she said nothing.  The morning was fresh and cool; I threw
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30200">
     back the lattice, and presently the room filled with sweet scents from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30210">
     the garden; but Catherine called peevishly to me, 'Ellen, shut the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30220">
     window.  I'm starving!'  And her teeth chattered as she shrank closer to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30230">
     the almost extinguished embers.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30250">
     'She's ill,' said Hindley, taking her wrist; 'I suppose that's the reason
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30260">
     she would not go to bed.  Damn it!  I don't want to be troubled with more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30270">
     sickness here.  What took you into the rain?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30290">
     'Running after t' lads, as usuald!' croaked Joseph, catching an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30300">
     opportunity from our hesitation to thrust in his evil tongue.  'If I war

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30430">
     'Silence, eavesdropper!' cried Catherine; 'none of your insolence before

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30480">
     'You lie, Cathy, no doubt,' answered her brother, 'and you are a

     I shall only have the more humour for you.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30570">
     'I never saw Heathcliff last night,' answered Catherine, beginning to sob
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30580">
     bitterly: 'and if you do turn him out of doors, I'll go with him.  But,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30600">
     burst into uncontrollable grief, and the remainder of her words were

     inarticulate.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30630">
     Hindley lavished on her a torrent of scornful abuse, and bade her get to

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30680">
     Mr. Kenneth, as soon as he saw her, pronounced her dangerously ill; she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30690">
     had a fever.  He bled her, and he told me to let her live on whey and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30700">
     water-gruel, and take care she did not throw herself downstairs or out of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30710">
     the window; and then he left: for he had enough to do in the parish,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30720">
     where two or three miles was the ordinary distance between cottage and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30730">
     cottage.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30750">
     Though I cannot say I made a gentle nurse, and Joseph and the master were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30760">
     no better, and though our patient was as wearisome and headstrong as a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30770">
     patient could be, she weathered it through.  Old Mrs. Linton paid us
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30780">
     several visits, to be sure, and set things to rights, and scolded and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30790">
     ordered us all; and when Catherine was convalescent, she insisted on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30800">
     conveying her to Thrushcross Grange: for which deliverance we were very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30810">
     grateful.  But the poor dame had reason to repent of her kindness: she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30820">
     and her husband both took the fever, and died within a few days of each
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30830">
     other.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30850">
     Our young lady returned to us saucier and more passionate, and haughtier
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30860">
     than ever.  Heathcliff had never been heard of since the evening of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30870">
     thunder-storm; and, one day, I had the misfortune, when she had provoked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30880">
     me exceedingly, to lay the blame of his disappearance on her: where
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30890">
     indeed it belonged, as she well knew.  From that period, for several
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30900">
     months, she ceased to hold any communication with me, save in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30910">
     relation of a mere servant.  Joseph fell under a ban also: he would speak
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30920">
     his mind, and lecture her all the same as if she were a little girl; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30930">
     she esteemed herself a woman, and our mistress, and thought that her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30940">
     recent illness gave her a claim to be treated with consideration.  Then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30950">
     the doctor had said that she would not bear crossing much; she ought to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30960">
     have her own way; and it was nothing less than murder in her eyes for any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30970">
     one to presume to stand up and contradict her.  From Mr. Earnshaw and his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30980">
     companions she kept aloof; and tutored by Kenneth, and serious threats of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_30990">
     a fit that often attended her rages, her brother allowed her whatever she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31000">
     pleased to demand, and generally avoided aggravating her fiery temper.  He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31010">
     was rather too indulgent in humouring her caprices; not from affection,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31020">
     but from pride: he wished earnestly to see her bring honour to the family
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31030">
     by an alliance with the Lintons, and as long as she let him alone she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31040">
     might trample on us like slaves, for aught he cared!  Edgar Linton, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31050">
     multitudes have been before and will be after him, was infatuated: and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31060">
     believed himself the happiest man alive on the day he led her to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31070">
     Gimmerton Chapel, three years subsequent to his father's death.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31090">
     Much against my inclination, I was persuaded to leave Wuthering Heights
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31100">
     and accompany her here. Little Hareton was nearly five years old, and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31110">
     had just begun to teach him his letters.  We made a sad parting; but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31120">
     Catherine's tears were more powerful than ours.  When I refused to go,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31130">
     and when she found her entreaties did not move me, she went lamenting to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31140">
     her husband and brother.  The former offered me munificent wages; the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31150">
     latter ordered me to pack up: he wanted no women in the house, he said,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31160">
     now that there was no mistress; and as to Hareton, the curate should take
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31170">
     him in hand, by-and-by.  And so I had but one choice left: to do as I was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31180">
     ordered.  I told the master he got rid of all decent people only to run
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31190">
     to ruin a little faster; I kissed Hareton, said good-by; and since then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31200">
     he has been a stranger: and it's very queer to think it, but I've no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31210">
     doubt he has completely forgotten all about Ellen Dean, and that he was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31220">
     ever more than all the world to her and she to him!

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31260">
     At this point of the housekeeper's story she chanced to glance towards
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31270">
     the time-piece over the chimney; and was in amazement on seeing the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31280">
     minute-hand measure half-past one.  She would not hear of staying a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31290">
     second longer: in truth, I felt rather disposed to defer the sequel of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31300">
     her narrative myself.  And now that she is vanished to her rest, and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31310">
     have meditated for another hour or two, I shall summon courage to go

     also, in spite of aching laziness of head and limbs.

     Mr. Heathcliff has just honoured me with a call.  About seven days ago he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31460">
     sent me a brace of grouse--the last of the season.  Scoundrel!  He is not

     altogether guiltless in this illness of mine; and that I had a great mind
    </p>

     to tell him.  But, alas! how could I offend a man who was charitable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31490">
     enough to sit at my bedside a good hour, and talk on some other subject
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31500">
     than pills and draughts, blisters and leeches?  This is quite an easy

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31520">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31530">
     can recollect its chief incidents, as far as she had gone.  Yes: I
    </p>

     remember her hero had run off, and never been heard of for three years;
    </p>

     capable of talking cheerfully.  Mrs. Dean came.

     a sizar's place at college, or escape to America, and earn honours by

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31870">
     agreeable disappointment, she behaved infinitely better than I dared to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31880">
     expect.  She seemed almost over-fond of Mr. Linton; and even to his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31890">
     sister she showed plenty of affection.  They were both very attentive to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31900">
     her comfort, certainly.  It was not the thorn bending to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31910">
     honeysuckles, but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn.  There were no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31920">
     mutual concessions: one stood erect, and the others yielded: and who can
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31930">
     be ill-natured and bad-tempered when they encounter neither opposition

     nor indifference?  I observed that Mr. Edgar had a deep-rooted fear of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31950">
     ruffling her humour.  He concealed it from her; but if ever he heard me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31960">
     answer sharply, or saw any other servant grow cloudy at some imperious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31970">
     order of hers, he would show his trouble by a frown of displeasure that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31980">
     never darkened on his own account.  He many a time spoke sternly to me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_31990">
     about my pertness; and averred that the stab of a knife could not inflict
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32000">
     a worse pang than he suffered at seeing his lady vexed.  Not to grieve a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32010">
     kind master, I learned to be less touchy; and, for the space of half a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32020">
     year, the gunpowder lay as harmless as sand, because no fire came near to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32030">
     explode it.  Catherine had seasons of gloom and silence now and then:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32040">
     they were respected with sympathising silence by her husband, who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32050">
     ascribed them to an alteration in her constitution, produced by her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32060">
     perilous illness; as she was never subject to depression of spirits
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32070">
     before.  The return of sunshine was welcomed by answering sunshine from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32080">
     him.  I believe I may assert that they were really in possession of deep
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32090">
     and growing happiness.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32110">
     It ended.  Well, we _must_ be for ourselves in the long run; the mild and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32120">
     generous are only more justly selfish than the domineering; and it ended
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32130">
     when circumstances caused each to feel that the one's interest was not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32140">
     the chief consideration in the other's thoughts.  On a mellow evening in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32150">
     September, I was coming from the garden with a heavy basket of apples
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32160">
     which I had been gathering.  It had got dusk, and the moon looked over
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32170">
     the high wall of the court, causing undefined shadows to lurk in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32180">
     corners of the numerous projecting portions of the building.  I set my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32190">
     burden on the house-steps by the kitchen-door, and lingered to rest, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32200">
     drew in a few more breaths of the soft, sweet air; my eyes were on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32210">
     moon, and my back to the entrance, when I heard a voice behind me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32220">
     say,--'Nelly, is that you?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32240">
     It was a deep voice, and foreign in tone; yet there was something in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32250">
     manner of pronouncing my name which made it sound familiar.  I turned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32260">
     about to discover who spoke, fearfully; for the doors were shut, and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32270">
     had seen nobody on approaching the steps.  Something stirred in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32280">
     porch; and, moving nearer, I distinguished a tall man dressed in dark
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32290">
     clothes, with dark face and hair.  He leant against the side, and held
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32300">
     his fingers on the latch as if intending to open for himself.  'Who can
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32310">
     it be?' I thought.  'Mr. Earnshaw?  Oh, no!  The voice has no resemblance

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32320">
     to his.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32340">
     'I have waited here an hour,' he resumed, while I continued staring; 'and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32350">
     the whole of that time all round has been as still as death.  I dared not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32360">
     enter.  You do not know me?  Look, I'm not a stranger!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32380">
     A ray fell on his features; the cheeks were sallow, and half covered with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32390">
     black whiskers; the brows lowering, the eyes deep-set and singular.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32400">
     remembered the eyes.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32420">
     'What!' I cried, uncertain whether to regard him as a worldly visitor,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32430">
     and I raised my hands in amazement.  'What! you come back?  Is it really
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32440">
     you?  Is it?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32460">
     'Yes, Heathcliff,' he replied, glancing from me up to the windows, which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32470">
     reflected a score of glittering moons, but showed no lights from within.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32480">
     'Are they at home? where is she?  Nelly, you are not glad! you needn't be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32490">
     so disturbed.  Is she here?  Speak!  I want to have one word with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32500">
     her--your mistress.  Go, and say some person from Gimmerton desires to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32510">
     see her.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32530">
     'How will she take it?' I exclaimed.  'What will she do?  The surprise
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32540">
     bewilders me--it will put her out of her head!  And you _are_ Heathcliff!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32550">
     But altered!  Nay, there's no comprehending it.  Have you been for a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32560">
     soldier?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32580">
     'Go and carry my message,' he interrupted, impatiently.  'I'm in hell
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32590">
     till you do!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32610">
     He lifted the latch, and I entered; but when I got to the parlour where
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32620">
     Mr. and Mrs. Linton were, I could not persuade myself to proceed.  At
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32630">
     length I resolved on making an excuse to ask if they would have the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32640">
     candles lighted, and I opened the door.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32660">
     They sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32670">
     and displayed, beyond the garden trees, and the wild green park, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32680">
     valley of Gimmerton, with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32690">
     (for very soon after you pass the chapel, as you may have noticed, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32700">
     sough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32710">
     the glen).  Wuthering Heights rose above this silvery vapour; but our old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32720">
     house was invisible; it rather dips down on the other side.  Both the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32730">
     room and its occupants, and the scene they gazed on, looked wondrously
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32740">
     peaceful.  I shrank reluctantly from performing my errand; and was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32750">
     actually going away leaving it unsaid, after having put my question about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32760">
     the candles, when a sense of my folly compelled me to return, and mutter,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32770">
     'A person from Gimmerton wishes to see you ma'am.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32790">
     'What does he want?' asked Mrs. Linton.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32810">
     'I did not question him,' I answered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32830">
     'Well, close the curtains, Nelly,' she said; 'and bring up tea.  I'll be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32840">
     back again directly.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32860">
     She quitted the apartment; Mr. Edgar inquired, carelessly, who it was.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32880">
     'Some one mistress does not expect,' I replied.  'That Heathcliff--you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32890">
     recollect him, sir--who used to live at Mr. Earnshaw's.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32910">
     'What! the gipsy--the ploughboy?' he cried.  'Why did you not say so to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32920">
     Catherine?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32940">
     'Hush! you must not call him by those names, master,' I said.  'She'd be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32950">
     sadly grieved to hear you.  She was nearly heartbroken when he ran off.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32960">
     guess his return will make a jubilee to her.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32980">
     Mr. Linton walked to a window on the other side of the room that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_32990">
     overlooked the court.  He unfastened it, and leant out.  I suppose they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33000">
     were below, for he exclaimed quickly: 'Don't stand there, love!  Bring
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33010">
     the person in, if it be anyone particular.'  Ere long, I heard the click
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33020">
     of the latch, and Catherine flew up-stairs, breathless and wild; too
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33030">
     excited to show gladness: indeed, by her face, you would rather have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33040">
     surmised an awful calamity.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33060">
     'Oh, Edgar, Edgar!' she panted, flinging her arms round his neck.  'Oh,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33070">
     Edgar darling!  Heathcliff's come back--he is!'  And she tightened her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33080">
     embrace to a squeeze.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33100">
     'Well, well,' cried her husband, crossly, 'don't strangle me for that!  He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33110">
     never struck me as such a marvellous treasure.  There is no need to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33120">
     frantic!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33140">
     'I know you didn't like him,' she answered, repressing a little the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33150">
     intensity of her delight.  'Yet, for my sake, you must be friends now.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33160">
     Shall I tell him to come up?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33180">
     'Here,' he said, 'into the parlour?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33200">
     'Where else?' she asked.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33220">
     He looked vexed, and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable place for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33230">
     him.  Mrs. Linton eyed him with a droll expression--half angry, half
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33240">
     laughing at his fastidiousness.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33260">
     'No,' she added, after a while; 'I cannot sit in the kitchen.  Set two
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33270">
     tables here, Ellen: one for your master and Miss Isabella, being gentry;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33280">
     the other for Heathcliff and myself, being of the lower orders.  Will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33290">
     that please you, dear?  Or must I have a fire lighted elsewhere?  If so,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33300">
     give directions.  I'll run down and secure my guest.  I'm afraid the joy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33310">
     is too great to be real!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33330">
     She was about to dart off again; but Edgar arrested her.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33350">
     '_You_ bid him step up,' he said, addressing me; 'and, Catherine, try to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33360">
     be glad, without being absurd.  The whole household need not witness the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33370">
     sight of your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33390">
     I descended, and found Heathcliff waiting under the porch, evidently
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33400">
     anticipating an invitation to enter.  He followed my guidance without
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33410">
     waste of words, and I ushered him into the presence of the master and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33420">
     mistress, whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm talking.  But the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33430">
     lady's glowed with another feeling when her friend appeared at the door:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33440">
     she sprang forward, took both his hands, and led him to Linton; and then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33450">
     she seized Linton's reluctant fingers and crushed them into his.  Now,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33460">
     fully revealed by the fire and candlelight, I was amazed, more than ever,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33470">
     to behold the transformation of Heathcliff.  He had grown a tall,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33480">
     athletic, well-formed man; beside whom my master seemed quite slender and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33490">
     youth-like.  His upright carriage suggested the idea of his having been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33500">
     in the army.  His countenance was much older in expression and decision
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33510">
     of feature than Mr. Linton's; it looked intelligent, and retained no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33520">
     marks of former degradation.  A half-civilised ferocity lurked yet in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33530">
     depressed brows and eyes full of black fire, but it was subdued; and his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33540">
     manner was even dignified: quite divested of roughness, though stern for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33550">
     grace.  My master's surprise equalled or exceeded mine: he remained for a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33560">
     minute at a loss how to address the ploughboy, as he had called him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33570">
     Heathcliff dropped his slight hand, and stood looking at him coolly till
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33580">
     he chose to speak.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33600">
     'Sit down, sir,' he said, at length.  'Mrs. Linton, recalling old times,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33610">
     would have me give you a cordial reception; and, of course, I am
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33620">
     gratified when anything occurs to please her.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33640">
     'And I also,' answered Heathcliff, 'especially if it be anything in which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33650">
     I have a part.  I shall stay an hour or two willingly.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33670">
     He took a seat opposite Catherine, who kept her gaze fixed on him as if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33680">
     she feared he would vanish were she to remove it.  He did not raise his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33690">
     to her often: a quick glance now and then sufficed; but it flashed back,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33700">
     each time more confidently, the undisguised delight he drank from hers.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33710">
     They were too much absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33720">
     Not so Mr. Edgar: he grew pale with pure annoyance: a feeling that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33730">
     reached its climax when his lady rose, and stepping across the rug,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33740">
     seized Heathcliff's hands again, and laughed like one beside herself.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33760">
     'I shall think it a dream to-morrow!' she cried.  'I shall not be able to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33770">
     believe that I have seen, and touched, and spoken to you once more.  And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33780">
     yet, cruel Heathcliff! you don't deserve this welcome.  To be absent and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33790">
     silent for three years, and never to think of me!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33810">
     'A little more than you have thought of me,' he murmured.  'I heard of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33820">
     your marriage, Cathy, not long since; and, while waiting in the yard
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33830">
     below, I meditated this plan--just to have one glimpse of your face, a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33840">
     stare of surprise, perhaps, and pretended pleasure; afterwards settle my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33850">
     score with Hindley; and then prevent the law by doing execution on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33860">
     myself.  Your welcome has put these ideas out of my mind; but beware of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33870">
     meeting me with another aspect next time!  Nay, you'll not drive me off
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33880">
     again.  You were really sorry for me, were you?  Well, there was cause.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33890">
     I've fought through a bitter life since I last heard your voice; and you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33900">
     must forgive me, for I struggled only for you!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33920">
     'Catherine, unless we are to have cold tea, please to come to the table,'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33930">
     interrupted Linton, striving to preserve his ordinary tone, and a due
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33940">
     measure of politeness.  'Mr. Heathcliff will have a long walk, wherever
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33950">
     he may lodge to-night; and I'm thirsty.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33970">
     She took her post before the urn; and Miss Isabella came, summoned by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33980">
     bell; then, having handed their chairs forward, I left the room.  The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_33990">
     meal hardly endured ten minutes.  Catherine's cup was never filled: she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34000">
     could neither eat nor drink.  Edgar had made a slop in his saucer, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34010">
     scarcely swallowed a mouthful.  Their guest did not protract his stay
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34020">
     that evening above an hour longer.  I asked, as he departed, if he went
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34030">
     to Gimmerton?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34050">
     'No, to Wuthering Heights,' he answered: 'Mr. Earnshaw invited me, when I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34060">
     called this morning.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34080">
     Mr. Earnshaw invited _him_! and _he_ called on Mr. Earnshaw!  I pondered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34090">
     this sentence painfully, after he was gone.  Is he turning out a bit of a

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34100">
     hypocrite, and coming into the country to work mischief under a cloak?  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34110">
     mused: I had a presentiment in the bottom of my heart that he had better
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34120">
     have remained away.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34140">
     About the middle of the night, I was wakened from my first nap by Mrs.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34150">
     Linton gliding into my chamber, taking a seat on my bedside, and pulling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34160">
     me by the hair to rouse me.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34180">
     'I cannot rest, Ellen,' she said, by way of apology.  'And I want some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34190">
     living creature to keep me company in my happiness!  Edgar is sulky,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34200">
     because I'm glad of a thing that does not interest him: he refuses to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34210">
     open his mouth, except to utter pettish, silly speeches; and he affirmed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34220">
     I was cruel and selfish for wishing to talk when he was so sick and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34230">
     sleepy.  He always contrives to be sick at the least cross!  I gave a few
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34240">
     sentences of commendation to Heathcliff, and he, either for a headache or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34250">
     a pang of envy, began to cry: so I got up and left him.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34270">
     'What use is it praising Heathcliff to him?' I answered.  'As lads they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34280">
     had an aversion to each other, and Heathcliff would hate just as much to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34290">
     hear him praised: it's human nature.  Let Mr. Linton alone about him,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34300">
     unless you would like an open quarrel between them.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34320">
     'But does it not show great weakness?' pursued she.  'I'm not envious: I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34330">
     never feel hurt at the brightness of Isabella's yellow hair and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34340">
     whiteness of her skin, at her dainty elegance, and the fondness all the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34350">
     family exhibit for her.  Even you, Nelly, if we have a dispute sometimes,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34360">
     you back Isabella at once; and I yield like a foolish mother: I call her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34370">
     a darling, and flatter her into a good temper.  It pleases her brother to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34380">
     see us cordial, and that pleases me.  But they are very much alike: they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34390">
     are spoiled children, and fancy the world was made for their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34400">
     accommodation; and though I humour both, I think a smart chastisement
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34410">
     might improve them all the same.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34430">
     'You're mistaken, Mrs. Linton,' said I.  'They humour you: I know what
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34440">
     there would be to do if they did not.  You can well afford to indulge
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34450">
     their passing whims as long as their business is to anticipate all your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34460">
     desires.  You may, however, fall out, at last, over something of equal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34470">
     consequence to both sides; and then those you term weak are very capable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34480">
     of being as obstinate as you.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34500">
     'And then we shall fight to the death, sha'n't we, Nelly?' she returned,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34510">
     laughing.  'No! I tell you, I have such faith in Linton's love, that I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34520">
     believe I might kill him, and he wouldn't wish to retaliate.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34540">
     I advised her to value him the more for his affection.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34560">
     'I do,' she answered, 'but he needn't resort to whining for trifles.  It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34570">
     is childish and, instead of melting into tears because I said that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34580">
     Heathcliff was now worthy of anyone's regard, and it would honour the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34590">
     first gentleman in the country to be his friend, he ought to have said it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34600">
     for me, and been delighted from sympathy.  He must get accustomed to him,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34610">
     and he may as well like him: considering how Heathcliff has reason to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34620">
     object to him, I'm sure he behaved excellently!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34640">
     'What do you think of his going to Wuthering Heights?' I inquired.  'He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34650">
     is reformed in every respect, apparently: quite a Christian: offering the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34660">
     right hand of fellowship to his enemies all around!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34680">
     'He explained it,' she replied.  'I wonder as much as you.  He said he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34690">
     called to gather information concerning me from you, supposing you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34700">
     resided there still; and Joseph told Hindley, who came out and fell to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34710">
     questioning him of what he had been doing, and how he had been living;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34720">
     and finally, desired him to walk in.  There were some persons sitting at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34730">
     cards; Heathcliff joined them; my brother lost some money to him, and,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34740">
     finding him plentifully supplied, he requested that he would come again
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34750">
     in the evening: to which he consented.  Hindley is too reckless to select
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34760">
     his acquaintance prudently: he doesn't trouble himself to reflect on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34770">
     causes he might have for mistrusting one whom he has basely injured.  But
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34780">
     Heathcliff affirms his principal reason for resuming a connection with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34790">
     his ancient persecutor is a wish to install himself in quarters at walking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34800">
     distance from the Grange, and an attachment to the house where we lived
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34810">
     together; and likewise a hope that I shall have more opportunities of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34820">
     seeing him there than I could have if he settled in Gimmerton.  He means
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34830">
     to offer liberal payment for permission to lodge at the Heights; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34840">
     doubtless my brother's covetousness will prompt him to accept the terms:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34850">
     he was always greedy; though what he grasps with one hand he flings away
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34860">
     with the other.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34880">
     'It's a nice place for a young man to fix his dwelling in!' said I.  'Have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34890">
     you no fear of the consequences, Mrs. Linton?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34910">
     'None for my friend,' she replied: 'his strong head will keep him from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34920">
     danger; a little for Hindley: but he can't be made morally worse than he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34930">
     is; and I stand between him and bodily harm.  The event of this evening
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34940">
     has reconciled me to God and humanity!  I had risen in angry rebellion
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34950">
     against Providence.  Oh, I've endured very, very bitter misery, Nelly!  If
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34960">
     that creature knew how bitter, he'd be ashamed to cloud its removal with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34970">
     idle petulance.  It was kindness for him which induced me to bear it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34980">
     alone: had I expressed the agony I frequently felt, he would have been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_34990">
     taught to long for its alleviation as ardently as I.  However, it's over,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35000">
     and I'll take no revenge on his folly; I can afford to suffer anything
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35010">
     hereafter!  Should the meanest thing alive slap me on the cheek, I'd not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35020">
     only turn the other, but I'd ask pardon for provoking it; and, as a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35030">
     proof, I'll go make my peace with Edgar instantly.  Good-night!  I'm an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35040">
     angel!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35060">
     In this self-complacent conviction she departed; and the success of her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35070">
     fulfilled resolution was obvious on the morrow: Mr. Linton had not only
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35080">
     abjured his peevishness (though his spirits seemed still subdued by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35090">
     Catherine's exuberance of vivacity), but he ventured no objection to her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35100">
     taking Isabella with her to Wuthering Heights in the afternoon; and she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35110">
     rewarded him with such a summer of sweetness and affection in return as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35120">
     made the house a paradise for several days; both master and servants
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35130">
     profiting from the perpetual sunshine.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35150">
     Heathcliff--Mr. Heathcliff I should say in future--used the liberty of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35160">
     visiting at Thrushcross Grange cautiously, at first: he seemed estimating
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35170">
     how far its owner would bear his intrusion.  Catherine, also, deemed it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35180">
     judicious to moderate her expressions of pleasure in receiving him; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35190">
     he gradually established his right to be expected.  He retained a great
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35200">
     deal of the reserve for which his boyhood was remarkable; and that served
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35210">
     to repress all startling demonstrations of feeling.  My master's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35220">
     uneasiness experienced a lull, and further circumstances diverted it into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35230">
     another channel for a space.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35250">
     His new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated misfortune of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35260">
     Isabella Linton evincing a sudden and irresistible attraction towards the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35270">
     tolerated guest.  She was at that time a charming young lady of eighteen;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35280">
     infantile in manners, though possessed of keen wit, keen feelings, and a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35290">
     keen temper, too, if irritated.  Her brother, who loved her tenderly, was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35300">
     appalled at this fantastic preference.  Leaving aside the degradation of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35310">
     an alliance with a nameless man, and the possible fact that his property,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35320">
     in default of heirs male, might pass into such a one's power, he had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35330">
     sense to comprehend Heathcliff's disposition: to know that, though his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35340">
     exterior was altered, his mind was unchangeable and unchanged.  And he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35350">
     dreaded that mind: it revolted him: he shrank forebodingly from the idea
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35360">
     of committing Isabella to its keeping.  He would have recoiled still more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35370">
     had he been aware that her attachment rose unsolicited, and was bestowed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35380">
     where it awakened no reciprocation of sentiment; for the minute he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35390">
     discovered its existence he laid the blame on Heathcliff's deliberate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35400">
     designing.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35420">
     We had all remarked, during some time, that Miss Linton fretted and pined
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35430">
     over something.  She grew cross and wearisome; snapping at and teasing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35440">
     Catherine continually, at the imminent risk of exhausting her limited
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35450">
     patience.  We excused her, to a certain extent, on the plea of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35460">
     ill-health: she was dwindling and fading before our eyes.  But one day,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35470">
     when she had been peculiarly wayward, rejecting her breakfast,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35480">
     complaining that the servants did not do what she told them; that the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35490">
     mistress would allow her to be nothing in the house, and Edgar neglected
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35500">
     her; that she had caught a cold with the doors being left open, and we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35510">
     let the parlour fire go out on purpose to vex her, with a hundred yet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35520">
     more frivolous accusations, Mrs. Linton peremptorily insisted that she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35530">
     should get to bed; and, having scolded her heartily, threatened to send
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35540">
     for the doctor.  Mention of Kenneth caused her to exclaim, instantly,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35550">
     that her health was perfect, and it was only Catherine's harshness which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35560">
     made her unhappy.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35580">
     'How can you say I am harsh, you naughty fondling?' cried the mistress,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35590">
     amazed at the unreasonable assertion.  'You are surely losing your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35600">
     reason.  When have I been harsh, tell me?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35620">
     'Yesterday,' sobbed Isabella, 'and now!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35640">
     'Yesterday!' said her sister-in-law.  'On what occasion?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35660">
     'In our walk along the moor: you told me to ramble where I pleased, while
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35670">
     you sauntered on with Mr. Heathcliff!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35690">
     'And that's your notion of harshness?' said Catherine, laughing.  'It was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35700">
     no hint that your company was superfluous?  We didn't care whether you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35710">
     kept with us or not; I merely thought Heathcliff's talk would have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35720">
     nothing entertaining for your ears.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35740">
     'Oh, no,' wept the young lady; 'you wished me away, because you knew I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35750">
     liked to be there!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35770">
     'Is she sane?' asked Mrs. Linton, appealing to me.  'I'll repeat our
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35780">
     conversation, word for word, Isabella; and you point out any charm it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35790">
     could have had for you.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35810">
     'I don't mind the conversation,' she answered: 'I wanted to be with--'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35830">
     'Well?' said Catherine, perceiving her hesitate to complete the sentence.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35850">
     'With him: and I won't be always sent off!' she continued, kindling up.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35860">
     'You are a dog in the manger, Cathy, and desire no one to be loved but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35870">
     yourself!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35890">
     'You are an impertinent little monkey!' exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35900">
     surprise.  'But I'll not believe this idiotcy!  It is impossible that you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35910">
     can covet the admiration of Heathcliff--that you consider him an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35920">
     agreeable person!  I hope I have misunderstood you, Isabella?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35940">
     'No, you have not,' said the infatuated girl.  'I love him more than ever
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35950">
     you loved Edgar, and he might love me, if you would let him!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35970">
     'I wouldn't be you for a kingdom, then!' Catherine declared,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35980">
     emphatically: and she seemed to speak sincerely.  'Nelly, help me to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_35990">
     convince her of her madness.  Tell her what Heathcliff is: an unreclaimed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36000">
     creature, without refinement, without cultivation; an arid wilderness of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36010">
     furze and whinstone.  I'd as soon put that little canary into the park on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36020">
     a winter's day, as recommend you to bestow your heart on him!  It is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36030">
     deplorable ignorance of his character, child, and nothing else, which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36040">
     makes that dream enter your head.  Pray, don't imagine that he conceals
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36050">
     depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern exterior!  He's not a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36060">
     rough diamond--a pearl-containing oyster of a rustic: he's a fierce,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36070">
     pitiless, wolfish man.  I never say to him, "Let this or that enemy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36080">
     alone, because it would be ungenerous or cruel to harm them;" I say, "Let
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36090">
     them alone, because _I_ should hate them to be wronged:" and he'd crush
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36100">
     you like a sparrow's egg, Isabella, if he found you a troublesome charge.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36110">
     I know he couldn't love a Linton; and yet he'd be quite capable of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36120">
     marrying your fortune and expectations: avarice is growing with him a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36130">
     besetting sin.  There's my picture: and I'm his friend--so much so, that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36140">
     had he thought seriously to catch you, I should, perhaps, have held my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36150">
     tongue, and let you fall into his trap.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36170">
     Miss Linton regarded her sister-in-law with indignation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36190">
     'For shame! for shame!' she repeated, angrily.  'You are worse than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36200">
     twenty foes, you poisonous friend!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36220">
     'Ah! you won't believe me, then?' said Catherine.  'You think I speak
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36230">
     from wicked selfishness?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36250">
     'I'm certain you do,' retorted Isabella; 'and I shudder at you!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36270">
     'Good!' cried the other.  'Try for yourself, if that be your spirit: I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36280">
     have done, and yield the argument to your saucy insolence.'--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36300">
     'And I must suffer for her egotism!' she sobbed, as Mrs. Linton left the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36310">
     room.  'All, all is against me: she has blighted my single consolation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36320">
     But she uttered falsehoods, didn't she?  Mr. Heathcliff is not a fiend:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36330">
     he has an honourable soul, and a true one, or how could he remember her?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36350">
     'Banish him from your thoughts, Miss,' I said.  'He's a bird of bad omen:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36360">
     no mate for you.  Mrs. Linton spoke strongly, and yet I can't contradict
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36370">
     her.  She is better acquainted with his heart than I, or any one besides;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36380">
     and she never would represent him as worse than he is.  Honest people
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36390">
     don't hide their deeds.  How has he been living? how has he got rich? why
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36400">
     is he staying at Wuthering Heights, the house of a man whom he abhors?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36410">
     They say Mr. Earnshaw is worse and worse since he came.  They sit up all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36420">
     night together continually, and Hindley has been borrowing money on his

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36610">
     old rascal, but no liar; and, if his account of Heathcliff's conduct be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36620">
     true, you would never think of desiring such a husband, would you?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36640">
     'You are leagued with the rest, Ellen!' she replied.  'I'll not listen to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36650">
     your slanders.  What malevolence you must have to wish to convince me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36660">
     that there is no happiness in the world!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36680">
     Whether she would have got over this fancy if left to herself, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36690">
     persevered in nursing it perpetually, I cannot say: she had little time
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36700">
     to reflect.  The day after, there was a justice-meeting at the next town;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36710">
     my master was obliged to attend; and Mr. Heathcliff, aware of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36720">
     absence, called rather earlier than usual.  Catherine and Isabella were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36730">
     sitting in the library, on hostile terms, but silent: the latter alarmed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36740">
     at her recent indiscretion, and the disclosure she had made of her secret
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36750">
     feelings in a transient fit of passion; the former, on mature
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36760">
     consideration, really offended with her companion; and, if she laughed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36770">
     again at her pertness, inclined to make it no laughing matter to her.  She
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36780">
     did laugh as she saw Heathcliff pass the window.  I was sweeping the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36790">
     hearth, and I noticed a mischievous smile on her lips.  Isabella,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36800">
     absorbed in her meditations, or a book, remained till the door opened;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36810">
     and it was too late to attempt an escape, which she would gladly have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36820">
     done had it been practicable.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36840">
     'Come in, that's right!' exclaimed the mistress, gaily, pulling a chair
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36850">
     to the fire.  'Here are two people sadly in need of a third to thaw the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36860">
     ice between them; and you are the very one we should both of us choose.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36870">
     Heathcliff, I'm proud to show you, at last, somebody that dotes on you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36880">
     more than myself.  I expect you to feel flattered.  Nay, it's not Nelly;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36890">
     don't look at her!  My poor little sister-in-law is breaking her heart by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36900">
     mere contemplation of your physical and moral beauty.  It lies in your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36910">
     own power to be Edgar's brother!  No, no, Isabella, you sha'n't run off,'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36920">
     she continued, arresting, with feigned playfulness, the confounded girl,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36930">
     who had risen indignantly.  'We were quarrelling like cats about you,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36940">
     Heathcliff; and I was fairly beaten in protestations of devotion and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36950">
     admiration: and, moreover, I was informed that if I would but have the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36960">
     manners to stand aside, my rival, as she will have herself to be, would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36970">
     shoot a shaft into your soul that would fix you for ever, and send my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_36980">
     image into eternal oblivion!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37000">
     'Catherine!' said Isabella, calling up her dignity, and disdaining to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37010">
     struggle from the tight grasp that held her, 'I'd thank you to adhere to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37020">
     the truth and not slander me, even in joke!  Mr. Heathcliff, be kind
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37030">
     enough to bid this friend of yours release me: she forgets that you and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37040">
     are not intimate acquaintances; and what amuses her is painful to me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37050">
     beyond expression.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37070">
     As the guest answered nothing, but took his seat, and looked thoroughly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37080">
     indifferent what sentiments she cherished concerning him, she turned and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37090">
     whispered an earnest appeal for liberty to her tormentor.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37110">
     'By no means!' cried Mrs. Linton in answer.  'I won't be named a dog in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37120">
     the manger again.  You _shall_ stay: now then!  Heathcliff, why don't you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37130">
     evince satisfaction at my pleasant news?  Isabella swears that the love
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37140">
     Edgar has for me is nothing to that she entertains for you.  I'm sure she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37150">
     made some speech of the kind; did she not, Ellen?  And she has fasted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37160">
     ever since the day before yesterday's walk, from sorrow and rage that I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37170">
     despatched her out of your society under the idea of its being
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37180">
     unacceptable.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37200">
     'I think you belie her,' said Heathcliff, twisting his chair to face
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37210">
     them.  'She wishes to be out of my society now, at any rate!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37230">
     And he stared hard at the object of discourse, as one might do at a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37240">
     strange repulsive animal: a centipede from the Indies, for instance,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37250">
     which curiosity leads one to examine in spite of the aversion it raises.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37260">
     The poor thing couldn't bear that; she grew white and red in rapid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37270">
     succession, and, while tears beaded her lashes, bent the strength of her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37280">
     small fingers to loosen the firm clutch of Catherine; and perceiving that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37290">
     as fast as she raised one finger off her arm another closed down, and she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37300">
     could not remove the whole together, she began to make use of her nails;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37310">
     and their sharpness presently ornamented the detainer's with crescents of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37320">
     red.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37340">
     'There's a tigress!' exclaimed Mrs. Linton, setting her free, and shaking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37350">
     her hand with pain.  'Begone, for God's sake, and hide your vixen face!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37360">
     How foolish to reveal those talons to him.  Can't you fancy the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37370">
     conclusions he'll draw?  Look, Heathcliff! they are instruments that will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37380">
     do execution--you must beware of your eyes.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37400">
     'I'd wrench them off her fingers, if they ever menaced me,' he answered,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37410">
     brutally, when the door had closed after her.  'But what did you mean by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37420">
     teasing the creature in that manner, Cathy?  You were not speaking the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37430">
     truth, were you?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37450">
     'I assure you I was,' she returned.  'She has been dying for your sake
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37460">
     several weeks, and raving about you this morning, and pouring forth a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37470">
     deluge of abuse, because I represented your failings in a plain light,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37480">
     for the purpose of mitigating her adoration.  But don't notice it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37490">
     further: I wished to punish her sauciness, that's all.  I like her too
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37500">
     well, my dear Heathcliff, to let you absolutely seize and devour her up.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37520">
     'And I like her too ill to attempt it,' said he, 'except in a very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37530">
     ghoulish fashion.  You'd hear of odd things if I lived alone with that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37540">
     mawkish, waxen face: the most ordinary would be painting on its white the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37550">
     colours of the rainbow, and turning the blue eyes black, every day or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37560">
     two: they detestably resemble Linton's.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37580">
     'Delectably!' observed Catherine.  'They are dove's eyes--angel's!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37600">
     'She's her brother's heir, is she not?' he asked, after a brief silence.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37620">
     'I should be sorry to think so,' returned his companion.  'Half a dozen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37630">
     nephews shall erase her title, please heaven!  Abstract your mind from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37640">
     the subject at present: you are too prone to covet your neighbour's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37650">
     goods; remember _this_ neighbour's goods are mine.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37670">
     'If they were _mine_, they would be none the less that,' said Heathcliff;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37680">
     'but though Isabella Linton may be silly, she is scarcely mad; and, in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37690">
     short, we'll dismiss the matter, as you advise.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37710">
     From their tongues they did dismiss it; and Catherine, probably, from her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37720">
     thoughts.  The other, I felt certain, recalled it often in the course of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37730">
     the evening.  I saw him smile to himself--grin rather--and lapse into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37740">
     ominous musing whenever Mrs. Linton had occasion to be absent from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37750">
     apartment.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37770">
     I determined to watch his movements.  My heart invariably cleaved to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37780">
     master's, in preference to Catherine's side: with reason I imagined, for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37790">
     he was kind, and trustful, and honourable; and she--she could not be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37800">
     called _opposite_, yet she seemed to allow herself such wide latitude,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37810">
     that I had little faith in her principles, and still less sympathy for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37820">
     her feelings.  I wanted something to happen which might have the effect
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37830">
     of freeing both Wuthering Heights and the Grange of Mr. Heathcliff
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37840">
     quietly; leaving us as we had been prior to his advent.  His visits were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37850">
     a continual nightmare to me; and, I suspected, to my master also.  His
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37860">
     abode at the Heights was an oppression past explaining.  I felt that God
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37870">
     had forsaken the stray sheep there to its own wicked wanderings, and an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37880">
     evil beast prowled between it and the fold, waiting his time to spring
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37890">
     and destroy.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37960">
     Sometimes, while meditating on these things in solitude, I've got up in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37970">
     sudden terror, and put on my bonnet to go see how all was at the farm.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37980">
     I've persuaded my conscience that it was a duty to warn him how people
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_37990">
     talked regarding his ways; and then I've recollected his confirmed bad
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38000">
     habits, and, hopeless of benefiting him, have flinched from re-entering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38010">
     the dismal house, doubting if I could bear to be taken at my word.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38030">
     One time I passed the old gate, going out of my way, on a journey to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38040">
     Gimmerton. It was about the period that my narrative has reached: a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38050">
     bright frosty afternoon; the ground bare, and the road hard and dry. I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38060">
     came to a stone where the highway branches off on to the moor at your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38070">
     left hand; a rough sand-pillar, with the letters W. H. cut on its north
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38080">
     side, on the east, G., and on the south-west, T. G. It serves as a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38090">
     guide-post to the Grange, the Heights, and village. The sun shone yellow
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38100">
     on its grey head, reminding me of summer; and I cannot say why, but all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38110">
     at once a gush of child's sensations flowed into my heart. Hindley and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38120">
     held it a favourite spot twenty years before. I gazed long at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38130">
     weather-worn block; and, stooping down, perceived a hole near the bottom
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38140">
     still full of snail-shells and pebbles, which we were fond of storing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38150">
     there with more perishable things; and, as fresh as reality, it appeared
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38160">
     that I beheld my early playmate seated on the withered turf: his dark,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38170">
     square head bent forward, and his little hand scooping out the earth
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38180">
     with a piece of slate. 'Poor Hindley!' I exclaimed, involuntarily. I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38190">
     started: my bodily eye was cheated into a momentary belief that the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38200">
     child lifted its face and stared straight into mine! It vanished in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38210">
     twinkling; but immediately I felt an irresistible yearning to be at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38220">
     Heights. Superstition urged me to comply with this impulse: supposing he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38230">
     should be dead! I thought--or should die soon!--supposing it were a sign
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38240">
     of death! The nearer I got to the house the more agitated I grew; and on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38250">
     catching sight of it I trembled in every limb. The apparition had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38260">
     outstripped me: it stood looking through the gate. That was my first
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38270">
     idea on observing an elf-locked, brown-eyed boy setting his ruddy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38280">
     countenance against the bars. Further reflection suggested this must be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38290">
     Hareton, _my_ Hareton, not altered greatly since I left him, ten months
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38300">
     since.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38320">
     'God bless thee, darling!' I cried, forgetting instantaneously my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38330">
     foolish fears. 'Hareton, it's Nelly! Nelly, thy nurse.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38350">
     He retreated out of arm's length, and picked up a large flint.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38370">
     'I am come to see thy father, Hareton,' I added, guessing from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38380">
     action that Nelly, if she lived in his memory at all, was not recognised
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38390">
     as one with me.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38410">
     He raised his missile to hurl it; I commenced a soothing speech, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38420">
     could not stay his hand: the stone struck my bonnet; and then ensued,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38430">
     from the stammering lips of the little fellow, a string of curses, which,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38440">
     whether he comprehended them or not, were delivered with practised
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38450">
     emphasis, and distorted his baby features into a shocking expression of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38460">
     malignity.  You may be certain this grieved more than angered me.  Fit to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38470">
     cry, I took an orange from my pocket, and offered it to propitiate him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38480">
     He hesitated, and then snatched it from my hold; as if he fancied I only
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38490">
     intended to tempt and disappoint him.  I showed another, keeping it out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38500">
     of his reach.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38520">
     'Who has taught you those fine words, my bairn?' I inquired.  'The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38530">
     curate?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38550">
     'Damn the curate, and thee!  Gie me that,' he replied.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38570">
     'Tell us where you got your lessons, and you shall have it,' said I.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38580">
     'Who's your master?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38600">
     'Devil daddy,' was his answer.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38620">
     'And what do you learn from daddy?' I continued.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38640">
     He jumped at the fruit; I raised it higher.  'What does he teach you?' I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38650">
     asked.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38670">
     'Naught,' said he, 'but to keep out of his gait.  Daddy cannot bide me,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38680">
     because I swear at him.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38700">
     'Ah! and the devil teaches you to swear at daddy?' I observed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38720">
     'Ay--nay,' he drawled.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38740">
     'Who, then?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38760">
     'Heathcliff.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38780">
     'I asked if he liked Mr. Heathcliff.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38800">
     'Ay!' he answered again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38820">
     Desiring to have his reasons for liking him, I could only gather the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38830">
     sentences--'I known't: he pays dad back what he gies to me--he curses
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38840">
     daddy for cursing me.  He says I mun do as I will.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38860">
     'And the curate does not teach you to read and write, then?' I pursued.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38880">
     'No, I was told the curate should have his--teeth dashed down his--throat,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38890">
     if he stepped over the threshold--Heathcliff had promised that!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38910">
     I put the orange in his hand, and bade him tell his father that a woman
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38920">
     called Nelly Dean was waiting to speak with him, by the garden gate.  He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38930">
     went up the walk, and entered the house; but, instead of Hindley,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38940">
     Heathcliff appeared on the door-stones; and I turned directly and ran
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38950">
     down the road as hard as ever I could race, making no halt till I gained
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38960">
     the guide-post, and feeling as scared as if I had raised a goblin.  This
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38970">
     is not much connected with Miss Isabella's affair: except that it urged
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38980">
     me to resolve further on mounting vigilant guard, and doing my utmost to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_38990">
     check the spread of such bad influence at the Grange: even though I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39000">
     should wake a domestic storm, by thwarting Mrs. Linton's pleasure.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39020">
     The next time Heathcliff came my young lady chanced to be feeding some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39030">
     pigeons in the court.  She had never spoken a word to her sister-in-law
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39040">
     for three days; but she had likewise dropped her fretful complaining, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39050">
     we found it a great comfort.  Heathcliff had not the habit of bestowing a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39060">
     single unnecessary civility on Miss Linton, I knew.  Now, as soon as he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39070">
     beheld her, his first precaution was to take a sweeping survey of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39080">
     house-front.  I was standing by the kitchen-window, but I drew out of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39090">
     sight.  He then stepped across the pavement to her, and said something:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39100">
     she seemed embarrassed, and desirous of getting away; to prevent it, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39110">
     laid his hand on her arm.  She averted her face: he apparently put some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39120">
     question which she had no mind to answer.  There was another rapid glance
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39130">
     at the house, and supposing himself unseen, the scoundrel had the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39140">
     impudence to embrace her.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39160">
     'Judas!  Traitor!' I ejaculated.  'You are a hypocrite, too, are you?  A
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39170">
     deliberate deceiver.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39190">
     'Who is, Nelly?' said Catherine's voice at my elbow: I had been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39200">
     over-intent on watching the pair outside to mark her entrance.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39220">
     'Your worthless friend!' I answered, warmly: 'the sneaking rascal yonder.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39230">
     Ah, he has caught a glimpse of us--he is coming in!  I wonder will he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39240">
     have the heart to find a plausible excuse for making love to Miss, when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39250">
     he told you he hated her?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39270">
     Mrs. Linton saw Isabella tear herself free, and run into the garden; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39280">
     a minute after, Heathcliff opened the door.  I couldn't withhold giving
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39290">
     some loose to my indignation; but Catherine angrily insisted on silence,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39300">
     and threatened to order me out of the kitchen, if I dared to be so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39310">
     presumptuous as to put in my insolent tongue.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39330">
     'To hear you, people might think you were the mistress!' she cried.  'You
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39340">
     want setting down in your right place!  Heathcliff, what are you about,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39350">
     raising this stir?  I said you must let Isabella alone!--I beg you will,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39360">
     unless you are tired of being received here, and wish Linton to draw the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39370">
     bolts against you!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39390">
     'God forbid that he should try!' answered the black villain.  I detested
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39400">
     him just then.  'God keep him meek and patient!  Every day I grow madder
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39410">
     after sending him to heaven!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39430">
     'Hush!' said Catherine, shutting the inner door!  'Don't vex me.  Why
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39440">
     have you disregarded my request?  Did she come across you on purpose?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39460">
     'What is it to you?' he growled.  'I have a right to kiss her, if she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39470">
     chooses; and you have no right to object.  I am not _your_ husband: _you_
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39480">
     needn't be jealous of me!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39500">
     'I'm not jealous of you,' replied the mistress; 'I'm jealous for you.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39510">
     Clear your face: you sha'n't scowl at me!  If you like Isabella, you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39520">
     shall marry her.  But do you like her?  Tell the truth, Heathcliff!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39530">
     There, you won't answer.  I'm certain you don't.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39550">
     'And would Mr. Linton approve of his sister marrying that man?' I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39560">
     inquired.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39580">
     'Mr. Linton should approve,' returned my lady, decisively.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39600">
     'He might spare himself the trouble,' said Heathcliff: 'I could do as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39610">
     well without his approbation. And as to you, Catherine, I have a mind to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39620">
     speak a few words now, while we are at it. I want you to be aware that I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39630">
     _know_ you have treated me infernally--infernally! Do you hear? And if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39640">
     you flatter yourself that I don't perceive it, you are a fool; and if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39650">
     you think I can be consoled by sweet words, you are an idiot: and if you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39660">
     fancy I'll suffer unrevenged, I'll convince you of the contrary, in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39670">
     very little while! Meantime, thank you for telling me your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39680">
     sister-in-law's secret: I swear I'll make the most of it. And stand you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39690">
     aside!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39710">
     'What new phase of his character is this?' exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39720">
     amazement.  'I've treated you infernally--and you'll take your revenge!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39730">
     How will you take it, ungrateful brute?  How have I treated you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39740">
     infernally?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39760">
     'I seek no revenge on you,' replied Heathcliff, less vehemently.  'That's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39770">
     not the plan.  The tyrant grinds down his slaves and they don't turn
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39780">
     against him; they crush those beneath them.  You are welcome to torture
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39790">
     me to death for your amusement, only allow me to amuse myself a little in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39800">
     the same style, and refrain from insult as much as you are able.  Having
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39810">
     levelled my palace, don't erect a hovel and complacently admire your own
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39820">
     charity in giving me that for a home.  If I imagined you really wished me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39830">
     to marry Isabel, I'd cut my throat!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39850">
     'Oh, the evil is that I am _not_ jealous, is it?' cried Catherine.  'Well,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39860">
     I won't repeat my offer of a wife: it is as bad as offering Satan a lost
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39870">
     soul.  Your bliss lies, like his, in inflicting misery.  You prove it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39880">
     Edgar is restored from the ill-temper he gave way to at your coming; I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39890">
     begin to be secure and tranquil; and you, restless to know us at peace,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39900">
     appear resolved on exciting a quarrel.  Quarrel with Edgar, if you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39910">
     please, Heathcliff, and deceive his sister: you'll hit on exactly the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39920">
     most efficient method of revenging yourself on me.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39940">
     The conversation ceased.  Mrs. Linton sat down by the fire, flushed and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39950">
     gloomy.  The spirit which served her was growing intractable: she could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39960">
     neither lay nor control it.  He stood on the hearth with folded arms,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39970">
     brooding on his evil thoughts; and in this position I left them to seek
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_39980">
     the master, who was wondering what kept Catherine below so long.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40000">
     'Ellen,' said he, when I entered, 'have you seen your mistress?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40020">
     'Yes; she's in the kitchen, sir,' I answered.  'She's sadly put out by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40030">
     Mr. Heathcliff's behaviour: and, indeed, I do think it's time to arrange
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40040">
     his visits on another footing.  There's harm in being too soft, and now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40050">
     it's come to this--.'  And I related the scene in the court, and, as near
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40060">
     as I dared, the whole subsequent dispute.  I fancied it could not be very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40070">
     prejudicial to Mrs. Linton; unless she made it so afterwards, by assuming
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40080">
     the defensive for her guest.  Edgar Linton had difficulty in hearing me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40090">
     to the close.  His first words revealed that he did not clear his wife of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40100">
     blame.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40120">
     'This is insufferable!' he exclaimed.  'It is disgraceful that she should
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40130">
     own him for a friend, and force his company on me!  Call me two men out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40140">
     of the hall, Ellen.  Catherine shall linger no longer to argue with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40150">
     low ruffian--I have humoured her enough.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40170">
     He descended, and bidding the servants wait in the passage, went,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40180">
     followed by me, to the kitchen.  Its occupants had recommenced their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40190">
     angry discussion: Mrs. Linton, at least, was scolding with renewed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40200">
     vigour; Heathcliff had moved to the window, and hung his head, somewhat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40210">
     cowed by her violent rating apparently.  He saw the master first, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40220">
     made a hasty motion that she should be silent; which she obeyed,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40230">
     abruptly, on discovering the reason of his intimation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40250">
     'How is this?' said Linton, addressing her; 'what notion of propriety
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40260">
     must you have to remain here, after the language which has been held to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40270">
     you by that blackguard?  I suppose, because it is his ordinary talk you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40280">
     think nothing of it: you are habituated to his baseness, and, perhaps,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40290">
     imagine I can get used to it too!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40310">
     'Have you been listening at the door, Edgar?' asked the mistress, in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40320">
     tone particularly calculated to provoke her husband, implying both
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40330">
     carelessness and contempt of his irritation.  Heathcliff, who had raised
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40340">
     his eyes at the former speech, gave a sneering laugh at the latter; on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40350">
     purpose, it seemed, to draw Mr. Linton's attention to him.  He succeeded;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40360">
     but Edgar did not mean to entertain him with any high flights of passion.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40380">
     'I've been so far forbearing with you, sir,' he said quietly; 'not that I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40390">
     was ignorant of your miserable, degraded character, but I felt you were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40400">
     only partly responsible for that; and Catherine wishing to keep up your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40410">
     acquaintance, I acquiesced--foolishly.  Your presence is a moral poison
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40420">
     that would contaminate the most virtuous: for that cause, and to prevent
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40430">
     worse consequences, I shall deny you hereafter admission into this house,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40440">
     and give notice now that I require your instant departure.  Three
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40450">
     minutes' delay will render it involuntary and ignominious.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40470">
     Heathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with an eye
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40480">
     full of derision.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40500">
     'Cathy, this lamb of yours threatens like a bull!' he said.  'It is in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40510">
     danger of splitting its skull against my knuckles.  By God!  Mr. Linton,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40520">
     I'm mortally sorry that you are not worth knocking down!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40540">
     My master glanced towards the passage, and signed me to fetch the men: he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40550">
     had no intention of hazarding a personal encounter.  I obeyed the hint;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40560">
     but Mrs. Linton, suspecting something, followed; and when I attempted to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40570">
     call them, she pulled me back, slammed the door to, and locked it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40590">
     'Fair means!' she said, in answer to her husband's look of angry
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40600">
     surprise.  'If you have not courage to attack him, make an apology, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40610">
     allow yourself to be beaten.  It will correct you of feigning more valour
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40620">
     than you possess.  No, I'll swallow the key before you shall get it!  I'm
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40630">
     delightfully rewarded for my kindness to each!  After constant indulgence
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40640">
     of one's weak nature, and the other's bad one, I earn for thanks two
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40650">
     samples of blind ingratitude, stupid to absurdity!  Edgar, I was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40660">
     defending you and yours; and I wish Heathcliff may flog you sick, for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40670">
     daring to think an evil thought of me!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40690">
     It did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that effect on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40700">
     master.  He tried to wrest the key from Catherine's grasp, and for safety
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40710">
     she flung it into the hottest part of the fire; whereupon Mr. Edgar was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40720">
     taken with a nervous trembling, and his countenance grew deadly pale.  For
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40730">
     his life he could not avert that excess of emotion: mingled anguish and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40740">
     humiliation overcame him completely.  He leant on the back of a chair,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40750">
     and covered his face.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40770">
     'Oh, heavens!  In old days this would win you knighthood!' exclaimed Mrs.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40780">
     Linton.  'We are vanquished! we are vanquished!  Heathcliff would as soon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40790">
     lift a finger at you as the king would march his army against a colony of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40800">
     mice.  Cheer up! you sha'n't be hurt!  Your type is not a lamb, it's a

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40810">
     sucking leveret.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40830">
     'I wish you joy of the milk-blooded coward, Cathy!' said her friend.  'I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40840">
     compliment you on your taste.  And that is the slavering, shivering thing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40850">
     you preferred to me!  I would not strike him with my fist, but I'd kick
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40860">
     him with my foot, and experience considerable satisfaction.  Is he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40870">
     weeping, or is he going to faint for fear?'

     The fellow approached and gave the chair on which Linton rested a push.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40900">
     He'd better have kept his distance: my master quickly sprang erect, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40910">
     struck him full on the throat a blow that would have levelled a slighter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40920">
     man.  It took his breath for a minute; and while he choked, Mr. Linton
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40930">
     walked out by the back door into the yard, and from thence to the front
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40940">
     entrance.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40960">
     'There! you've done with coming here,' cried Catherine.  'Get away, now;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40970">
     he'll return with a brace of pistols and half-a-dozen assistants.  If he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40980">
     did overhear us, of course he'd never forgive you.  You've played me an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_40990">
     ill turn, Heathcliff!  But go--make haste!  I'd rather see Edgar at bay
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41000">
     than you.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41020">
     'Do you suppose I'm going with that blow burning in my gullet?' he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41030">
     thundered.  'By hell, no!  I'll crush his ribs in like a rotten hazel-nut
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41040">
     before I cross the threshold!  If I don't floor him now, I shall murder
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41050">
     him some time; so, as you value his existence, let me get at him!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41070">
     'He is not coming,' I interposed, framing a bit of a lie.  'There's the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41080">
     coachman and the two gardeners; you'll surely not wait to be thrust into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41090">
     the road by them!  Each has a bludgeon; and master will, very likely, be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41100">
     watching from the parlour-windows to see that they fulfil his orders.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41120">
     The gardeners and coachman were there: but Linton was with them.  They
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41130">
     had already entered the court.  Heathcliff, on the second thoughts,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41140">
     resolved to avoid a struggle against three underlings: he seized the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41150">
     poker, smashed the lock from the inner door, and made his escape as they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41160">
     tramped in.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41180">
     Mrs. Linton, who was very much excited, bade me accompany her up-stairs.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41190">
     She did not know my share in contributing to the disturbance, and I was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41200">
     anxious to keep her in ignorance.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41220">
     'I'm nearly distracted, Nelly!' she exclaimed, throwing herself on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41230">
     sofa.  'A thousand smiths' hammers are beating in my head!  Tell Isabella
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41240">
     to shun me; this uproar is owing to her; and should she or any one else
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41250">
     aggravate my anger at present, I shall get wild.  And, Nelly, say to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41260">
     Edgar, if you see him again to-night, that I'm in danger of being
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41270">
     seriously ill.  I wish it may prove true.  He has startled and distressed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41280">
     me shockingly!  I want to frighten him.  Besides, he might come and begin
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41290">
     a string of abuse or complainings; I'm certain I should recriminate, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41300">
     God knows where we should end!  Will you do so, my good Nelly?  You are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41310">
     aware that I am no way blamable in this matter.  What possessed him to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41320">
     turn listener?  Heathcliff's talk was outrageous, after you left us; but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41330">
     I could soon have diverted him from Isabella, and the rest meant nothing.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41340">
     Now all is dashed wrong; by the fool's craving to hear evil of self, that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41350">
     haunts some people like a demon!  Had Edgar never gathered our
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41360">
     conversation, he would never have been the worse for it.  Really, when he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41370">
     opened on me in that unreasonable tone of displeasure after I had scolded
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41380">
     Heathcliff till I was hoarse for him, I did not care hardly what they did
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41390">
     to each other; especially as I felt that, however the scene closed, we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41400">
     should all be driven asunder for nobody knows how long!  Well, if I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41410">
     cannot keep Heathcliff for my friend--if Edgar will be mean and jealous,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41420">
     I'll try to break their hearts by breaking my own.  That will be a prompt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41430">
     way of finishing all, when I am pushed to extremity!  But it's a deed to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41440">
     be reserved for a forlorn hope; I'd not take Linton by surprise with it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41450">
     To this point he has been discreet in dreading to provoke me; you must
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41460">
     represent the peril of quitting that policy, and remind him of my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41470">
     passionate temper, verging, when kindled, on frenzy.  I wish you could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41480">
     dismiss that apathy out of that countenance, and look rather more anxious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41490">
     about me.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41510">
     The stolidity with which I received these instructions was, no doubt,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41520">
     rather exasperating: for they were delivered in perfect sincerity; but I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41530">
     believed a person who could plan the turning of her fits of passion to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41540">
     account, beforehand, might, by exerting her will, manage to control
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41550">
     herself tolerably, even while under their influence; and I did not wish
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41560">
     to 'frighten' her husband, as she said, and multiply his annoyances for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41570">
     the purpose of serving her selfishness.  Therefore I said nothing when I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41580">
     met the master coming towards the parlour; but I took the liberty of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41590">
     turning back to listen whether they would resume their quarrel together.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41600">
     He began to speak first.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41620">
     'Remain where you are, Catherine,' he said; without any anger in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41630">
     voice, but with much sorrowful despondency.  'I shall not stay.  I am
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41640">
     neither come to wrangle nor be reconciled; but I wish just to learn
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41650">
     whether, after this evening's events, you intend to continue your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41660">
     intimacy with--'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41680">
     'Oh, for mercy's sake,' interrupted the mistress, stamping her foot, 'for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41690">
     mercy's sake, let us hear no more of it now!  Your cold blood cannot be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41700">
     worked into a fever: your veins are full of ice-water; but mine are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41710">
     boiling, and the sight of such chillness makes them dance.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41730">
     'To get rid of me, answer my question,' persevered Mr. Linton.  'You must
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41740">
     answer it; and that violence does not alarm me.  I have found that you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41750">
     can be as stoical as anyone, when you please.  Will you give up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41760">
     Heathcliff hereafter, or will you give up me?  It is impossible for you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41770">
     to be _my_ friend and _his_ at the same time; and I absolutely _require_
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41780">
     to know which you choose.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41800">
     'I require to be let alone!' exclaimed Catherine, furiously.  'I demand
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41810">
     it!  Don't you see I can scarcely stand?  Edgar, you--you leave me!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41830">
     She rang the bell till it broke with a twang; I entered leisurely.  It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41840">
     was enough to try the temper of a saint, such senseless, wicked rages!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41850">
     There she lay dashing her head against the arm of the sofa, and grinding
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41860">
     her teeth, so that you might fancy she would crash them to splinters!  Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41870">
     Linton stood looking at her in sudden compunction and fear.  He told me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41880">
     to fetch some water.  She had no breath for speaking.  I brought a glass
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41890">
     full; and as she would not drink, I sprinkled it on her face.  In a few
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41900">
     seconds she stretched herself out stiff, and turned up her eyes, while
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41910">
     her cheeks, at once blanched and livid, assumed the aspect of death.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41920">
     Linton looked terrified.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41940">
     'There is nothing in the world the matter,' I whispered.  I did not want
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41950">
     him to yield, though I could not help being afraid in my heart.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41970">
     'She has blood on her lips!' he said, shuddering.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_41990">
     'Never mind!' I answered, tartly. And I told him how she had resolved,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42000">
     previous to his coming, on exhibiting a fit of frenzy. I incautiously
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42010">
     gave the account aloud, and she heard me; for she started up--her hair
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42020">
     flying over her shoulders, her eyes flashing, the muscles of her neck
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42030">
     and arms standing out preternaturally. I made up my mind for broken
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42040">
     bones, at least; but she only glared about her for an instant, and then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42050">
     rushed from the room. The master directed me to follow; I did, to her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42060">
     chamber-door: she hindered me from going further by securing it against
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42070">
     me.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42090">
     As she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning, I went to ask
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42100">
     whether she would have some carried up.  'No!' she replied, peremptorily.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42110">
     The same question was repeated at dinner and tea; and again on the morrow
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42120">
     after, and received the same answer.  Mr. Linton, on his part, spent his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42130">
     time in the library, and did not inquire concerning his wife's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42140">
     occupations.  Isabella and he had had an hour's interview, during which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42150">
     he tried to elicit from her some sentiment of proper horror for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42160">
     Heathcliff's advances: but he could make nothing of her evasive replies,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42170">
     and was obliged to close the examination unsatisfactorily; adding,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42180">
     however, a solemn warning, that if she were so insane as to encourage
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42190">
     that worthless suitor, it would dissolve all bonds of relationship
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42200">
     between herself and him.

     While Miss Linton moped about the park and garden, always silent, and

     almost always in tears; and her brother shut himself up among books that

     one sensible soul in its walls, and that lodged in my body.  I wasted no

     condolences on Miss, nor any expostulations on my mistress; nor did I pay

     much attention to the sighs of my master, who yearned to hear his lady's

     name, since he might not hear her voice.  I determined they should come

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42390">
     about as they pleased for me; and though it was a tiresomely slow
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42400">
     process, I began to rejoice at length in a faint dawn of its progress: as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42410">
     I thought at first.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42430">
     Mrs. Linton, on the third day, unbarred her door, and having finished the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42440">
     water in her pitcher and decanter, desired a renewed supply, and a basin
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42450">
     of gruel, for she believed she was dying.  That I set down as a speech
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42460">
     meant for Edgar's ears; I believed no such thing, so I kept it to myself
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42470">
     and brought her some tea and dry toast.  She ate and drank eagerly, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42480">
     sank back on her pillow again, clenching her hands and groaning.  'Oh, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42490">
     will die,' she exclaimed, 'since no one cares anything about me.  I wish

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42500">
     I had not taken that.'  Then a good while after I heard her murmur, 'No,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42540">
     'Did you want anything, ma'am?' I inquired, still preserving my external
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42550">
     composure, in spite of her ghastly countenance and strange, exaggerated
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42560">
     manner.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42580">
     'What is that apathetic being doing?' she demanded, pushing the thick
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42590">
     entangled locks from her wasted face.  'Has he fallen into a lethargy, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42600">
     is he dead?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42620">
     'Neither,' replied I; 'if you mean Mr. Linton.  He's tolerably well, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42630">
     think, though his studies occupy him rather more than they ought: he is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42640">
     continually among his books, since he has no other society.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42660">
     I should not have spoken so if I had known her true condition, but I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42670">
     could not get rid of the notion that she acted a part of her disorder.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42690">
     'Among his books!' she cried, confounded.  'And I dying!  I on the brink
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42700">
     of the grave!  My God! does he know how I'm altered?' continued she,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42710">
     staring at her reflection in a mirror hanging against the opposite wall.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42720">
     'Is that Catherine Linton?  He imagines me in a pet--in play, perhaps.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42730">
     Cannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest?  Nelly, if it be not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42740">
     too late, as soon as I learn how he feels, I'll choose between these two:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42750">
     either to starve at once--that would be no punishment unless he had a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42760">
     heart--or to recover, and leave the country.  Are you speaking the truth
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42770">
     about him now?  Take care.  Is he actually so utterly indifferent for my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42780">
     life?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42800">
     'Why, ma'am,' I answered, 'the master has no idea of your being deranged;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42810">
     and of course he does not fear that you will let yourself die of hunger.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42830">
     'You think not?  Cannot you tell him I will?' she returned.  'Persuade
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42840">
     him! speak of your own mind: say you are certain I will!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42860">
     'No, you forget, Mrs. Linton,' I suggested, 'that you have eaten some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42870">
     food with a relish this evening, and to-morrow you will perceive its good
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42880">
     effects.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42900">
     'If I were only sure it would kill him,' she interrupted, 'I'd kill
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42910">
     myself directly!  These three awful nights I've never closed my lids--and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42920">
     oh, I've been tormented!  I've been haunted, Nelly!  But I begin to fancy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42930">
     you don't like me.  How strange!  I thought, though everybody hated and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42940">
     despised each other, they could not avoid loving me.  And they have all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42950">
     turned to enemies in a few hours: they have, I'm positive; the people
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42960">
     here.  How dreary to meet death, surrounded by their cold faces!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42970">
     Isabella, terrified and repelled, afraid to enter the room, it would be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42980">
     so dreadful to watch Catherine go.  And Edgar standing solemnly by to see
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_42990">
     it over; then offering prayers of thanks to God for restoring peace to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43000">
     his house, and going back to his _books_!  What in the name of all that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43010">
     feels has he to do with _books_, when I am dying?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43030">
     She could not bear the notion which I had put into her head of Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43040">
     Linton's philosophical resignation.  Tossing about, she increased her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43050">
     feverish bewilderment to madness, and tore the pillow with her teeth;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43060">
     then raising herself up all burning, desired that I would open the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43070">
     window.  We were in the middle of winter, the wind blew strong from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43080">
     north-east, and I objected.  Both the expressions flitting over her face,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43090">
     and the changes of her moods, began to alarm me terribly; and brought to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43100">
     my recollection her former illness, and the doctor's injunction that she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43110">
     should not be crossed.  A minute previously she was violent; now,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43120">
     supported on one arm, and not noticing my refusal to obey her, she seemed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43130">
     to find childish diversion in pulling the feathers from the rents she had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43140">
     just made, and ranging them on the sheet according to their different
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43150">
     species: her mind had strayed to other associations.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43170">
     'That's a turkey's,' she murmured to herself; 'and this is a wild duck's;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43180">
     and this is a pigeon's.  Ah, they put pigeons' feathers in the pillows--no

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43190">
     wonder I couldn't die!  Let me take care to throw it on the floor when I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43200">
     lie down.  And here is a moor-cock's; and this--I should know it among a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43210">
     thousand--it's a lapwing's.  Bonny bird; wheeling over our heads in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43220">
     middle of the moor.  It wanted to get to its nest, for the clouds had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43230">
     touched the swells, and it felt rain coming.  This feather was picked up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43240">
     from the heath, the bird was not shot: we saw its nest in the winter,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43250">
     full of little skeletons.  Heathcliff set a trap over it, and the old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43260">
     ones dared not come.  I made him promise he'd never shoot a lapwing after
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43270">
     that, and he didn't.  Yes, here are more!  Did he shoot my lapwings,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43280">
     Nelly?  Are they red, any of them?  Let me look.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43300">
     'Give over with that baby-work!' I interrupted, dragging the pillow away,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43310">
     and turning the holes towards the mattress, for she was removing its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43320">
     contents by handfuls.  'Lie down and shut your eyes: you're wandering.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43330">
     There's a mess!  The down is flying about like snow.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43350">
     I went here and there collecting it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43370">
     'I see in you, Nelly,' she continued dreamily, 'an aged woman: you have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43380">
     grey hair and bent shoulders.  This bed is the fairy cave under Penistone
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43390">
     crags, and you are gathering elf-bolts to hurt our heifers; pretending,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43400">
     while I am near, that they are only locks of wool.  That's what you'll
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43410">
     come to fifty years hence: I know you are not so now.  I'm not wandering:

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43420">
     you're mistaken, or else I should believe you really _were_ that withered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43430">
     hag, and I should think I _was_ under Penistone Crags; and I'm conscious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43440">
     it's night, and there are two candles on the table making the black press
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43450">
     shine like jet.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43470">
     'The black press? where is that?' I asked.  'You are talking in your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43480">
     sleep!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43500">
     'It's against the wall, as it always is,' she replied.  'It _does_ appear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43510">
     odd--I see a face in it!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43530">
     'There's no press in the room, and never was,' said I, resuming my seat,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43540">
     and looping up the curtain that I might watch her.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43560">
     'Don't _you_ see that face?' she inquired, gazing earnestly at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43570">
     mirror.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43590">
     And say what I could, I was incapable of making her comprehend it to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43600">
     her own; so I rose and covered it with a shawl.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43620">
     'It's behind there still!' she pursued, anxiously.  'And it stirred.  Who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43630">
     is it?  I hope it will not come out when you are gone!  Oh!  Nelly, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43640">
     room is haunted!  I'm afraid of being alone!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43660">
     I took her hand in mine, and bid her be composed; for a succession of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43670">
     shudders convulsed her frame, and she would keep straining her gaze
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43680">
     towards the glass.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43700">
     'There's nobody here!' I insisted.  'It was _yourself_, Mrs. Linton: you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43710">
     knew it a while since.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43730">
     'Myself!' she gasped, 'and the clock is striking twelve!  It's true,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43740">
     then! that's dreadful!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43760">
     Her fingers clutched the clothes, and gathered them over her eyes.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43770">
     attempted to steal to the door with an intention of calling her husband;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43780">
     but I was summoned back by a piercing shriek--the shawl had dropped from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43790">
     the frame.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43810">
     'Why, what is the matter?' cried I.  'Who is coward now?  Wake up!  That
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43820">
     is the glass--the mirror, Mrs. Linton; and you see yourself in it, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43830">
     there am I too by your side.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43850">
     Trembling and bewildered, she held me fast, but the horror gradually
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43860">
     passed from her countenance; its paleness gave place to a glow of shame.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43880">
     'Oh, dear!  I thought I was at home,' she sighed.  'I thought I was lying
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43890">
     in my chamber at Wuthering Heights.  Because I'm weak, my brain got
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43900">
     confused, and I screamed unconsciously.  Don't say anything; but stay
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43910">
     with me.  I dread sleeping: my dreams appal me.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43930">
     'A sound sleep would do you good, ma'am,' I answered: 'and I hope this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43940">
     suffering will prevent your trying starving again.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43960">
     'Oh, if I were but in my own bed in the old house!' she went on bitterly,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43970">
     wringing her hands.  'And that wind sounding in the firs by the lattice.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43980">
     Do let me feel it--it comes straight down the moor--do let me have one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_43990">
     breath!'  To pacify her I held the casement ajar a few seconds.  A cold
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44000">
     blast rushed through; I closed it, and returned to my post.  She lay
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44010">
     still now, her face bathed in tears.  Exhaustion of body had entirely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44020">
     subdued her spirit: our fiery Catherine was no better than a wailing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44030">
     child.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44050">
     'How long is it since I shut myself in here?' she asked, suddenly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44060">
     reviving.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44080">
     'It was Monday evening,' I replied, 'and this is Thursday night, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44090">
     rather Friday morning, at present.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44110">
     'What! of the same week?' she exclaimed.  'Only that brief time?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44130">
     'Long enough to live on nothing but cold water and ill-temper,' observed
    </p>

     I.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44160">
     'Well, it seems a weary number of hours,' she muttered doubtfully: 'it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44170">
     must be more. I remember being in the parlour after they had quarrelled,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44180">
     and Edgar being cruelly provoking, and me running into this room
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44190">
     desperate. As soon as ever I had barred the door, utter blackness
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44200">
     overwhelmed me, and I fell on the floor. I couldn't explain to Edgar how
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44210">
     certain I felt of having a fit, or going raging mad, if he persisted in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44220">
     teasing me! I had no command of tongue, or brain, and he did not guess
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44230">
     my agony, perhaps: it barely left me sense to try to escape from him and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44240">
     his voice. Before I recovered sufficiently to see and hear, it began to

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44250">
     be dawn, and, Nelly, I'll tell you what I thought, and what has kept
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44260">
     recurring and recurring till I feared for my reason. I thought as I lay
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44270">
     there, with my head against that table leg, and my eyes dimly discerning

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44280">
     the grey square of the window, that I was enclosed in the oak-panelled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44290">
     bed at home; and my heart ached with some great grief which, just
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44300">
     waking, I could not recollect. I pondered, and worried myself to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44310">
     discover what it could be, and, most strangely, the whole last seven
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44320">
     years of my life grew a blank! I did not recall that they had been at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44330">
     all. I was a child; my father was just buried, and my misery arose from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44340">
     the separation that Hindley had ordered between me and Heathcliff. I was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44350">
     laid alone, for the first time; and, rousing from a dismal doze after a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44360">
     night of weeping, I lifted my hand to push the panels aside: it struck
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44370">
     the table-top! I swept it along the carpet, and then memory burst in: my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44380">
     late anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of despair. I cannot say why I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44390">
     felt so wildly wretched: it must have been temporary derangement; for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44400">
     there is scarcely cause. But, supposing at twelve years old I had been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44410">
     wrenched from the Heights, and every early association, and my all in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44420">
     all, as Heathcliff was at that time, and been converted at a stroke into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44430">
     Mrs. Linton, the lady of Thrushcross Grange, and the wife of a stranger:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44440">
     an exile, and outcast, thenceforth, from what had been my world. You may
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44450">
     fancy a glimpse of the abyss where I grovelled! Shake your head as you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44460">
     will, Nelly, you have helped to unsettle me! You should have spoken to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44470">
     Edgar, indeed you should, and compelled him to leave me quiet! Oh, I'm
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44480">
     burning! I wish I were out of doors! I wish I were a girl again, half
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44490">
     savage and hardy, and free; and laughing at injuries, not maddening
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44500">
     under them! Why am I so changed? why does my blood rush into a hell of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44510">
     tumult at a few words? I'm sure I should be myself were I once among the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44520">
     heather on those hills. Open the window again wide: fasten it open!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44530">
     Quick, why don't you move?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44550">
     'Because I won't give you your death of cold,' I answered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44570">
     'You won't give me a chance of life, you mean,' she said, sullenly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44580">
     'However, I'm not helpless yet; I'll open it myself.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44600">
     And sliding from the bed before I could hinder her, she crossed the room,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44610">
     walking very uncertainly, threw it back, and bent out, careless of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44620">
     frosty air that cut about her shoulders as keen as a knife.  I entreated,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44630">
     and finally attempted to force her to retire.  But I soon found her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44640">
     delirious strength much surpassed mine (she was delirious, I became
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44650">
     convinced by her subsequent actions and ravings).  There was no moon, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44660">
     everything beneath lay in misty darkness: not a light gleamed from any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44670">
     house, far or near all had been extinguished long ago: and those at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44680">
     Wuthering Heights were never visible--still she asserted she caught their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44690">
     shining.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44710">
     'Look!' she cried eagerly, 'that's my room with the candle in it, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44720">
     trees swaying before it; and the other candle is in Joseph's garret.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44730">
     Joseph sits up late, doesn't he?  He's waiting till I come home that he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44740">
     may lock the gate.  Well, he'll wait a while yet.  It's a rough journey,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44750">
     and a sad heart to travel it; and we must pass by Gimmerton Kirk to go
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44760">
     that journey!  We've braved its ghosts often together, and dared each
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44770">
     other to stand among the graves and ask them to come.  But, Heathcliff,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44780">
     if I dare you now, will you venture?  If you do, I'll keep you.  I'll not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44790">
     lie there by myself: they may bury me twelve feet deep, and throw the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44800">
     church down over me, but I won't rest till you are with me.  I never
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44810">
     will!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44830">
     She paused, and resumed with a strange smile.  'He's considering--he'd
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44840">
     rather I'd come to him!  Find a way, then! not through that kirkyard.  You
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44850">
     are slow!  Be content, you always followed me!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44870">
     Perceiving it vain to argue against her insanity, I was planning how I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44880">
     could reach something to wrap about her, without quitting my hold of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44890">
     herself (for I could not trust her alone by the gaping lattice), when, to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44900">
     my consternation, I heard the rattle of the door-handle, and Mr. Linton
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44910">
     entered.  He had only then come from the library; and, in passing through
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44920">
     the lobby, had noticed our talking and been attracted by curiosity, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44930">
     fear, to examine what it signified, at that late hour.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44950">
     'Oh, sir!' I cried, checking the exclamation risen to his lips at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44960">
     sight which met him, and the bleak atmosphere of the chamber.  'My poor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44970">
     mistress is ill, and she quite masters me: I cannot manage her at all;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44980">
     pray, come and persuade her to go to bed.  Forget your anger, for she's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_44990">
     hard to guide any way but her own.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45010">
     'Catherine ill?' he said, hastening to us.  'Shut the window, Ellen!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45020">
     Catherine! why--'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45040">
     He was silent.  The haggardness of Mrs. Linton's appearance smote him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45050">
     speechless, and he could only glance from her to me in horrified
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45060">
     astonishment.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45080">
     'She's been fretting here,' I continued, 'and eating scarcely anything,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45090">
     and never complaining: she would admit none of us till this evening, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45100">
     so we couldn't inform you of her state, as we were not aware of it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45110">
     ourselves; but it is nothing.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45130">
     I felt I uttered my explanations awkwardly; the master frowned.  'It is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45140">
     nothing, is it, Ellen Dean?' he said sternly.  'You shall account more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45150">
     clearly for keeping me ignorant of this!'  And he took his wife in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45160">
     arms, and looked at her with anguish.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45180">
     At first she gave him no glance of recognition: he was invisible to her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45190">
     abstracted gaze.  The delirium was not fixed, however; having weaned her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45200">
     eyes from contemplating the outer darkness, by degrees she centred her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45210">
     attention on him, and discovered who it was that held her.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45230">
     'Ah! you are come, are you, Edgar Linton?' she said, with angry
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45240">
     animation.  'You are one of those things that are ever found when least
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45250">
     wanted, and when you are wanted, never!  I suppose we shall have plenty
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45260">
     of lamentations now--I see we shall--but they can't keep me from my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45270">
     narrow home out yonder: my resting-place, where I'm bound before spring
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45280">
     is over!  There it is: not among the Lintons, mind, under the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45290">
     chapel-roof, but in the open air, with a head-stone; and you may please
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45300">
     yourself whether you go to them or come to me!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45320">
     'Catherine, what have you done?' commenced the master.  'Am I nothing to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45330">
     you any more?  Do you love that wretch Heath--'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45350">
     'Hush!' cried Mrs. Linton.  'Hush, this moment!  You mention that name
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45360">
     and I end the matter instantly by a spring from the window!  What you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45370">
     touch at present you may have; but my soul will be on that hill-top
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45380">
     before you lay hands on me again.  I don't want you, Edgar: I'm past
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45390">
     wanting you.  Return to your books.  I'm glad you possess a consolation,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45400">
     for all you had in me is gone.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45420">
     'Her mind wanders, sir,' I interposed.  'She has been talking nonsense
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45430">
     the whole evening; but let her have quiet, and proper attendance, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45440">
     she'll rally.  Hereafter, we must be cautious how we vex her.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45460">
     'I desire no further advice from you,' answered Mr. Linton.  'You knew
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45470">
     your mistress's nature, and you encouraged me to harass her.  And not to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45480">
     give me one hint of how she has been these three days!  It was heartless!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45490">
     Months of sickness could not cause such a change!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45510">
     I began to defend myself, thinking it too bad to be blamed for another's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45520">
     wicked waywardness.  'I knew Mrs. Linton's nature to be headstrong and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45530">
     domineering,' cried I: 'but I didn't know that you wished to foster her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45540">
     fierce temper!  I didn't know that, to humour her, I should wink at Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45550">
     Heathcliff.  I performed the duty of a faithful servant in telling you,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45560">
     and I have got a faithful servant's wages!  Well, it will teach me to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45570">
     careful next time.  Next time you may gather intelligence for yourself!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45590">
     'The next time you bring a tale to me you shall quit my service, Ellen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45600">
     Dean,' he replied.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45620">
     'You'd rather hear nothing about it, I suppose, then, Mr. Linton?' said
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45630">
     I.  'Heathcliff has your permission to come a-courting to Miss, and to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45640">
     drop in at every opportunity your absence offers, on purpose to poison
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45650">
     the mistress against you?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45670">
     Confused as Catherine was, her wits were alert at applying our
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45680">
     conversation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45700">
     'Ah!  Nelly has played traitor,' she exclaimed, passionately.  'Nelly is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45710">
     my hidden enemy.  You witch!  So you do seek elf-bolts to hurt us!  Let
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45720">
     me go, and I'll make her rue!  I'll make her howl a recantation!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45740">
     A maniac's fury kindled under her brows; she struggled desperately to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45750">
     disengage herself from Linton's arms.  I felt no inclination to tarry the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45760">
     event; and, resolving to seek medical aid on my own responsibility, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45770">
     quitted the chamber.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45790">
     In passing the garden to reach the road, at a place where a bridle hook
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45800">
     is driven into the wall, I saw something white moved irregularly,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45810">
     evidently by another agent than the wind.  Notwithstanding my hurry, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45820">
     stayed to examine it, lest ever after I should have the conviction
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45830">
     impressed on my imagination that it was a creature of the other world.  My
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45840">
     surprise and perplexity were great on discovering, by touch more than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45850">
     vision, Miss Isabella's springer, Fanny, suspended by a handkerchief, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45860">
     nearly at its last gasp.  I quickly released the animal, and lifted it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45870">
     into the garden.  I had seen it follow its mistress up-stairs when she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45880">
     went to bed; and wondered much how it could have got out there, and what
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45890">
     mischievous person had treated it so.  While untying the knot round the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45900">
     hook, it seemed to me that I repeatedly caught the beat of horses' feet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45910">
     galloping at some distance; but there were such a number of things to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45920">
     occupy my reflections that I hardly gave the circumstance a thought:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45930">
     though it was a strange sound, in that place, at two o'clock in the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45940">
     morning.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45960">
     Mr. Kenneth was fortunately just issuing from his house to see a patient
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45970">
     in the village as I came up the street; and my account of Catherine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45980">
     Linton's malady induced him to accompany me back immediately.  He was a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_45990">
     plain rough man; and he made no scruple to speak his doubts of her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46000">
     surviving this second attack; unless she were more submissive to his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46010">
     directions than she had shown herself before.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46030">
     'Nelly Dean,' said he, 'I can't help fancying there's an extra cause for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46040">
     this.  What has there been to do at the Grange?  We've odd reports up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46050">
     here.  A stout, hearty lass like Catherine does not fall ill for a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46060">
     trifle; and that sort of people should not either.  It's hard work
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46070">
     bringing them through fevers, and such things.  How did it begin?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46090">
     'The master will inform you,' I answered; 'but you are acquainted with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46100">
     the Earnshaws' violent dispositions, and Mrs. Linton caps them all.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46110">
     may say this; it commenced in a quarrel.  She was struck during a tempest
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46120">
     of passion with a kind of fit.  That's her account, at least: for she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46130">
     flew off in the height of it, and locked herself up.  Afterwards, she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46140">
     refused to eat, and now she alternately raves and remains in a half
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46150">
     dream; knowing those about her, but having her mind filled with all sorts
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46160">
     of strange ideas and illusions.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46180">
     'Mr. Linton will be sorry?' observed Kenneth, interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46200">
     'Sorry? he'll break his heart should anything happen!' I replied.  'Don't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46210">
     alarm him more than necessary.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46230">
     'Well, I told him to beware,' said my companion; 'and he must bide the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46240">
     consequences of neglecting my warning!  Hasn't he been intimate with Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46250">
     Heathcliff lately?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46270">
     'Heathcliff frequently visits at the Grange,' answered I, 'though more on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46280">
     the strength of the mistress having known him when a boy, than because
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46290">
     the master likes his company.  At present he's discharged from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46300">
     trouble of calling; owing to some presumptuous aspirations after Miss
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46310">
     Linton which he manifested.  I hardly think he'll be taken in again.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46330">
     'And does Miss Linton turn a cold shoulder on him?' was the doctor's next
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46340">
     question.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46360">
     'I'm not in her confidence,' returned I, reluctant to continue the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46370">
     subject.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46390">
     'No, she's a sly one,' he remarked, shaking his head.  'She keeps her own
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46400">
     counsel!  But she's a real little fool.  I have it from good authority
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46410">
     that last night (and a pretty night it was!) she and Heathcliff were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46420">
     walking in the plantation at the back of your house above two hours; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46430">
     he pressed her not to go in again, but just mount his horse and away with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46440">
     him!  My informant said she could only put him off by pledging her word
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46450">
     of honour to be prepared on their first meeting after that: when it was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46460">
     to be he didn't hear; but you urge Mr. Linton to look sharp!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46480">
     This news filled me with fresh fears; I outstripped Kenneth, and ran most
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46490">
     of the way back.  The little dog was yelping in the garden yet.  I spared
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46500">
     a minute to open the gate for it, but instead of going to the house door,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46510">
     it coursed up and down snuffing the grass, and would have escaped to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46520">
     road, had I not seized it and conveyed it in with me.  On ascending to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46530">
     Isabella's room, my suspicions were confirmed: it was empty.  Had I been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46540">
     a few hours sooner Mrs. Linton's illness might have arrested her rash
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46550">
     step.  But what could be done now?  There was a bare possibility of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46560">
     overtaking them if pursued instantly.  _I_ could not pursue them,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46570">
     however; and I dared not rouse the family, and fill the place with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46580">
     confusion; still less unfold the business to my master, absorbed as he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46590">
     was in his present calamity, and having no heart to spare for a second
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46600">
     grief!  I saw nothing for it but to hold my tongue, and suffer matters to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46610">
     take their course; and Kenneth being arrived, I went with a badly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46620">
     composed countenance to announce him.  Catherine lay in a troubled sleep:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46630">
     her husband had succeeded in soothing the excess of frenzy; he now hung
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46640">
     over her pillow, watching every shade and every change of her painfully
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46650">
     expressive features.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46670">
     The doctor, on examining the case for himself, spoke hopefully to him of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46680">
     its having a favourable termination, if we could only preserve around her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46690">
     perfect and constant tranquillity.  To me, he signified the threatening
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46700">
     danger was not so much death, as permanent alienation of intellect.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46720">
     I did not close my eyes that night, nor did Mr. Linton: indeed, we never
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46730">
     went to bed; and the servants were all up long before the usual hour,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46740">
     moving through the house with stealthy tread, and exchanging whispers as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46750">
     they encountered each other in their vocations.  Every one was active but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46760">
     Miss Isabella; and they began to remark how sound she slept: her brother,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46770">
     too, asked if she had risen, and seemed impatient for her presence, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46780">
     hurt that she showed so little anxiety for her sister-in-law.  I trembled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46790">
     lest he should send me to call her; but I was spared the pain of being
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46800">
     the first proclaimant of her flight.  One of the maids, a thoughtless
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46810">
     girl, who had been on an early errand to Gimmerton, came panting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46820">
     up-stairs, open-mouthed, and dashed into the chamber, crying: 'Oh, dear,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46830">
     dear!  What mun we have next?  Master, master, our young lady--'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46850">
     'Hold your noise!' cried, I hastily, enraged at her clamorous manner.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46870">
     'Speak lower, Mary--What is the matter?' said Mr. Linton.  'What ails
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46880">
     your young lady?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46900">
     'She's gone, she's gone!  Yon' Heathcliff's run off wi' her!' gasped the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46910">
     girl.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46930">
     'That is not true!' exclaimed Linton, rising in agitation.  'It cannot
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46940">
     be: how has the idea entered your head?  Ellen Dean, go and seek her.  It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46950">
     is incredible: it cannot be.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46970">
     As he spoke he took the servant to the door, and then repeated his demand
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_46980">
     to know her reasons for such an assertion.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47000">
     'Why, I met on the road a lad that fetches milk here,' she stammered,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47010">
     'and he asked whether we weren't in trouble at the Grange.  I thought he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47020">
     meant for missis's sickness, so I answered, yes.  Then says he, "There's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47030">
     somebody gone after 'em, I guess?"  I stared.  He saw I knew nought about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47040">
     it, and he told how a gentleman and lady had stopped to have a horse's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47050">
     shoe fastened at a blacksmith's shop, two miles out of Gimmerton, not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47060">
     very long after midnight! and how the blacksmith's lass had got up to spy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47070">
     who they were: she knew them both directly.  And she noticed the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47080">
     man--Heathcliff it was, she felt certain: nob'dy could mistake him,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47090">
     besides--put a sovereign in her father's hand for payment.  The lady had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47100">
     a cloak about her face; but having desired a sup of water, while she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47110">
     drank it fell back, and she saw her very plain.  Heathcliff held both
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47120">
     bridles as they rode on, and they set their faces from the village, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47130">
     went as fast as the rough roads would let them.  The lass said nothing to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47140">
     her father, but she told it all over Gimmerton this morning.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47160">
     I ran and peeped, for form's sake, into Isabella's room; confirming, when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47170">
     I returned, the servant's statement.  Mr. Linton had resumed his seat by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47180">
     the bed; on my re-entrance, he raised his eyes, read the meaning of my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47190">
     blank aspect, and dropped them without giving an order, or uttering a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47200">
     word.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47220">
     'Are we to try any measures for overtaking and bringing her back,' I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47230">
     inquired.  'How should we do?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47250">
     'She went of her own accord,' answered the master; 'she had a right to go
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47260">
     if she pleased.  Trouble me no more about her.  Hereafter she is only my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47270">
     sister in name: not because I disown her, but because she has disowned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47280">
     me.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47300">
     And that was all he said on the subject: he did not make single inquiry
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47310">
     further, or mention her in any way, except directing me to send what
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47320">
     property she had in the house to her fresh home, wherever it was, when I

     knew it.

     that her mind would settle back to its right balance also, and she would

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47550">
     The first time she left her chamber was at the commencement of the

     handful of golden crocuses; her eye, long stranger to any gleam of

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47680">
     Catherine, last spring at this time, I was longing to have you under this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47690">
     roof; now, I wish you were a mile or two up those hills: the air blows so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47700">
     sweetly, I feel that it would cure you.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47720">
     'I shall never be there but once more,' said the invalid; 'and then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47730">
     you'll leave me, and I shall remain for ever.  Next spring you'll long
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47740">
     again to have me under this roof, and you'll look back and think you were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47750">
     happy to-day.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47770">
     Linton lavished on her the kindest caresses, and tried to cheer her by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47780">
     the fondest words; but, vaguely regarding the flowers, she let the tears
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47790">
     collect on her lashes and stream down her cheeks unheeding.  We knew she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47800">
     was really better, and, therefore, decided that long confinement to a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47810">
     single place produced much of this despondency, and it might be partially
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47820">
     removed by a change of scene.  The master told me to light a fire in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47830">
     many-weeks' deserted parlour, and to set an easy-chair in the sunshine by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47840">
     the window; and then he brought her down, and she sat a long while
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47850">
     enjoying the genial heat, and, as we expected, revived by the objects
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47860">
     round her: which, though familiar, were free from the dreary associations
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47870">
     investing her hated sick chamber.  By evening she seemed greatly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47880">
     exhausted; yet no arguments could persuade her to return to that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47890">
     apartment, and I had to arrange the parlour sofa for her bed, till
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47900">
     another room could be prepared.  To obviate the fatigue of mounting and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47910">
     descending the stairs, we fitted up this, where you lie at present--on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47920">
     the same floor with the parlour; and she was soon strong enough to move
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47930">
     from one to the other, leaning on Edgar's arm.  Ah, I thought myself, she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47940">
     might recover, so waited on as she was.  And there was double cause to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47950">
     desire it, for on her existence depended that of another: we cherished
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47960">
     the hope that in a little while Mr. Linton's heart would be gladdened,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47970">
     and his lands secured from a stranger's grip, by the birth of an heir.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_47990">
     I should mention that Isabella sent to her brother, some six weeks from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48000">
     her departure, a short note, announcing her marriage with Heathcliff.  It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48010">
     appeared dry and cold; but at the bottom was dotted in with pencil an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48020">
     obscure apology, and an entreaty for kind remembrance and reconciliation,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48030">
     if her proceeding had offended him: asserting that she could not help it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48040">
     then, and being done, she had now no power to repeal it.  Linton did not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48050">
     reply to this, I believe; and, in a fortnight more, I got a long letter,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48060">
     which I considered odd, coming from the pen of a bride just out of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48070">
     honeymoon.  I'll read it: for I keep it yet.  Any relic of the dead is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48080">
     precious, if they were valued living.

     * * * * *
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48120">
     DEAR ELLEN, it begins,--I came last night to Wuthering Heights, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48130">
     heard, for the first time, that Catherine has been, and is yet, very ill.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48140">
     I must not write to her, I suppose, and my brother is either too angry or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48150">
     too distressed to answer what I sent him.  Still, I must write to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48160">
     somebody, and the only choice left me is you.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48180">
     Inform Edgar that I'd give the world to see his face again--that my heart
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48190">
     returned to Thrushcross Grange in twenty-four hours after I left it, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48200">
     is there at this moment, full of warm feelings for him, and Catherine!  _I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48210">
     can't follow it though_--(these words are underlined)--they need not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48220">
     expect me, and they may draw what conclusions they please; taking care,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48230">
     however, to lay nothing at the door of my weak will or deficient
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48240">
     affection.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48260">
     The remainder of the letter is for yourself alone.  I want to ask you two
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48270">
     questions: the first is,--How did you contrive to preserve the common
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48280">
     sympathies of human nature when you resided here?  I cannot recognise any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48290">
     sentiment which those around share with me.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48310">
     The second question I have great interest in; it is this--Is Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48320">
     Heathcliff a man?  If so, is he mad?  And if not, is he a devil?  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48330">
     sha'n't tell my reasons for making this inquiry; but I beseech you to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48340">
     explain, if you can, what I have married: that is, when you call to see
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48350">
     me; and you must call, Ellen, very soon.  Don't write, but come, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48360">
     bring me something from Edgar.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48380">
     Now, you shall hear how I have been received in my new home, as I am led
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48390">
     to imagine the Heights will be.  It is to amuse myself that I dwell on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48400">
     such subjects as the lack of external comforts: they never occupy my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48410">
     thoughts, except at the moment when I miss them.  I should laugh and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48420">
     dance for joy, if I found their absence was the total of my miseries, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48430">
     the rest was an unnatural dream!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48450">
     The sun set behind the Grange as we turned on to the moors; by that, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48460">
     judged it to be six o'clock; and my companion halted half an hour, to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48470">
     inspect the park, and the gardens, and, probably, the place itself, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48480">
     well as he could; so it was dark when we dismounted in the paved yard of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48490">
     the farm-house, and your old fellow-servant, Joseph, issued out to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48500">
     receive us by the light of a dip candle.  He did it with a courtesy that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48510">
     redounded to his credit.  His first act was to elevate his torch to a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48520">
     level with my face, squint malignantly, project his under-lip, and turn
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48530">
     away.  Then he took the two horses, and led them into the stables;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48540">
     reappearing for the purpose of locking the outer gate, as if we lived in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48550">
     an ancient castle.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48570">
     Heathcliff stayed to speak to him, and I entered the kitchen--a dingy,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48580">
     untidy hole; I daresay you would not know it, it is so changed since it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48590">
     was in your charge.  By the fire stood a ruffianly child, strong in limb
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48600">
     and dirty in garb, with a look of Catherine in his eyes and about his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48610">
     mouth.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48630">
     'This is Edgar's legal nephew,' I reflected--'mine in a manner; I must
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48640">
     shake hands, and--yes--I must kiss him.  It is right to establish a good
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48650">
     understanding at the beginning.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48670">
     I approached, and, attempting to take his chubby fist, said--'How do you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48680">
     do, my dear?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48700">
     He replied in a jargon I did not comprehend.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48720">
     'Shall you and I be friends, Hareton?' was my next essay at conversation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48740">
     An oath, and a threat to set Throttler on me if I did not 'frame off'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48750">
     rewarded my perseverance.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48770">
     'Hey, Throttler, lad!' whispered the little wretch, rousing a half-bred
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48780">
     bull-dog from its lair in a corner.  'Now, wilt thou be ganging?' he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48790">
     asked authoritatively.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48810">
     Love for my life urged a compliance; I stepped over the threshold to wait
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48820">
     till the others should enter.  Mr. Heathcliff was nowhere visible; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48830">
     Joseph, whom I followed to the stables, and requested to accompany me in,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48840">
     after staring and muttering to himself, screwed up his nose and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48850">
     replied--'Mim! mim! mim!  Did iver Christian body hear aught like it?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48860">
     Mincing un' munching!  How can I tell whet ye say?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48880">
     'I say, I wish you to come with me into the house!' I cried, thinking him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48890">
     deaf, yet highly disgusted at his rudeness.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48910">
     'None o' me!  I getten summut else to do,' he answered, and continued his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48920">
     work; moving his lantern jaws meanwhile, and surveying my dress and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48930">
     countenance (the former a great deal too fine, but the latter, I'm sure,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48940">
     as sad as he could desire) with sovereign contempt.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48960">
     I walked round the yard, and through a wicket, to another door, at which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48970">
     I took the liberty of knocking, in hopes some more civil servant might
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48980">
     show himself.  After a short suspense, it was opened by a tall, gaunt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_48990">
     man, without neckerchief, and otherwise extremely slovenly; his features
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49000">
     were lost in masses of shaggy hair that hung on his shoulders; and _his_
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49010">
     eyes, too, were like a ghostly Catherine's with all their beauty
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49020">
     annihilated.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49040">
     'What's your business here?' he demanded, grimly.  'Who are you?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49060">
     'My name was Isabella Linton,' I replied.  'You've seen me before, sir.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49070">
     I'm lately married to Mr. Heathcliff, and he has brought me here--I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49080">
     suppose, by your permission.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49100">
     'Is he come back, then?' asked the hermit, glaring like a hungry wolf.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49120">
     'Yes--we came just now,' I said; 'but he left me by the kitchen door; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49130">
     when I would have gone in, your little boy played sentinel over the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49140">
     place, and frightened me off by the help of a bull-dog.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49160">
     'It's well the hellish villain has kept his word!' growled my future
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49170">
     host, searching the darkness beyond me in expectation of discovering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49180">
     Heathcliff; and then he indulged in a soliloquy of execrations, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49190">
     threats of what he would have done had the 'fiend' deceived him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49210">
     I repented having tried this second entrance, and was almost inclined to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49220">
     slip away before he finished cursing, but ere I could execute that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49230">
     intention, he ordered me in, and shut and re-fastened the door.  There
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49240">
     was a great fire, and that was all the light in the huge apartment, whose
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49250">
     floor had grown a uniform grey; and the once brilliant pewter-dishes,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49260">
     which used to attract my gaze when I was a girl, partook of a similar
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49270">
     obscurity, created by tarnish and dust.  I inquired whether I might call
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49280">
     the maid, and be conducted to a bedroom!  Mr. Earnshaw vouchsafed no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49290">
     answer.  He walked up and down, with his hands in his pockets, apparently
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49300">
     quite forgetting my presence; and his abstraction was evidently so deep,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49310">
     and his whole aspect so misanthropical, that I shrank from disturbing him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49320">
     again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49340">
     You'll not be surprised, Ellen, at my feeling particularly cheerless,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49350">
     seated in worse than solitude on that inhospitable hearth, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49360">
     remembering that four miles distant lay my delightful home, containing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49370">
     the only people I loved on earth; and there might as well be the

     Atlantic to part us, instead of those four miles: I could not overpass
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49390">
     them! I questioned with myself--where must I turn for comfort? and--mind
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49400">
     you don't tell Edgar, or Catherine--above every sorrow beside, this rose
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49410">
     pre-eminent: despair at finding nobody who could or would be my ally
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49420">
     against Heathcliff! I had sought shelter at Wuthering Heights, almost
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49430">
     gladly, because I was secured by that arrangement from living alone with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49440">
     him; but he knew the people we were coming amongst, and he did not fear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49450">
     their intermeddling.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49470">
     I sat and thought a doleful time: the clock struck eight, and nine, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49480">
     still my companion paced to and fro, his head bent on his breast, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49490">
     perfectly silent, unless a groan or a bitter ejaculation forced itself
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49500">
     out at intervals.  I listened to detect a woman's voice in the house, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49510">
     filled the interim with wild regrets and dismal anticipations, which, at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49520">
     last, spoke audibly in irrepressible sighing and weeping.  I was not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49530">
     aware how openly I grieved, till Earnshaw halted opposite, in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49540">
     measured walk, and gave me a stare of newly-awakened surprise.  Taking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49550">
     advantage of his recovered attention, I exclaimed--'I'm tired with my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49560">
     journey, and I want to go to bed!  Where is the maid-servant?  Direct me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49570">
     to her, as she won't come to me!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49590">
     'We have none,' he answered; 'you must wait on yourself!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49610">
     'Where must I sleep, then?' I sobbed; I was beyond regarding
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49620">
     self-respect, weighed down by fatigue and wretchedness.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49640">
     'Joseph will show you Heathcliff's chamber,' said he; 'open that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49650">
     door--he's in there.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49670">
     I was going to obey, but he suddenly arrested me, and added in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49680">
     strangest tone--'Be so good as to turn your lock, and draw your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49690">
     bolt--don't omit it!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49710">
     'Well!' I said.  'But why, Mr. Earnshaw?'  I did not relish the notion of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49720">
     deliberately fastening myself in with Heathcliff.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49740">
     'Look here!' he replied, pulling from his waistcoat a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49750">
     curiously-constructed pistol, having a double-edged spring knife attached
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49760">
     to the barrel.  'That's a great tempter to a desperate man, is it not?  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49770">
     cannot resist going up with this every night, and trying his door.  If
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49780">
     once I find it open he's done for; I do it invariably, even though the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49790">
     minute before I have been recalling a hundred reasons that should make me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49800">
     refrain: it is some devil that urges me to thwart my own schemes by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49810">
     killing him.  You fight against that devil for love as long as you may;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49820">
     when the time comes, not all the angels in heaven shall save him!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49840">
     I surveyed the weapon inquisitively.  A hideous notion struck me: how
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49850">
     powerful I should be possessing such an instrument!  I took it from his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49860">
     hand, and touched the blade.  He looked astonished at the expression my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49870">
     face assumed during a brief second: it was not horror, it was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49880">
     covetousness.  He snatched the pistol back, jealously; shut the knife,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49890">
     and returned it to its concealment.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49910">
     'I don't care if you tell him,' said he.  'Put him on his guard, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49920">
     watch for him.  You know the terms we are on, I see: his danger does not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49930">
     shock you.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49950">
     'What has Heathcliff done to you?' I asked.  'In what has he wronged you,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49960">
     to warrant this appalling hatred?  Wouldn't it be wiser to bid him quit
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49970">
     the house?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_49990">
     'No!' thundered Earnshaw; 'should he offer to leave me, he's a dead man:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50000">
     persuade him to attempt it, and you are a murderess!  Am I to lose _all_,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50010">
     without a chance of retrieval?  Is Hareton to be a beggar?  Oh,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50020">
     damnation!  I _will_ have it back; and I'll have _his_ gold too; and then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50030">
     his blood; and hell shall have his soul!  It will be ten times blacker
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50040">
     with that guest than ever it was before!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50060">
     You've acquainted me, Ellen, with your old master's habits.  He is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50070">
     clearly on the verge of madness: he was so last night at least.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50080">
     shuddered to be near him, and thought on the servant's ill-bred
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50090">
     moroseness as comparatively agreeable.  He now recommenced his moody
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50100">
     walk, and I raised the latch, and escaped into the kitchen.  Joseph was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50110">
     bending over the fire, peering into a large pan that swung above it; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50120">
     a wooden bowl of oatmeal stood on the settle close by.  The contents of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50130">
     the pan began to boil, and he turned to plunge his hand into the bowl; I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50140">
     conjectured that this preparation was probably for our supper, and, being
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50150">
     hungry, I resolved it should be eatable; so, crying out sharply, '_I'll_
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50160">
     make the porridge!'  I removed the vessel out of his reach, and proceeded
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50170">
     to take off my hat and riding-habit.  'Mr. Earnshaw,' I continued,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50180">
     'directs me to wait on myself: I will.  I'm not going to act the lady
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50190">
     among you, for fear I should starve.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50210">
     'Gooid Lord!' he muttered, sitting down, and stroking his ribbed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50220">
     stockings from the knee to the ankle.  'If there's to be fresh
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50230">
     ortherings--just when I getten used to two maisters, if I mun hev' a

     it's nigh at hand!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50280">
     This lamentation drew no notice from me: I went briskly to work, sighing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50290">
     to remember a period when it would have been all merry fun; but compelled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50300">
     speedily to drive off the remembrance.  It racked me to recall past
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50310">
     happiness and the greater peril there was of conjuring up its apparition,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50320">
     the quicker the thible ran round, and the faster the handfuls of meal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50330">
     fell into the water.  Joseph beheld my style of cookery with growing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50340">
     indignation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50360">
     'Thear!' he ejaculated.  'Hareton, thou willn't sup thy porridge
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50370">
     to-neeght; they'll be naught but lumps as big as my neive.  Thear, agean!

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50380">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50400">
     deaved out!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50420">
     It _was_ rather a rough mess, I own, when poured into the basins; four
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50430">
     had been provided, and a gallon pitcher of new milk was brought from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50440">
     dairy, which Hareton seized and commenced drinking and spilling from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50450">
     expansive lip.  I expostulated, and desired that he should have his in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50460">
     mug; affirming that I could not taste the liquid treated so dirtily.  The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50470">
     old cynic chose to be vastly offended at this nicety; assuring me,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50480">
     repeatedly, that 'the barn was every bit as good' as I, 'and every bit as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50490">
     wollsome,' and wondering how I could fashion to be so conceited.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50500">
     Meanwhile, the infant ruffian continued sucking; and glowered up at me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50510">
     defyingly, as he slavered into the jug.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50530">
     'I shall have my supper in another room,' I said.  'Have you no place you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50540">
     call a parlour?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50560">
     '_Parlour_!' he echoed, sneeringly, '_parlour_!  Nay, we've noa

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50600">
     'Then I shall go up-stairs,' I answered; 'show me a chamber.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50620">
     I put my basin on a tray, and went myself to fetch some more milk.  With
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50630">
     great grumblings, the fellow rose, and preceded me in my ascent: we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50640">
     mounted to the garrets; he opened a door, now and then, to look into the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50650">
     apartments we passed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50670">
     'Here's a rahm,' he said, at last, flinging back a cranky board on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50680">
     hinges.  'It's weel eneugh to ate a few porridge in.  There's a pack o'

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50720">
     The 'rahm' was a kind of lumber-hole smelling strong of malt and grain;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50730">
     various sacks of which articles were piled around, leaving a wide, bare
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50740">
     space in the middle.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50760">
     'Why, man,' I exclaimed, facing him angrily, 'this is not a place to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50770">
     sleep in.  I wish to see my bed-room.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50790">
     '_Bed-rume_!' he repeated, in a tone of mockery. 'Yah's see all t'

     _bed-rumes_ thear is--yon's mine.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50820">
     He pointed into the second garret, only differing from the first in being
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50830">
     more naked about the walls, and having a large, low, curtainless bed,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50840">
     with an indigo-coloured quilt, at one end.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50860">
     'What do I want with yours?' I retorted.  'I suppose Mr. Heathcliff does

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50870">
     not lodge at the top of the house, does he?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50890">
     'Oh! it's Maister _Hathecliff's_ ye're wanting?' cried he, as if making a

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_50940">
     'You've a nice house, Joseph,' I could not refrain from observing, 'and

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51070">
     vallances hung in festoons, wrenched from their rings, and the iron rod
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51080">
     supporting them was bent in an arc on one side, causing the drapery to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51090">
     trail upon the floor.  The chairs were also damaged, many of them
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51100">
     severely; and deep indentations deformed the panels of the walls.  I was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51110">
     endeavouring to gather resolution for entering and taking possession,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51120">
     when my fool of a guide announced,--'This here is t' maister's.'  My
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51130">
     supper by this time was cold, my appetite gone, and my patience
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51140">
     exhausted.  I insisted on being provided instantly with a place of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51150">
     refuge, and means of repose.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51170">
     'Whear the divil?' began the religious elder.  'The Lord bless us!  The

     Lord forgie us!  Whear the _hell_ wold ye gang? ye marred, wearisome

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51220">
     I was so vexed, I flung my tray and its contents on the ground; and then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51230">
     seated myself at the stairs'-head, hid my face in my hands, and cried.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51250">
     'Ech! ech!' exclaimed Joseph.  'Weel done, Miss Cathy! weel done, Miss
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51260">
     Cathy!  Howsiver, t' maister sall just tum'le o'er them brooken pots; un'

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51330">
     And so he went on scolding to his den beneath, taking the candle with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51340">
     him; and I remained in the dark. The period of reflection succeeding
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51350">
     this silly action compelled me to admit the necessity of smothering my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51360">
     pride and choking my wrath, and bestirring myself to remove its effects.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51370">
     An unexpected aid presently appeared in the shape of Throttler, whom I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51380">
     now recognised as a son of our old Skulker: it had spent its whelphood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51390">
     at the Grange, and was given by my father to Mr. Hindley. I fancy it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51400">
     knew me: it pushed its nose against mine by way of salute, and then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51410">
     hastened to devour the porridge; while I groped from step to step,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51420">
     collecting the shattered earthenware, and drying the spatters of milk
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51430">
     from the banister with my pocket-handkerchief. Our labours were scarcely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51440">
     over when I heard Earnshaw's tread in the passage; my assistant tucked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51450">
     in his tail, and pressed to the wall; I stole into the nearest doorway.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51460">
     The dog's endeavour to avoid him was unsuccessful; as I guessed by a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51470">
     scutter down-stairs, and a prolonged, piteous yelping. I had better
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51480">
     luck: he passed on, entered his chamber, and shut the door. Directly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51490">
     after Joseph came up with Hareton, to put him to bed. I had found
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51500">
     shelter in Hareton's room, and the old man, on seeing me, said,--'They's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51510">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51550">
     Gladly did I take advantage of this intimation; and the minute I flung
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51560">
     myself into a chair, by the fire, I nodded, and slept.  My slumber was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51570">
     deep and sweet, though over far too soon.  Mr. Heathcliff awoke me; he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51580">
     had just come in, and demanded, in his loving manner, what I was doing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51590">
     there?  I told him the cause of my staying up so late--that he had the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51600">
     key of our room in his pocket.  The adjective _our_ gave mortal offence.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51610">
     He swore it was not, nor ever should be, mine; and he'd--but I'll not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51620">
     repeat his language, nor describe his habitual conduct: he is ingenious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51630">
     and unresting in seeking to gain my abhorrence!  I sometimes wonder at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51640">
     him with an intensity that deadens my fear: yet, I assure you, a tiger or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51650">
     a venomous serpent could not rouse terror in me equal to that which he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51660">
     wakens.  He told me of Catherine's illness, and accused my brother of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51670">
     causing it promising that I should be Edgar's proxy in suffering, till he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51680">
     could get hold of him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51700">
     I do hate him--I am wretched--I have been a fool!  Beware of uttering one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51710">
     breath of this to any one at the Grange.  I shall expect you every

     CHAPTER XIV
    </head>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51790">
     As soon as I had perused this epistle I went to the master, and informed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51800">
     him that his sister had arrived at the Heights, and sent me a letter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51810">
     expressing her sorrow for Mrs. Linton's situation, and her ardent desire
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51820">
     to see him; with a wish that he would transmit to her, as early as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51830">
     possible, some token of forgiveness by me.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51850">
     'Forgiveness!' said Linton.  'I have nothing to forgive her, Ellen.  You
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51860">
     may call at Wuthering Heights this afternoon, if you like, and say that I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51870">
     am not angry, but I'm sorry to have lost her; especially as I can never
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51880">
     think she'll be happy.  It is out of the question my going to see her,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51890">
     however: we are eternally divided; and should she really wish to oblige
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51900">
     me, let her persuade the villain she has married to leave the country.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51920">
     'And you won't write her a little note, sir?' I asked, imploringly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51940">
     'No,' he answered.  'It is needless.  My communication with Heathcliff's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51950">
     family shall be as sparing as his with mine.  It shall not exist!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51970">
     Mr. Edgar's coldness depressed me exceedingly; and all the way from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51980">
     Grange I puzzled my brains how to put more heart into what he said, when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_51990">
     I repeated it; and how to soften his refusal of even a few lines to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52000">
     console Isabella. I daresay she had been on the watch for me since
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52010">
     morning: I saw her looking through the lattice as I came up the garden
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52020">
     causeway, and I nodded to her; but she drew back, as if afraid of being
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52030">
     observed. I entered without knocking. There never was such a dreary,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52040">
     dismal scene as the formerly cheerful house presented! I must confess,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52050">
     that if I had been in the young lady's place, I would, at least, have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52060">
     swept the hearth, and wiped the tables with a duster. But she already
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52070">
     partook of the pervading spirit of neglect which encompassed her. Her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52080">
     pretty face was wan and listless; her hair uncurled: some locks hanging
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52090">
     lankly down, and some carelessly twisted round her head. Probably she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52100">
     had not touched her dress since yester evening. Hindley was not there.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52110">
     Mr. Heathcliff sat at a table, turning over some papers in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52120">
     pocket-book; but he rose when I appeared, asked me how I did, quite
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52130">
     friendly, and offered me a chair. He was the only thing there that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52140">
     seemed decent; and I thought he never looked better. So much had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52150">
     circumstances altered their positions, that he would certainly have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52160">
     struck a stranger as a born and bred gentleman; and his wife as a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52170">
     thorough little slattern! She came forward eagerly to greet me, and held
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52180">
     out one hand to take the expected letter. I shook my head. She wouldn't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52190">
     understand the hint, but followed me to a sideboard, where I went to lay
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52200">
     my bonnet, and importuned me in a whisper to give her directly what I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52210">
     had brought. Heathcliff guessed the meaning of her manoeuvres, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52220">
     said--'If you have got anything for Isabella (as no doubt you have,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52230">
     Nelly), give it to her. You needn't make a secret of it: we have no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52240">
     secrets between us.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52260">
     'Oh, I have nothing,' I replied, thinking it best to speak the truth at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52270">
     once.  'My master bid me tell his sister that she must not expect either
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52280">
     a letter or a visit from him at present.  He sends his love, ma'am, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52290">
     his wishes for your happiness, and his pardon for the grief you have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52300">
     occasioned; but he thinks that after this time his household and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52310">
     household here should drop intercommunication, as nothing could come of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52320">
     keeping it up.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52340">
     Mrs. Heathcliff's lip quivered slightly, and she returned to her seat in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52350">
     the window.  Her husband took his stand on the hearthstone, near me, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52360">
     began to put questions concerning Catherine.  I told him as much as I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52370">
     thought proper of her illness, and he extorted from me, by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52380">
     cross-examination, most of the facts connected with its origin.  I blamed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52390">
     her, as she deserved, for bringing it all on herself; and ended by hoping
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52400">
     that he would follow Mr. Linton's example and avoid future interference
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52410">
     with his family, for good or evil.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52430">
     'Mrs. Linton is now just recovering,' I said; 'she'll never be like she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52440">
     was, but her life is spared; and if you really have a regard for her,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52450">
     you'll shun crossing her way again: nay, you'll move out of this country
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52460">
     entirely; and that you may not regret it, I'll inform you Catherine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52470">
     Linton is as different now from your old friend Catherine Earnshaw, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52480">
     that young lady is different from me.  Her appearance is changed greatly,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52490">
     her character much more so; and the person who is compelled, of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52500">
     necessity, to be her companion, will only sustain his affection hereafter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52510">
     by the remembrance of what she once was, by common humanity, and a sense
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52520">
     of duty!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52540">
     'That is quite possible,' remarked Heathcliff, forcing himself to seem
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52550">
     calm: 'quite possible that your master should have nothing but common
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52560">
     humanity and a sense of duty to fall back upon.  But do you imagine that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52570">
     I shall leave Catherine to his _duty_ and _humanity_? and can you compare
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52580">
     my feelings respecting Catherine to his?  Before you leave this house, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52590">
     must exact a promise from you that you'll get me an interview with her:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52600">
     consent, or refuse, I _will_ see her!  What do you say?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52620">
     'I say, Mr. Heathcliff,' I replied, 'you must not: you never shall,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52630">
     through my means.  Another encounter between you and the master would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52640">
     kill her altogether.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52660">
     'With your aid that may be avoided,' he continued; 'and should there be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52670">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52680">
     trouble more to her existence--why, I think I shall be justified in going
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52690">
     to extremes!  I wish you had sincerity enough to tell me whether
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52700">
     Catherine would suffer greatly from his loss: the fear that she would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52710">
     restrains me.  And there you see the distinction between our feelings:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52720">
     had he been in my place, and I in his, though I hated him with a hatred
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52730">
     that turned my life to gall, I never would have raised a hand against
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52740">
     him.  You may look incredulous, if you please!  I never would have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52750">
     banished him from her society as long as she desired his.  The moment her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52760">
     regard ceased, I would have torn his heart out, and drunk his blood!  But,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52770">
     till then--if you don't believe me, you don't know me--till then, I would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52780">
     have died by inches before I touched a single hair of his head!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52800">
     'And yet,' I interrupted, 'you have no scruples in completely ruining all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52810">
     hopes of her perfect restoration, by thrusting yourself into her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52820">
     remembrance now, when she has nearly forgotten you, and involving her in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52830">
     a new tumult of discord and distress.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52850">
     'You suppose she has nearly forgotten me?' he said.  'Oh, Nelly! you know
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52860">
     she has not!  You know as well as I do, that for every thought she spends
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52870">
     on Linton she spends a thousand on me!  At a most miserable period of my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52880">
     life, I had a notion of the kind: it haunted me on my return to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52890">
     neighbourhood last summer; but only her own assurance could make me admit
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52900">
     the horrible idea again.  And then, Linton would be nothing, nor Hindley,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52910">
     nor all the dreams that ever I dreamt.  Two words would comprehend my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52920">
     future--_death_ and _hell_: existence, after losing her, would be hell.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52930">
     Yet I was a fool to fancy for a moment that she valued Edgar Linton's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52940">
     attachment more than mine.  If he loved with all the powers of his puny
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52950">
     being, he couldn't love as much in eighty years as I could in a day.  And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52960">
     Catherine has a heart as deep as I have: the sea could be as readily
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52970">
     contained in that horse-trough as her whole affection be monopolised by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52980">
     him.  Tush!  He is scarcely a degree dearer to her than her dog, or her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_52990">
     horse.  It is not in him to be loved like me: how can she love in him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53000">
     what he has not?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53020">
     'Catherine and Edgar are as fond of each other as any two people can be,'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53030">
     cried Isabella, with sudden vivacity.  'No one has a right to talk in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53040">
     that manner, and I won't hear my brother depreciated in silence!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53060">
     'Your brother is wondrous fond of you too, isn't he?' observed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53070">
     Heathcliff, scornfully.  'He turns you adrift on the world with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53080">
     surprising alacrity.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53100">
     'He is not aware of what I suffer,' she replied.  'I didn't tell him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53110">
     that.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53130">
     'You have been telling him something, then: you have written, have you?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53150">
     'To say that I was married, I did write--you saw the note.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53170">
     'And nothing since?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53190">
     'No.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53210">
     'My young lady is looking sadly the worse for her change of condition,' I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53220">
     remarked.  'Somebody's love comes short in her case, obviously; whose, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53230">
     may guess; but, perhaps, I shouldn't say.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53250">
     'I should guess it was her own,' said Heathcliff.  'She degenerates into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53260">
     a mere slut!  She is tired of trying to please me uncommonly early.  You'd
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53270">
     hardly credit it, but the very morrow of our wedding she was weeping to

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53280">
     go home.  However, she'll suit this house so much the better for not

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53290">
     being over nice, and I'll take care she does not disgrace me by rambling

     abroad.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53320">
     'Well, sir,' returned I, 'I hope you'll consider that Mrs. Heathcliff is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53330">
     accustomed to be looked after and waited on; and that she has been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53340">
     brought up like an only daughter, whom every one was ready to serve.  You
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53350">
     must let her have a maid to keep things tidy about her, and you must
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53360">
     treat her kindly.  Whatever be your notion of Mr. Edgar, you cannot doubt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53370">
     that she has a capacity for strong attachments, or she wouldn't have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53380">
     abandoned the elegancies, and comforts, and friends of her former home,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53390">
     to fix contentedly, in such a wilderness as this, with you.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53410">
     'She abandoned them under a delusion,' he answered; 'picturing in me a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53420">
     hero of romance, and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53430">
     devotion.  I can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53440">
     so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53450">
     character and acting on the false impressions she cherished.  But, at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53460">
     last, I think she begins to know me: I don't perceive the silly smiles
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53470">
     and grimaces that provoked me at first; and the senseless incapability of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53480">
     discerning that I was in earnest when I gave her my opinion of her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53490">
     infatuation and herself.  It was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53500">
     discover that I did not love her.  I believed, at one time, no lessons
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53510">
     could teach her that!  And yet it is poorly learnt; for this morning she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53520">
     announced, as a piece of appalling intelligence, that I had actually
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53530">
     succeeded in making her hate me!  A positive labour of Hercules, I assure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53540">
     you!  If it be achieved, I have cause to return thanks.  Can I trust your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53550">
     assertion, Isabella?  Are you sure you hate me?  If I let you alone for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53560">
     half a day, won't you come sighing and wheedling to me again?  I daresay
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53570">
     she would rather I had seemed all tenderness before you: it wounds her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53580">
     vanity to have the truth exposed.  But I don't care who knows that the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53590">
     passion was wholly on one side: and I never told her a lie about it.  She
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53600">
     cannot accuse me of showing one bit of deceitful softness.  The first
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53610">
     thing she saw me do, on coming out of the Grange, was to hang up her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53620">
     little dog; and when she pleaded for it, the first words I uttered were a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53630">
     wish that I had the hanging of every being belonging to her, except one:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53640">
     possibly she took that exception for herself.  But no brutality disgusted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53650">
     her: I suppose she has an innate admiration of it, if only her precious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53660">
     person were secure from injury!  Now, was it not the depth of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53670">
     absurdity--of genuine idiotcy, for that pitiful, slavish, mean-minded
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53680">
     brach to dream that I could love her?  Tell your master, Nelly, that I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53690">
     never, in all my life, met with such an abject thing as she is.  She even
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53700">
     disgraces the name of Linton; and I've sometimes relented, from pure lack
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53710">
     of invention, in my experiments on what she could endure, and still creep
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53720">
     shamefully cringing back!  But tell him, also, to set his fraternal and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53730">
     magisterial heart at ease: that I keep strictly within the limits of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53740">
     law.  I have avoided, up to this period, giving her the slightest right
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53750">
     to claim a separation; and, what's more, she'd thank nobody for dividing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53760">
     us.  If she desired to go, she might: the nuisance of her presence
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53770">
     outweighs the gratification to be derived from tormenting her!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53790">
     'Mr. Heathcliff,' said I, 'this is the talk of a madman; your wife, most
    </p>

     likely, is convinced you are mad; and, for that reason, she has borne
    </p>

     with you hitherto: but now that you say she may go, she'll doubtless
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53820">
     avail herself of the permission.  You are not so bewitched, ma'am, are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53830">
     you, as to remain with him of your own accord?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53850">
     'Take care, Ellen!' answered Isabella, her eyes sparkling irefully; there
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53860">
     was no misdoubting by their expression the full success of her partner's

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53900">
     not repeat it!  Only, Ellen, promise you'll not mention a syllable of his

     married me on purpose to obtain power over him; and he sha'n't obtain

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53940">
     it--I'll die first!  I just hope, I pray, that he may forget his

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53950">
     diabolical prudence and kill me!  The single pleasure I can imagine is to
    </p>

     die, or to see him dead!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_53980">
     'There--that will do for the present!' said Heathcliff.  'If you are

     I, being your legal protector, must retain you in my custody, however

     distasteful the obligation may be.  Go up-stairs; I have something to say

     Why, this is the road upstairs, child!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54070">
     He seized, and thrust her from the room; and returned muttering--'I have

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54270">
     wouldn't it be better to prevent my coming in contact with them, or their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54280">
     master?  And you could do it so easily.  I'd warn you when I came, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54290">
     then you might let me in unobserved, as soon as she was alone, and watch
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54300">
     till I departed, your conscience quite calm: you would be hindering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54310">
     mischief.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54330">
     I protested against playing that treacherous part in my employer's house:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54340">
     and, besides, I urged the cruelty and selfishness of his destroying Mrs.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54350">
     Linton's tranquillity for his satisfaction.  'The commonest occurrence
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54360">
     startles her painfully,' I said.  'She's all nerves, and she couldn't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54370">
     bear the surprise, I'm positive.  Don't persist, sir! or else I shall be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54380">
     obliged to inform my master of your designs; and he'll take measures to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54390">
     secure his house and its inmates from any such unwarrantable intrusions!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54410">
     'In that case I'll take measures to secure you, woman!' exclaimed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54420">
     Heathcliff; 'you shall not leave Wuthering Heights till to-morrow
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54430">
     morning.  It is a foolish story to assert that Catherine could not bear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54440">
     to see me; and as to surprising her, I don't desire it: you must prepare
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54450">
     her--ask her if I may come.  You say she never mentions my name, and that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54460">
     I am never mentioned to her.  To whom should she mention me if I am a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54470">
     forbidden topic in the house?  She thinks you are all spies for her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54480">
     husband.  Oh, I've no doubt she's in hell among you!  I guess by her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54490">
     silence, as much as anything, what she feels.  You say she is often
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54500">
     restless, and anxious-looking: is that a proof of tranquillity?  You talk
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54510">
     of her mind being unsettled.  How the devil could it be otherwise in her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54520">
     frightful isolation?  And that insipid, paltry creature attending her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54530">
     from _duty_ and _humanity_!  From _pity_ and _charity_!  He might as well
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54540">
     plant an oak in a flower-pot, and expect it to thrive, as imagine he can
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54550">
     restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares?  Let us settle it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54560">
     at once: will you stay here, and am I to fight my way to Catherine over
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54570">
     Linton and his footman?  Or will you be my friend, as you have been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54580">
     hitherto, and do what I request?  Decide! because there is no reason for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54590">
     my lingering another minute, if you persist in your stubborn ill-nature!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54610">
     Well, Mr. Lockwood, I argued and complained, and flatly refused him fifty
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54620">
     times; but in the long run he forced me to an agreement.  I engaged to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54630">
     carry a letter from him to my mistress; and should she consent, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54640">
     promised to let him have intelligence of Linton's next absence from home,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54650">
     when he might come, and get in as he was able: I wouldn't be there, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54660">
     my fellow-servants should be equally out of the way.  Was it right or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54670">
     wrong?  I fear it was wrong, though expedient.  I thought I prevented
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54680">
     another explosion by my compliance; and I thought, too, it might create a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54690">
     favourable crisis in Catherine's mental illness: and then I remembered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54700">
     Mr. Edgar's stern rebuke of my carrying tales; and I tried to smooth away
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54710">
     all disquietude on the subject, by affirming, with frequent iteration,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54720">
     that that betrayal of trust, if it merited so harsh an appellation,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54730">
     should be the last.  Notwithstanding, my journey homeward was sadder than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54740">
     my journey thither; and many misgivings I had, ere I could prevail on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54750">
     myself to put the missive into Mrs. Linton's hand.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54770">
     But here is Kenneth; I'll go down, and tell him how much better you are.

     My history is _dree_, as we say, and will serve to while away another

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54810">
     Dree, and dreary!  I reflected as the good woman descended to receive the

     doctor: and not exactly of the kind which I should have chosen to amuse
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54830">
     me.  But never mind!  I'll extract wholesome medicines from Mrs. Dean's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54840">
     bitter herbs; and firstly, let me beware of the fascination that lurks in

     Another week over--and I am so many days nearer health, and spring!  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54950">
     have now heard all my neighbour's history, at different sittings, as the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54960">
     housekeeper could spare time from more important occupations.  I'll
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54970">
     continue it in her own words, only a little condensed.  She is, on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_54980">
     whole, a very fair narrator, and I don't think I could improve her style.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55000">
     In the evening, she said, the evening of my visit to the Heights, I knew,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55010">
     as well as if I saw him, that Mr. Heathcliff was about the place; and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55020">
     shunned going out, because I still carried his letter in my pocket, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55030">
     didn't want to be threatened or teased any more.  I had made up my mind
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55040">
     not to give it till my master went somewhere, as I could not guess how
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55050">
     its receipt would affect Catherine.  The consequence was, that it did not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55060">
     reach her before the lapse of three days.  The fourth was Sunday, and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55070">
     brought it into her room after the family were gone to church.  There was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55080">
     a manservant left to keep the house with me, and we generally made a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55090">
     practice of locking the doors during the hours of service; but on that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55100">
     occasion the weather was so warm and pleasant that I set them wide open,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55110">
     and, to fulfil my engagement, as I knew who would be coming, I told my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55120">
     companion that the mistress wished very much for some oranges, and he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55130">
     must run over to the village and get a few, to be paid for on the morrow.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55140">
     He departed, and I went up-stairs.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55160">
     Mrs. Linton sat in a loose white dress, with a light shawl over her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55170">
     shoulders, in the recess of the open window, as usual.  Her thick, long
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55180">
     hair had been partly removed at the beginning of her illness, and now she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55190">
     wore it simply combed in its natural tresses over her temples and neck.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55200">
     Her appearance was altered, as I had told Heathcliff; but when she was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55210">
     calm, there seemed unearthly beauty in the change.  The flash of her eyes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55220">
     had been succeeded by a dreamy and melancholy softness; they no longer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55230">
     gave the impression of looking at the objects around her: they appeared
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55240">
     always to gaze beyond, and far beyond--you would have said out of this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55250">
     world.  Then, the paleness of her face--its haggard aspect having
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55260">
     vanished as she recovered flesh--and the peculiar expression arising from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55270">
     her mental state, though painfully suggestive of their causes, added to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55280">
     the touching interest which she awakened; and--invariably to me, I know,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55290">
     and to any person who saw her, I should think--refuted more tangible
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55300">
     proofs of convalescence, and stamped her as one doomed to decay.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55320">
     A book lay spread on the sill before her, and the scarcely perceptible
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55330">
     wind fluttered its leaves at intervals.  I believe Linton had laid it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55340">
     there: for she never endeavoured to divert herself with reading, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55350">
     occupation of any kind, and he would spend many an hour in trying to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55360">
     entice her attention to some subject which had formerly been her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55370">
     amusement.  She was conscious of his aim, and in her better moods endured
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55380">
     his efforts placidly, only showing their uselessness by now and then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55390">
     suppressing a wearied sigh, and checking him at last with the saddest of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55400">
     smiles and kisses.  At other times, she would turn petulantly away, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55410">
     hide her face in her hands, or even push him off angrily; and then he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55420">
     took care to let her alone, for he was certain of doing no good.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55440">
     Gimmerton chapel bells were still ringing; and the full, mellow flow of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55450">
     the beck in the valley came soothingly on the ear.  It was a sweet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55460">
     substitute for the yet absent murmur of the summer foliage, which drowned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55470">
     that music about the Grange when the trees were in leaf.  At Wuthering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55480">
     Heights it always sounded on quiet days following a great thaw or a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55490">
     season of steady rain.  And of Wuthering Heights Catherine was thinking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55500">
     as she listened: that is, if she thought or listened at all; but she had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55510">
     the vague, distant look I mentioned before, which expressed no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55520">
     recognition of material things either by ear or eye.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55540">
     'There's a letter for you, Mrs. Linton,' I said, gently inserting it in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55550">
     one hand that rested on her knee.  'You must read it immediately, because
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55560">
     it wants an answer.  Shall I break the seal?'  'Yes,' she answered,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55570">
     without altering the direction of her eyes.  I opened it--it was very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55580">
     short.  'Now,' I continued, 'read it.'  She drew away her hand, and let
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55590">
     it fall.  I replaced it in her lap, and stood waiting till it should
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55600">
     please her to glance down; but that movement was so long delayed that at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55610">
     last I resumed--'Must I read it, ma'am?  It is from Mr. Heathcliff.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55630">
     There was a start and a troubled gleam of recollection, and a struggle to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55640">
     arrange her ideas.  She lifted the letter, and seemed to peruse it; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55650">
     when she came to the signature she sighed: yet still I found she had not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55660">
     gathered its import, for, upon my desiring to hear her reply, she merely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55670">
     pointed to the name, and gazed at me with mournful and questioning
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55680">
     eagerness.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55700">
     'Well, he wishes to see you,' said I, guessing her need of an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55710">
     interpreter.  'He's in the garden by this time, and impatient to know
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55720">
     what answer I shall bring.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55740">
     As I spoke, I observed a large dog lying on the sunny grass beneath raise
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55750">
     its ears as if about to bark, and then smoothing them back, announce, by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55760">
     a wag of the tail, that some one approached whom it did not consider a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55770">
     stranger.  Mrs. Linton bent forward, and listened breathlessly.  The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55780">
     minute after a step traversed the hall; the open house was too tempting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55790">
     for Heathcliff to resist walking in: most likely he supposed that I was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55800">
     inclined to shirk my promise, and so resolved to trust to his own
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55810">
     audacity.  With straining eagerness Catherine gazed towards the entrance
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55820">
     of her chamber.  He did not hit the right room directly: she motioned me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55830">
     to admit him, but he found it out ere I could reach the door, and in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55840">
     stride or two was at her side, and had her grasped in his arms.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55860">
     He neither spoke nor loosed his hold for some five minutes, during which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55870">
     period he bestowed more kisses than ever he gave in his life before, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55880">
     daresay: but then my mistress had kissed him first, and I plainly saw
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55890">
     that he could hardly bear, for downright agony, to look into her face!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55900">
     The same conviction had stricken him as me, from the instant he beheld
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55910">
     her, that there was no prospect of ultimate recovery there--she was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55920">
     fated, sure to die.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55940">
     'Oh, Cathy!  Oh, my life! how can I bear it?' was the first sentence he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55950">
     uttered, in a tone that did not seek to disguise his despair.  And now he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55960">
     stared at her so earnestly that I thought the very intensity of his gaze
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55970">
     would bring tears into his eyes; but they burned with anguish: they did
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_55980">
     not melt.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56000">
     'What now?' said Catherine, leaning back, and returning his look with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56010">
     suddenly clouded brow: her humour was a mere vane for constantly varying
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56020">
     caprices.  'You and Edgar have broken my heart, Heathcliff!  And you both
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56030">
     come to bewail the deed to me, as if you were the people to be pitied!  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56040">
     shall not pity you, not I.  You have killed me--and thriven on it, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56050">
     think.  How strong you are!  How many years do you mean to live after I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56060">
     am gone?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56080">
     Heathcliff had knelt on one knee to embrace her; he attempted to rise,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56090">
     but she seized his hair, and kept him down.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56110">
     'I wish I could hold you,' she continued, bitterly, 'till we were both
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56120">
     dead!  I shouldn't care what you suffered.  I care nothing for your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56130">
     sufferings.  Why shouldn't you suffer?  I do!  Will you forget me?  Will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56140">
     you be happy when I am in the earth?  Will you say twenty years hence,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56150">
     "That's the grave of Catherine Earnshaw?  I loved her long ago, and was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56160">
     wretched to lose her; but it is past.  I've loved many others since: my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56170">
     children are dearer to me than she was; and, at death, I shall not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56180">
     rejoice that I am going to her: I shall be sorry that I must leave
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56190">
     them!"  Will you say so, Heathcliff?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56210">
     'Don't torture me till I'm as mad as yourself,' cried he, wrenching his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56220">
     head free, and grinding his teeth.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56240">
     The two, to a cool spectator, made a strange and fearful picture.  Well
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56250">
     might Catherine deem that heaven would be a land of exile to her, unless
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56260">
     with her mortal body she cast away her moral character also.  Her present
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56270">
     countenance had a wild vindictiveness in its white cheek, and a bloodless
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56280">
     lip and scintillating eye; and she retained in her closed fingers a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56290">
     portion of the locks she had been grasping.  As to her companion, while
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56300">
     raising himself with one hand, he had taken her arm with the other; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56310">
     so inadequate was his stock of gentleness to the requirements of her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56320">
     condition, that on his letting go I saw four distinct impressions left
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56330">
     blue in the colourless skin.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56350">
     'Are you possessed with a devil,' he pursued, savagely, 'to talk in that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56360">
     manner to me when you are dying?  Do you reflect that all those words
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56370">
     will be branded in my memory, and eating deeper eternally after you have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56380">
     left me?  You know you lie to say I have killed you: and, Catherine, you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56390">
     know that I could as soon forget you as my existence!  Is it not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56400">
     sufficient for your infernal selfishness, that while you are at peace I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56410">
     shall writhe in the torments of hell?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56430">
     'I shall not be at peace,' moaned Catherine, recalled to a sense of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56440">
     physical weakness by the violent, unequal throbbing of her heart, which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56450">
     beat visibly and audibly under this excess of agitation.  She said
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56460">
     nothing further till the paroxysm was over; then she continued, more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56470">
     kindly--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56490">
     'I'm not wishing you greater torment than I have, Heathcliff.  I only
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56500">
     wish us never to be parted: and should a word of mine distress you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56510">
     hereafter, think I feel the same distress underground, and for my own
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56520">
     sake, forgive me!  Come here and kneel down again!  You never harmed me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56530">
     in your life.  Nay, if you nurse anger, that will be worse to remember
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56540">
     than my harsh words!  Won't you come here again?  Do!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56560">
     Heathcliff went to the back of her chair, and leant over, but not so far
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56570">
     as to let her see his face, which was livid with emotion.  She bent round
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56580">
     to look at him; he would not permit it: turning abruptly, he walked to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56590">
     the fireplace, where he stood, silent, with his back towards us.  Mrs.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56600">
     Linton's glance followed him suspiciously: every movement woke a new
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56610">
     sentiment in her.  After a pause and a prolonged gaze, she resumed;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56620">
     addressing me in accents of indignant disappointment:--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56640">
     'Oh, you see, Nelly, he would not relent a moment to keep me out of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56650">
     grave.  _That_ is how I'm loved!  Well, never mind.  That is not _my_
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56660">
     Heathcliff.  I shall love mine yet; and take him with me: he's in my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56670">
     soul.  And,' added she musingly, 'the thing that irks me most is this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56680">
     shattered prison, after all.  I'm tired of being enclosed here.  I'm
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56690">
     wearying to escape into that glorious world, and to be always there: not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56700">
     seeing it dimly through tears, and yearning for it through the walls of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56710">
     an aching heart: but really with it, and in it.  Nelly, you think you are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56720">
     better and more fortunate than I; in full health and strength: you are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56730">
     sorry for me--very soon that will be altered.  I shall be sorry for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56740">
     _you_.  I shall be incomparably beyond and above you all.  I _wonder_ he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56750">
     won't be near me!'  She went on to herself.  'I thought he wished it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56760">
     Heathcliff, dear! you should not be sullen now.  Do come to me,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56770">
     Heathcliff.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56790">
     In her eagerness she rose and supported herself on the arm of the chair.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56800">
     At that earnest appeal he turned to her, looking absolutely desperate.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56810">
     His eyes, wide and wet, at last flashed fiercely on her; his breast
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56820">
     heaved convulsively.  An instant they held asunder, and then how they met
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56830">
     I hardly saw, but Catherine made a spring, and he caught her, and they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56840">
     were locked in an embrace from which I thought my mistress would never be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56850">
     released alive: in fact, to my eyes, she seemed directly insensible.  He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56860">
     flung himself into the nearest seat, and on my approaching hurriedly to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56870">
     ascertain if she had fainted, he gnashed at me, and foamed like a mad
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56880">
     dog, and gathered her to him with greedy jealousy.  I did not feel as if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56890">
     I were in the company of a creature of my own species: it appeared that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56900">
     he would not understand, though I spoke to him; so I stood off, and held
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56910">
     my tongue, in great perplexity.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56930">
     A movement of Catherine's relieved me a little presently: she put up her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56940">
     hand to clasp his neck, and bring her cheek to his as he held her; while
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56950">
     he, in return, covering her with frantic caresses, said wildly--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56970">
     'You teach me now how cruel you've been--cruel and false.  _Why_ did you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56980">
     despise me?  _Why_ did you betray your own heart, Cathy?  I have not one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_56990">
     word of comfort.  You deserve this.  You have killed yourself.  Yes, you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57000">
     may kiss me, and cry; and wring out my kisses and tears: they'll blight
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57010">
     you--they'll damn you.  You loved me--then what _right_ had you to leave
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57020">
     me?  What right--answer me--for the poor fancy you felt for Linton?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57030">
     Because misery and degradation, and death, and nothing that God or Satan
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57040">
     could inflict would have parted us, _you_, of your own will, did it.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57050">
     have not broken your heart--_you_ have broken it; and in breaking it, you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57060">
     have broken mine.  So much the worse for me that I am strong.  Do I want
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57070">
     to live?  What kind of living will it be when you--oh, God! would _you_
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57080">
     like to live with your soul in the grave?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57100">
     'Let me alone.  Let me alone,' sobbed Catherine.  'If I've done wrong,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57110">
     I'm dying for it.  It is enough!  You left me too: but I won't upbraid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57120">
     you!  I forgive you.  Forgive me!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57140">
     'It is hard to forgive, and to look at those eyes, and feel those wasted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57150">
     hands,' he answered.  'Kiss me again; and don't let me see your eyes!  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57160">
     forgive what you have done to me.  I love _my_ murderer--but _yours_!  How
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57170">
     can I?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57190">
     They were silent--their faces hid against each other, and washed by each
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57200">
     other's tears.  At least, I suppose the weeping was on both sides; as it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57210">
     seemed Heathcliff could weep on a great occasion like this.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57230">
     I grew very uncomfortable, meanwhile; for the afternoon wore fast away,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57240">
     the man whom I had sent off returned from his errand, and I could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57250">
     distinguish, by the shine of the western sun up the valley, a concourse
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57260">
     thickening outside Gimmerton chapel porch.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57280">
     'Service is over,' I announced.  'My master will be here in half an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57290">
     hour.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57310">
     Heathcliff groaned a curse, and strained Catherine closer: she never
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57320">
     moved.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57340">
     Ere long I perceived a group of the servants passing up the road towards
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57350">
     the kitchen wing.  Mr. Linton was not far behind; he opened the gate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57360">
     himself and sauntered slowly up, probably enjoying the lovely afternoon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57370">
     that breathed as soft as summer.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57390">
     'Now he is here,' I exclaimed.  'For heaven's sake, hurry down!  You'll
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57400">
     not meet any one on the front stairs.  Do be quick; and stay among the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57410">
     trees till he is fairly in.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57430">
     'I must go, Cathy,' said Heathcliff, seeking to extricate himself from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57440">
     his companion's arms.  'But if I live, I'll see you again before you are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57450">
     asleep.  I won't stray five yards from your window.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57470">
     'You must not go!' she answered, holding him as firmly as her strength
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57480">
     allowed.  'You _shall_ not, I tell you.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57500">
     'For one hour,' he pleaded earnestly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57520">
     'Not for one minute,' she replied.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57540">
     'I _must_--Linton will be up immediately,' persisted the alarmed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57550">
     intruder.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57570">
     He would have risen, and unfixed her fingers by the act--she clung fast,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57580">
     gasping: there was mad resolution in her face.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57600">
     'No!' she shrieked.  'Oh, don't, don't go.  It is the last time!  Edgar
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57610">
     will not hurt us.  Heathcliff, I shall die!  I shall die!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57630">
     'Damn the fool!  There he is,' cried Heathcliff, sinking back into his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57640">
     seat.  'Hush, my darling!  Hush, hush, Catherine!  I'll stay.  If he shot
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57650">
     me so, I'd expire with a blessing on my lips.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57670">
     And there they were fast again.  I heard my master mounting the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57680">
     stairs--the cold sweat ran from my forehead: I was horrified.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57700">
     'Are you going to listen to her ravings?' I said, passionately.  'She
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57710">
     does not know what she says.  Will you ruin her, because she has not wit
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57720">
     to help herself?  Get up!  You could be free instantly.  That is the most
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57730">
     diabolical deed that ever you did.  We are all done for--master,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57740">
     mistress, and servant.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57760">
     I wrung my hands, and cried out; and Mr. Linton hastened his step at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57770">
     noise.  In the midst of my agitation, I was sincerely glad to observe
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57780">
     that Catherine's arms had fallen relaxed, and her head hung down.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57800">
     'She's fainted, or dead,' I thought: 'so much the better.  Far better
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57810">
     that she should be dead, than lingering a burden and a misery-maker to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57820">
     all about her.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57840">
     Edgar sprang to his unbidden guest, blanched with astonishment and rage.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57850">
     What he meant to do I cannot tell; however, the other stopped all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57860">
     demonstrations, at once, by placing the lifeless-looking form in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57870">
     arms.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57890">
     'Look there!' he said.  'Unless you be a fiend, help her first--then you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57900">
     shall speak to me!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57920">
     He walked into the parlour, and sat down.  Mr. Linton summoned me, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57930">
     with great difficulty, and after resorting to many means, we managed to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57940">
     restore her to sensation; but she was all bewildered; she sighed, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57950">
     moaned, and knew nobody.  Edgar, in his anxiety for her, forgot her hated
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57960">
     friend.  I did not.  I went, at the earliest opportunity, and besought
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57970">
     him to depart; affirming that Catherine was better, and he should hear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_57980">
     from me in the morning how she passed the night.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58000">
     'I shall not refuse to go out of doors,' he answered; 'but I shall stay
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58010">
     in the garden: and, Nelly, mind you keep your word to-morrow.  I shall be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58020">
     under those larch-trees.  Mind! or I pay another visit, whether Linton be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58030">
     in or not.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58050">
     He sent a rapid glance through the half-open door of the chamber, and,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58060">
     ascertaining that what I stated was apparently true, delivered the house
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58070">
     of his luckless presence.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58140">
     About twelve o'clock that night was born the Catherine you saw at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58150">
     Wuthering Heights: a puny, seven-months' child; and two hours after the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58160">
     mother died, having never recovered sufficient consciousness to miss
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58170">
     Heathcliff, or know Edgar.  The latter's distraction at his bereavement
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58180">
     is a subject too painful to be dwelt on; its after-effects showed how
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58190">
     deep the sorrow sunk.  A great addition, in my eyes, was his being left
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58200">
     without an heir.  I bemoaned that, as I gazed on the feeble orphan; and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58210">
     mentally abused old Linton for (what was only natural partiality) the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58220">
     securing his estate to his own daughter, instead of his son's.  An
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58230">
     unwelcomed infant it was, poor thing!  It might have wailed out of life,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58240">
     and nobody cared a morsel, during those first hours of existence.  We
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58250">
     redeemed the neglect afterwards; but its beginning was as friendless as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58260">
     its end is likely to be.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58280">
     Next morning--bright and cheerful out of doors--stole softened in through
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58290">
     the blinds of the silent room, and suffused the couch and its occupant
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58300">
     with a mellow, tender glow.  Edgar Linton had his head laid on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58310">
     pillow, and his eyes shut.  His young and fair features were almost as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58320">
     deathlike as those of the form beside him, and almost as fixed: but _his_
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58330">
     was the hush of exhausted anguish, and _hers_ of perfect peace.  Her brow
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58340">
     smooth, her lids closed, her lips wearing the expression of a smile; no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58350">
     angel in heaven could be more beautiful than she appeared.  And I partook
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58360">
     of the infinite calm in which she lay: my mind was never in a holier
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58370">
     frame than while I gazed on that untroubled image of Divine rest.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58380">
     instinctively echoed the words she had uttered a few hours before:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58390">
     'Incomparably beyond and above us all!  Whether still on earth or now in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58400">
     heaven, her spirit is at home with God!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58420">
     I don't know if it be a peculiarity in me, but I am seldom otherwise than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58430">
     happy while watching in the chamber of death, should no frenzied or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58440">
     despairing mourner share the duty with me.  I see a repose that neither
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58450">
     earth nor hell can break, and I feel an assurance of the endless and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58460">
     shadowless hereafter--the Eternity they have entered--where life is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58470">
     boundless in its duration, and love in its sympathy, and joy in its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58480">
     fulness.  I noticed on that occasion how much selfishness there is even
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58490">
     in a love like Mr. Linton's, when he so regretted Catherine's blessed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58500">
     release!  To be sure, one might have doubted, after the wayward and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58510">
     impatient existence she had led, whether she merited a haven of peace at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58520">
     last.  One might doubt in seasons of cold reflection; but not then, in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58530">
     the presence of her corpse.  It asserted its own tranquillity, which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58540">
     seemed a pledge of equal quiet to its former inhabitant.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58560">
     Do you believe such people are happy in the other world, sir?  I'd give a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58570">
     great deal to know.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58590">
     I declined answering Mrs. Dean's question, which struck me as something
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58600">
     heterodox.  She proceeded:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58620">
     Retracing the course of Catherine Linton, I fear we have no right to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58630">
     think she is; but we'll leave her with her Maker.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58650">
     The master looked asleep, and I ventured soon after sunrise to quit the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58660">
     room and steal out to the pure refreshing air.  The servants thought me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58670">
     gone to shake off the drowsiness of my protracted watch; in reality, my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58680">
     chief motive was seeing Mr. Heathcliff.  If he had remained among the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58690">
     larches all night, he would have heard nothing of the stir at the Grange;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58700">
     unless, perhaps, he might catch the gallop of the messenger going to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58710">
     Gimmerton.  If he had come nearer, he would probably be aware, from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58720">
     lights flitting to and fro, and the opening and shutting of the outer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58730">
     doors, that all was not right within.  I wished, yet feared, to find him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58740">
     I felt the terrible news must be told, and I longed to get it over; but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58750">
     how to do it I did not know.  He was there--at least, a few yards further
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58760">
     in the park; leant against an old ash-tree, his hat off, and his hair
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58770">
     soaked with the dew that had gathered on the budded branches, and fell
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58780">
     pattering round him.  He had been standing a long time in that position,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58790">
     for I saw a pair of ousels passing and repassing scarcely three feet from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58800">
     him, busy in building their nest, and regarding his proximity no more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58810">
     than that of a piece of timber.  They flew off at my approach, and he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58820">
     raised his eyes and spoke:--'She's dead!' he said; 'I've not waited for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58830">
     you to learn that.  Put your handkerchief away--don't snivel before me.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58840">
     Damn you all! she wants none of your tears!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58860">
     I was weeping as much for him as her: we do sometimes pity creatures that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58870">
     have none of the feeling either for themselves or others.  When I first
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58880">
     looked into his face, I perceived that he had got intelligence of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58890">
     catastrophe; and a foolish notion struck me that his heart was quelled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58900">
     and he prayed, because his lips moved and his gaze was bent on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58910">
     ground.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58930">
     'Yes, she's dead!' I answered, checking my sobs and drying my cheeks.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58940">
     'Gone to heaven, I hope; where we may, every one, join her, if we take
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58950">
     due warning and leave our evil ways to follow good!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58970">
     'Did _she_ take due warning, then?' asked Heathcliff, attempting a sneer.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58980">
     'Did she die like a saint?  Come, give me a true history of the event.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_58990">
     How did--?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59010">
     He endeavoured to pronounce the name, but could not manage it; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59020">
     compressing his mouth he held a silent combat with his inward agony,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59030">
     defying, meanwhile, my sympathy with an unflinching, ferocious stare.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59040">
     'How did she die?' he resumed, at last--fain, notwithstanding his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59050">
     hardihood, to have a support behind him; for, after the struggle, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59060">
     trembled, in spite of himself, to his very finger-ends.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59080">
     'Poor wretch!' I thought; 'you have a heart and nerves the same as your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59090">
     brother men!  Why should you be anxious to conceal them?  Your pride
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59100">
     cannot blind God!  You tempt him to wring them, till he forces a cry of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59110">
     humiliation.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59130">
     'Quietly as a lamb!' I answered, aloud.  'She drew a sigh, and stretched
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59140">
     herself, like a child reviving, and sinking again to sleep; and five
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59150">
     minutes after I felt one little pulse at her heart, and nothing more!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59170">
     'And--did she ever mention me?' he asked, hesitating, as if he dreaded
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59180">
     the answer to his question would introduce details that he could not bear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59190">
     to hear.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59210">
     'Her senses never returned: she recognised nobody from the time you left
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59220">
     her,' I said.  'She lies with a sweet smile on her face; and her latest
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59230">
     ideas wandered back to pleasant early days.  Her life closed in a gentle
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59240">
     dream--may she wake as kindly in the other world!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59260">
     'May she wake in torment!' he cried, with frightful vehemence, stamping
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59270">
     his foot, and groaning in a sudden paroxysm of ungovernable passion.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59280">
     'Why, she's a liar to the end!  Where is she?  Not _there_--not in

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59300">
     sufferings!  And I pray one prayer--I repeat it till my tongue
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59310">
     stiffens--Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest as long as I am living;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59320">
     you said I killed you--haunt me, then!  The murdered _do_ haunt their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59330">
     murderers, I believe.  I know that ghosts _have_ wandered on earth.  Be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59340">
     with me always--take any form--drive me mad! only _do_ not leave me in

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59350">
     this abyss, where I cannot find you!  Oh, God! it is unutterable!  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59360">
     _cannot_ live without my life!  I _cannot_ live without my soul!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59380">
     He dashed his head against the knotted trunk; and, lifting up his eyes,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59390">
     howled, not like a man, but like a savage beast being goaded to death
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59400">
     with knives and spears.  I observed several splashes of blood about the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59410">
     bark of the tree, and his hand and forehead were both stained; probably
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59420">
     the scene I witnessed was a repetition of others acted during the night.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59430">
     It hardly moved my compassion--it appalled me: still, I felt reluctant to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59440">
     quit him so.  But the moment he recollected himself enough to notice me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59450">
     watching, he thundered a command for me to go, and I obeyed.  He was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59460">
     beyond my skill to quiet or console!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59480">
     Mrs. Linton's funeral was appointed to take place on the Friday following
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59490">
     her decease; and till then her coffin remained uncovered, and strewn with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59500">
     flowers and scented leaves, in the great drawing-room.  Linton spent his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59510">
     days and nights there, a sleepless guardian; and--a circumstance
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59520">
     concealed from all but me--Heathcliff spent his nights, at least,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59530">
     outside, equally a stranger to repose.  I held no communication with him:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59540">
     still, I was conscious of his design to enter, if he could; and on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59550">
     Tuesday, a little after dark, when my master, from sheer fatigue, had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59560">
     been compelled to retire a couple of hours, I went and opened one of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59570">
     windows; moved by his perseverance to give him a chance of bestowing on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59580">
     the faded image of his idol one final adieu.  He did not omit to avail
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59590">
     himself of the opportunity, cautiously and briefly; too cautiously to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59600">
     betray his presence by the slightest noise.  Indeed, I shouldn't have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59610">
     discovered that he had been there, except for the disarrangement of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59620">
     drapery about the corpse's face, and for observing on the floor a curl of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59630">
     light hair, fastened with a silver thread; which, on examination, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59640">
     ascertained to have been taken from a locket hung round Catherine's neck.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59650">
     Heathcliff had opened the trinket and cast out its contents, replacing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59660">
     them by a black lock of his own.  I twisted the two, and enclosed them
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59670">
     together.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59690">
     Mr. Earnshaw was, of course, invited to attend the remains of his sister
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59700">
     to the grave; he sent no excuse, but he never came; so that, besides her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59710">
     husband, the mourners were wholly composed of tenants and servants.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59720">
     Isabella was not asked.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59740">
     The place of Catherine's interment, to the surprise of the villagers, was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59750">
     neither in the chapel under the carved monument of the Lintons, nor yet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59760">
     by the tombs of her own relations, outside.  It was dug on a green slope
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59770">
     in a corner of the kirk-yard, where the wall is so low that heath and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59780">
     bilberry-plants have climbed over it from the moor; and peat-mould almost

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59790">
     buries it.  Her husband lies in the same spot now; and they have each a

     simple headstone above, and a plain grey block at their feet, to mark the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59880">
     That Friday made the last of our fine days for a month.  In the evening
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59890">
     the weather broke: the wind shifted from south to north-east, and brought
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59900">
     rain first, and then sleet and snow.  On the morrow one could hardly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59910">
     imagine that there had been three weeks of summer: the primroses and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59920">
     crocuses were hidden under wintry drifts; the larks were silent, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59930">
     young leaves of the early trees smitten and blackened.  And dreary, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59940">
     chill, and dismal, that morrow did creep over!  My master kept his room;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59950">
     I took possession of the lonely parlour, converting it into a nursery:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59960">
     and there I was, sitting with the moaning doll of a child laid on my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59970">
     knee; rocking it to and fro, and watching, meanwhile, the still driving
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59980">
     flakes build up the uncurtained window, when the door opened, and some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_59990">
     person entered, out of breath and laughing!  My anger was greater than my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60000">
     astonishment for a minute.  I supposed it one of the maids, and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60010">
     cried--'Have done!  How dare you show your giddiness here; What would Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60020">
     Linton say if he heard you?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60040">
     'Excuse me!' answered a familiar voice; 'but I know Edgar is in bed, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60050">
     I cannot stop myself.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60070">
     With that the speaker came forward to the fire, panting and holding her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60080">
     hand to her side.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60100">
     'I have run the whole way from Wuthering Heights!' she continued, after a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60110">
     pause; 'except where I've flown.  I couldn't count the number of falls
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60120">
     I've had.  Oh, I'm aching all over!  Don't be alarmed!  There shall be an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60130">
     explanation as soon as I can give it; only just have the goodness to step
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60140">
     out and order the carriage to take me on to Gimmerton, and tell a servant
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60150">
     to seek up a few clothes in my wardrobe.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60170">
     The intruder was Mrs. Heathcliff.  She certainly seemed in no laughing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60180">
     predicament: her hair streamed on her shoulders, dripping with snow and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60190">
     water; she was dressed in the girlish dress she commonly wore, befitting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60200">
     her age more than her position: a low frock with short sleeves, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60210">
     nothing on either head or neck.  The frock was of light silk, and clung
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60220">
     to her with wet, and her feet were protected merely by thin slippers; add
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60230">
     to this a deep cut under one ear, which only the cold prevented from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60240">
     bleeding profusely, a white face scratched and bruised, and a frame
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60250">
     hardly able to support itself through fatigue; and you may fancy my first
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60260">
     fright was not much allayed when I had had leisure to examine her.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60280">
     'My dear young lady,' I exclaimed, 'I'll stir nowhere, and hear nothing,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60290">
     till you have removed every article of your clothes, and put on dry
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60300">
     things; and certainly you shall not go to Gimmerton to-night, so it is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60310">
     needless to order the carriage.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60330">
     'Certainly I shall,' she said; 'walking or riding: yet I've no objection
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60340">
     to dress myself decently.  And--ah, see how it flows down my neck now!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60350">
     The fire does make it smart.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60370">
     She insisted on my fulfilling her directions, before she would let me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60380">
     touch her; and not till after the coachman had been instructed to get
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60390">
     ready, and a maid set to pack up some necessary attire, did I obtain her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60400">
     consent for binding the wound and helping to change her garments.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60420">
     'Now, Ellen,' she said, when my task was finished and she was seated in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60430">
     an easy-chair on the hearth, with a cup of tea before her, 'you sit down
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60440">
     opposite me, and put poor Catherine's baby away: I don't like to see it!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60450">
     You mustn't think I care little for Catherine, because I behaved so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60460">
     foolishly on entering: I've cried, too, bitterly--yes, more than any one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60470">
     else has reason to cry.  We parted unreconciled, you remember, and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60480">
     sha'n't forgive myself.  But, for all that, I was not going to sympathise
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60490">
     with him--the brute beast!  Oh, give me the poker!  This is the last
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60500">
     thing of his I have about me:' she slipped the gold ring from her third
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60510">
     finger, and threw it on the floor.  'I'll smash it!' she continued,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60520">
     striking it with childish spite, 'and then I'll burn it!' and she took
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60530">
     and dropped the misused article among the coals.  'There! he shall buy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60540">
     another, if he gets me back again.  He'd be capable of coming to seek me,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60550">
     to tease Edgar.  I dare not stay, lest that notion should possess his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60560">
     wicked head!  And besides, Edgar has not been kind, has he?  And I won't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60570">
     come suing for his assistance; nor will I bring him into more trouble.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60580">
     Necessity compelled me to seek shelter here; though, if I had not learned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60590">
     he was out of the way, I'd have halted at the kitchen, washed my face,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60600">
     warmed myself, got you to bring what I wanted, and departed again to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60610">
     anywhere out of the reach of my accursed--of that incarnate goblin!  Ah,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60620">
     he was in such a fury!  If he had caught me!  It's a pity Earnshaw is not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60630">
     his match in strength: I wouldn't have run till I'd seen him all but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60640">
     demolished, had Hindley been able to do it!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60660">
     'Well, don't talk so fast, Miss!' I interrupted; 'you'll disorder the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60670">
     handkerchief I have tied round your face, and make the cut bleed again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60680">
     Drink your tea, and take breath, and give over laughing: laughter is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60690">
     sadly out of place under this roof, and in your condition!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60710">
     'An undeniable truth,' she replied.  'Listen to that child!  It maintains
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60720">
     a constant wail--send it out of my hearing for an hour; I sha'n't stay
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60730">
     any longer.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60750">
     I rang the bell, and committed it to a servant's care; and then I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60760">
     inquired what had urged her to escape from Wuthering Heights in such an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60770">
     unlikely plight, and where she meant to go, as she refused remaining with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60780">
     us.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60800">
     'I ought, and I wished to remain,' answered she, 'to cheer Edgar and take
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60810">
     care of the baby, for two things, and because the Grange is my right
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60820">
     home.  But I tell you he wouldn't let me!  Do you think he could bear to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60830">
     see me grow fat and merry--could bear to think that we were tranquil, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60840">
     not resolve on poisoning our comfort?  Now, I have the satisfaction of

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60850">
     being sure that he detests me, to the point of its annoying him seriously
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60860">
     to have me within ear-shot or eyesight: I notice, when I enter his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60870">
     presence, the muscles of his countenance are involuntarily distorted into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60880">
     an expression of hatred; partly arising from his knowledge of the good

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60890">
     causes I have to feel that sentiment for him, and partly from original
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_60900">
     aversion.  It is strong enough to make me feel pretty certain that he

     took a stone, struck down the division between two windows, and sprang

     with malevolence, as I reluctantly delivered the account in answer to his

     gaunt and ghastly, leant against the chimney.  Neither appeared inclined
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_63420">
     to dine, and, having waited till all was cold on the table, I commenced
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_63430">
     alone.  Nothing hindered me from eating heartily, and I experienced a
    </p>

     certain sense of satisfaction and superiority, as, at intervals, I cast a

     conscience within me.  After I had done, I ventured on the unusual
    </p>

     liberty of drawing near the fire, going round Earnshaw's seat, and
    </p>

     kneeling in the corner beside him.

     forehead, that I once thought so manly, and that I now think so
    </p>

     diabolical, was shaded with a heavy cloud; his basilisk eyes were nearly

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_63540">
     quenched by sleeplessness, and weeping, perhaps, for the lashes were wet

     then: his lips devoid of their ferocious sneer, and sealed in an

     expression of unspeakable sadness.  Had it been another, I would have
    </p>

     miss this chance of sticking in a dart: his weakness was the only time

     intelligible.

     '"Get up, wretched idiot, before I stamp you to death!" he cried, making
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64320">
     a movement that caused me to make one also.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64340">

     degrading title of Mrs. Heathcliff, she would soon have presented a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64370">
     similar picture!  _She_ wouldn't have borne your abominable behaviour
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64380">
     quietly: her detestation and disgust must have found voice."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64400">
     'The back of the settle and Earnshaw's person interposed between me and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64410">
     him; so instead of endeavouring to reach me, he snatched a dinner-knife
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64420">
     from the table and flung it at my head.  It struck beneath my ear, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64430">
     stopped the sentence I was uttering; but, pulling it out, I sprang to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64440">
     door and delivered another; which I hope went a little deeper than his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64450">
     missile.  The last glimpse I caught of him was a furious rush on his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64460">
     part, checked by the embrace of his host; and both fell locked together
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64470">
     on the hearth.  In my flight through the kitchen I bid Joseph speed to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64480">
     his master; I knocked over Hareton, who was hanging a litter of puppies
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64490">
     from a chair-back in the doorway; and, blessed as a soul escaped from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64500">
     purgatory, I bounded, leaped, and flew down the steep road; then,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64510">
     quitting its windings, shot direct across the moor, rolling over banks,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64520">
     and wading through marshes: precipitating myself, in fact, towards the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64530">
     beacon-light of the Grange.  And far rather would I be condemned to a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64540">
     perpetual dwelling in the infernal regions than, even for one night,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64550">
     abide beneath the roof of Wuthering Heights again.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64570">
     Isabella ceased speaking, and took a drink of tea; then she rose, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64580">
     bidding me put on her bonnet, and a great shawl I had brought, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64590">
     turning a deaf ear to my entreaties for her to remain another hour, she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64600">
     stepped on to a chair, kissed Edgar's and Catherine's portraits, bestowed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64610">
     a similar salute on me, and descended to the carriage, accompanied by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64620">
     Fanny, who yelped wild with joy at recovering her mistress.  She was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64630">
     driven away, never to revisit this neighbourhood: but a regular
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64640">
     correspondence was established between her and my master when things were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64650">
     more settled.  I believe her new abode was in the south, near London;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64660">
     there she had a son born a few months subsequent to her escape.  He was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64670">
     christened Linton, and, from the first, she reported him to be an ailing,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64680">
     peevish creature.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64700">
     Mr. Heathcliff, meeting me one day in the village, inquired where she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64710">
     lived.  I refused to tell.  He remarked that it was not of any moment,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64720">
     only she must beware of coming to her brother: she should not be with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64730">
     him, if he had to keep her himself.  Though I would give no information,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64740">
     he discovered, through some of the other servants, both her place of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64750">
     residence and the existence of the child.  Still, he didn't molest her:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64760">
     for which forbearance she might thank his aversion, I suppose.  He often
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64770">
     asked about the infant, when he saw me; and on hearing its name, smiled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64780">
     grimly, and observed: 'They wish me to hate it too, do they?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64800">
     'I don't think they wish you to know anything about it,' I answered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64820">
     'But I'll have it,' he said, 'when I want it.  They may reckon on that!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64840">
     Fortunately its mother died before the time arrived; some thirteen years
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64850">
     after the decease of Catherine, when Linton was twelve, or a little more.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64870">
     On the day succeeding Isabella's unexpected visit I had no opportunity of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64880">
     speaking to my master: he shunned conversation, and was fit for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64890">
     discussing nothing.  When I could get him to listen, I saw it pleased him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64900">
     that his sister had left her husband; whom he abhorred with an intensity
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64910">
     which the mildness of his nature would scarcely seem to allow.  So deep
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64920">
     and sensitive was his aversion, that he refrained from going anywhere
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64930">
     where he was likely to see or hear of Heathcliff.  Grief, and that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64940">
     together, transformed him into a complete hermit: he threw up his office
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64950">
     of magistrate, ceased even to attend church, avoided the village on all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64960">
     occasions, and spent a life of entire seclusion within the limits of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64970">
     park and grounds; only varied by solitary rambles on the moors, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64980">
     visits to the grave of his wife, mostly at evening, or early morning
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_64990">
     before other wanderers were abroad.  But he was too good to be thoroughly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65000">
     unhappy long.  _He_ didn't pray for Catherine's soul to haunt him.  Time
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65010">
     brought resignation, and a melancholy sweeter than common joy.  He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65020">
     recalled her memory with ardent, tender love, and hopeful aspiring to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65030">
     better world; where he doubted not she was gone.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65050">
     And he had earthly consolation and affections also.  For a few days, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65060">
     said, he seemed regardless of the puny successor to the departed: that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65070">
     coldness melted as fast as snow in April, and ere the tiny thing could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65080">
     stammer a word or totter a step it wielded a despot's sceptre in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65090">
     heart.  It was named Catherine; but he never called it the name in full,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65100">
     as he had never called the first Catherine short: probably because
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65110">
     Heathcliff had a habit of doing so.  The little one was always Cathy: it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65120">
     formed to him a distinction from the mother, and yet a connection with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65130">
     her; and his attachment sprang from its relation to her, far more than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65140">
     from its being his own.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65160">
     I used to draw a comparison between him and Hindley Earnshaw, and perplex
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65170">
     myself to explain satisfactorily why their conduct was so opposite in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65180">
     similar circumstances.  They had both been fond husbands, and were both
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65190">
     attached to their children; and I could not see how they shouldn't both
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65200">
     have taken the same road, for good or evil.  But, I thought in my mind,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65210">
     Hindley, with apparently the stronger head, has shown himself sadly the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65220">
     worse and the weaker man.  When his ship struck, the captain abandoned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65230">
     his post; and the crew, instead of trying to save her, rushed into riot
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65240">
     and confusion, leaving no hope for their luckless vessel.  Linton, on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65250">
     contrary, displayed the true courage of a loyal and faithful soul: he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65260">
     trusted God; and God comforted him.  One hoped, and the other despaired:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65270">
     they chose their own lots, and were righteously doomed to endure them.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65280">
     But you'll not want to hear my moralising, Mr. Lockwood; you'll judge, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65290">
     well as I can, all these things: at least, you'll think you will, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65300">
     that's the same.  The end of Earnshaw was what might have been expected;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65310">
     it followed fast on his sister's: there were scarcely six months between
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65320">
     them.  We, at the Grange, never got a very succinct account of his state
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65330">
     preceding it; all that I did learn was on occasion of going to aid in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65340">
     preparations for the funeral.  Mr. Kenneth came to announce the event to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65350">
     my master.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65370">
     'Well, Nelly,' said he, riding into the yard one morning, too early not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65380">
     to alarm me with an instant presentiment of bad news, 'it's yours and my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65390">
     turn to go into mourning at present.  Who's given us the slip now, do you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65400">
     think?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65420">
     'Who?' I asked in a flurry.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65440">
     'Why, guess!' he returned, dismounting, and slinging his bridle on a hook
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65450">
     by the door.  'And nip up the corner of your apron: I'm certain you'll
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65460">
     need it.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65480">
     'Not Mr. Heathcliff, surely?' I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65500">
     'What! would you have tears for him?' said the doctor.  'No, Heathcliff's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65510">
     a tough young fellow: he looks blooming to-day.  I've just seen him.  He's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65520">
     rapidly regaining flesh since he lost his better half.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65540">
     'Who is it, then, Mr. Kenneth?' I repeated impatiently.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65560">
     'Hindley Earnshaw!  Your old friend Hindley,' he replied, 'and my wicked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65570">
     gossip: though he's been too wild for me this long while.  There!  I said
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65580">
     we should draw water.  But cheer up!  He died true to his character:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65590">
     drunk as a lord.  Poor lad!  I'm sorry, too.  One can't help missing an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65600">
     old companion: though he had the worst tricks with him that ever man
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65610">
     imagined, and has done me many a rascally turn.  He's barely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65620">
     twenty-seven, it seems; that's your own age: who would have thought you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65630">
     were born in one year?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65650">
     I confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of Mrs. Linton's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65660">
     death: ancient associations lingered round my heart; I sat down in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65670">
     porch and wept as for a blood relation, desiring Mr. Kenneth to get
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65680">
     another servant to introduce him to the master.  I could not hinder
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65690">
     myself from pondering on the question--'Had he had fair play?'  Whatever
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65700">
     I did, that idea would bother me: it was so tiresomely pertinacious that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65710">
     I resolved on requesting leave to go to Wuthering Heights, and assist in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65720">
     the last duties to the dead.  Mr. Linton was extremely reluctant to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65730">
     consent, but I pleaded eloquently for the friendless condition in which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65740">
     he lay; and I said my old master and foster-brother had a claim on my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65750">
     services as strong as his own.  Besides, I reminded him that the child
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65760">
     Hareton was his wife's nephew, and, in the absence of nearer kin, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65770">
     ought to act as its guardian; and he ought to and must inquire how the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65780">
     property was left, and look over the concerns of his brother-in-law.  He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65790">
     was unfit for attending to such matters then, but he bid me speak to his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65800">
     lawyer; and at length permitted me to go.  His lawyer had been Earnshaw's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65810">
     also: I called at the village, and asked him to accompany me.  He shook
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65820">
     his head, and advised that Heathcliff should be let alone; affirming, if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65830">
     the truth were known, Hareton would be found little else than a beggar.
    </p>

     'His father died in debt,' he said; 'the whole property is mortgaged, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65860">
     the sole chance for the natural heir is to allow him an opportunity of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65870">
     creating some interest in the creditor's heart, that he may be inclined
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65880">
     to deal leniently towards him.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65900">
     When I reached the Heights, I explained that I had come to see everything
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65910">
     carried on decently; and Joseph, who appeared in sufficient distress,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65920">
     expressed satisfaction at my presence.  Mr. Heathcliff said he did not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65930">
     perceive that I was wanted; but I might stay and order the arrangements
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65940">
     for the funeral, if I chose.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65960">
     'Correctly,' he remarked, 'that fool's body should be buried at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65970">
     cross-roads, without ceremony of any kind. I happened to leave him ten
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65980">
     minutes yesterday afternoon, and in that interval he fastened the two
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_65990">
     doors of the house against me, and he has spent the night in drinking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66000">
     himself to death deliberately! We broke in this morning, for we heard
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66010">
     him sporting like a horse; and there he was, laid over the settle:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66020">
     flaying and scalping would not have wakened him. I sent for Kenneth, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66030">
     he came; but not till the beast had changed into carrion: he was both
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66040">
     dead and cold, and stark; and so you'll allow it was useless making more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66050">
     stir about him!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66070">
     The old servant confirmed this statement, but muttered:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66090">
     'I'd rayther he'd goan hisseln for t' doctor!  I sud ha' taen tent o' t'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66100">
     maister better nor him--and he warn't deead when I left, naught o' t'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66110">
     soart!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66130">
     I insisted on the funeral being respectable.  Mr. Heathcliff said I might
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66140">
     have my own way there too: only, he desired me to remember that the money
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66150">
     for the whole affair came out of his pocket.  He maintained a hard,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66160">
     careless deportment, indicative of neither joy nor sorrow: if anything,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66170">
     it expressed a flinty gratification at a piece of difficult work
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66180">
     successfully executed.  I observed once, indeed, something like
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66190">
     exultation in his aspect: it was just when the people were bearing the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66200">
     coffin from the house.  He had the hypocrisy to represent a mourner: and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66210">
     previous to following with Hareton, he lifted the unfortunate child on to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66220">
     the table and muttered, with peculiar gusto, 'Now, my bonny lad, you are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66230">
     _mine_!  And we'll see if one tree won't grow as crooked as another, with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66240">
     the same wind to twist it!'  The unsuspecting thing was pleased at this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66250">
     speech: he played with Heathcliff's whiskers, and stroked his cheek; but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66260">
     I divined its meaning, and observed tartly, 'That boy must go back with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66270">
     me to Thrushcross Grange, sir.  There is nothing in the world less yours
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66280">
     than he is!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66300">
     'Does Linton say so?' he demanded.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66320">
     'Of course--he has ordered me to take him,' I replied.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66340">
     'Well,' said the scoundrel, 'we'll not argue the subject now: but I have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66350">
     a fancy to try my hand at rearing a young one; so intimate to your master
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66360">
     that I must supply the place of this with my own, if he attempt to remove
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66370">
     it.  I don't engage to let Hareton go undisputed; but I'll be pretty sure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66380">
     to make the other come!  Remember to tell him.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66400">
     This hint was enough to bind our hands.  I repeated its substance on my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66410">
     return; and Edgar Linton, little interested at the commencement, spoke no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66420">
     more of interfering.  I'm not aware that he could have done it to any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66430">
     purpose, had he been ever so willing.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66450">
     The guest was now the master of Wuthering Heights: he held firm
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66460">
     possession, and proved to the attorney--who, in his turn, proved it to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66470">
     Mr. Linton--that Earnshaw had mortgaged every yard of land he owned for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66480">
     cash to supply his mania for gaming; and he, Heathcliff, was the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66490">
     mortgagee.  In that manner Hareton, who should now be the first gentleman
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66500">
     in the neighbourhood, was reduced to a state of complete dependence on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66510">
     his father's inveterate enemy; and lives in his own house as a servant,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66520">
     deprived of the advantage of wages: quite unable to right himself,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66530">
     because of his friendlessness, and his ignorance that he has been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66540">
     wronged.

     CHAPTER XVIII
    </head>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66610">
     The twelve years, continued Mrs. Dean, following that dismal period were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66620">
     the happiest of my life: my greatest troubles in their passage rose from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66630">
     our little lady's trifling illnesses, which she had to experience in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66640">
     common with all children, rich and poor.  For the rest, after the first
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66650">
     six months, she grew like a larch, and could walk and talk too, in her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66660">
     own way, before the heath blossomed a second time over Mrs. Linton's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66670">
     dust.  She was the most winning thing that ever brought sunshine into a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66680">
     desolate house: a real beauty in face, with the Earnshaws' handsome dark
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66690">
     eyes, but the Lintons' fair skin and small features, and yellow curling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66700">
     hair.  Her spirit was high, though not rough, and qualified by a heart
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66710">
     sensitive and lively to excess in its affections.  That capacity for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66720">
     intense attachments reminded me of her mother: still she did not resemble
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66730">
     her: for she could be soft and mild as a dove, and she had a gentle voice
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66740">
     and pensive expression: her anger was never furious; her love never
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66750">
     fierce: it was deep and tender.  However, it must be acknowledged, she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66760">
     had faults to foil her gifts.  A propensity to be saucy was one; and a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66770">
     perverse will, that indulged children invariably acquire, whether they be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66780">
     good tempered or cross.  If a servant chanced to vex her, it was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66790">
     always--'I shall tell papa!'  And if he reproved her, even by a look, you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66800">
     would have thought it a heart-breaking business: I don't believe he ever
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66810">
     did speak a harsh word to her.  He took her education entirely on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66820">
     himself, and made it an amusement.  Fortunately, curiosity and a quick
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66830">
     intellect made her an apt scholar: she learned rapidly and eagerly, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66840">
     did honour to his teaching.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66860">
     Till she reached the age of thirteen she had not once been beyond the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66870">
     range of the park by herself.  Mr. Linton would take her with him a mile
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66880">
     or so outside, on rare occasions; but he trusted her to no one else.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66890">
     Gimmerton was an unsubstantial name in her ears; the chapel, the only
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66900">
     building she had approached or entered, except her own home.  Wuthering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66910">
     Heights and Mr. Heathcliff did not exist for her: she was a perfect
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66920">
     recluse; and, apparently, perfectly contented.  Sometimes, indeed, while
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66930">
     surveying the country from her nursery window, she would observe--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66950">
     'Ellen, how long will it be before I can walk to the top of those hills?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66960">
     I wonder what lies on the other side--is it the sea?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_66980">
     'No, Miss Cathy,' I would answer; 'it is hills again, just like these.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67000">
     'And what are those golden rocks like when you stand under them?' she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67010">
     once asked.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67030">
     The abrupt descent of Penistone Crags particularly attracted her notice;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67040">
     especially when the setting sun shone on it and the topmost heights, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67050">
     the whole extent of landscape besides lay in shadow.  I explained that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67060">
     they were bare masses of stone, with hardly enough earth in their clefts
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67070">
     to nourish a stunted tree.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67090">
     'And why are they bright so long after it is evening here?' she pursued.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67110">
     'Because they are a great deal higher up than we are,' replied I; 'you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67120">
     could not climb them, they are too high and steep.  In winter the frost
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67130">
     is always there before it comes to us; and deep into summer I have found
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67140">
     snow under that black hollow on the north-east side!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67160">
     'Oh, you have been on them!' she cried gleefully.  'Then I can go, too,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67170">
     when I am a woman.  Has papa been, Ellen?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67190">
     'Papa would tell you, Miss,' I answered, hastily, 'that they are not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67200">
     worth the trouble of visiting.  The moors, where you ramble with him, are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67210">
     much nicer; and Thrushcross Park is the finest place in the world.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67230">
     'But I know the park, and I don't know those,' she murmured to herself.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67240">
     'And I should delight to look round me from the brow of that tallest
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67250">
     point: my little pony Minny shall take me some time.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67270">
     One of the maids mentioning the Fairy Cave, quite turned her head with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67280">
     desire to fulfil this project: she teased Mr. Linton about it; and he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67290">
     promised she should have the journey when she got older.  But Miss
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67300">
     Catherine measured her age by months, and, 'Now, am I old enough to go to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67310">
     Penistone Crags?' was the constant question in her mouth.  The road
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67320">
     thither wound close by Wuthering Heights.  Edgar had not the heart to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67330">
     pass it; so she received as constantly the answer, 'Not yet, love: not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67340">
     yet.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67360">
     I said Mrs. Heathcliff lived above a dozen years after quitting her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67370">
     husband.  Her family were of a delicate constitution: she and Edgar both
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67380">
     lacked the ruddy health that you will generally meet in these parts.  What
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67390">
     her last illness was, I am not certain: I conjecture, they died of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67400">
     same thing, a kind of fever, slow at its commencement, but incurable, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67410">
     rapidly consuming life towards the close.  She wrote to inform her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67420">
     brother of the probable conclusion of a four-months' indisposition under
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67430">
     which she had suffered, and entreated him to come to her, if possible;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67440">
     for she had much to settle, and she wished to bid him adieu, and deliver
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67450">
     Linton safely into his hands.  Her hope was that Linton might be left
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67460">
     with him, as he had been with her: his father, she would fain convince
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67470">
     herself, had no desire to assume the burden of his maintenance or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67480">
     education.  My master hesitated not a moment in complying with her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67490">
     request: reluctant as he was to leave home at ordinary calls, he flew to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67500">
     answer this; commanding Catherine to my peculiar vigilance, in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67510">
     absence, with reiterated orders that she must not wander out of the park,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67520">
     even under my escort he did not calculate on her going unaccompanied.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67540">
     He was away three weeks.  The first day or two my charge sat in a corner
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67550">
     of the library, too sad for either reading or playing: in that quiet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67560">
     state she caused me little trouble; but it was succeeded by an interval
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67570">
     of impatient, fretful weariness; and being too busy, and too old then, to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67580">
     run up and down amusing her, I hit on a method by which she might
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67590">
     entertain herself.  I used to send her on her travels round the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67600">
     grounds--now on foot, and now on a pony; indulging her with a patient
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67610">
     audience of all her real and imaginary adventures when she returned.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67630">
     The summer shone in full prime; and she took such a taste for this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67640">
     solitary rambling that she often contrived to remain out from breakfast
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67650">
     till tea; and then the evenings were spent in recounting her fanciful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67660">
     tales.  I did not fear her breaking bounds; because the gates were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67670">
     generally locked, and I thought she would scarcely venture forth alone,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67680">
     if they had stood wide open.  Unluckily, my confidence proved misplaced.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67690">
     Catherine came to me, one morning, at eight o'clock, and said she was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67700">
     that day an Arabian merchant, going to cross the Desert with his caravan;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67710">
     and I must give her plenty of provision for herself and beasts: a horse,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67720">
     and three camels, personated by a large hound and a couple of pointers.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67730">
     got together good store of dainties, and slung them in a basket on one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67740">
     side of the saddle; and she sprang up as gay as a fairy, sheltered by her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67750">
     wide-brimmed hat and gauze veil from the July sun, and trotted off with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67760">
     merry laugh, mocking my cautious counsel to avoid galloping, and come
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67770">
     back early.  The naughty thing never made her appearance at tea.  One
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67780">
     traveller, the hound, being an old dog and fond of its ease, returned;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67790">
     but neither Cathy, nor the pony, nor the two pointers were visible in any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67800">
     direction: I despatched emissaries down this path, and that path, and at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67810">
     last went wandering in search of her myself.  There was a labourer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67820">
     working at a fence round a plantation, on the borders of the grounds.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67830">
     inquired of him if he had seen our young lady.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67850">
     'I saw her at morn,' he replied: 'she would have me to cut her a hazel
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67860">
     switch, and then she leapt her Galloway over the hedge yonder, where it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67870">
     is lowest, and galloped out of sight.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67890">
     You may guess how I felt at hearing this news.  It struck me directly she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67900">
     must have started for Penistone Crags.  'What will become of her?' I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67910">
     ejaculated, pushing through a gap which the man was repairing, and making
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67920">
     straight to the high-road.  I walked as if for a wager, mile after mile,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67930">
     till a turn brought me in view of the Heights; but no Catherine could I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67940">
     detect, far or near.  The Crags lie about a mile and a half beyond Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67950">
     Heathcliff's place, and that is four from the Grange, so I began to fear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67960">
     night would fall ere I could reach them.  'And what if she should have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67970">
     slipped in clambering among them,' I reflected, 'and been killed, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67980">
     broken some of her bones?'  My suspense was truly painful; and, at first,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_67990">
     it gave me delightful relief to observe, in hurrying by the farmhouse,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68000">
     Charlie, the fiercest of the pointers, lying under a window, with swelled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68010">
     head and bleeding ear.  I opened the wicket and ran to the door, knocking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68020">
     vehemently for admittance.  A woman whom I knew, and who formerly lived
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68030">
     at Gimmerton, answered: she had been servant there since the death of Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68040">
     Earnshaw.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68060">
     'Ah,' said she, 'you are come a-seeking your little mistress!  Don't be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68070">
     frightened.  She's here safe: but I'm glad it isn't the master.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68090">
     'He is not at home then, is he?' I panted, quite breathless with quick
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68100">
     walking and alarm.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68120">
     'No, no,' she replied: 'both he and Joseph are off, and I think they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68130">
     won't return this hour or more.  Step in and rest you a bit.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68150">
     I entered, and beheld my stray lamb seated on the hearth, rocking herself
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68160">
     in a little chair that had been her mother's when a child.  Her hat was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68170">
     hung against the wall, and she seemed perfectly at home, laughing and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68180">
     chattering, in the best spirits imaginable, to Hareton--now a great,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68190">
     strong lad of eighteen--who stared at her with considerable curiosity and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68200">
     astonishment: comprehending precious little of the fluent succession of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68210">
     remarks and questions which her tongue never ceased pouring forth.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68230">
     'Very well, Miss!' I exclaimed, concealing my joy under an angry
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68240">
     countenance.  'This is your last ride, till papa comes back.  I'll not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68250">
     trust you over the threshold again, you naughty, naughty girl!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68270">
     'Aha, Ellen!' she cried, gaily, jumping up and running to my side.  'I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68280">
     shall have a pretty story to tell to-night; and so you've found me out.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68290">
     Have you ever been here in your life before?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68310">
     'Put that hat on, and home at once,' said I.  'I'm dreadfully grieved at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68320">
     you, Miss Cathy: you've done extremely wrong!  It's no use pouting and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68330">
     crying: that won't repay the trouble I've had, scouring the country after
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68340">
     you.  To think how Mr. Linton charged me to keep you in; and you stealing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68350">
     off so!  It shows you are a cunning little fox, and nobody will put faith
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68360">
     in you any more.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68380">
     'What have I done?' sobbed she, instantly checked.  'Papa charged me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68390">
     nothing: he'll not scold me, Ellen--he's never cross, like you!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68410">
     'Come, come!' I repeated.  'I'll tie the riband.  Now, let us have no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68420">
     petulance.  Oh, for shame!  You thirteen years old, and such a baby!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68440">
     This exclamation was caused by her pushing the hat from her head, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68450">
     retreating to the chimney out of my reach.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68470">
     'Nay,' said the servant, 'don't be hard on the bonny lass, Mrs. Dean.  We
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68480">
     made her stop: she'd fain have ridden forwards, afeard you should be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68490">
     uneasy.  Hareton offered to go with her, and I thought he should: it's a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68500">
     wild road over the hills.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68520">
     Hareton, during the discussion, stood with his hands in his pockets, too
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68530">
     awkward to speak; though he looked as if he did not relish my intrusion.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68550">
     'How long am I to wait?' I continued, disregarding the woman's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68560">
     interference.  'It will be dark in ten minutes.  Where is the pony, Miss
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68570">
     Cathy?  And where is Phoenix?  I shall leave you, unless you be quick; so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68580">
     please yourself.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68600">
     'The pony is in the yard,' she replied, 'and Phoenix is shut in there.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68610">
     He's bitten--and so is Charlie.  I was going to tell you all about it;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68620">
     but you are in a bad temper, and don't deserve to hear.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68640">
     I picked up her hat, and approached to reinstate it; but perceiving that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68650">
     the people of the house took her part, she commenced capering round the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68660">
     room; and on my giving chase, ran like a mouse over and under and behind
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68670">
     the furniture, rendering it ridiculous for me to pursue.  Hareton and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68680">
     woman laughed, and she joined them, and waxed more impertinent still;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68690">
     till I cried, in great irritation,--'Well, Miss Cathy, if you were aware
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68700">
     whose house this is you'd be glad enough to get out.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68720">
     'It's _your_ father's, isn't it?' said she, turning to Hareton.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68740">
     'Nay,' he replied, looking down, and blushing bashfully.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68760">
     He could not stand a steady gaze from her eyes, though they were just his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68770">
     own.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68790">
     'Whose then--your master's?' she asked.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68810">
     He coloured deeper, with a different feeling, muttered an oath, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68820">
     turned away.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68840">
     'Who is his master?' continued the tiresome girl, appealing to me.  'He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68850">
     talked about "our house," and "our folk."  I thought he had been the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68860">
     owner's son.  And he never said Miss: he should have done, shouldn't he,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68870">
     if he's a servant?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68890">
     Hareton grew black as a thunder-cloud at this childish speech.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68900">
     silently shook my questioner, and at last succeeded in equipping her for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68910">
     departure.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68930">
     'Now, get my horse,' she said, addressing her unknown kinsman as she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68940">
     would one of the stable-boys at the Grange.  'And you may come with me.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68950">
     want to see where the goblin-hunter rises in the marsh, and to hear about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68960">
     the _fairishes_, as you call them: but make haste!  What's the matter?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68970">
     Get my horse, I say.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_68990">
     'I'll see thee damned before I be _thy_ servant!' growled the lad.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69010">
     'You'll see me _what_!' asked Catherine in surprise.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69030">
     'Damned--thou saucy witch!' he replied.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69050">
     'There, Miss Cathy! you see you have got into pretty company,' I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69060">
     interposed.  'Nice words to be used to a young lady!  Pray don't begin to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69070">
     dispute with him.  Come, let us seek for Minny ourselves, and begone.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69090">
     'But, Ellen,' cried she, staring fixed in astonishment, 'how dare he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69100">
     speak so to me?  Mustn't he be made to do as I ask him?  You wicked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69110">
     creature, I shall tell papa what you said.--Now, then!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69130">
     Hareton did not appear to feel this threat; so the tears sprang into her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69140">
     eyes with indignation.  'You bring the pony,' she exclaimed, turning to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69150">
     the woman, 'and let my dog free this moment!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69170">
     'Softly, Miss,' answered she addressed; 'you'll lose nothing by being
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69180">
     civil.  Though Mr. Hareton, there, be not the master's son, he's your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69190">
     cousin: and I was never hired to serve you.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69210">
     '_He_ my cousin!' cried Cathy, with a scornful laugh.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69230">
     'Yes, indeed,' responded her reprover.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69250">
     'Oh, Ellen! don't let them say such things,' she pursued in great
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69260">
     trouble.  'Papa is gone to fetch my cousin from London: my cousin is a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69270">
     gentleman's son.  That my--' she stopped, and wept outright; upset at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69280">
     bare notion of relationship with such a clown.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69300">
     'Hush, hush!' I whispered; 'people can have many cousins and of all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69310">
     sorts, Miss Cathy, without being any the worse for it; only they needn't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69320">
     keep their company, if they be disagreeable and bad.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69340">
     'He's not--he's not my cousin, Ellen!' she went on, gathering fresh grief
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69350">
     from reflection, and flinging herself into my arms for refuge from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69360">
     idea.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69380">
     I was much vexed at her and the servant for their mutual revelations;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69390">
     having no doubt of Linton's approaching arrival, communicated by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69400">
     former, being reported to Mr. Heathcliff; and feeling as confident that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69410">
     Catherine's first thought on her father's return would be to seek an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69420">
     explanation of the latter's assertion concerning her rude-bred kindred.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69430">
     Hareton, recovering from his disgust at being taken for a servant, seemed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69440">
     moved by her distress; and, having fetched the pony round to the door, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69450">
     took, to propitiate her, a fine crooked-legged terrier whelp from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69460">
     kennel, and putting it into her hand, bid her whist! for he meant nought.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69470">
     Pausing in her lamentations, she surveyed him with a glance of awe and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69480">
     horror, then burst forth anew.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69500">
     I could scarcely refrain from smiling at this antipathy to the poor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69510">
     fellow; who was a well-made, athletic youth, good-looking in features,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69520">
     and stout and healthy, but attired in garments befitting his daily
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69530">
     occupations of working on the farm and lounging among the moors after
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69540">
     rabbits and game.  Still, I thought I could detect in his physiognomy a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69550">
     mind owning better qualities than his father ever possessed.  Good things
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69560">
     lost amid a wilderness of weeds, to be sure, whose rankness far
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69570">
     over-topped their neglected growth; yet, notwithstanding, evidence of a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69580">
     wealthy soil, that might yield luxuriant crops under other and favourable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69590">
     circumstances.  Mr. Heathcliff, I believe, had not treated him physically
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69600">
     ill; thanks to his fearless nature, which offered no temptation to that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69610">
     course of oppression: he had none of the timid susceptibility that would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69620">
     have given zest to ill-treatment, in Heathcliff's judgment.  He appeared
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69630">
     to have bent his malevolence on making him a brute: he was never taught
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69640">
     to read or write; never rebuked for any bad habit which did not annoy his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69650">
     keeper; never led a single step towards virtue, or guarded by a single
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69660">
     precept against vice.  And from what I heard, Joseph contributed much to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69670">
     his deterioration, by a narrow-minded partiality which prompted him to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69680">
     flatter and pet him, as a boy, because he was the head of the old family.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69690">
     And as he had been in the habit of accusing Catherine Earnshaw and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69700">
     Heathcliff, when children, of putting the master past his patience, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69710">
     compelling him to seek solace in drink by what he termed their 'offald
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69720">
     ways,' so at present he laid the whole burden of Hareton's faults on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69730">
     shoulders of the usurper of his property.  If the lad swore, he wouldn't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69740">
     correct him: nor however culpably he behaved.  It gave Joseph
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69750">
     satisfaction, apparently, to watch him go the worst lengths: he allowed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69760">
     that the lad was ruined: that his soul was abandoned to perdition; but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69770">
     then he reflected that Heathcliff must answer for it.  Hareton's blood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69780">
     would be required at his hands; and there lay immense consolation in that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69790">
     thought.  Joseph had instilled into him a pride of name, and of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69800">
     lineage; he would, had he dared, have fostered hate between him and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69810">
     present owner of the Heights: but his dread of that owner amounted to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69820">
     superstition; and he confined his feelings regarding him to muttered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69830">
     innuendoes and private comminations.  I don't pretend to be intimately
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69840">
     acquainted with the mode of living customary in those days at Wuthering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69850">
     Heights: I only speak from hearsay; for I saw little.  The villagers
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69860">
     affirmed Mr. Heathcliff was _near_, and a cruel hard landlord to his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69870">
     tenants; but the house, inside, had regained its ancient aspect of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69880">
     comfort under female management, and the scenes of riot common in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69890">
     Hindley's time were not now enacted within its walls.  The master was too
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69900">
     gloomy to seek companionship with any people, good or bad; and he is yet.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69920">
     This, however, is not making progress with my story.  Miss Cathy rejected
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69930">
     the peace-offering of the terrier, and demanded her own dogs, Charlie and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69940">
     Phoenix.  They came limping and hanging their heads; and we set out for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69950">
     home, sadly out of sorts, every one of us.  I could not wring from my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69960">
     little lady how she had spent the day; except that, as I supposed, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69970">
     goal of her pilgrimage was Penistone Crags; and she arrived without
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69980">
     adventure to the gate of the farm-house, when Hareton happened to issue
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_69990">
     forth, attended by some canine followers, who attacked her train.  They
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70000">
     had a smart battle, before their owners could separate them: that formed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70010">
     an introduction.  Catherine told Hareton who she was, and where she was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70020">
     going; and asked him to show her the way: finally, beguiling him to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70030">
     accompany her.  He opened the mysteries of the Fairy Cave, and twenty
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70040">
     other queer places.  But, being in disgrace, I was not favoured with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70050">
     description of the interesting objects she saw.  I could gather, however,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70060">
     that her guide had been a favourite till she hurt his feelings by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70070">
     addressing him as a servant; and Heathcliff's housekeeper hurt hers by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70080">
     calling him her cousin.  Then the language he had held to her rankled in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70090">
     her heart; she who was always 'love,' and 'darling,' and 'queen,' and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70100">
     'angel,' with everybody at the Grange, to be insulted so shockingly by a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70110">
     stranger!  She did not comprehend it; and hard work I had to obtain a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70120">
     promise that she would not lay the grievance before her father.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70130">
     explained how he objected to the whole household at the Heights, and how
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70140">
     sorry he would be to find she had been there; but I insisted most on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70150">
     fact, that if she revealed my negligence of his orders, he would perhaps
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70160">
     be so angry that I should have to leave; and Cathy couldn't bear that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70170">
     prospect: she pledged her word, and kept it for my sake.  After all, she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70180">
     was a sweet little girl.

    </head>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70250">
     A letter, edged with black, announced the day of my master's return.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70260">
     Isabella was dead; and he wrote to bid me get mourning for his daughter,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70270">
     and arrange a room, and other accommodations, for his youthful nephew.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70280">
     Catherine ran wild with joy at the idea of welcoming her father back; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70290">
     indulged most sanguine anticipations of the innumerable excellencies of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70300">
     her 'real' cousin.  The evening of their expected arrival came.  Since
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70310">
     early morning she had been busy ordering her own small affairs; and now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70320">
     attired in her new black frock--poor thing! her aunt's death impressed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70330">
     her with no definite sorrow--she obliged me, by constant worrying, to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70340">
     walk with her down through the grounds to meet them.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70360">
     'Linton is just six months younger than I am,' she chattered, as we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70370">
     strolled leisurely over the swells and hollows of mossy turf, under
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70380">
     shadow of the trees.  'How delightful it will be to have him for a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70390">
     playfellow!  Aunt Isabella sent papa a beautiful lock of his hair; it was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70400">
     lighter than mine--more flaxen, and quite as fine.  I have it carefully
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70410">
     preserved in a little glass box; and I've often thought what a pleasure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70420">
     it would be to see its owner.  Oh! I am happy--and papa, dear, dear papa!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70430">
     Come, Ellen, let us run! come, run.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70450">
     She ran, and returned and ran again, many times before my sober footsteps
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70460">
     reached the gate, and then she seated herself on the grassy bank beside
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70470">
     the path, and tried to wait patiently; but that was impossible: she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70480">
     couldn't be still a minute.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70500">
     'How long they are!' she exclaimed.  'Ah, I see, some dust on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70510">
     road--they are coming!  No!  When will they be here?  May we not go a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70520">
     little way--half a mile, Ellen, only just half a mile?  Do say Yes: to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70530">
     that clump of birches at the turn!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70550">
     I refused staunchly.  At length her suspense was ended: the travelling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70560">
     carriage rolled in sight.  Miss Cathy shrieked and stretched out her arms
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70570">
     as soon as she caught her father's face looking from the window.  He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70580">
     descended, nearly as eager as herself; and a considerable interval
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70590">
     elapsed ere they had a thought to spare for any but themselves.  While
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70600">
     they exchanged caresses I took a peep in to see after Linton.  He was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70610">
     asleep in a corner, wrapped in a warm, fur-lined cloak, as if it had been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70620">
     winter.  A pale, delicate, effeminate boy, who might have been taken for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70630">
     my master's younger brother, so strong was the resemblance: but there was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70640">
     a sickly peevishness in his aspect that Edgar Linton never had.  The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70650">
     latter saw me looking; and having shaken hands, advised me to close the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70660">
     door, and leave him undisturbed; for the journey had fatigued him.  Cathy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70670">
     would fain have taken one glance, but her father told her to come, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70680">
     they walked together up the park, while I hastened before to prepare the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70690">
     servants.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70710">
     'Now, darling,' said Mr. Linton, addressing his daughter, as they halted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70720">
     at the bottom of the front steps: 'your cousin is not so strong or so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70730">
     merry as you are, and he has lost his mother, remember, a very short time
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70740">
     since; therefore, don't expect him to play and run about with you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70750">
     directly.  And don't harass him much by talking: let him be quiet this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70760">
     evening, at least, will you?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70780">
     'Yes, yes, papa,' answered Catherine: 'but I do want to see him; and he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70790">
     hasn't once looked out.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70810">
     The carriage stopped; and the sleeper being roused, was lifted to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70820">
     ground by his uncle.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70840">
     'This is your cousin Cathy, Linton,' he said, putting their little hands
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70850">
     together.  'She's fond of you already; and mind you don't grieve her by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70860">
     crying to-night.  Try to be cheerful now; the travelling is at an end,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70870">
     and you have nothing to do but rest and amuse yourself as you please.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70890">
     'Let me go to bed, then,' answered the boy, shrinking from Catherine's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70900">
     salute; and he put his fingers to remove incipient tears.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70920">
     'Come, come, there's a good child,' I whispered, leading him in.  'You'll
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70930">
     make her weep too--see how sorry she is for you!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70950">
     I do not know whether it was sorrow for him, but his cousin put on as sad

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70960">
     a countenance as himself, and returned to her father.  All three entered,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70970">
     and mounted to the library, where tea was laid ready.  I proceeded to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70980">
     remove Linton's cap and mantle, and placed him on a chair by the table;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_70990">
     but he was no sooner seated than he began to cry afresh.  My master
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71000">
     inquired what was the matter.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71020">
     'I can't sit on a chair,' sobbed the boy.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71040">
     'Go to the sofa, then, and Ellen shall bring you some tea,' answered his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71050">
     uncle patiently.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71070">
     He had been greatly tried, during the journey, I felt convinced, by his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71080">
     fretful ailing charge.  Linton slowly trailed himself off, and lay down.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71090">
     Cathy carried a footstool and her cup to his side.  At first she sat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71100">
     silent; but that could not last: she had resolved to make a pet of her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71110">
     little cousin, as she would have him to be; and she commenced stroking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71120">
     his curls, and kissing his cheek, and offering him tea in her saucer,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71130">
     like a baby.  This pleased him, for he was not much better: he dried his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71140">
     eyes, and lightened into a faint smile.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71160">
     'Oh, he'll do very well,' said the master to me, after watching them a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71170">
     minute.  'Very well, if we can keep him, Ellen.  The company of a child
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71180">
     of his own age will instil new spirit into him soon, and by wishing for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71190">
     strength he'll gain it.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71210">
     'Ay, if we can keep him!' I mused to myself; and sore misgivings came
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71220">
     over me that there was slight hope of that.  And then, I thought, how
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71230">
     ever will that weakling live at Wuthering Heights?  Between his father
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71240">
     and Hareton, what playmates and instructors they'll be.  Our doubts were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71250">
     presently decided--even earlier than I expected.  I had just taken the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71260">
     children up-stairs, after tea was finished, and seen Linton asleep--he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71270">
     would not suffer me to leave him till that was the case--I had come down,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71280">
     and was standing by the table in the hall, lighting a bedroom candle for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71290">
     Mr. Edgar, when a maid stepped out of the kitchen and informed me that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71300">
     Mr. Heathcliff's servant Joseph was at the door, and wished to speak with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71310">
     the master.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71330">
     'I shall ask him what he wants first,' I said, in considerable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71340">
     trepidation.  'A very unlikely hour to be troubling people, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71350">
     instant they have returned from a long journey.  I don't think the master
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71360">
     can see him.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71380">
     Joseph had advanced through the kitchen as I uttered these words, and now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71390">
     presented himself in the hall.  He was donned in his Sunday garments,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71400">
     with his most sanctimonious and sourest face, and, holding his hat in one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71410">
     hand, and his stick in the other, he proceeded to clean his shoes on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71420">
     mat.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71440">
     'Good-evening, Joseph,' I said, coldly.  'What business brings you here
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71450">
     to-night?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71470">
     'It's Maister Linton I mun spake to,' he answered, waving me disdainfully
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71480">
     aside.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71500">
     'Mr. Linton is going to bed; unless you have something particular to say,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71510">
     I'm sure he won't hear it now,' I continued.  'You had better sit down in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71520">
     there, and entrust your message to me.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71540">
     'Which is his rahm?' pursued the fellow, surveying the range of closed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71550">
     doors.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71570">
     I perceived he was bent on refusing my mediation, so very reluctantly I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71580">
     went up to the library, and announced the unseasonable visitor, advising
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71590">
     that he should be dismissed till next day.  Mr. Linton had no time to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71600">
     empower me to do so, for Joseph mounted close at my heels, and, pushing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71610">
     into the apartment, planted himself at the far side of the table, with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71620">
     his two fists clapped on the head of his stick, and began in an elevated
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71630">
     tone, as if anticipating opposition--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71650">
     'Hathecliff has sent me for his lad, and I munn't goa back 'bout him.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71670">
     Edgar Linton was silent a minute; an expression of exceeding sorrow
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71680">
     overcast his features: he would have pitied the child on his own account;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71690">
     but, recalling Isabella's hopes and fears, and anxious wishes for her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71700">
     son, and her commendations of him to his care, he grieved bitterly at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71710">
     prospect of yielding him up, and searched in his heart how it might be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71720">
     avoided.  No plan offered itself: the very exhibition of any desire to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71730">
     keep him would have rendered the claimant more peremptory: there was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71740">
     nothing left but to resign him.  However, he was not going to rouse him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71750">
     from his sleep.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71770">
     'Tell Mr. Heathcliff,' he answered calmly, 'that his son shall come to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71780">
     Wuthering Heights to-morrow.  He is in bed, and too tired to go the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71790">
     distance now.  You may also tell him that the mother of Linton desired
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71800">
     him to remain under my guardianship; and, at present, his health is very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71810">
     precarious.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71830">
     'Noa!' said Joseph, giving a thud with his prop on the floor, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71840">
     assuming an authoritative air.  'Noa! that means naught.  Hathecliff maks
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71850">
     noa 'count o' t' mother, nor ye norther; but he'll heu' his lad; und I

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71880">
     'You shall not to-night!' answered Linton decisively.  'Walk down stairs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71890">
     at once, and repeat to your master what I have said.  Ellen, show him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71900">
     down.  Go--'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71920">
     And, aiding the indignant elder with a lift by the arm, he rid the room
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71930">
     of him and closed the door.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_71950">
     'Varrah weell!' shouted Joseph, as he slowly drew off.  'To-morn, he's

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72030">
     To obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled, Mr. Linton
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72040">
     commissioned me to take the boy home early, on Catherine's pony; and,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72050">
     said he--'As we shall now have no influence over his destiny, good or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72060">
     bad, you must say nothing of where he is gone to my daughter: she cannot
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72070">
     associate with him hereafter, and it is better for her to remain in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72080">
     ignorance of his proximity; lest she should be restless, and anxious to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72090">
     visit the Heights.  Merely tell her his father sent for him suddenly, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72100">
     he has been obliged to leave us.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72120">
     Linton was very reluctant to be roused from his bed at five o'clock, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72130">
     astonished to be informed that he must prepare for further travelling;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72140">
     but I softened off the matter by stating that he was going to spend some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72150">
     time with his father, Mr. Heathcliff, who wished to see him so much, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72160">
     did not like to defer the pleasure till he should recover from his late
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72170">
     journey.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72190">
     'My father!' he cried, in strange perplexity.  'Mamma never told me I had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72200">
     a father.  Where does he live?  I'd rather stay with uncle.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72220">
     'He lives a little distance from the Grange,' I replied; 'just beyond
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72230">
     those hills: not so far, but you may walk over here when you get hearty.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72240">
     And you should be glad to go home, and to see him.  You must try to love
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72250">
     him, as you did your mother, and then he will love you.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72270">
     'But why have I not heard of him before?' asked Linton.  'Why didn't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72280">
     mamma and he live together, as other people do?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72300">
     'He had business to keep him in the north,' I answered, 'and your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72310">
     mother's health required her to reside in the south.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72330">
     'And why didn't mamma speak to me about him?' persevered the child.  'She
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72340">
     often talked of uncle, and I learnt to love him long ago.  How am I to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72350">
     love papa?  I don't know him.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72370">
     'Oh, all children love their parents,' I said.  'Your mother, perhaps,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72380">
     thought you would want to be with him if she mentioned him often to you.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72390">
     Let us make haste.  An early ride on such a beautiful morning is much
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72400">
     preferable to an hour's more sleep.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72420">
     'Is _she_ to go with us,' he demanded, 'the little girl I saw yesterday?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72440">
     'Not now,' replied I.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72460">
     'Is uncle?' he continued.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72480">
     'No, I shall be your companion there,' I said.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72500">
     Linton sank back on his pillow and fell into a brown study.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72520">
     'I won't go without uncle,' he cried at length: 'I can't tell where you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72530">
     mean to take me.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72550">
     I attempted to persuade him of the naughtiness of showing reluctance to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72560">
     meet his father; still he obstinately resisted any progress towards
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72570">
     dressing, and I had to call for my master's assistance in coaxing him out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72580">
     of bed.  The poor thing was finally got off, with several delusive
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72590">
     assurances that his absence should be short: that Mr. Edgar and Cathy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72600">
     would visit him, and other promises, equally ill-founded, which I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72610">
     invented and reiterated at intervals throughout the way.  The pure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72620">
     heather-scented air, the bright sunshine, and the gentle canter of Minny,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72630">
     relieved his despondency after a while.  He began to put questions
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72640">
     concerning his new home, and its inhabitants, with greater interest and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72650">
     liveliness.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72670">
     'Is Wuthering Heights as pleasant a place as Thrushcross Grange?' he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72680">
     inquired, turning to take a last glance into the valley, whence a light
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72690">
     mist mounted and formed a fleecy cloud on the skirts of the blue.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72710">
     'It is not so buried in trees,' I replied, 'and it is not quite so large,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72720">
     but you can see the country beautifully all round; and the air is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72730">
     healthier for you--fresher and drier.  You will, perhaps, think the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72760">
     the moors.  Hareton Earnshaw--that is, Miss Cathy's other cousin, and so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72770">
     yours in a manner--will show you all the sweetest spots; and you can
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72780">
     bring a book in fine weather, and make a green hollow your study; and,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72790">
     now and then, your uncle may join you in a walk: he does, frequently,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72800">
     walk out on the hills.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72820">
     'And what is my father like?' he asked.  'Is he as young and handsome as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72830">
     uncle?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72850">
     'He's as young,' said I; 'but he has black hair and eyes, and looks
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72860">
     sterner; and he is taller and bigger altogether.  He'll not seem to you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72870">
     so gentle and kind at first, perhaps, because it is not his way: still,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72880">
     mind you, be frank and cordial with him; and naturally he'll be fonder of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72890">
     you than any uncle, for you are his own.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72910">
     'Black hair and eyes!' mused Linton.  'I can't fancy him.  Then I am not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72920">
     like him, am I?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72940">
     'Not much,' I answered: not a morsel, I thought, surveying with regret
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72950">
     the white complexion and slim frame of my companion, and his large
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72960">
     languid eyes--his mother's eyes, save that, unless a morbid touchiness
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72970">
     kindled them a moment, they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_72990">
     'How strange that he should never come to see mamma and me!' he murmured.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73000">
     'Has he ever seen me?  If he has, I must have been a baby.  I remember
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73010">
     not a single thing about him!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73030">
     'Why, Master Linton,' said I, 'three hundred miles is a great distance;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73040">
     and ten years seem very different in length to a grown-up person compared
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73050">
     with what they do to you.  It is probable Mr. Heathcliff proposed going
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73060">
     from summer to summer, but never found a convenient opportunity; and now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73070">
     it is too late.  Don't trouble him with questions on the subject: it will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73080">
     disturb him, for no good.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73100">
     The boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the remainder of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73110">
     the ride, till we halted before the farmhouse garden-gate.  I watched to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73120">
     catch his impressions in his countenance.  He surveyed the carved front
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73130">
     and low-browed lattices, the straggling gooseberry-bushes and crooked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73140">
     firs, with solemn intentness, and then shook his head: his private
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73150">
     feelings entirely disapproved of the exterior of his new abode.  But he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73160">
     had sense to postpone complaining: there might be compensation within.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73170">
     Before he dismounted, I went and opened the door.  It was half-past six;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73180">
     the family had just finished breakfast: the servant was clearing and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73190">
     wiping down the table.  Joseph stood by his master's chair telling some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73200">
     tale concerning a lame horse; and Hareton was preparing for the hayfield.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73220">
     'Hallo, Nelly!' said Mr. Heathcliff, when he saw me.  'I feared I should
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73230">
     have to come down and fetch my property myself.  You've brought it, have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73240">
     you?  Let us see what we can make of it.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73260">
     He got up and strode to the door: Hareton and Joseph followed in gaping
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73270">
     curiosity.  Poor Linton ran a frightened eye over the faces of the three.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73290">
     'Sure-ly,' said Joseph after a grave inspection, 'he's swopped wi' ye,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73300">
     Maister, an' yon's his lass!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73320">
     Heathcliff, having stared his son into an ague of confusion, uttered a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73330">
     scornful laugh.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73350">
     'God! what a beauty! what a lovely, charming thing!' he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73360">
     'Hav'n't they reared it on snails and sour milk, Nelly?  Oh, damn my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73370">
     soul! but that's worse than I expected--and the devil knows I was not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73380">
     sanguine!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73400">
     I bid the trembling and bewildered child get down, and enter.  He did not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73410">
     thoroughly comprehend the meaning of his father's speech, or whether it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73420">
     were intended for him: indeed, he was not yet certain that the grim,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73430">
     sneering stranger was his father.  But he clung to me with growing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73440">
     trepidation; and on Mr. Heathcliff's taking a seat and bidding him 'come
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73450">
     hither' he hid his face on my shoulder and wept.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73470">
     'Tut, tut!' said Heathcliff, stretching out a hand and dragging him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73480">
     roughly between his knees, and then holding up his head by the chin.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73490">
     'None of that nonsense!  We're not going to hurt thee, Linton--isn't that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73500">
     thy name?  Thou art thy mother's child, entirely!  Where is my share in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73510">
     thee, puling chicken?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73530">
     He took off the boy's cap and pushed back his thick flaxen curls, felt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73540">
     his slender arms and his small fingers; during which examination Linton
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73550">
     ceased crying, and lifted his great blue eyes to inspect the inspector.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73570">
     'Do you know me?' asked Heathcliff, having satisfied himself that the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73580">
     limbs were all equally frail and feeble.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73600">
     'No,' said Linton, with a gaze of vacant fear.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73620">
     'You've heard of me, I daresay?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73640">
     'No,' he replied again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73660">
     'No!  What a shame of your mother, never to waken your filial regard for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73670">
     me!  You are my son, then, I'll tell you; and your mother was a wicked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73680">
     slut to leave you in ignorance of the sort of father you possessed.  Now,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73690">
     don't wince, and colour up!  Though it is something to see you have not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73700">
     white blood.  Be a good lad; and I'll do for you.  Nelly, if you be tired
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73710">
     you may sit down; if not, get home again.  I guess you'll report what you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73720">
     hear and see to the cipher at the Grange; and this thing won't be settled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73730">
     while you linger about it.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73750">
     'Well,' replied I, 'I hope you'll be kind to the boy, Mr. Heathcliff, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73760">
     you'll not keep him long; and he's all you have akin in the wide world,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73770">
     that you will ever know--remember.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73790">
     'I'll be very kind to him, you needn't fear,' he said, laughing.  'Only
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73800">
     nobody else must be kind to him: I'm jealous of monopolising his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73810">
     affection.  And, to begin my kindness, Joseph, bring the lad some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73820">
     breakfast.  Hareton, you infernal calf, begone to your work.  Yes, Nell,'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73830">
     he added, when they had departed, 'my son is prospective owner of your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73840">
     place, and I should not wish him to die till I was certain of being his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73850">
     successor.  Besides, he's _mine_, and I want the triumph of seeing _my_
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73860">
     descendant fairly lord of their estates; my child hiring their children
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73870">
     to till their fathers' lands for wages.  That is the sole consideration
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73880">
     which can make me endure the whelp: I despise him for himself, and hate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73890">
     him for the memories he revives!  But that consideration is sufficient:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73900">
     he's as safe with me, and shall be tended as carefully as your master
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73910">
     tends his own.  I have a room up-stairs, furnished for him in handsome
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73920">
     style; I've engaged a tutor, also, to come three times a week, from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73930">
     twenty miles' distance, to teach him what he pleases to learn.  I've
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73940">
     ordered Hareton to obey him: and in fact I've arranged everything with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73950">
     view to preserve the superior and the gentleman in him, above his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73960">
     associates.  I do regret, however, that he so little deserves the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73970">
     trouble: if I wished any blessing in the world, it was to find him a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73980">
     worthy object of pride; and I'm bitterly disappointed with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_73990">
     whey-faced, whining wretch!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74010">
     While he was speaking, Joseph returned bearing a basin of milk-porridge,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74020">
     and placed it before Linton: who stirred round the homely mess with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74030">
     look of aversion, and affirmed he could not eat it. I saw the old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74040">
     man-servant shared largely in his master's scorn of the child; though he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74050">
     was compelled to retain the sentiment in his heart, because Heathcliff
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74060">
     plainly meant his underlings to hold him in honour.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74080">
     'Cannot ate it?' repeated he, peering in Linton's face, and subduing his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74090">
     voice to a whisper, for fear of being overheard.  'But Maister Hareton
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74100">
     nivir ate naught else, when he wer a little 'un; and what wer gooid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74110">
     enough for him's gooid enough for ye, I's rayther think!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74130">
     'I _sha'n't_ eat it!' answered Linton, snappishly.  'Take it away.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74150">
     Joseph snatched up the food indignantly, and brought it to us.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74170">
     'Is there aught ails th' victuals?' he asked, thrusting the tray under
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74180">
     Heathcliff's nose.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74200">
     'What should ail them?' he said.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74220">
     'Wah!' answered Joseph, 'yon dainty chap says he cannut ate 'em.  But I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74230">
     guess it's raight!  His mother wer just soa--we wer a'most too mucky to

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74240">
     sow t' corn for makking her breead.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74260">
     'Don't mention his mother to me,' said the master, angrily.  'Get him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74270">
     something that he can eat, that's all.  What is his usual food, Nelly?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74290">
     I suggested boiled milk or tea; and the housekeeper received instructions
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74300">
     to prepare some.  Come, I reflected, his father's selfishness may
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74310">
     contribute to his comfort.  He perceives his delicate constitution, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74320">
     the necessity of treating him tolerably.  I'll console Mr. Edgar by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74330">
     acquainting him with the turn Heathcliff's humour has taken.  Having no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74340">
     excuse for lingering longer, I slipped out, while Linton was engaged in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74350">
     timidly rebuffing the advances of a friendly sheep-dog.  But he was too
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74360">
     much on the alert to be cheated: as I closed the door, I heard a cry, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74370">
     a frantic repetition of the words--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74390">
     'Don't leave me!  I'll not stay here!  I'll not stay here!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74410">
     Then the latch was raised and fell: they did not suffer him to come
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74420">
     forth.  I mounted Minny, and urged her to a trot; and so my brief
    </p>

     guardianship ended.

     We had sad work with little Cathy that day: she rose in high glee, eager

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74510">
     to join her cousin, and such passionate tears and lamentations followed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74520">
     the news of his departure that Edgar himself was obliged to soothe her,

     by affirming he should come back soon: he added, however, 'if I can get

     paying business visits to Gimmerton, I used to ask how the young master
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74610">
     got on; for he lived almost as secluded as Catherine herself, and was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74620">
     never to be seen.  I could gather from her that he continued in weak
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74630">
     health, and was a tiresome inmate.  She said Mr. Heathcliff seemed to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74640">
     dislike him ever longer and worse, though he took some trouble to conceal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74650">
     it: he had an antipathy to the sound of his voice, and could not do at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74660">
     all with his sitting in the same room with him many minutes together.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74670">
     There seldom passed much talk between them: Linton learnt his lessons and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74680">
     spent his evenings in a small apartment they called the parlour: or else
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74690">
     lay in bed all day: for he was constantly getting coughs, and colds, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74700">
     aches, and pains of some sort.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74720">
     'And I never know such a fainthearted creature,' added the woman; 'nor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74730">
     one so careful of hisseln. He _will_ go on, if I leave the window open a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74740">
     bit late in the evening. Oh! it's killing, a breath of night air! And he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74750">
     must have a fire in the middle of summer; and Joseph's bacca-pipe is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74760">
     poison; and he must always have sweets and dainties, and always milk,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74770">
     milk for ever--heeding naught how the rest of us are pinched in winter;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74780">
     and there he'll sit, wrapped in his furred cloak in his chair by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74790">
     fire, with some toast and water or other slop on the hob to sip at; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74800">
     if Hareton, for pity, comes to amuse him--Hareton is not bad-natured,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74810">
     though he's rough--they're sure to part, one swearing and the other
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74820">
     crying. I believe the master would relish Earnshaw's thrashing him to a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74830">
     mummy, if he were not his son; and I'm certain he would be fit to turn
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74840">
     him out of doors, if he knew half the nursing he gives hisseln. But then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74850">
     he won't go into danger of temptation: he never enters the parlour, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74860">
     should Linton show those ways in the house where he is, he sends him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74870">
     up-stairs directly.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74890">
     I divined, from this account, that utter lack of sympathy had rendered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74900">
     young Heathcliff selfish and disagreeable, if he were not so originally;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74910">
     and my interest in him, consequently, decayed: though still I was moved
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74920">
     with a sense of grief at his lot, and a wish that he had been left with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74930">
     us.  Mr. Edgar encouraged me to gain information: he thought a great deal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74940">
     about him, I fancy, and would have run some risk to see him; and he told
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74950">
     me once to ask the housekeeper whether he ever came into the village?  She
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74960">
     said he had only been twice, on horseback, accompanying his father; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74970">
     both times he pretended to be quite knocked up for three or four days
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74980">
     afterwards.  That housekeeper left, if I recollect rightly, two years
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_74990">
     after he came; and another, whom I did not know, was her successor; she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75000">
     lives there still.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75020">
     Time wore on at the Grange in its former pleasant way till Miss Cathy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75030">
     reached sixteen.  On the anniversary of her birth we never manifested any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75040">
     signs of rejoicing, because it was also the anniversary of my late
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75050">
     mistress's death.  Her father invariably spent that day alone in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75060">
     library; and walked, at dusk, as far as Gimmerton kirkyard, where he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75070">
     would frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight.  Therefore Catherine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75080">
     was thrown on her own resources for amusement.  This twentieth of March
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75090">
     was a beautiful spring day, and when her father had retired, my young
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75100">
     lady came down dressed for going out, and said she asked to have a ramble
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75110">
     on the edge of the moor with me: Mr. Linton had given her leave, if we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75120">
     went only a short distance and were back within the hour.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75140">
     'So make haste, Ellen!' she cried.  'I know where I wish to go; where a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75150">
     colony of moor-game are settled: I want to see whether they have made
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75160">
     their nests yet.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75180">
     'That must be a good distance up,' I answered; 'they don't breed on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75190">
     edge of the moor.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75210">
     'No, it's not,' she said.  'I've gone very near with papa.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75230">
     I put on my bonnet and sallied out, thinking nothing more of the matter.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75240">
     She bounded before me, and returned to my side, and was off again like a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75250">
     young greyhound; and, at first, I found plenty of entertainment in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75260">
     listening to the larks singing far and near, and enjoying the sweet, warm
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75270">
     sunshine; and watching her, my pet and my delight, with her golden
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75280">
     ringlets flying loose behind, and her bright cheek, as soft and pure in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75290">
     its bloom as a wild rose, and her eyes radiant with cloudless pleasure.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75300">
     She was a happy creature, and an angel, in those days.  It's a pity she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75310">
     could not be content.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75330">
     'Well,' said I, 'where are your moor-game, Miss Cathy?  We should be at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75340">
     them: the Grange park-fence is a great way off now.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75360">
     'Oh, a little further--only a little further, Ellen,' was her answer,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75370">
     continually.  'Climb to that hillock, pass that bank, and by the time you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75380">
     reach the other side I shall have raised the birds.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75400">
     But there were so many hillocks and banks to climb and pass, that, at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75410">
     length, I began to be weary, and told her we must halt, and retrace our
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75420">
     steps.  I shouted to her, as she had outstripped me a long way; she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75430">
     either did not hear or did not regard, for she still sprang on, and I was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75440">
     compelled to follow.  Finally, she dived into a hollow; and before I came
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75450">
     in sight of her again, she was two miles nearer Wuthering Heights than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75460">
     her own home; and I beheld a couple of persons arrest her, one of whom I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75470">
     felt convinced was Mr. Heathcliff himself.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75490">
     Cathy had been caught in the fact of plundering, or, at least, hunting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75500">
     out the nests of the grouse.  The Heights were Heathcliff's land, and he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75510">
     was reproving the poacher.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75530">
     'I've neither taken any nor found any,' she said, as I toiled to them,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75540">
     expanding her hands in corroboration of the statement.  'I didn't mean to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75550">
     take them; but papa told me there were quantities up here, and I wished
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75560">
     to see the eggs.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75580">
     Heathcliff glanced at me with an ill-meaning smile, expressing his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75590">
     acquaintance with the party, and, consequently, his malevolence towards
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75600">
     it, and demanded who 'papa' was?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75620">
     'Mr. Linton of Thrushcross Grange,' she replied.  'I thought you did not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75630">
     know me, or you wouldn't have spoken in that way.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75650">
     'You suppose papa is highly esteemed and respected, then?' he said,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75660">
     sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75680">
     'And what are you?' inquired Catherine, gazing curiously on the speaker.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75690">
     'That man I've seen before.  Is he your son?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75710">
     She pointed to Hareton, the other individual, who had gained nothing but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75720">
     increased bulk and strength by the addition of two years to his age: he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75730">
     seemed as awkward and rough as ever.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75750">
     'Miss Cathy,' I interrupted, 'it will be three hours instead of one that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75760">
     we are out, presently.  We really must go back.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75780">
     'No, that man is not my son,' answered Heathcliff, pushing me aside.  'But
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75790">
     I have one, and you have seen him before too; and, though your nurse is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75800">
     in a hurry, I think both you and she would be the better for a little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75810">
     rest.  Will you just turn this nab of heath, and walk into my house?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75820">
     You'll get home earlier for the ease; and you shall receive a kind
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75830">
     welcome.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75850">
     I whispered Catherine that she mustn't, on any account, accede to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75860">
     proposal: it was entirely out of the question.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75880">
     'Why?' she asked, aloud.  'I'm tired of running, and the ground is dewy:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75890">
     I can't sit here.  Let us go, Ellen.  Besides, he says I have seen his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75900">
     son.  He's mistaken, I think; but I guess where he lives: at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75910">
     farmhouse I visited in coming from Penistone Crags.  Don't you?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75930">
     'I do.  Come, Nelly, hold your tongue--it will be a treat for her to look
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75940">
     in on us.  Hareton, get forwards with the lass.  You shall walk with me,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75950">
     Nelly.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75970">
     'No, she's not going to any such place,' I cried, struggling to release
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75980">
     my arm, which he had seized: but she was almost at the door-stones
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_75990">
     already, scampering round the brow at full speed.  Her appointed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76000">
     companion did not pretend to escort her: he shied off by the road-side,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76010">
     and vanished.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76030">
     'Mr. Heathcliff, it's very wrong,' I continued: 'you know you mean no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76040">
     good.  And there she'll see Linton, and all will be told as soon as ever
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76050">
     we return; and I shall have the blame.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76070">
     'I want her to see Linton,' he answered; 'he's looking better these few
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76080">
     days; it's not often he's fit to be seen.  And we'll soon persuade her to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76090">
     keep the visit secret: where is the harm of it?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76110">
     'The harm of it is, that her father would hate me if he found I suffered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76120">
     her to enter your house; and I am convinced you have a bad design in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76130">
     encouraging her to do so,' I replied.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76150">
     'My design is as honest as possible.  I'll inform you of its whole
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76160">
     scope,' he said.  'That the two cousins may fall in love, and get
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76170">
     married.  I'm acting generously to your master: his young chit has no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76180">
     expectations, and should she second my wishes she'll be provided for at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76190">
     once as joint successor with Linton.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76210">
     'If Linton died,' I answered, 'and his life is quite uncertain, Catherine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76220">
     would be the heir.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76240">
     'No, she would not,' he said.  'There is no clause in the will to secure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76250">
     it so: his property would go to me; but, to prevent disputes, I desire
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76260">
     their union, and am resolved to bring it about.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76280">
     'And I'm resolved she shall never approach your house with me again,' I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76290">
     returned, as we reached the gate, where Miss Cathy waited our coming.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76310">
     Heathcliff bade me be quiet; and, preceding us up the path, hastened to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76320">
     open the door.  My young lady gave him several looks, as if she could not

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76330">
     exactly make up her mind what to think of him; but now he smiled when he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76340">
     met her eye, and softened his voice in addressing her; and I was foolish
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76350">
     enough to imagine the memory of her mother might disarm him from desiring
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76360">
     her injury.  Linton stood on the hearth.  He had been out walking in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76370">
     fields, for his cap was on, and he was calling to Joseph to bring him dry
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76380">
     shoes.  He had grown tall of his age, still wanting some months of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76390">
     sixteen.  His features were pretty yet, and his eye and complexion
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76400">
     brighter than I remembered them, though with merely temporary lustre
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76410">
     borrowed from the salubrious air and genial sun.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76430">
     'Now, who is that?' asked Mr. Heathcliff, turning to Cathy.  'Can you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76440">
     tell?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76460">
     'Your son?' she said, having doubtfully surveyed, first one and then the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76470">
     other.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76490">
     'Yes, yes,' answered he: 'but is this the only time you have beheld him?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76500">
     Think!  Ah! you have a short memory.  Linton, don't you recall your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76510">
     cousin, that you used to tease us so with wishing to see?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76530">
     'What, Linton!' cried Cathy, kindling into joyful surprise at the name.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76540">
     'Is that little Linton?  He's taller than I am!  Are you Linton?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76560">
     The youth stepped forward, and acknowledged himself: she kissed him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76570">
     fervently, and they gazed with wonder at the change time had wrought in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76580">
     the appearance of each.  Catherine had reached her full height; her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76590">
     figure was both plump and slender, elastic as steel, and her whole aspect
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76600">
     sparkling with health and spirits.  Linton's looks and movements were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76610">
     very languid, and his form extremely slight; but there was a grace in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76620">
     manner that mitigated these defects, and rendered him not unpleasing.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76630">
     After exchanging numerous marks of fondness with him, his cousin went to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76640">
     Mr. Heathcliff, who lingered by the door, dividing his attention between
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76650">
     the objects inside and those that lay without: pretending, that is, to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76660">
     observe the latter, and really noting the former alone.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76680">
     'And you are my uncle, then!' she cried, reaching up to salute him.  'I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76690">
     thought I liked you, though you were cross at first.  Why don't you visit
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76700">
     at the Grange with Linton?  To live all these years such close
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76710">
     neighbours, and never see us, is odd: what have you done so for?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76730">
     'I visited it once or twice too often before you were born,' he answered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76740">
     'There--damn it!  If you have any kisses to spare, give them to Linton:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76750">
     they are thrown away on me.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76770">
     'Naughty Ellen!' exclaimed Catherine, flying to attack me next with her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76780">
     lavish caresses.  'Wicked Ellen! to try to hinder me from entering.  But
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76790">
     I'll take this walk every morning in future: may I, uncle? and sometimes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76800">
     bring papa.  Won't you be glad to see us?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76820">
     'Of course,' replied the uncle, with a hardly suppressed grimace,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76830">
     resulting from his deep aversion to both the proposed visitors.  'But
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76840">
     stay,' he continued, turning towards the young lady.  'Now I think of it,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76850">
     I'd better tell you.  Mr. Linton has a prejudice against me: we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76860">
     quarrelled at one time of our lives, with unchristian ferocity; and, if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76870">
     you mention coming here to him, he'll put a veto on your visits
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76880">
     altogether.  Therefore, you must not mention it, unless you be careless
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76890">
     of seeing your cousin hereafter: you may come, if you will, but you must
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76900">
     not mention it.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76920">
     'Why did you quarrel?' asked Catherine, considerably crestfallen.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76940">
     'He thought me too poor to wed his sister,' answered Heathcliff, 'and was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76950">
     grieved that I got her: his pride was hurt, and he'll never forgive it.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76970">
     'That's wrong!' said the young lady: 'some time I'll tell him so.  But
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76980">
     Linton and I have no share in your quarrel.  I'll not come here, then; he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_76990">
     shall come to the Grange.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77010">
     'It will be too far for me,' murmured her cousin: 'to walk four miles
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77020">
     would kill me.  No, come here, Miss Catherine, now and then: not every
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77030">
     morning, but once or twice a week.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77050">
     The father launched towards his son a glance of bitter contempt.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77070">
     'I am afraid, Nelly, I shall lose my labour,' he muttered to me.  'Miss
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77080">
     Catherine, as the ninny calls her, will discover his value, and send him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77090">
     to the devil.  Now, if it had been Hareton!--Do you know that, twenty
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77100">
     times a day, I covet Hareton, with all his degradation?  I'd have loved
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77110">
     the lad had he been some one else.  But I think he's safe from _her_
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77120">
     love.  I'll pit him against that paltry creature, unless it bestir itself
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77130">
     briskly.  We calculate it will scarcely last till it is eighteen.  Oh,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77140">
     confound the vapid thing!  He's absorbed in drying his feet, and never
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77150">
     looks at her.--Linton!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77170">
     'Yes, father,' answered the boy.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77190">
     'Have you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about, not even a rabbit
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77200">
     or a weasel's nest?  Take her into the garden, before you change your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77210">
     shoes; and into the stable to see your horse.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77230">
     'Wouldn't you rather sit here?' asked Linton, addressing Cathy in a tone
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77240">
     which expressed reluctance to move again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77260">
     'I don't know,' she replied, casting a longing look to the door, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77270">
     evidently eager to be active.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77290">
     He kept his seat, and shrank closer to the fire.  Heathcliff rose, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77300">
     went into the kitchen, and from thence to the yard, calling out for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77310">
     Hareton.  Hareton responded, and presently the two re-entered.  The young
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77320">
     man had been washing himself, as was visible by the glow on his cheeks
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77330">
     and his wetted hair.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77350">
     'Oh, I'll ask _you_, uncle,' cried Miss Cathy, recollecting the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77360">
     housekeeper's assertion.  'That is not my cousin, is he?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77380">
     'Yes,' he, replied, 'your mother's nephew.  Don't you like him!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77400">
     Catherine looked queer.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77420">
     'Is he not a handsome lad?' he continued.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77440">
     The uncivil little thing stood on tiptoe, and whispered a sentence in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77450">
     Heathcliff's ear.  He laughed; Hareton darkened: I perceived he was very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77460">
     sensitive to suspected slights, and had obviously a dim notion of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77470">
     inferiority.  But his master or guardian chased the frown by exclaiming--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77490">
     'You'll be the favourite among us, Hareton!  She says you are a--What was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77500">
     it?  Well, something very flattering.  Here! you go with her round the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77510">
     farm.  And behave like a gentleman, mind!  Don't use any bad words; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77520">
     don't stare when the young lady is not looking at you, and be ready to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77530">
     hide your face when she is; and, when you speak, say your words slowly,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77540">
     and keep your hands out of your pockets.  Be off, and entertain her as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77550">
     nicely as you can.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77570">
     He watched the couple walking past the window.  Earnshaw had his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77580">
     countenance completely averted from his companion.  He seemed studying
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77590">
     the familiar landscape with a stranger's and an artist's interest.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77600">
     Catherine took a sly look at him, expressing small admiration.  She then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77610">
     turned her attention to seeking out objects of amusement for herself, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77620">
     tripped merrily on, lilting a tune to supply the lack of conversation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77640">
     'I've tied his tongue,' observed Heathcliff.  'He'll not venture a single
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77650">
     syllable all the time!  Nelly, you recollect me at his age--nay, some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77660">
     years younger.  Did I ever look so stupid: so "gaumless," as Joseph calls
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77670">
     it?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77690">
     'Worse,' I replied, 'because more sullen with it.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77710">
     'I've a pleasure in him,' he continued, reflecting aloud. 'He has
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77720">
     satisfied my expectations. If he were a born fool I should not enjoy it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77730">
     half so much. But he's no fool; and I can sympathise with all his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77740">
     feelings, having felt them myself. I know what he suffers now, for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77750">
     instance, exactly: it is merely a beginning of what he shall suffer,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77760">
     though. And he'll never be able to emerge from his bathos of coarseness
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77770">
     and ignorance. I've got him faster than his scoundrel of a father
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77780">
     secured me, and lower; for he takes a pride in his brutishness. I've
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77790">
     taught him to scorn everything extra-animal as silly and weak. Don't you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77800">
     think Hindley would be proud of his son, if he could see him? almost as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77810">
     proud as I am of mine. But there's this difference; one is gold put to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77820">
     the use of paving-stones, and the other is tin polished to ape a service
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77830">
     of silver. _Mine_ has nothing valuable about it; yet I shall have the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77840">
     merit of making it go as far as such poor stuff can go. _His_ had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77850">
     first-rate qualities, and they are lost: rendered worse than unavailing.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77860">
     I have nothing to regret; he would have more than any but I are aware
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77870">
     of. And the best of it is, Hareton is damnably fond of me! You'll own
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77880">
     that I've outmatched Hindley there. If the dead villain could rise from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77890">
     his grave to abuse me for his offspring's wrongs, I should have the fun
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77900">
     of seeing the said offspring fight him back again, indignant that he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77910">
     should dare to rail at the one friend he has in the world!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77930">
     Heathcliff chuckled a fiendish laugh at the idea.  I made no reply,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77940">
     because I saw that he expected none.  Meantime, our young companion, who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77950">
     sat too removed from us to hear what was said, began to evince symptoms
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77960">
     of uneasiness, probably repenting that he had denied himself the treat of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77970">
     Catherine's society for fear of a little fatigue.  His father remarked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77980">
     the restless glances wandering to the window, and the hand irresolutely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_77990">
     extended towards his cap.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78010">
     'Get up, you idle boy!' he exclaimed, with assumed heartiness.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78030">
     'Away after them! they are just at the corner, by the stand of hives.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78050">
     Linton gathered his energies, and left the hearth.  The lattice was open,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78060">
     and, as he stepped out, I heard Cathy inquiring of her unsociable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78070">
     attendant what was that inscription over the door? Hareton stared up, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78080">
     scratched his head like a true clown.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78100">
     'It's some damnable writing,' he answered.  'I cannot read it.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78120">
     'Can't read it?' cried Catherine; 'I can read it: it's English.  But I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78130">
     want to know why it is there.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78150">
     Linton giggled: the first appearance of mirth he had exhibited.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78170">
     'He does not know his letters,' he said to his cousin.  'Could you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78180">
     believe in the existence of such a colossal dunce?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78200">
     'Is he all as he should be?' asked Miss Cathy, seriously; 'or is he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78210">
     simple: not right?  I've questioned him twice now, and each time he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78220">
     looked so stupid I think he does not understand me.  I can hardly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78230">
     understand him, I'm sure!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78250">
     Linton repeated his laugh, and glanced at Hareton tauntingly; who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78260">
     certainly did not seem quite clear of comprehension at that moment.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78280">
     'There's nothing the matter but laziness; is there, Earnshaw?' he said.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78290">
     'My cousin fancies you are an idiot.  There you experience the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78300">
     consequence of scorning "book-larning," as you would say.  Have you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78310">
     noticed, Catherine, his frightful Yorkshire pronunciation?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78330">
     'Why, where the devil is the use on't?' growled Hareton, more ready in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78340">
     answering his daily companion.  He was about to enlarge further, but the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78350">
     two youngsters broke into a noisy fit of merriment: my giddy miss being
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78360">
     delighted to discover that she might turn his strange talk to matter of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78370">
     amusement.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78390">
     'Where is the use of the devil in that sentence?' tittered Linton.  'Papa
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78400">
     told you not to say any bad words, and you can't open your mouth without
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78410">
     one.  Do try to behave like a gentleman, now do!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78430">
     'If thou weren't more a lass than a lad, I'd fell thee this minute, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78440">
     would; pitiful lath of a crater!' retorted the angry boor, retreating,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78450">
     while his face burnt with mingled rage and mortification! for he was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78460">
     conscious of being insulted, and embarrassed how to resent it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78480">
     Mr. Heathcliff having overheard the conversation, as well as I, smiled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78490">
     when he saw him go; but immediately afterwards cast a look of singular
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78500">
     aversion on the flippant pair, who remained chattering in the door-way:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78510">
     the boy finding animation enough while discussing Hareton's faults and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78520">
     deficiencies, and relating anecdotes of his goings on; and the girl
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78530">
     relishing his pert and spiteful sayings, without considering the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78540">
     ill-nature they evinced.  I began to dislike, more than to compassionate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78550">
     Linton, and to excuse his father in some measure for holding him cheap.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78570">
     We stayed till afternoon: I could not tear Miss Cathy away sooner; but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78580">
     happily my master had not quitted his apartment, and remained ignorant of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78590">
     our prolonged absence.  As we walked home, I would fain have enlightened
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78600">
     my charge on the characters of the people we had quitted: but she got it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78610">
     into her head that I was prejudiced against them.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78630">
     'Aha!' she cried, 'you take papa's side, Ellen: you are partial I know;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78640">
     or else you wouldn't have cheated me so many years into the notion that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78650">
     Linton lived a long way from here.  I'm really extremely angry; only I'm
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78660">
     so pleased I can't show it!  But you must hold your tongue about _my_
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78670">
     uncle; he's my uncle, remember; and I'll scold papa for quarrelling with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78680">
     him.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78700">
     And so she ran on, till I relinquished the endeavour to convince her of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78710">
     her mistake.  She did not mention the visit that night, because she did
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78720">
     not see Mr. Linton.  Next day it all came out, sadly to my chagrin; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78730">
     still I was not altogether sorry: I thought the burden of directing and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78740">
     warning would be more efficiently borne by him than me.  But he was too
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78750">
     timid in giving satisfactory reasons for his wish that she should shun
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78760">
     connection with the household of the Heights, and Catherine liked good
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78770">
     reasons for every restraint that harassed her petted will.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78790">
     'Papa!' she exclaimed, after the morning's salutations, 'guess whom I saw
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78800">
     yesterday, in my walk on the moors.  Ah, papa, you started! you've not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78810">
     done right, have you, now?  I saw--but listen, and you shall hear how I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78820">
     found you out; and Ellen, who is in league with you, and yet pretended to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78830">
     pity me so, when I kept hoping, and was always disappointed about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78840">
     Linton's coming back!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78860">
     She gave a faithful account of her excursion and its consequences; and my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78870">
     master, though he cast more than one reproachful look at me, said nothing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78880">
     till she had concluded.  Then he drew her to him, and asked if she knew
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78890">
     why he had concealed Linton's near neighbourhood from her?  Could she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78900">
     think it was to deny her a pleasure that she might harmlessly enjoy?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78920">
     'It was because you disliked Mr. Heathcliff,' she answered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78940">
     'Then you believe I care more for my own feelings than yours, Cathy?' he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78950">
     said.  'No, it was not because I disliked Mr. Heathcliff, but because Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78960">
     Heathcliff dislikes me; and is a most diabolical man, delighting to wrong
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78970">
     and ruin those he hates, if they give him the slightest opportunity.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78980">
     knew that you could not keep up an acquaintance with your cousin without
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_78990">
     being brought into contact with him; and I knew he would detest you on my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79000">
     account; so for your own good, and nothing else, I took precautions that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79010">
     you should not see Linton again.  I meant to explain this some time as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79020">
     you grew older, and I'm sorry I delayed it.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79040">
     'But Mr. Heathcliff was quite cordial, papa,' observed Catherine, not at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79050">
     all convinced; 'and he didn't object to our seeing each other: he said I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79060">
     might come to his house when I pleased; only I must not tell you, because
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79070">
     you had quarrelled with him, and would not forgive him for marrying aunt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79080">
     Isabella.  And you won't.  _You_ are the one to be blamed: he is willing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79090">
     to let us be friends, at least; Linton and I; and you are not.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79110">
     My master, perceiving that she would not take his word for her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79120">
     uncle-in-law's evil disposition, gave a hasty sketch of his conduct to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79130">
     Isabella, and the manner in which Wuthering Heights became his property.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79140">
     He could not bear to discourse long upon the topic; for though he spoke
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79150">
     little of it, he still felt the same horror and detestation of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79160">
     ancient enemy that had occupied his heart ever since Mrs. Linton's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79170">
     death. 'She might have been living yet, if it had not been for him!' was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79180">
     his constant bitter reflection; and, in his eyes, Heathcliff seemed a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79190">
     murderer. Miss Cathy--conversant with no bad deeds except her own slight
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79200">
     acts of disobedience, injustice, and passion, arising from hot temper
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79210">
     and thoughtlessness, and repented of on the day they were committed--was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79220">
     amazed at the blackness of spirit that could brood on and cover revenge
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79230">
     for years, and deliberately prosecute its plans without a visitation of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79240">
     remorse. She appeared so deeply impressed and shocked at this new view
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79250">
     of human nature--excluded from all her studies and all her ideas till
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79260">
     now--that Mr. Edgar deemed it unnecessary to pursue the subject. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79270">
     merely added: 'You will know hereafter, darling, why I wish you to avoid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79280">
     his house and family; now return to your old employments and amusements,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79290">
     and think no more about them.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79310">
     Catherine kissed her father, and sat down quietly to her lessons for a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79320">
     couple of hours, according to custom; then she accompanied him into the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79330">
     grounds, and the whole day passed as usual: but in the evening, when she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79340">
     had retired to her room, and I went to help her to undress, I found her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79350">
     crying, on her knees by the bedside.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79370">
     'Oh, fie, silly child!' I exclaimed.  'If you had any real griefs you'd
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79380">
     be ashamed to waste a tear on this little contrariety.  You never had one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79390">
     shadow of substantial sorrow, Miss Catherine.  Suppose, for a minute,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79400">
     that master and I were dead, and you were by yourself in the world: how
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79410">
     would you feel, then?  Compare the present occasion with such an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79420">
     affliction as that, and be thankful for the friends you have, instead of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79430">
     coveting more.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79450">
     'I'm not crying for myself, Ellen,' she answered, 'it's for him.  He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79460">
     expected to see me again to-morrow, and there he'll be so disappointed:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79470">
     and he'll wait for me, and I sha'n't come!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79490">
     'Nonsense!' said I, 'do you imagine he has thought as much of you as you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79500">
     have of him?  Hasn't he Hareton for a companion?  Not one in a hundred
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79510">
     would weep at losing a relation they had just seen twice, for two
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79520">
     afternoons.  Linton will conjecture how it is, and trouble himself no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79530">
     further about you.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79550">
     'But may I not write a note to tell him why I cannot come?' she asked,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79560">
     rising to her feet.  'And just send those books I promised to lend him?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79570">
     His books are not as nice as mine, and he wanted to have them extremely,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79580">
     when I told him how interesting they were.  May I not, Ellen?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79600">
     'No, indeed! no, indeed!' replied I with decision.  'Then he would write
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79610">
     to you, and there'd never be an end of it.  No, Miss Catherine, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79620">
     acquaintance must be dropped entirely: so papa expects, and I shall see
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79630">
     that it is done.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79650">
     'But how can one little note--?' she recommenced, putting on an imploring
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79660">
     countenance.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79680">
     'Silence!' I interrupted.  'We'll not begin with your little notes.  Get
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79690">
     into bed.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79710">
     She threw at me a very naughty look, so naughty that I would not kiss her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79720">
     good-night at first: I covered her up, and shut her door, in great
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79730">
     displeasure; but, repenting half-way, I returned softly, and lo! there
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79740">
     was Miss standing at the table with a bit of blank paper before her and a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79750">
     pencil in her hand, which she guiltily slipped out of sight on my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79760">
     entrance.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79780">
     'You'll get nobody to take that, Catherine,' I said, 'if you write it;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79790">
     and at present I shall put out your candle.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79810">
     I set the extinguisher on the flame, receiving as I did so a slap on my

     hand and a petulant 'cross thing!'  I then quitted her again, and she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79830">
     drew the bolt in one of her worst, most peevish humours.  The letter was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79840">
     finished and forwarded to its destination by a milk-fetcher who came from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79850">
     the village; but that I didn't learn till some time afterwards.  Weeks
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79860">
     passed on, and Cathy recovered her temper; though she grew wondrous fond
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79870">
     of stealing off to corners by herself and often, if I came near her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79880">
     suddenly while reading, she would start and bend over the book, evidently
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79890">
     desirous to hide it; and I detected edges of loose paper sticking out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79900">
     beyond the leaves.  She also got a trick of coming down early in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79910">
     morning and lingering about the kitchen, as if she were expecting the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79920">
     arrival of something; and she had a small drawer in a cabinet in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79930">
     library, which she would trifle over for hours, and whose key she took
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79940">
     special care to remove when she left it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79960">
     One day, as she inspected this drawer, I observed that the playthings and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79970">
     trinkets which recently formed its contents were transmuted into bits of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79980">
     folded paper.  My curiosity and suspicions were roused; I determined to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_79990">
     take a peep at her mysterious treasures; so, at night, as soon as she and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80000">
     my master were safe upstairs, I searched, and readily found among my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80010">
     house keys one that would fit the lock.  Having opened, I emptied the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80020">
     whole contents into my apron, and took them with me to examine at leisure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80030">
     in my own chamber.  Though I could not but suspect, I was still surprised
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80040">
     to discover that they were a mass of correspondence--daily almost, it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80050">
     must have been--from Linton Heathcliff: answers to documents forwarded by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80060">
     her.  The earlier dated were embarrassed and short; gradually, however,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80070">
     they expanded into copious love-letters, foolish, as the age of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80080">
     writer rendered natural, yet with touches here and there which I thought
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80090">
     were borrowed from a more experienced source.  Some of them struck me as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80100">
     singularly odd compounds of ardour and flatness; commencing in strong
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80110">
     feeling, and concluding in the affected, wordy style that a schoolboy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80120">
     might use to a fancied, incorporeal sweetheart.  Whether they satisfied
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80130">
     Cathy I don't know; but they appeared very worthless trash to me.  After
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80140">
     turning over as many as I thought proper, I tied them in a handkerchief
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80150">
     and set them aside, relocking the vacant drawer.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80170">
     Following her habit, my young lady descended early, and visited the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80180">
     kitchen: I watched her go to the door, on the arrival of a certain little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80190">
     boy; and, while the dairymaid filled his can, she tucked something into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80200">
     his jacket pocket, and plucked something out.  I went round by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80210">
     garden, and laid wait for the messenger; who fought valorously to defend
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80220">
     his trust, and we spilt the milk between us; but I succeeded in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80230">
     abstracting the epistle; and, threatening serious consequences if he did
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80240">
     not look sharp home, I remained under the wall and perused Miss Cathy's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80250">
     affectionate composition.  It was more simple and more eloquent than her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80260">
     cousin's: very pretty and very silly.  I shook my head, and went
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80270">
     meditating into the house.  The day being wet, she could not divert
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80280">
     herself with rambling about the park; so, at the conclusion of her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80290">
     morning studies, she resorted to the solace of the drawer.  Her father
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80300">
     sat reading at the table; and I, on purpose, had sought a bit of work in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80310">
     some unripped fringes of the window-curtain, keeping my eye steadily
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80320">
     fixed on her proceedings.  Never did any bird flying back to a plundered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80330">
     nest, which it had left brimful of chirping young ones, express more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80340">
     complete despair, in its anguished cries and flutterings, than she by her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80350">
     single 'Oh!' and the change that transfigured her late happy countenance.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80360">
     Mr. Linton looked up.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80380">
     'What is the matter, love?  Have you hurt yourself?' he said.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80400">
     His tone and look assured her _he_ had not been the discoverer of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80410">
     hoard.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80430">
     'No, papa!' she gasped.  'Ellen! Ellen! come up-stairs--I'm sick!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80450">
     I obeyed her summons, and accompanied her out.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80470">
     'Oh, Ellen! you have got them,' she commenced immediately, dropping on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80480">
     her knees, when we were enclosed alone.  'Oh, give them to me, and I'll
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80490">
     never, never do so again!  Don't tell papa.  You have not told papa,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80500">
     Ellen? say you have not?  I've been exceedingly naughty, but I won't do
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80510">
     it any more!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80530">
     With a grave severity in my manner I bade her stand up.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80550">
     'So,' I exclaimed, 'Miss Catherine, you are tolerably far on, it seems:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80560">
     you may well be ashamed of them!  A fine bundle of trash you study in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80570">
     your leisure hours, to be sure: why, it's good enough to be printed!  And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80580">
     what do you suppose the master will think when I display it before him?  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80590">
     hav'n't shown it yet, but you needn't imagine I shall keep your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80600">
     ridiculous secrets.  For shame! and you must have led the way in writing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80610">
     such absurdities: he would not have thought of beginning, I'm certain.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80630">
     'I didn't!  I didn't!' sobbed Cathy, fit to break her heart.  'I didn't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80640">
     once think of loving him till--'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80660">
     '_Loving_!' cried I, as scornfully as I could utter the word.  '_Loving_!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80670">
     Did anybody ever hear the like!  I might just as well talk of loving the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80680">
     miller who comes once a year to buy our corn.  Pretty loving, indeed! and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80690">
     both times together you have seen Linton hardly four hours in your life!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80700">
     Now here is the babyish trash.  I'm going with it to the library; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80710">
     we'll see what your father says to such _loving_.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80730">
     She sprang at her precious epistles, but I held them above my head; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80740">
     then she poured out further frantic entreaties that I would burn them--do
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80750">
     anything rather than show them.  And being really fully as much inclined
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80760">
     to laugh as scold--for I esteemed it all girlish vanity--I at length
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80770">
     relented in a measure, and asked,--'If I consent to burn them, will you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80780">
     promise faithfully neither to send nor receive a letter again, nor a book
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80790">
     (for I perceive you have sent him books), nor locks of hair, nor rings,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80800">
     nor playthings?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80820">
     'We don't send playthings,' cried Catherine, her pride overcoming her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80830">
     shame.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80850">
     'Nor anything at all, then, my lady?' I said.  'Unless you will, here I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80860">
     go.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80880">
     'I promise, Ellen!' she cried, catching my dress.  'Oh, put them in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80890">
     fire, do, do!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80910">
     But when I proceeded to open a place with the poker the sacrifice was too
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80920">
     painful to be borne.  She earnestly supplicated that I would spare her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80930">
     one or two.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80950">
     'One or two, Ellen, to keep for Linton's sake!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80970">
     I unknotted the handkerchief, and commenced dropping them in from an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_80980">
     angle, and the flame curled up the chimney.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81000">
     'I will have one, you cruel wretch!' she screamed, darting her hand into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81010">
     the fire, and drawing forth some half-consumed fragments, at the expense
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81020">
     of her fingers.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81040">
     'Very well--and I will have some to exhibit to papa!'  I answered,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81050">
     shaking back the rest into the bundle, and turning anew to the door.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81070">
     She emptied her blackened pieces into the flames, and motioned me to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81080">
     finish the immolation.  It was done; I stirred up the ashes, and interred
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81090">
     them under a shovelful of coals; and she mutely, and with a sense of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81100">
     intense injury, retired to her private apartment.  I descended to tell my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81110">
     master that the young lady's qualm of sickness was almost gone, but I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81120">
     judged it best for her to lie down a while.  She wouldn't dine; but she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81130">
     reappeared at tea, pale, and red about the eyes, and marvellously subdued
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81140">
     in outward aspect.  Next morning I answered the letter by a slip of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81150">
     paper, inscribed, 'Master Heathcliff is requested to send no more notes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81160">
     to Miss Linton, as she will not receive them.'  And, henceforth, the

     little boy came with vacant pockets.

     Summer drew to an end, and early autumn: it was past Michaelmas, but the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81250">
     harvest was late that year, and a few of our fields were still uncleared.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81260">
     Mr. Linton and his daughter would frequently walk out among the reapers;

     at the carrying of the last sheaves they stayed till dusk, and the

     settled obstinately on his lungs, and confined him indoors throughout the

     whole of the winter, nearly without intermission.

     Poor Cathy, frightened from her little romance, had been considerably
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81330">
     sadder and duller since its abandonment; and her father insisted on her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81340">
     reading less, and taking more exercise.  She had his companionship no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81350">
     longer; I esteemed it a duty to supply its lack, as much as possible,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81360">
     with mine: an inefficient substitute; for I could only spare two or three

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81370">
     hours, from my numerous diurnal occupations, to follow her footsteps, and

     then my society was obviously less desirable than his.

     On an afternoon in October, or the beginning of November--a fresh watery
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81410">
     afternoon, when the turf and paths were rustling with moist, withered
    </p>

     leaves, and the cold blue sky was half hidden by clouds--dark grey
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81430">
     streamers, rapidly mounting from the west, and boding abundant rain--I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81440">
     requested my young lady to forego her ramble, because I was certain of

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81450">
     showers.  She refused; and I unwillingly donned a cloak, and took my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81460">
     umbrella to accompany her on a stroll to the bottom of the park: a formal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81470">
     walk which she generally affected if low-spirited--and that she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81480">
     invariably was when Mr. Edgar had been worse than ordinary, a thing never

     known from his confession, but guessed both by her and me from his

     increased silence and the melancholy of his countenance.  She went sadly

     on: there was no running or bounding now, though the chill wind might

     well have tempted her to race.  And often, from the side of my eye, I

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81530">
     could detect her raising a hand, and brushing something off her cheek.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81540">
     gazed round for a means of diverting her thoughts.  On one side of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81550">
     road rose a high, rough bank, where hazels and stunted oaks, with their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81560">
     roots half exposed, held uncertain tenure: the soil was too loose for the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81570">
     latter; and strong winds had blown some nearly horizontal.  In summer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81580">
     Miss Catherine delighted to climb along these trunks, and sit in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81590">
     branches, swinging twenty feet above the ground; and I, pleased with her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81600">
     agility and her light, childish heart, still considered it proper to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81610">
     scold every time I caught her at such an elevation, but so that she knew
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81620">
     there was no necessity for descending.  From dinner to tea she would lie
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81630">
     in her breeze-rocked cradle, doing nothing except singing old songs--my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81640">
     nursery lore--to herself, or watching the birds, joint tenants, feed and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81650">
     entice their young ones to fly: or nestling with closed lids, half
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81660">
     thinking, half dreaming, happier than words can express.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81680">
     'Look, Miss!' I exclaimed, pointing to a nook under the roots of one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81690">
     twisted tree.  'Winter is not here yet.  There's a little flower up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81700">
     yonder, the last bud from the multitude of bluebells that clouded those
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81710">
     turf steps in July with a lilac mist.  Will you clamber up, and pluck it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81720">
     to show to papa?'  Cathy stared a long time at the lonely blossom
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81730">
     trembling in its earthy shelter, and replied, at length--'No, I'll not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81740">
     touch it: but it looks melancholy, does it not, Ellen?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81760">
     'Yes,' I observed, 'about as starved and suckless as you: your cheeks are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81770">
     bloodless; let us take hold of hands and run.  You're so low, I daresay I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81780">
     shall keep up with you.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81800">
     'No,' she repeated, and continued sauntering on, pausing at intervals to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81810">
     muse over a bit of moss, or a tuft of blanched grass, or a fungus
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81820">
     spreading its bright orange among the heaps of brown foliage; and, ever
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81830">
     and anon, her hand was lifted to her averted face.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81850">
     'Catherine, why are you crying, love?' I asked, approaching and putting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81860">
     my arm over her shoulder.  'You mustn't cry because papa has a cold; be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81870">
     thankful it is nothing worse.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81890">
     She now put no further restraint on her tears; her breath was stifled by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81900">
     sobs.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81920">
     'Oh, it will be something worse,' she said.  'And what shall I do when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81930">
     papa and you leave me, and I am by myself?  I can't forget your words,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81940">
     Ellen; they are always in my ear.  How life will be changed, how dreary
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81950">
     the world will be, when papa and you are dead.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81970">
     'None can tell whether you won't die before us,' I replied.  'It's wrong
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81980">
     to anticipate evil.  We'll hope there are years and years to come before
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_81990">
     any of us go: master is young, and I am strong, and hardly forty-five.  My
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82000">
     mother lived till eighty, a canty dame to the last.  And suppose Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82010">
     Linton were spared till he saw sixty, that would be more years than you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82020">
     have counted, Miss.  And would it not be foolish to mourn a calamity
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82030">
     above twenty years beforehand?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82050">
     'But Aunt Isabella was younger than papa,' she remarked, gazing up with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82060">
     timid hope to seek further consolation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82080">
     'Aunt Isabella had not you and me to nurse her,' I replied.  'She wasn't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82090">
     as happy as Master: she hadn't as much to live for.  All you need do, is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82100">
     to wait well on your father, and cheer him by letting him see you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82110">
     cheerful; and avoid giving him anxiety on any subject: mind that, Cathy!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82120">
     I'll not disguise but you might kill him if you were wild and reckless,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82130">
     and cherished a foolish, fanciful affection for the son of a person who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82140">
     would be glad to have him in his grave; and allowed him to discover that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82150">
     you fretted over the separation he has judged it expedient to make.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82170">
     'I fret about nothing on earth except papa's illness,' answered my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82180">
     companion.  'I care for nothing in comparison with papa.  And I'll
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82190">
     never--never--oh, never, while I have my senses, do an act or say a word
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82200">
     to vex him.  I love him better than myself, Ellen; and I know it by this:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82210">
     I pray every night that I may live after him; because I would rather be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82220">
     miserable than that he should be: that proves I love him better than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82230">
     myself.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82250">
     'Good words,' I replied.  'But deeds must prove it also; and after he is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82260">
     well, remember you don't forget resolutions formed in the hour of fear.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82280">
     As we talked, we neared a door that opened on the road; and my young
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82290">
     lady, lightening into sunshine again, climbed up and seated herself on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82300">
     the top of the wall, reaching over to gather some hips that bloomed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82310">
     scarlet on the summit branches of the wild-rose trees shadowing the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82320">
     highway side: the lower fruit had disappeared, but only birds could touch
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82330">
     the upper, except from Cathy's present station.  In stretching to pull
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82340">
     them, her hat fell off; and as the door was locked, she proposed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82350">
     scrambling down to recover it.  I bid her be cautious lest she got a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82360">
     fall, and she nimbly disappeared.  But the return was no such easy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82370">
     matter: the stones were smooth and neatly cemented, and the rose-bushes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82380">
     and black-berry stragglers could yield no assistance in re-ascending.  I,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82390">
     like a fool, didn't recollect that, till I heard her laughing and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82400">
     exclaiming--'Ellen! you'll have to fetch the key, or else I must run
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82410">
     round to the porter's lodge.  I can't scale the ramparts on this side!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82430">
     'Stay where you are,' I answered; 'I have my bundle of keys in my pocket:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82440">
     perhaps I may manage to open it; if not, I'll go.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82460">
     Catherine amused herself with dancing to and fro before the door, while I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82470">
     tried all the large keys in succession.  I had applied the last, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82480">
     found that none would do; so, repeating my desire that she would remain
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82490">
     there, I was about to hurry home as fast as I could, when an approaching
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82500">
     sound arrested me.  It was the trot of a horse; Cathy's dance stopped
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82510">
     also.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82530">
     'Who is that?' I whispered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82550">
     'Ellen, I wish you could open the door,' whispered back my companion,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82560">
     anxiously.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82580">
     'Ho, Miss Linton!' cried a deep voice (the rider's), 'I'm glad to meet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82590">
     you.  Don't be in haste to enter, for I have an explanation to ask and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82600">
     obtain.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82620">
     'I sha'n't speak to you, Mr. Heathcliff,' answered Catherine.  'Papa says
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82630">
     you are a wicked man, and you hate both him and me; and Ellen says the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82640">
     same.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82660">
     'That is nothing to the purpose,' said Heathcliff.  (He it was.)  'I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82670">
     don't hate my son, I suppose; and it is concerning him that I demand your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82680">
     attention.  Yes; you have cause to blush.  Two or three months since,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82690">
     were you not in the habit of writing to Linton? making love in play, eh?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82700">
     You deserved, both of you, flogging for that!  You especially, the elder;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82710">
     and less sensitive, as it turns out.  I've got your letters, and if you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82720">
     give me any pertness I'll send them to your father.  I presume you grew
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82730">
     weary of the amusement and dropped it, didn't you?  Well, you dropped
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82740">
     Linton with it into a Slough of Despond.  He was in earnest: in love,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82750">
     really.  As true as I live, he's dying for you; breaking his heart at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82760">
     your fickleness: not figuratively, but actually.  Though Hareton has made
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82770">
     him a standing jest for six weeks, and I have used more serious measures,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82780">
     and attempted to frighten him out of his idiotcy, he gets worse daily;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82790">
     and he'll be under the sod before summer, unless you restore him!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82810">
     'How can you lie so glaringly to the poor child?' I called from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82820">
     inside.  'Pray ride on!  How can you deliberately get up such paltry
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82830">
     falsehoods?  Miss Cathy, I'll knock the lock off with a stone: you won't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82840">
     believe that vile nonsense.  You can feel in yourself it is impossible
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82850">
     that a person should die for love of a stranger.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82870">
     'I was not aware there were eavesdroppers,' muttered the detected
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82880">
     villain. 'Worthy Mrs. Dean, I like you, but I don't like your

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82890">
     double-dealing,' he added aloud. 'How could _you_ lie so glaringly as to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82900">
     affirm I hated the "poor child"? and invent bugbear stories to terrify
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82930">
     spoken truth: do, there's a darling! Just imagine your father in my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82940">
     place, and Linton in yours; then think how you would value your careless
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82950">
     lover if he refused to stir a step to comfort you, when your father
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82960">
     himself entreated him; and don't, from pure stupidity, fall into the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82970">
     same error. I swear, on my salvation, he's going to his grave, and none
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_82980">
     but you can save him!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83000">
     The lock gave way and I issued out.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83020">
     'I swear Linton is dying,' repeated Heathcliff, looking hard at me.  'And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83030">
     grief and disappointment are hastening his death.  Nelly, if you won't

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83050">
     time next week; and I think your master himself would scarcely object to

     her visiting her cousin.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83080">
     'Come in,' said I, taking Cathy by the arm and half forcing her to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83090">
     re-enter; for she lingered, viewing with troubled eyes the features of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83100">
     the speaker, too stern to express his inward deceit.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83120">
     He pushed his horse close, and, bending down, observed--'Miss Catherine,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83130">
     I'll own to you that I have little patience with Linton; and Hareton and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83140">
     Joseph have less.  I'll own that he's with a harsh set.  He pines for

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83150">
     kindness, as well as love; and a kind word from you would be his best
    </p>

     medicine.  Don't mind Mrs. Dean's cruel cautions; but be generous, and

     I closed the door, and rolled a stone to assist the loosened lock in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83210">
     holding it; and spreading my umbrella, I drew my charge underneath: for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83220">
     the rain began to drive through the moaning branches of the trees, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83230">
     warned us to avoid delay.  Our hurry prevented any comment on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83240">
     encounter with Heathcliff, as we stretched towards home; but I divined
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83250">
     instinctively that Catherine's heart was clouded now in double darkness.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83260">
     Her features were so sad, they did not seem hers: she evidently regarded
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83270">
     what she had heard as every syllable true.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83290">
     The master had retired to rest before we came in.  Cathy stole to his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83300">
     room to inquire how he was; he had fallen asleep.  She returned, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83310">
     asked me to sit with her in the library.  We took our tea together; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83320">
     afterwards she lay down on the rug, and told me not to talk, for she was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83330">
     weary.  I got a book, and pretended to read.  As soon as she supposed me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83340">
     absorbed in my occupation, she recommenced her silent weeping: it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83350">
     appeared, at present, her favourite diversion.  I suffered her to enjoy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83360">
     it a while; then I expostulated: deriding and ridiculing all Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83370">
     Heathcliff's assertions about his son, as if I were certain she would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83380">
     coincide.  Alas!  I hadn't skill to counteract the effect his account had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83390">
     produced: it was just what he intended.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83410">
     'You may be right, Ellen,' she answered; 'but I shall never feel at ease
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83420">
     till I know.  And I must tell Linton it is not my fault that I don't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83430">
     write, and convince him that I shall not change.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83450">
     What use were anger and protestations against her silly credulity?  We
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83460">
     parted that night--hostile; but next day beheld me on the road to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83470">
     Wuthering Heights, by the side of my wilful young mistress's pony.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83480">
     couldn't bear to witness her sorrow: to see her pale, dejected
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83490">
     countenance, and heavy eyes: and I yielded, in the faint hope that Linton
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83500">
     himself might prove, by his reception of us, how little of the tale was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83510">
     founded on fact.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83580">
     The rainy night had ushered in a misty morning--half frost, half
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83590">
     drizzle--and temporary brooks crossed our path--gurgling from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83600">
     uplands.  My feet were thoroughly wetted; I was cross and low; exactly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83610">
     the humour suited for making the most of these disagreeable things.  We
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83620">
     entered the farm-house by the kitchen way, to ascertain whether Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83630">
     Heathcliff were really absent: because I put slight faith in his own
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83640">
     affirmation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83660">
     Joseph seemed sitting in a sort of elysium alone, beside a roaring fire;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83670">
     a quart of ale on the table near him, bristling with large pieces of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83680">
     toasted oat-cake; and his black, short pipe in his mouth.  Catherine ran
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83690">
     to the hearth to warm herself.  I asked if the master was in?  My
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83700">
     question remained so long unanswered, that I thought the old man had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83710">
     grown deaf, and repeated it louder.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83730">
     'Na--ay!' he snarled, or rather screamed through his nose.  'Na--ay! yah
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83740">
     muh goa back whear yah coom frough.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83760">
     'Joseph!' cried a peevish voice, simultaneously with me, from the inner
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83770">
     room.  'How often am I to call you?  There are only a few red ashes now.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83780">
     Joseph! come this moment.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83800">
     Vigorous puffs, and a resolute stare into the grate, declared he had no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83810">
     ear for this appeal.  The housekeeper and Hareton were invisible; one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83820">
     gone on an errand, and the other at his work, probably.  We knew Linton's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83830">
     tones, and entered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83850">
     'Oh, I hope you'll die in a garret, starved to death!' said the boy,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83860">
     mistaking our approach for that of his negligent attendant.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83880">
     He stopped on observing his error: his cousin flew to him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83900">
     'Is that you, Miss Linton?' he said, raising his head from the arm of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83910">
     great chair, in which he reclined.  'No--don't kiss me: it takes my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83920">
     breath.  Dear me!  Papa said you would call,' continued he, after
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83930">
     recovering a little from Catherine's embrace; while she stood by looking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83940">
     very contrite.  'Will you shut the door, if you please? you left it open;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83950">
     and those--those _detestable_ creatures won't bring coals to the fire.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83960">
     It's so cold!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83980">
     I stirred up the cinders, and fetched a scuttleful myself.  The invalid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_83990">
     complained of being covered with ashes; but he had a tiresome cough, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84000">
     looked feverish and ill, so I did not rebuke his temper.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84020">
     'Well, Linton,' murmured Catherine, when his corrugated brow relaxed,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84030">
     'are you glad to see me?  Can I do you any good?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84050">
     'Why didn't you come before?' he asked.  'You should have come, instead
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84060">
     of writing.  It tired me dreadfully writing those long letters.  I'd far
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84070">
     rather have talked to you.  Now, I can neither bear to talk, nor anything
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84080">
     else.  I wonder where Zillah is!  Will you' (looking at me) 'step into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84090">
     the kitchen and see?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84110">
     I had received no thanks for my other service; and being unwilling to run
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84120">
     to and fro at his behest, I replied--'Nobody is out there but Joseph.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84140">
     'I want to drink,' he exclaimed fretfully, turning away.  'Zillah is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84150">
     constantly gadding off to Gimmerton since papa went: it's miserable!  And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84160">
     I'm obliged to come down here--they resolved never to hear me up-stairs.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84180">
     'Is your father attentive to you, Master Heathcliff?' I asked, perceiving
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84190">
     Catherine to be checked in her friendly advances.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84210">
     'Attentive?  He makes them a little more attentive at least,' he cried.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84220">
     'The wretches!  Do you know, Miss Linton, that brute Hareton laughs at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84230">
     me!  I hate him! indeed, I hate them all: they are odious beings.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84250">
     Cathy began searching for some water; she lighted on a pitcher in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84260">
     dresser, filled a tumbler, and brought it.  He bid her add a spoonful of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84270">
     wine from a bottle on the table; and having swallowed a small portion,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84280">
     appeared more tranquil, and said she was very kind.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84300">
     'And are you glad to see me?' asked she, reiterating her former question
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84310">
     and pleased to detect the faint dawn of a smile.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84330">
     'Yes, I am.  It's something new to hear a voice like yours!' he replied.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84340">
     'But I have been vexed, because you wouldn't come.  And papa swore it was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84350">
     owing to me: he called me a pitiful, shuffling, worthless thing; and said
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84360">
     you despised me; and if he had been in my place, he would be more the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84370">
     master of the Grange than your father by this time.  But you don't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84380">
     despise me, do you, Miss--?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84400">
     'I wish you would say Catherine, or Cathy,' interrupted my young lady.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84410">
     'Despise you?  No!  Next to papa and Ellen, I love you better than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84420">
     anybody living.  I don't love Mr. Heathcliff, though; and I dare not come
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84430">
     when he returns: will he stay away many days?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84450">
     'Not many,' answered Linton; 'but he goes on to the moors frequently,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84460">
     since the shooting season commenced; and you might spend an hour or two
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84470">
     with me in his absence.  Do say you will.  I think I should not be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84480">
     peevish with you: you'd not provoke me, and you'd always be ready to help
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84490">
     me, wouldn't you?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84510">
     'Yes,' said Catherine, stroking his long soft hair: 'if I could only get
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84520">
     papa's consent, I'd spend half my time with you.  Pretty Linton!  I wish
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84530">
     you were my brother.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84550">
     'And then you would like me as well as your father?' observed he, more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84560">
     cheerfully.  'But papa says you would love me better than him and all the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84570">
     world, if you were my wife; so I'd rather you were that.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84590">
     'No, I should never love anybody better than papa,' she returned gravely.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84600">
     'And people hate their wives, sometimes; but not their sisters and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84610">
     brothers: and if you were the latter, you would live with us, and papa
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84620">
     would be as fond of you as he is of me.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84640">
     Linton denied that people ever hated their wives; but Cathy affirmed they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84650">
     did, and, in her wisdom, instanced his own father's aversion to her aunt.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84660">
     I endeavoured to stop her thoughtless tongue.  I couldn't succeed till
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84670">
     everything she knew was out.  Master Heathcliff, much irritated, asserted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84680">
     her relation was false.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84700">
     'Papa told me; and papa does not tell falsehoods,' she answered pertly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84720">
     '_My_ papa scorns yours!' cried Linton.  'He calls him a sneaking fool.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84740">
     'Yours is a wicked man,' retorted Catherine; 'and you are very naughty to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84750">
     dare to repeat what he says.  He must be wicked to have made Aunt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84760">
     Isabella leave him as she did.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84780">
     'She didn't leave him,' said the boy; 'you sha'n't contradict me.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84800">
     'She did,' cried my young lady.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84820">
     'Well, I'll tell you something!' said Linton.  'Your mother hated your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84830">
     father: now then.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84850">
     'Oh!' exclaimed Catherine, too enraged to continue.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84870">
     'And she loved mine,' added he.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84890">
     'You little liar!  I hate you now!' she panted, and her face grew red
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84900">
     with passion.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84920">
     'She did! she did!' sang Linton, sinking into the recess of his chair,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84930">
     and leaning back his head to enjoy the agitation of the other disputant,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84940">
     who stood behind.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84960">
     'Hush, Master Heathcliff!' I said; 'that's your father's tale, too, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84970">
     suppose.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_84990">
     'It isn't: you hold your tongue!' he answered.  'She did, she did,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85000">
     Catherine! she did, she did!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85020">
     Cathy, beside herself, gave the chair a violent push, and caused him to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85030">
     fall against one arm.  He was immediately seized by a suffocating cough
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85040">
     that soon ended his triumph.  It lasted so long that it frightened even
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85050">
     me.  As to his cousin, she wept with all her might, aghast at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85060">
     mischief she had done: though she said nothing.  I held him till the fit
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85070">
     exhausted itself.  Then he thrust me away, and leant his head down
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85080">
     silently.  Catherine quelled her lamentations also, took a seat opposite,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85090">
     and looked solemnly into the fire.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85110">
     'How do you feel now, Master Heathcliff?' I inquired, after waiting ten
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85120">
     minutes.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85140">
     'I wish _she_ felt as I do,' he replied: 'spiteful, cruel thing! Hareton
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85150">
     never touches me: he never struck me in his life. And I was better
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85160">
     to-day: and there--' his voice died in a whimper.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85180">
     '_I_ didn't strike you!' muttered Cathy, chewing her lip to prevent
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85190">
     another burst of emotion.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85210">
     He sighed and moaned like one under great suffering, and kept it up for a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85220">
     quarter of an hour; on purpose to distress his cousin apparently, for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85230">
     whenever he caught a stifled sob from her he put renewed pain and pathos
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85240">
     into the inflexions of his voice.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85260">
     'I'm sorry I hurt you, Linton,' she said at length, racked beyond
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85270">
     endurance.  'But I couldn't have been hurt by that little push, and I had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85280">
     no idea that you could, either: you're not much, are you, Linton?  Don't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85290">
     let me go home thinking I've done you harm.  Answer! speak to me.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85310">
     'I can't speak to you,' he murmured; 'you've hurt me so that I shall lie
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85320">
     awake all night choking with this cough.  If you had it you'd know what
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85330">
     it was; but _you'll_ be comfortably asleep while I'm in agony, and nobody
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85340">
     near me.  I wonder how you would like to pass those fearful nights!'  And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85350">
     he began to wail aloud, for very pity of himself.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85370">
     'Since you are in the habit of passing dreadful nights,' I said, 'it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85380">
     won't be Miss who spoils your ease: you'd be the same had she never come.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85390">
     However, she shall not disturb you again; and perhaps you'll get quieter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85400">
     when we leave you.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85420">
     'Must I go?' asked Catherine dolefully, bending over him.  'Do you want
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85430">
     me to go, Linton?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85450">
     'You can't alter what you've done,' he replied pettishly, shrinking from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85460">
     her, 'unless you alter it for the worse by teasing me into a fever.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85480">
     'Well, then, I must go?' she repeated.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85500">
     'Let me alone, at least,' said he; 'I can't bear your talking.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85520">
     She lingered, and resisted my persuasions to departure a tiresome while;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85530">
     but as he neither looked up nor spoke, she finally made a movement to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85540">
     door, and I followed.  We were recalled by a scream.  Linton had slid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85550">
     from his seat on to the hearthstone, and lay writhing in the mere
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85560">
     perverseness of an indulged plague of a child, determined to be as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85570">
     grievous and harassing as it can.  I thoroughly gauged his disposition
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85580">
     from his behaviour, and saw at once it would be folly to attempt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85590">
     humouring him.  Not so my companion: she ran back in terror, knelt down,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85600">
     and cried, and soothed, and entreated, till he grew quiet from lack of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85610">
     breath: by no means from compunction at distressing her.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85630">
     'I shall lift him on to the settle,' I said, 'and he may roll about as he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85640">
     pleases: we can't stop to watch him.  I hope you are satisfied, Miss
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85650">
     Cathy, that you are not the person to benefit him; and that his condition
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85660">
     of health is not occasioned by attachment to you.  Now, then, there he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85670">
     is!  Come away: as soon as he knows there is nobody by to care for his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85680">
     nonsense, he'll be glad to lie still.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85700">
     She placed a cushion under his head, and offered him some water; he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85710">
     rejected the latter, and tossed uneasily on the former, as if it were a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85720">
     stone or a block of wood.  She tried to put it more comfortably.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85740">
     'I can't do with that,' he said; 'it's not high enough.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85760">
     Catherine brought another to lay above it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85780">
     'That's too high,' murmured the provoking thing.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85800">
     'How must I arrange it, then?' she asked despairingly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85820">
     He twined himself up to her, as she half knelt by the settle, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85830">
     converted her shoulder into a support.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85850">
     'No, that won't do,' I said.  'You'll be content with the cushion, Master
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85860">
     Heathcliff.  Miss has wasted too much time on you already: we cannot
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85870">
     remain five minutes longer.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85890">
     'Yes, yes, we can!' replied Cathy.  'He's good and patient now.  He's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85900">
     beginning to think I shall have far greater misery than he will to-night,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85910">
     if I believe he is the worse for my visit: and then I dare not come
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85920">
     again.  Tell the truth about it, Linton; for I musn't come, if I have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85930">
     hurt you.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85950">
     'You must come, to cure me,' he answered.  'You ought to come, because
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85960">
     you have hurt me: you know you have extremely!  I was not as ill when you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85970">
     entered as I am at present--was I?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_85990">
     'But you've made yourself ill by crying and being in a passion.--I didn't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86000">
     do it all,' said his cousin.  'However, we'll be friends now.  And you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86010">
     want me: you would wish to see me sometimes, really?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86030">
     'I told you I did,' he replied impatiently.  'Sit on the settle and let
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86040">
     me lean on your knee.  That's as mamma used to do, whole afternoons
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86050">
     together.  Sit quite still and don't talk: but you may sing a song, if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86060">
     you can sing; or you may say a nice long interesting ballad--one of those
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86070">
     you promised to teach me; or a story.  I'd rather have a ballad, though:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86080">
     begin.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86100">
     Catherine repeated the longest she could remember.  The employment
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86110">
     pleased both mightily.  Linton would have another, and after that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86120">
     another, notwithstanding my strenuous objections; and so they went on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86130">
     until the clock struck twelve, and we heard Hareton in the court,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86140">
     returning for his dinner.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86160">
     'And to-morrow, Catherine, will you be here to-morrow?' asked young
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86170">
     Heathcliff, holding her frock as she rose reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86190">
     'No,' I answered, 'nor next day neither.'  She, however, gave a different
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86200">
     response evidently, for his forehead cleared as she stooped and whispered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86210">
     in his ear.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86230">
     'You won't go to-morrow, recollect, Miss!' I commenced, when we were out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86240">
     of the house.  'You are not dreaming of it, are you?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86260">
     She smiled.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86280">
     'Oh, I'll take good care,' I continued: 'I'll have that lock mended, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86290">
     you can escape by no way else.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86310">
     'I can get over the wall,' she said laughing.  'The Grange is not a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86320">
     prison, Ellen, and you are not my gaoler.  And besides, I'm almost
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86330">
     seventeen: I'm a woman.  And I'm certain Linton would recover quickly if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86340">
     he had me to look after him.  I'm older than he is, you know, and wiser:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86350">
     less childish, am I not?  And he'll soon do as I direct him, with some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86360">
     slight coaxing.  He's a pretty little darling when he's good.  I'd make
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86370">
     such a pet of him, if he were mine.  We should never quarrel, should we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86380">
     after we were used to each other?  Don't you like him, Ellen?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86400">
     'Like him!' I exclaimed.  'The worst-tempered bit of a sickly slip that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86410">
     ever struggled into its teens.  Happily, as Mr. Heathcliff conjectured,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86420">
     he'll not win twenty.  I doubt whether he'll see spring, indeed.  And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86430">
     small loss to his family whenever he drops off.  And lucky it is for us
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86440">
     that his father took him: the kinder he was treated, the more tedious and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86450">
     selfish he'd be.  I'm glad you have no chance of having him for a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86460">
     husband, Miss Catherine.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86480">
     My companion waxed serious at hearing this speech.  To speak of his death
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86490">
     so regardlessly wounded her feelings.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86510">
     'He's younger than I,' she answered, after a protracted pause of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86520">
     meditation, 'and he ought to live the longest: he will--he must live as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86530">
     long as I do.  He's as strong now as when he first came into the north;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86540">
     I'm positive of that.  It's only a cold that ails him, the same as papa
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86550">
     has.  You say papa will get better, and why shouldn't he?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86570">
     'Well, well,' I cried, 'after all, we needn't trouble ourselves; for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86580">
     listen, Miss,--and mind, I'll keep my word,--if you attempt going to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86590">
     Wuthering Heights again, with or without me, I shall inform Mr. Linton,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86600">
     and, unless he allow it, the intimacy with your cousin must not be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86610">
     revived.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86630">
     'It has been revived,' muttered Cathy, sulkily.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86650">
     'Must not be continued, then,' I said.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86670">
     'We'll see,' was her reply, and she set off at a gallop, leaving me to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86680">
     toil in the rear.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86700">
     We both reached home before our dinner-time; my master supposed we had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86710">
     been wandering through the park, and therefore he demanded no explanation
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86720">
     of our absence.  As soon as I entered I hastened to change my soaked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86730">
     shoes and stockings; but sitting such awhile at the Heights had done the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86740">
     mischief.  On the succeeding morning I was laid up, and during three
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86750">
     weeks I remained incapacitated for attending to my duties: a calamity
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86760">
     never experienced prior to that period, and never, I am thankful to say,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86770">
     since.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86790">
     My little mistress behaved like an angel in coming to wait on me, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86800">
     cheer my solitude; the confinement brought me exceedingly low.  It is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86810">
     wearisome, to a stirring active body: but few have slighter reasons for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86820">
     complaint than I had.  The moment Catherine left Mr. Linton's room she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86830">
     appeared at my bedside.  Her day was divided between us; no amusement
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86840">
     usurped a minute: she neglected her meals, her studies, and her play; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86850">
     she was the fondest nurse that ever watched.  She must have had a warm
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86860">
     heart, when she loved her father so, to give so much to me.  I said her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86870">
     days were divided between us; but the master retired early, and I

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86880">
     generally needed nothing after six o'clock, thus the evening was her own.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86890">
     Poor thing!  I never considered what she did with herself after tea.  And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86900">
     though frequently, when she looked in to bid me good-night, I remarked a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86910">
     fresh colour in her cheeks and a pinkness over her slender fingers,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_86920">
     instead of fancying the line borrowed from a cold ride across the moors,

     I laid it to the charge of a hot fire in the library.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87000">
     At the close of three weeks I was able to quit my chamber and move about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87010">
     the house.  And on the first occasion of my sitting up in the evening I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87020">
     asked Catherine to read to me, because my eyes were weak.  We were in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87030">
     library, the master having gone to bed: she consented, rather
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87040">
     unwillingly, I fancied; and imagining my sort of books did not suit her,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87050">
     I bid her please herself in the choice of what she perused.  She selected
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87060">
     one of her own favourites, and got forward steadily about an hour; then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87070">
     came frequent questions.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87090">
     'Ellen, are not you tired?  Hadn't you better lie down now?  You'll be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87100">
     sick, keeping up so long, Ellen.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87120">
     'No, no, dear, I'm not tired,' I returned, continually.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87140">
     Perceiving me immovable, she essayed another method of showing her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87150">
     disrelish for her occupation.  It changed to yawning, and stretching,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87160">
     and--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87180">
     'Ellen, I'm tired.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87200">
     'Give over then and talk,' I answered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87220">
     That was worse: she fretted and sighed, and looked at her watch till
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87230">
     eight, and finally went to her room, completely overdone with sleep;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87240">
     judging by her peevish, heavy look, and the constant rubbing she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87250">
     inflicted on her eyes.  The following night she seemed more impatient
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87260">
     still; and on the third from recovering my company she complained of a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87270">
     headache, and left me.  I thought her conduct odd; and having remained
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87280">
     alone a long while, I resolved on going and inquiring whether she were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87290">
     better, and asking her to come and lie on the sofa, instead of up-stairs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87300">
     in the dark.  No Catherine could I discover up-stairs, and none below.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87310">
     The servants affirmed they had not seen her.  I listened at Mr. Edgar's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87320">
     door; all was silence.  I returned to her apartment, extinguished my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87330">
     candle, and seated myself in the window.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87350">
     The moon shone bright; a sprinkling of snow covered the ground, and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87360">
     reflected that she might, possibly, have taken it into her head to walk
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87370">
     about the garden, for refreshment.  I did detect a figure creeping along
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87380">
     the inner fence of the park; but it was not my young mistress: on its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87390">
     emerging into the light, I recognised one of the grooms.  He stood a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87400">
     considerable period, viewing the carriage-road through the grounds; then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87410">
     started off at a brisk pace, as if he had detected something, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87420">
     reappeared presently, leading Miss's pony; and there she was, just
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87430">
     dismounted, and walking by its side.  The man took his charge stealthily
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87440">
     across the grass towards the stable.  Cathy entered by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87450">
     casement-window of the drawing-room, and glided noiselessly up to where I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87460">
     awaited her.  She put the door gently too, slipped off her snowy shoes,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87470">
     untied her hat, and was proceeding, unconscious of my espionage, to lay
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87480">
     aside her mantle, when I suddenly rose and revealed myself.  The surprise
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87490">
     petrified her an instant: she uttered an inarticulate exclamation, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87500">
     stood fixed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87520">
     'My dear Miss Catherine,' I began, too vividly impressed by her recent
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87530">
     kindness to break into a scold, 'where have you been riding out at this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87540">
     hour?  And why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale?  Where
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87550">
     have you been?  Speak!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87570">
     'To the bottom of the park,' she stammered.  'I didn't tell a tale.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87590">
     'And nowhere else?' I demanded.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87610">
     'No,' was the muttered reply.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87630">
     'Oh, Catherine!' I cried, sorrowfully.  'You know you have been doing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87640">
     wrong, or you wouldn't be driven to uttering an untruth to me.  That does
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87650">
     grieve me.  I'd rather be three months ill, than hear you frame a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87660">
     deliberate lie.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87680">
     She sprang forward, and bursting into tears, threw her arms round my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87690">
     neck.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87710">
     'Well, Ellen, I'm so afraid of you being angry,' she said.  'Promise not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87720">
     to be angry, and you shall know the very truth: I hate to hide it.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87740">
     We sat down in the window-seat; I assured her I would not scold, whatever
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87750">
     her secret might be, and I guessed it, of course; so she commenced--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87770">
     'I've been to Wuthering Heights, Ellen, and I've never missed going a day
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87780">
     since you fell ill; except thrice before, and twice after you left your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87790">
     room.  I gave Michael books and pictures to prepare Minny every evening,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87800">
     and to put her back in the stable: you mustn't scold him either, mind.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87810">
     was at the Heights by half-past six, and generally stayed till half-past
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87820">
     eight, and then galloped home.  It was not to amuse myself that I went: I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87830">
     was often wretched all the time.  Now and then I was happy: once in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87840">
     week perhaps.  At first, I expected there would be sad work persuading
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87850">
     you to let me keep my word to Linton: for I had engaged to call again
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87860">
     next day, when we quitted him; but, as you stayed up-stairs on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87870">
     morrow, I escaped that trouble.  While Michael was refastening the lock
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87880">
     of the park door in the afternoon, I got possession of the key, and told
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87890">
     him how my cousin wished me to visit him, because he was sick, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87900">
     couldn't come to the Grange; and how papa would object to my going: and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87910">
     then I negotiated with him about the pony.  He is fond of reading, and he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87920">
     thinks of leaving soon to get married; so he offered, if I would lend him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87930">
     books out of the library, to do what I wished: but I preferred giving him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87940">
     my own, and that satisfied him better.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87960">
     'On my second visit Linton seemed in lively spirits; and Zillah (that is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87970">
     their housekeeper) made us a clean room and a good fire, and told us
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87980">
     that, as Joseph was out at a prayer-meeting and Hareton Earnshaw was off
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_87990">
     with his dogs--robbing our woods of pheasants, as I heard afterwards--we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88000">
     might do what we liked.  She brought me some warm wine and gingerbread,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88010">
     and appeared exceedingly good-natured, and Linton sat in the arm-chair,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88020">
     and I in the little rocking chair on the hearth-stone, and we laughed and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88030">
     talked so merrily, and found so much to say: we planned where we would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88040">
     go, and what we would do in summer.  I needn't repeat that, because you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88050">
     would call it silly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88070">
     'One time, however, we were near quarrelling.  He said the pleasantest
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88080">
     manner of spending a hot July day was lying from morning till evening on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88090">
     a bank of heath in the middle of the moors, with the bees humming
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88100">
     dreamily about among the bloom, and the larks singing high up overhead,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88110">
     and the blue sky and bright sun shining steadily and cloudlessly.  That
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88120">
     was his most perfect idea of heaven's happiness: mine was rocking in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88130">
     rustling green tree, with a west wind blowing, and bright white clouds
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88140">
     flitting rapidly above; and not only larks, but throstles, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88150">
     blackbirds, and linnets, and cuckoos pouring out music on every side, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88160">
     the moors seen at a distance, broken into cool dusky dells; but close by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88170">
     great swells of long grass undulating in waves to the breeze; and woods
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88180">
     and sounding water, and the whole world awake and wild with joy.  He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88190">
     wanted all to lie in an ecstasy of peace; I wanted all to sparkle and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88200">
     dance in a glorious jubilee.  I said his heaven would be only half alive;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88210">
     and he said mine would be drunk: I said I should fall asleep in his; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88220">
     he said he could not breathe in mine, and began to grow very snappish.  At
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88230">
     last, we agreed to try both, as soon as the right weather came; and then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88240">
     we kissed each other and were friends.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88260">
     'After sitting still an hour, I looked at the great room with its smooth
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88270">
     uncarpeted floor, and thought how nice it would be to play in, if we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88280">
     removed the table; and I asked Linton to call Zillah in to help us, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88290">
     we'd have a game at blindman's-buff; she should try to catch us: you used

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88300">
     to, you know, Ellen.  He wouldn't: there was no pleasure in it, he said;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88310">
     but he consented to play at ball with me.  We found two in a cupboard,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88320">
     among a heap of old toys, tops, and hoops, and battledores and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88330">
     shuttlecocks.  One was marked C., and the other H.; I wished to have the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88340">
     C., because that stood for Catherine, and the H. might be for Heathcliff,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88350">
     his name; but the bran came out of H., and Linton didn't like it.  I beat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88360">
     him constantly: and he got cross again, and coughed, and returned to his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88370">
     chair.  That night, though, he easily recovered his good humour: he was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88380">
     charmed with two or three pretty songs--_your_ songs, Ellen; and when I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88390">
     was obliged to go, he begged and entreated me to come the following
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88400">
     evening; and I promised.  Minny and I went flying home as light as air;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88410">
     and I dreamt of Wuthering Heights and my sweet, darling cousin, till
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88420">
     morning.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88440">
     'On the morrow I was sad; partly because you were poorly, and partly that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88450">
     I wished my father knew, and approved of my excursions: but it was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88460">
     beautiful moonlight after tea; and, as I rode on, the gloom cleared.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88470">
     shall have another happy evening, I thought to myself; and what delights
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88480">
     me more, my pretty Linton will.  I trotted up their garden, and was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88490">
     turning round to the back, when that fellow Earnshaw met me, took my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88500">
     bridle, and bid me go in by the front entrance.  He patted Minny's neck,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88510">
     and said she was a bonny beast, and appeared as if he wanted me to speak
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88520">
     to him.  I only told him to leave my horse alone, or else it would kick
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88530">
     him.  He answered in his vulgar accent, "It wouldn't do mitch hurt if it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88540">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88560">
     he looked up to the inscription above, and said, with a stupid mixture of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88570">
     awkwardness and elation: "Miss Catherine!  I can read yon, now."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88590">
     '"Wonderful," I exclaimed.  "Pray let us hear you--you _are_ grown
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88600">
     clever!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88620">
     'He spelt, and drawled over by syllables, the name--"Hareton Earnshaw."

     '"And the figures?" I cried, encouragingly, perceiving that he came to a

     dead halt.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88670">
     '"I cannot tell them yet," he answered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88690">
     '"Oh, you dunce!" I said, laughing heartily at his failure.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88710">
     'The fool stared, with a grin hovering about his lips, and a scowl

     mirth: whether it were not pleasant familiarity, or what it really was,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88740">
     contempt.  I settled his doubts, by suddenly retrieving my gravity and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88750">
     desiring him to walk away, for I came to see Linton, not him.  He

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88760">
     reddened--I saw that by the moonlight--dropped his hand from the latch,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88770">
     and skulked off, a picture of mortified vanity.  He imagined himself to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88780">
     be as accomplished as Linton, I suppose, because he could spell his own

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88810">
     'Stop, Miss Catherine, dear!'--I interrupted.  'I shall not scold, but I

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88840">
     improper it was to behave in that way.  At least, it was praiseworthy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88850">
     ambition for him to desire to be as accomplished as Linton; and probably
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88860">

     ignorance before, I have no doubt; and he wished to remedy it and please
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88880">
     you.  To sneer at his imperfect attempt was very bad breeding.  Had you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88890">
     been brought up in his circumstances, would you be less rude?  He was as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88900">
     quick and as intelligent a child as ever you were; and I'm hurt that he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_88910">
     should be despised now, because that base Heathcliff has treated him so
    </p>

     'Well, Ellen, you won't cry about it, will you?' she exclaimed, surprised

     at my earnestness.  'But wait, and you shall hear if he conned his A B C

     'I knew now that I mustn't tease him, as he was ill; and I spoke softly

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89050">
     brought some of my nicest books for him: he asked me to read a little of

     one, and I was about to comply, when Earnshaw burst the door open: having
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89070">
     gathered venom with reflection.  He advanced direct to us, seized Linton
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89080">
     by the arm, and swung him off the seat.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89100">
     '"Get to thy own room!" he said, in a voice almost inarticulate with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89110">
     passion; and his face looked swelled and furious.  "Take her there if she

     comes to see thee: thou shalln't keep me out of this.  Begone wi' ye

     longing to knock me down.  I was afraid for a moment, and I let one

     an expression of frantic, powerless fury.  He grasped the handle of the

     choked by a dreadful fit of coughing; blood gushed from his mouth, and he

     for Zillah, as loud as I could.  She soon heard me: she was milking the

     cows in a shed behind the barn, and hurrying from her work, she inquired
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89510">
     what there was to do?  I hadn't breath to explain; dragging her in, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89520">
     looked about for Linton.  Earnshaw had come out to examine the mischief
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89530">
     he had caused, and he was then conveying the poor thing up-stairs.  Zillah
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89540">
     and I ascended after him; but he stopped me at the top of the steps, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89550">
     said I shouldn't go in: I must go home.  I exclaimed that he had killed

     Linton, and I _would_ enter.  Joseph locked the door, and declared I
    </p>

     should do "no sich stuff," and asked me whether I were "bahn to be as mad

     he would be better in a bit, but he couldn't do with that shrieking and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89600">
     din; and she took me, and nearly carried me into the house.

     'Ellen, I was ready to tear my hair off my head!  I sobbed and wept so

     that I would tell papa, and that he should be put in prison and hanged,
    </p>

     he commenced blubbering himself, and hurried out to hide his cowardly

     to depart, and I had got some hundred yards off the premises, he suddenly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89700">
     issued from the shadow of the road-side, and checked Minny and took hold
    </p>

     of me.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89730">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89810">
     excited, and dreaded to hear that Linton was dead, sometimes; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89820">
     sometimes shuddered at the thought of encountering Hareton.  On the third
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89830">
     day I took courage: at least, I couldn't bear longer suspense, and stole
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89840">
     off once more.  I went at five o'clock, and walked; fancying I might
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89850">
     manage to creep into the house, and up to Linton's room, unobserved.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89860">
     However, the dogs gave notice of my approach.  Zillah received me, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89870">
     saying "the lad was mending nicely," showed me into a small, tidy,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89880">
     carpeted apartment, where, to my inexpressible joy, I beheld Linton laid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89890">
     on a little sofa, reading one of my books.  But he would neither speak to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89900">
     me nor look at me, through a whole hour, Ellen: he has such an unhappy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89910">
     temper.  And what quite confounded me, when he did open his mouth, it was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89920">
     to utter the falsehood that I had occasioned the uproar, and Hareton was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89930">
     not to blame!  Unable to reply, except passionately, I got up and walked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89940">
     from the room.  He sent after me a faint "Catherine!"  He did not reckon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89950">
     on being answered so: but I wouldn't turn back; and the morrow was the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89960">
     second day on which I stayed at home, nearly determined to visit him no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89970">
     more.  But it was so miserable going to bed and getting up, and never
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89980">
     hearing anything about him, that my resolution melted into air before it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_89990">
     was properly formed.  It had appeared wrong to take the journey once; now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90000">
     it seemed wrong to refrain.  Michael came to ask if he must saddle Minny;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90010">
     I said "Yes," and considered myself doing a duty as she bore me over the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90020">
     hills.  I was forced to pass the front windows to get to the court: it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90030">
     was no use trying to conceal my presence.

     '"Young master is in the house," said Zillah, as she saw me making for

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90070">
     directly.  Linton sat in the great arm-chair half asleep; walking up to

     the fire, I began in a serious tone, partly meaning it to be true--

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90200">
     worthless, and bad in temper, and bad in spirit, almost always; and, if
    </p>

     you choose, you may say good-bye: you'll get rid of an annoyance.  Only,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90220">
     Catherine, do me this justice: believe that if I might be as sweet, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90230">
     as kind, and as good as you are, I would be; as willingly, and more so,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90240">
     than as happy and as healthy.  And believe that your kindness has made me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90250">
     love you deeper than if I deserved your love: and though I couldn't, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90260">
     cannot help showing my nature to you, I regret it and repent it; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90270">
     shall regret and repent it till I die!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90290">
     'I felt he spoke the truth; and I felt I must forgive him: and, though we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90300">
     should quarrel the next moment, I must forgive him again.  We were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90310">
     reconciled; but we cried, both of us, the whole time I stayed: not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90320">
     entirely for sorrow; yet I _was_ sorry Linton had that distorted nature.

     He'll never let his friends be at ease, and he'll never be at ease

     himself!  I have always gone to his little parlour, since that night;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90350">
     because his father returned the day after.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90370">
     'About three times, I think, we have been merry and hopeful, as we were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90380">
     the first evening; the rest of my visits were dreary and troubled: now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90390">
     with his selfishness and spite, and now with his sufferings: but I've
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90400">
     learned to endure the former with nearly as little resentment as the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90410">
     latter.  Mr. Heathcliff purposely avoids me: I have hardly seen him at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90420">
     all.  Last Sunday, indeed, coming earlier than usual, I heard him abusing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90430">
     poor Linton cruelly for his conduct of the night before.  I can't tell
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90440">
     how he knew of it, unless he listened.  Linton had certainly behaved
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90450">
     provokingly: however, it was the business of nobody but me, and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90460">
     interrupted Mr. Heathcliff's lecture by entering and telling him so.  He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90470">
     burst into a laugh, and went away, saying he was glad I took that view of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90480">
     the matter.  Since then, I've told Linton he must whisper his bitter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90490">
     things.  Now, Ellen, you have heard all.  I can't be prevented from going
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90500">
     to Wuthering Heights, except by inflicting misery on two people; whereas,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90510">
     if you'll only not tell papa, my going need disturb the tranquillity of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90520">
     none.  You'll not tell, will you?  It will be very heartless, if you do.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90540">
     'I'll make up my mind on that point by to-morrow, Miss Catherine,' I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90550">
     replied.  'It requires some study; and so I'll leave you to your rest,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90560">
     and go think it over.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90580">
     I thought it over aloud, in my master's presence; walking straight from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90590">
     her room to his, and relating the whole story: with the exception of her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90600">
     conversations with her cousin, and any mention of Hareton.  Mr. Linton
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90610">
     was alarmed and distressed, more than he would acknowledge to me.  In the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90620">
     morning, Catherine learnt my betrayal of her confidence, and she learnt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90630">
     also that her secret visits were to end.  In vain she wept and writhed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90640">
     against the interdict, and implored her father to have pity on Linton:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90650">
     all she got to comfort her was a promise that he would write and give him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90660">
     leave to come to the Grange when he pleased; but explaining that he must
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90670">
     no longer expect to see Catherine at Wuthering Heights.  Perhaps, had he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90680">
     been aware of his nephew's disposition and state of health, he would have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_90690">
     seen fit to withhold even that slight consolation.

     'She was,' continued the housekeeper.  'Her affection for him was still

     the chief sentiment in her heart; and he spoke without anger: he spoke in

     the deep tenderness of one about to leave his treasure amid perils and

     Edgar sighed; and, walking to the window, looked out towards Gimmerton

     Kirk. It was a misty afternoon, but the February sun shone dimly, and we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91100">
     could just distinguish the two fir-trees in the yard, and the
    </p>

     'I've prayed often,' he half soliloquised, 'for the approach of what is

     coming; and now I begin to shrink, and fear it.  I thought the memory of

     the hour I came down that glen a bridegroom would be less sweet than the

     with my little Cathy: through winter nights and summer days she was a

     living hope at my side.  But I've been as happy musing by myself among
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91200">
     those stones, under that old church: lying, through the long June
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91210">
     evenings, on the green mound of her mother's grave, and wishing--yearning
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91220">
     for the time when I might lie beneath it.  What can I do for Cathy?  How
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91230">
     must I quit her?  I'd not care one moment for Linton being Heathcliff's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91240">
     son; nor for his taking her from me, if he could console her for my loss.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91250">
     I'd not care that Heathcliff gained his ends, and triumphed in robbing me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91260">
     of my last blessing!  But should Linton be unworthy--only a feeble tool
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91270">
     to his father--I cannot abandon her to him!  And, hard though it be to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91280">
     crush her buoyant spirit, I must persevere in making her sad while I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91290">
     live, and leaving her solitary when I die.  Darling!  I'd rather resign
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91300">
     her to God, and lay her in the earth before me.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91320">
     'Resign her to God as it is, sir,' I answered, 'and if we should lose

     you--which may He forbid--under His providence, I'll stand her friend and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91340">
     counsellor to the last.  Miss Catherine is a good girl: I don't fear that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91350">
     she will go wilfully wrong; and people who do their duty are always
    </p>

     finally rewarded.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91380">
     Spring advanced; yet my master gathered no real strength, though he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91390">
     resumed his walks in the grounds with his daughter.  To her inexperienced
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91400">
     notions, this itself was a sign of convalescence; and then his cheek was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91410">
     often flushed, and his eyes were bright; she felt sure of his recovering.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91420">
     On her seventeenth birthday, he did not visit the churchyard: it was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91430">
     raining, and I observed--'You'll surely not go out to-night, sir?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91450">
     He answered,--'No, I'll defer it this year a little longer.'  He wrote
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91460">
     again to Linton, expressing his great desire to see him; and, had the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91470">
     invalid been presentable, I've no doubt his father would have permitted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91480">
     him to come.  As it was, being instructed, he returned an answer,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91490">
     intimating that Mr. Heathcliff objected to his calling at the Grange; but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91500">
     his uncle's kind remembrance delighted him, and he hoped to meet him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91510">
     sometimes in his rambles, and personally to petition that his cousin and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91520">
     he might not remain long so utterly divided.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91540">
     That part of his letter was simple, and probably his own.  Heathcliff
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91550">
     knew he could plead eloquently for Catherine's company, then.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91570">
     'I do not ask,' he said, 'that she may visit here; but am I never to see

     her, because my father forbids me to go to her home, and you forbid her

     Edgar, though he felt for the boy, could not consent to grant his

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91740">
     perhaps, they might meet: meantime, he wished him to continue writing at

     letter; being well aware of his hard position in his family.  Linton

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91810">
     sufferings and distresses, the themes constantly uppermost in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91820">
     thoughts, he harped on the cruel obligation of being held asunder from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91830">
     his friend and love; and gently intimated that Mr. Linton must allow an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91840">
     interview soon, or he should fear he was purposely deceiving him with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91850">
     empty promises.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91870">
     Cathy was a powerful ally at home; and between them they at length
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91880">
     persuaded my master to acquiesce in their having a ride or a walk
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91890">
     together about once a week, under my guardianship, and on the moors
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91900">
     nearest the Grange: for June found him still declining.  Though he had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91910">
     set aside yearly a portion of his income for my young lady's fortune, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91920">
     had a natural desire that she might retain--or at least return in a short
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91930">
     time to--the house of her ancestors; and he considered her only prospect
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91940">
     of doing that was by a union with his heir; he had no idea that the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91950">
     latter was failing almost as fast as himself; nor had any one, I believe:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91960">
     no doctor visited the Heights, and no one saw Master Heathcliff to make
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91970">
     report of his condition among us.  I, for my part, began to fancy my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91980">
     forebodings were false, and that he must be actually rallying, when he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_91990">
     mentioned riding and walking on the moors, and seemed so earnest in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92000">
     pursuing his object.  I could not picture a father treating a dying child
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92010">
     as tyrannically and wickedly as I afterwards learned Heathcliff had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92020">
     treated him, to compel this apparent eagerness: his efforts redoubling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92030">
     the more imminently his avaricious and unfeeling plans were threatened
    </p>

     with defeat by death.

     Summer was already past its prime, when Edgar reluctantly yielded his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92120">
     assent to their entreaties, and Catherine and I set out on our first ride
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92130">
     to join her cousin.  It was a close, sultry day: devoid of sunshine, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92140">
     with a sky too dappled and hazy to threaten rain: and our place of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92150">
     meeting had been fixed at the guide-stone, by the cross-roads.  On
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92160">
     arriving there, however, a little herd-boy, despatched as a messenger,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92170">
     told us that,--'Maister Linton wer just o' this side th' Heights: and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92180">
     he'd be mitch obleeged to us to gang on a bit further.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92200">
     'Then Master Linton has forgot the first injunction of his uncle,' I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92210">
     observed: 'he bid us keep on the Grange land, and here we are off at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92220">
     once.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92240">
     'Well, we'll turn our horses' heads round when we reach him,' answered my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92250">
     companion; 'our excursion shall lie towards home.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92270">
     But when we reached him, and that was scarcely a quarter of a mile from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92280">
     his own door, we found he had no horse; and we were forced to dismount,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92290">
     and leave ours to graze.  He lay on the heath, awaiting our approach, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92300">
     did not rise till we came within a few yards.  Then he walked so feebly,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92310">
     and looked so pale, that I immediately exclaimed,--'Why, Master
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92320">
     Heathcliff, you are not fit for enjoying a ramble this morning.  How ill
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92330">
     you do look!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92350">
     Catherine surveyed him with grief and astonishment: she changed the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92360">
     ejaculation of joy on her lips to one of alarm; and the congratulation on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92370">
     their long-postponed meeting to an anxious inquiry, whether he were worse
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92380">
     than usual?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92400">
     'No--better--better!' he panted, trembling, and retaining her hand as if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92410">
     he needed its support, while his large blue eyes wandered timidly over
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92420">
     her; the hollowness round them transforming to haggard wildness the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92430">
     languid expression they once possessed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92450">
     'But you have been worse,' persisted his cousin; 'worse than when I saw
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92460">
     you last; you are thinner, and--'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92480">
     'I'm tired,' he interrupted, hurriedly.  'It is too hot for walking, let
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92490">
     us rest here.  And, in the morning, I often feel sick--papa says I grow
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92500">
     so fast.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92520">
     Badly satisfied, Cathy sat down, and he reclined beside her.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92540">
     'This is something like your paradise,' said she, making an effort at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92550">
     cheerfulness.  'You recollect the two days we agreed to spend in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92560">
     place and way each thought pleasantest?  This is nearly yours, only there
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92570">
     are clouds; but then they are so soft and mellow: it is nicer than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92580">
     sunshine.  Next week, if you can, we'll ride down to the Grange Park, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92590">
     try mine.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92610">
     Linton did not appear to remember what she talked of and he had evidently
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92620">
     great difficulty in sustaining any kind of conversation.  His lack of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92630">
     interest in the subjects she started, and his equal incapacity to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92640">
     contribute to her entertainment, were so obvious that she could not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92650">
     conceal her disappointment.  An indefinite alteration had come over his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92660">
     whole person and manner.  The pettishness that might be caressed into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92670">
     fondness, had yielded to a listless apathy; there was less of the peevish
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92680">
     temper of a child which frets and teases on purpose to be soothed, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92690">
     more of the self-absorbed moroseness of a confirmed invalid, repelling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92700">
     consolation, and ready to regard the good-humoured mirth of others as an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92710">
     insult.  Catherine perceived, as well as I did, that he held it rather a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92720">
     punishment, than a gratification, to endure our company; and she made no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92730">
     scruple of proposing, presently, to depart.  That proposal, unexpectedly,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92740">
     roused Linton from his lethargy, and threw him into a strange state of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92750">
     agitation.  He glanced fearfully towards the Heights, begging she would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92760">
     remain another half-hour, at least.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92780">
     'But I think,' said Cathy, 'you'd be more comfortable at home than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92790">
     sitting here; and I cannot amuse you to-day, I see, by my tales, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92800">
     songs, and chatter: you have grown wiser than I, in these six months; you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92810">
     have little taste for my diversions now: or else, if I could amuse you,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92820">
     I'd willingly stay.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92840">
     'Stay to rest yourself,' he replied.  'And, Catherine, don't think or say
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92850">
     that I'm _very_ unwell: it is the heavy weather and heat that make me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92860">
     dull; and I walked about, before you came, a great deal for me.  Tell
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92870">
     uncle I'm in tolerable health, will you?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92890">
     'I'll tell him that _you_ say so, Linton.  I couldn't affirm that you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92900">
     are,' observed my young lady, wondering at his pertinacious assertion of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92910">
     what was evidently an untruth.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92930">
     'And be here again next Thursday,' continued he, shunning her puzzled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92940">
     gaze.  'And give him my thanks for permitting you to come--my best
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92950">
     thanks, Catherine.  And--and, if you _did_ meet my father, and he asked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92960">
     you about me, don't lead him to suppose that I've been extremely silent
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92970">
     and stupid: don't look sad and downcast, as you are doing--he'll be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_92980">
     angry.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93000">
     'I care nothing for his anger,' exclaimed Cathy, imagining she would be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93010">
     its object.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93030">
     'But I do,' said her cousin, shuddering.  '_Don't_ provoke him against
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93040">
     me, Catherine, for he is very hard.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93060">
     'Is he severe to you, Master Heathcliff?' I inquired.  'Has he grown
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93070">
     weary of indulgence, and passed from passive to active hatred?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93090">
     Linton looked at me, but did not answer; and, after keeping her seat by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93100">
     his side another ten minutes, during which his head fell drowsily on his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93110">
     breast, and he uttered nothing except suppressed moans of exhaustion or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93120">
     pain, Cathy began to seek solace in looking for bilberries, and sharing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93130">
     the produce of her researches with me: she did not offer them to him, for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93140">
     she saw further notice would only weary and annoy.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93160">
     'Is it half-an-hour now, Ellen?' she whispered in my ear, at last.  'I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93170">
     can't tell why we should stay.  He's asleep, and papa will be wanting us
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93180">
     back.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93200">
     'Well, we must not leave him asleep,' I answered; 'wait till he wakes,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93210">
     and be patient.  You were mighty eager to set off, but your longing to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93220">
     see poor Linton has soon evaporated!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93240">
     'Why did _he_ wish to see me?' returned Catherine.  'In his crossest
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93250">
     humours, formerly, I liked him better than I do in his present curious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93260">
     mood.  It's just as if it were a task he was compelled to perform--this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93270">
     interview--for fear his father should scold him.  But I'm hardly going to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93280">
     come to give Mr. Heathcliff pleasure; whatever reason he may have for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93290">
     ordering Linton to undergo this penance.  And, though I'm glad he's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93300">
     better in health, I'm sorry he's so much less pleasant, and so much less
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93310">
     affectionate to me.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93330">
     'You think _he is_ better in health, then?' I said.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93350">
     'Yes,' she answered; 'because he always made such a great deal of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93360">
     sufferings, you know.  He is not tolerably well, as he told me to tell
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93370">
     papa; but he's better, very likely.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93390">
     'There you differ with me, Miss Cathy,' I remarked; 'I should conjecture
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93400">
     him to be far worse.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93420">
     Linton here started from his slumber in bewildered terror, and asked if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93430">
     any one had called his name.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93450">
     'No,' said Catherine; 'unless in dreams.  I cannot conceive how you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93460">
     manage to doze out of doors, in the morning.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93480">
     'I thought I heard my father,' he gasped, glancing up to the frowning nab
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93490">
     above us.  'You are sure nobody spoke?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93510">
     'Quite sure,' replied his cousin.  'Only Ellen and I were disputing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93520">
     concerning your health.  Are you truly stronger, Linton, than when we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93530">
     separated in winter?  If you be, I'm certain one thing is not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93540">
     stronger--your regard for me: speak,--are you?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93560">
     The tears gushed from Linton's eyes as he answered, 'Yes, yes, I am!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93570">
     And, still under the spell of the imaginary voice, his gaze wandered up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93580">
     and down to detect its owner.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93600">
     Cathy rose.  'For to-day we must part,' she said.  'And I won't conceal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93610">
     that I have been sadly disappointed with our meeting; though I'll mention
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93620">
     it to nobody but you: not that I stand in awe of Mr. Heathcliff.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93640">
     'Hush,' murmured Linton; 'for God's sake, hush!  He's coming.'  And he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93650">
     clung to Catherine's arm, striving to detain her; but at that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93660">
     announcement she hastily disengaged herself, and whistled to Minny, who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93670">
     obeyed her like a dog.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93690">
     'I'll be here next Thursday,' she cried, springing to the saddle.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93700">
     'Good-bye. Quick, Ellen!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93720">
     And so we left him, scarcely conscious of our departure, so absorbed was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93730">
     he in anticipating his father's approach.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93750">
     Before we reached home, Catherine's displeasure softened into a perplexed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93760">
     sensation of pity and regret, largely blended with vague, uneasy doubts
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93770">
     about Linton's actual circumstances, physical and social: in which I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93780">
     partook, though I counselled her not to say much; for a second journey
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93790">
     would make us better judges.  My master requested an account of our
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93800">
     ongoings.  His nephew's offering of thanks was duly delivered, Miss Cathy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93810">
     gently touching on the rest: I also threw little light on his inquiries,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93820">
     for I hardly knew what to hide and what to reveal.

     Seven days glided away, every one marking its course by the henceforth
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93900">
     rapid alteration of Edgar Linton's state.  The havoc that months had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93910">
     previously wrought was now emulated by the inroads of hours.  Catherine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93920">
     we would fain have deluded yet; but her own quick spirit refused to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93930">
     delude her: it divined in secret, and brooded on the dreadful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93940">
     probability, gradually ripening into certainty.  She had not the heart to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93950">
     mention her ride, when Thursday came round; I mentioned it for her, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93960">
     obtained permission to order her out of doors: for the library, where her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93970">
     father stopped a short time daily--the brief period he could bear to sit
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93980">
     up--and his chamber, had become her whole world.  She grudged each moment
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_93990">
     that did not find her bending over his pillow, or seated by his side.  Her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94000">
     countenance grew wan with watching and sorrow, and my master gladly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94010">
     dismissed her to what he flattered himself would be a happy change of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94020">
     scene and society; drawing comfort from the hope that she would not now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94030">
     be left entirely alone after his death.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94050">
     He had a fixed idea, I guessed by several observations he let fall, that,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94060">
     as his nephew resembled him in person, he would resemble him in mind; for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94070">
     Linton's letters bore few or no indications of his defective character.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94080">
     And I, through pardonable weakness, refrained from correcting the error;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94090">
     asking myself what good there would be in disturbing his last moments
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94100">
     with information that he had neither power nor opportunity to turn to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94110">
     account.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94130">
     We deferred our excursion till the afternoon; a golden afternoon of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94140">
     August: every breath from the hills so full of life, that it seemed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94150">
     whoever respired it, though dying, might revive.  Catherine's face was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94160">
     just like the landscape--shadows and sunshine flitting over it in rapid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94170">
     succession; but the shadows rested longer, and the sunshine was more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94180">
     transient; and her poor little heart reproached itself for even that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94190">
     passing forgetfulness of its cares.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94210">
     We discerned Linton watching at the same spot he had selected before.  My
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94220">
     young mistress alighted, and told me that, as she was resolved to stay a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94230">
     very little while, I had better hold the pony and remain on horseback;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94240">
     but I dissented: I wouldn't risk losing sight of the charge committed to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94250">
     me a minute; so we climbed the slope of heath together.  Master
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94260">
     Heathcliff received us with greater animation on this occasion: not the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94270">
     animation of high spirits though, nor yet of joy; it looked more like
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94280">
     fear.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94300">
     'It is late!' he said, speaking short and with difficulty.  'Is not your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94310">
     father very ill?  I thought you wouldn't come.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94330">
     '_Why_ won't you be candid?' cried Catherine, swallowing her greeting.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94340">
     'Why cannot you say at once you don't want me?  It is strange, Linton,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94350">
     that for the second time you have brought me here on purpose, apparently
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94360">
     to distress us both, and for no reason besides!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94380">
     Linton shivered, and glanced at her, half supplicating, half ashamed; but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94390">
     his cousin's patience was not sufficient to endure this enigmatical
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94400">
     behaviour.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94420">
     'My father _is_ very ill,' she said; 'and why am I called from his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94430">
     bedside?  Why didn't you send to absolve me from my promise, when you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94440">
     wished I wouldn't keep it?  Come!  I desire an explanation: playing and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94450">
     trifling are completely banished out of my mind; and I can't dance
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94460">
     attendance on your affectations now!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94480">
     'My affectations!' he murmured; 'what are they?  For heaven's sake,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94490">
     Catherine, don't look so angry!  Despise me as much as you please; I am a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94500">
     worthless, cowardly wretch: I can't be scorned enough; but I'm too mean
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94510">
     for your anger.  Hate my father, and spare me for contempt.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94530">
     'Nonsense!' cried Catherine in a passion.  'Foolish, silly boy!  And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94540">
     there! he trembles: as if I were really going to touch him!  You needn't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94550">
     bespeak contempt, Linton: anybody will have it spontaneously at your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94560">
     service.  Get off!  I shall return home: it is folly dragging you from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94570">
     the hearth-stone, and pretending--what do we pretend?  Let go my frock!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94580">
     If I pitied you for crying and looking so very frightened, you should
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94590">
     spurn such pity.  Ellen, tell him how disgraceful this conduct is.  Rise,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94600">
     and don't degrade yourself into an abject reptile--_don't_!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94620">
     With streaming face and an expression of agony, Linton had thrown his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94630">
     nerveless frame along the ground: he seemed convulsed with exquisite
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94640">
     terror.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94660">
     'Oh!' he sobbed, 'I cannot bear it!  Catherine, Catherine, I'm a traitor,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94670">
     too, and I dare not tell you!  But leave me, and I shall be killed!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94680">
     _Dear_ Catherine, my life is in your hands: and you have said you loved
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94690">
     me, and if you did, it wouldn't harm you.  You'll not go, then? kind,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94700">
     sweet, good Catherine!  And perhaps you _will_ consent--and he'll let me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94710">
     die with you!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94730">
     My young lady, on witnessing his intense anguish, stooped to raise him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94740">
     The old feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame her vexation, and she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94750">
     grew thoroughly moved and alarmed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94770">
     'Consent to what?' she asked.  'To stay! tell me the meaning of this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94780">
     strange talk, and I will.  You contradict your own words, and distract
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94790">
     me!  Be calm and frank, and confess at once all that weighs on your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94800">
     heart.  You wouldn't injure me, Linton, would you?  You wouldn't let any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94810">
     enemy hurt me, if you could prevent it?  I'll believe you are a coward,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94820">
     for yourself, but not a cowardly betrayer of your best friend.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94840">
     'But my father threatened me,' gasped the boy, clasping his attenuated
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94850">
     fingers, 'and I dread him--I dread him!  I _dare_ not tell!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94870">
     'Oh, well!' said Catherine, with scornful compassion, 'keep your secret:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94880">
     _I'm_ no coward.  Save yourself: I'm not afraid!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94900">
     Her magnanimity provoked his tears: he wept wildly, kissing her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94910">
     supporting hands, and yet could not summon courage to speak out.  I was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94920">
     cogitating what the mystery might be, and determined Catherine should
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94930">
     never suffer to benefit him or any one else, by my good will; when,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94940">
     hearing a rustle among the ling, I looked up and saw Mr. Heathcliff
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94950">
     almost close upon us, descending the Heights.  He didn't cast a glance
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94960">
     towards my companions, though they were sufficiently near for Linton's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94970">
     sobs to be audible; but hailing me in the almost hearty tone he assumed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94980">
     to none besides, and the sincerity of which I couldn't avoid doubting, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_94990">
     said--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95010">
     'It is something to see you so near to my house, Nelly.  How are you at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95020">
     the Grange?  Let us hear.  The rumour goes,' he added, in a lower tone,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95030">
     'that Edgar Linton is on his death-bed: perhaps they exaggerate his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95040">
     illness?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95060">
     'No; my master is dying,' I replied: 'it is true enough.  A sad thing it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95070">
     will be for us all, but a blessing for him!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95090">
     'How long will he last, do you think?' he asked.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95110">
     'I don't know,' I said.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95130">
     'Because,' he continued, looking at the two young people, who were fixed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95140">
     under his eye--Linton appeared as if he could not venture to stir or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95150">
     raise his head, and Catherine could not move, on his account--'because
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95160">
     that lad yonder seems determined to beat me; and I'd thank his uncle to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95170">
     be quick, and go before him!  Hallo! has the whelp been playing that game
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95180">
     long?  I _did_ give him some lessons about snivelling.  Is he pretty
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95190">
     lively with Miss Linton generally?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95210">
     'Lively? no--he has shown the greatest distress,' I answered.  'To see
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95220">
     him, I should say, that instead of rambling with his sweetheart on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95230">
     hills, he ought to be in bed, under the hands of a doctor.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95250">
     'He shall be, in a day or two,' muttered Heathcliff.  'But first--get up,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95260">
     Linton!  Get up!' he shouted.  'Don't grovel on the ground there up, this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95270">
     moment!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95290">
     Linton had sunk prostrate again in another paroxysm of helpless fear,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95300">
     caused by his father's glance towards him, I suppose: there was nothing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95310">
     else to produce such humiliation.  He made several efforts to obey, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95320">
     his little strength was annihilated for the time, and he fell back again
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95330">
     with a moan.  Mr. Heathcliff advanced, and lifted him to lean against a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95340">
     ridge of turf.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95360">
     'Now,' said he, with curbed ferocity, 'I'm getting angry and if you don't

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95370">
     command that paltry spirit of yours--_damn_ you! get up directly!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95390">
     'I will, father,' he panted.  'Only, let me alone, or I shall faint.  I've
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95400">
     done as you wished, I'm sure.  Catherine will tell you that I--that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95410">
     I--have been cheerful.  Ah! keep by me, Catherine; give me your hand.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95430">
     'Take mine,' said his father; 'stand on your feet.  There now--she'll
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95440">
     lend you her arm: that's right, look at her.  You would imagine I was the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95450">
     devil himself, Miss Linton, to excite such horror.  Be so kind as to walk
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95460">
     home with him, will you?  He shudders if I touch him.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95480">
     'Linton dear!' whispered Catherine, 'I can't go to Wuthering Heights:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95490">
     papa has forbidden me.  He'll not harm you: why are you so afraid?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95510">
     'I can never re-enter that house,' he answered.  'I'm _not_ to re-enter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95520">
     it without you!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95540">
     'Stop!' cried his father.  'We'll respect Catherine's filial scruples.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95550">
     Nelly, take him in, and I'll follow your advice concerning the doctor,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95560">
     without delay.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95580">
     'You'll do well,' replied I.  'But I must remain with my mistress: to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95590">
     mind your son is not my business.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95610">
     'You are very stiff,' said Heathcliff, 'I know that: but you'll force me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95620">
     to pinch the baby and make it scream before it moves your charity.  Come,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95630">
     then, my hero.  Are you willing to return, escorted by me?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95650">
     He approached once more, and made as if he would seize the fragile being;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95660">
     but, shrinking back, Linton clung to his cousin, and implored her to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95670">
     accompany him, with a frantic importunity that admitted no denial.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95680">
     However I disapproved, I couldn't hinder her: indeed, how could she have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95690">
     refused him herself?  What was filling him with dread we had no means of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95700">
     discerning; but there he was, powerless under its grip, and any addition
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95710">
     seemed capable of shocking him into idiotcy.  We reached the threshold;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95720">
     Catherine walked in, and I stood waiting till she had conducted the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95730">
     invalid to a chair, expecting her out immediately; when Mr. Heathcliff,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95740">
     pushing me forward, exclaimed--'My house is not stricken with the plague,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95750">
     Nelly; and I have a mind to be hospitable to-day: sit down, and allow me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95760">
     to shut the door.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95780">
     He shut and locked it also.  I started.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95800">
     'You shall have tea before you go home,' he added.  'I am by myself.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95810">
     Hareton is gone with some cattle to the Lees, and Zillah and Joseph are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95820">
     off on a journey of pleasure; and, though I'm used to being alone, I'd
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95830">
     rather have some interesting company, if I can get it.  Miss Linton, take
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95840">
     your seat by _him_.  I give you what I have: the present is hardly worth
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95850">
     accepting; but I have nothing else to offer.  It is Linton, I mean.  How
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95860">
     she does stare!  It's odd what a savage feeling I have to anything that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95870">
     seems afraid of me!  Had I been born where laws are less strict and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95880">
     tastes less dainty, I should treat myself to a slow vivisection of those
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95890">
     two, as an evening's amusement.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95910">
     He drew in his breath, struck the table, and swore to himself, 'By hell!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95920">
     I hate them.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95940">
     'I am not afraid of you!' exclaimed Catherine, who could not hear the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95950">
     latter part of his speech.  She stepped close up; her black eyes flashing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95960">
     with passion and resolution.  'Give me that key: I will have it!' she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95970">
     said.  'I wouldn't eat or drink here, if I were starving.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_95990">
     Heathcliff had the key in his hand that remained on the table.  He looked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96000">
     up, seized with a sort of surprise at her boldness; or, possibly,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96010">
     reminded, by her voice and glance, of the person from whom she inherited
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96020">
     it.  She snatched at the instrument, and half succeeded in getting it out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96030">
     of his loosened fingers: but her action recalled him to the present; he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96040">
     recovered it speedily.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96060">
     'Now, Catherine Linton,' he said, 'stand off, or I shall knock you down;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96070">
     and, that will make Mrs. Dean mad.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96090">
     Regardless of this warning, she captured his closed hand and its contents
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96100">
     again.  'We _will_ go!' she repeated, exerting her utmost efforts to cause
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96110">
     the iron muscles to relax; and finding that her nails made no impression,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96120">
     she applied her teeth pretty sharply.  Heathcliff glanced at me a glance
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96130">
     that kept me from interfering a moment.  Catherine was too intent on his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96140">
     fingers to notice his face.  He opened them suddenly, and resigned the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96150">
     object of dispute; but, ere she had well secured it, he seized her with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96160">
     the liberated hand, and, pulling her on his knee, administered with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96170">
     other a shower of terrific slaps on both sides of the head, each
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96180">
     sufficient to have fulfilled his threat, had she been able to fall.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96200">
     At this diabolical violence I rushed on him furiously. 'You villain!' I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96210">
     began to cry, 'you villain!' A touch on the chest silenced me: I am
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96220">
     stout, and soon put out of breath; and, what with that and the rage, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96230">
     staggered dizzily back and felt ready to suffocate, or to burst a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96240">
     blood-vessel. The scene was over in two minutes; Catherine, released,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96250">
     put her two hands to her temples, and looked just as if she were not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96260">
     sure whether her ears were off or on. She trembled like a reed, poor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96270">
     thing, and leant against the table perfectly bewildered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96290">
     'I know how to chastise children, you see,' said the scoundrel, grimly,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96300">
     as he stooped to repossess himself of the key, which had dropped to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96310">
     floor.  'Go to Linton now, as I told you; and cry at your ease!  I shall
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96320">
     be your father, to-morrow--all the father you'll have in a few days--and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96330">
     you shall have plenty of that.  You can bear plenty; you're no weakling:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96340">
     you shall have a daily taste, if I catch such a devil of a temper in your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96350">
     eyes again!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96370">
     Cathy ran to me instead of Linton, and knelt down and put her burning
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96380">
     cheek on my lap, weeping aloud.  Her cousin had shrunk into a corner of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96390">
     the settle, as quiet as a mouse, congratulating himself, I dare say, that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96400">
     the correction had alighted on another than him.  Mr. Heathcliff,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96410">
     perceiving us all confounded, rose, and expeditiously made the tea
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96420">
     himself.  The cups and saucers were laid ready.  He poured it out, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96430">
     handed me a cup.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96450">
     'Wash away your spleen,' he said.  'And help your own naughty pet and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96460">
     mine.  It is not poisoned, though I prepared it.  I'm going out to seek
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96470">
     your horses.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96490">
     Our first thought, on his departure, was to force an exit somewhere.  We
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96500">
     tried the kitchen door, but that was fastened outside: we looked at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96510">
     windows--they were too narrow for even Cathy's little figure.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96530">
     'Master Linton,' I cried, seeing we were regularly imprisoned, 'you know
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96540">
     what your diabolical father is after, and you shall tell us, or I'll box
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96550">
     your ears, as he has done your cousin's.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96570">
     'Yes, Linton, you must tell,' said Catherine.  'It was for your sake I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96580">
     came; and it will be wickedly ungrateful if you refuse.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96600">
     'Give me some tea, I'm thirsty, and then I'll tell you,' he answered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96610">
     'Mrs. Dean, go away.  I don't like you standing over me.  Now, Catherine,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96620">
     you are letting your tears fall into my cup.  I won't drink that.  Give
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96630">
     me another.'  Catherine pushed another to him, and wiped her face.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96640">
     felt disgusted at the little wretch's composure, since he was no longer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96650">
     in terror for himself.  The anguish he had exhibited on the moor subsided
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96660">
     as soon as ever he entered Wuthering Heights; so I guessed he had been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96670">
     menaced with an awful visitation of wrath if he failed in decoying us
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96680">
     there; and, that accomplished, he had no further immediate fears.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96700">
     'Papa wants us to be married,' he continued, after sipping some of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96710">
     liquid.  'And he knows your papa wouldn't let us marry now; and he's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96720">
     afraid of my dying if we wait; so we are to be married in the morning,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96730">
     and you are to stay here all night; and, if you do as he wishes, you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96740">
     shall return home next day, and take me with you.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96760">
     'Take you with her, pitiful changeling!' I exclaimed.  '_You_ marry?  Why,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96770">
     the man is mad! or he thinks us fools, every one.  And do you imagine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96780">
     that beautiful young lady, that healthy, hearty girl, will tie herself to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96790">
     a little perishing monkey like you?  Are you cherishing the notion that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96800">
     anybody, let alone Miss Catherine Linton, would have you for a husband?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96810">
     You want whipping for bringing us in here at all, with your dastardly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96820">
     puling tricks: and--don't look so silly, now!  I've a very good mind to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96830">
     shake you severely, for your contemptible treachery, and your imbecile
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96840">
     conceit.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96860">
     I did give him a slight shaking; but it brought on the cough, and he took
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96870">
     to his ordinary resource of moaning and weeping, and Catherine rebuked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96880">
     me.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96900">
     'Stay all night?  No,' she said, looking slowly round.  'Ellen, I'll burn
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96910">
     that door down but I'll get out.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96930">
     And she would have commenced the execution of her threat directly, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96940">
     Linton was up in alarm for his dear self again.  He clasped her in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96950">
     two feeble arms sobbing:--'Won't you have me, and save me? not let me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96960">
     come to the Grange?  Oh, darling Catherine! you mustn't go and leave,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96970">
     after all.  You _must_ obey my father--you _must_!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_96990">
     'I must obey my own,' she replied, 'and relieve him from this cruel
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97000">
     suspense.  The whole night!  What would he think?  He'll be distressed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97010">
     already.  I'll either break or burn a way out of the house.  Be quiet!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97020">
     You're in no danger; but if you hinder me--Linton, I love papa better
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97030">
     than you!'  The mortal terror he felt of Mr. Heathcliff's anger restored
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97040">
     to the boy his coward's eloquence.  Catherine was near distraught: still,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97050">
     she persisted that she must go home, and tried entreaty in her turn,

     'Your beasts have trotted off,' he said, 'and--now Linton! snivelling

     He spoke these words, holding the door open for his son to pass, and the

     latter achieved his exit exactly as a spaniel might which suspected the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97210">
     person who attended on it of designing a spiteful squeeze.  The lock was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97220">
     re-secured.  Heathcliff approached the fire, where my mistress and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97230">
     stood silent.  Catherine looked up, and instinctively raised her hand to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97240">
     her cheek: his neighbourhood revived a painful sensation.  Anybody else
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97250">
     would have been incapable of regarding the childish act with sternness,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97260">
     but he scowled on her and muttered--'Oh! you are not afraid of me?  Your

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97270">
     courage is well disguised: you seem damnably afraid!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97290">
     'I _am_ afraid now,' she replied, 'because, if I stay, papa will be

     miserable: and how can I endure making him miserable--when he--when

     God! there is; though we be in an out-of-the-way place.  I'd inform if he

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97430">
     residence under my roof for the next twenty-four hours than informing me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97440">
     that such an event would follow.  As to your promise to marry Linton,
    </p>

     I'll take care you shall keep it; for you shall not quit this place till

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97480">
     'Send Ellen, then, to let papa know I'm safe!' exclaimed Catherine,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97490">
     weeping bitterly.  'Or marry me now.  Poor papa!  Ellen, he'll think

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97500">
     we're lost.  What shall we do?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97520">
     'Not he!  He'll think you are tired of waiting on him, and run off for a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97530">
     little amusement,' answered Heathcliff.  'You cannot deny that you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97540">
     entered my house of your own accord, in contempt of his injunctions to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97550">
     the contrary.  And it is quite natural that you should desire amusement
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97560">
     at your age; and that you would weary of nursing a sick man, and that man

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97570">
     _only_ your father.  Catherine, his happiest days were over when your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97580">
     days began.  He cursed you, I dare say, for coming into the world (I did,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97590">
     at least); and it would just do if he cursed you as _he_ went out of it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97600">
     I'd join him.  I don't love you!  How should I?  Weep away.  As far as I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97610">
     can see, it will be your chief diversion hereafter; unless Linton make
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97620">
     amends for other losses: and your provident parent appears to fancy he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97630">
     may.  His letters of advice and consolation entertained me vastly.  In
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97640">
     his last he recommended my jewel to be careful of his; and kind to her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97650">
     when he got her.  Careful and kind--that's paternal.  But Linton requires
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97660">
     his whole stock of care and kindness for himself.  Linton can play the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97670">
     little tyrant well.  He'll undertake to torture any number of cats, if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97680">
     their teeth be drawn and their claws pared.  You'll be able to tell his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97690">
     uncle fine tales of his _kindness_, when you get home again, I assure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97700">
     you.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97720">
     'You're right there!' I said; 'explain your son's character.  Show his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97730">
     resemblance to yourself: and then, I hope, Miss Cathy will think twice

     before she takes the cockatrice!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97760">
     'I don't much mind speaking of his amiable qualities now,' he answered;

     'because she must either accept him or remain a prisoner, and you along

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97790">
     here.  If you doubt, encourage her to retract her word, and you'll have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97800">
     an opportunity of judging!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97820">
     'I'll not retract my word,' said Catherine.  'I'll marry him within this

     you're a cruel man, but you're not a fiend; and you won't, from _mere_

     malice, destroy irrevocably all my happiness.  If papa thought I had left
    </p>

     I've given over crying: but I'm going to kneel here, at your knee; and

     I'll not get up, and I'll not take my eyes from your face till you look

     back at me!  No, don't turn away! _do look_! you'll see nothing to

     you never loved _anybody_ in all your life, uncle? _never_?  Ah! you must

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97920">
     look once.  I'm so wretched, you can't help being sorry and pitying me.'

     Heathcliff, brutally repulsing her.  'I'd rather be hugged by a snake.

     How the devil can you dream of fawning on me?  I _detest_ you!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97980">
     He shrugged his shoulders: shook himself, indeed, as if his flesh crept

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_97990">
     with aversion; and thrust back his chair; while I got up, and opened my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98000">
     mouth, to commence a downright torrent of abuse.  But I was rendered dumb
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98010">
     in the middle of the first sentence, by a threat that I should be shown
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98020">
     into a room by myself the very next syllable I uttered.  It was growing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98030">
     dark--we heard a sound of voices at the garden-gate.  Our host hurried
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98040">
     out instantly: _he_ had his wits about him; _we_ had not.  There was a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98050">
     talk of two or three minutes, and he returned alone.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98070">
     'I thought it had been your cousin Hareton,' I observed to Catherine.  'I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98080">
     wish he would arrive!  Who knows but he might take our part?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98100">
     'It was three servants sent to seek you from the Grange,' said
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98110">
     Heathcliff, overhearing me.  'You should have opened a lattice and called
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98120">
     out: but I could swear that chit is glad you didn't.  She's glad to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98130">
     obliged to stay, I'm certain.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98150">
     At learning the chance we had missed, we both gave vent to our grief
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98160">
     without control; and he allowed us to wail on till nine o'clock.  Then he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98170">
     bid us go upstairs, through the kitchen, to Zillah's chamber; and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98180">
     whispered my companion to obey: perhaps we might contrive to get through
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98190">
     the window there, or into a garret, and out by its skylight.  The window,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98200">
     however, was narrow, like those below, and the garret trap was safe from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98210">
     our attempts; for we were fastened in as before.  We neither of us lay
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98220">
     down: Catherine took her station by the lattice, and watched anxiously
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98230">
     for morning; a deep sigh being the only answer I could obtain to my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98240">
     frequent entreaties that she would try to rest.  I seated myself in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98250">
     chair, and rocked to and fro, passing harsh judgment on my many
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98260">
     derelictions of duty; from which, it struck me then, all the misfortunes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98270">
     of my employers sprang.  It was not the case, in reality, I am aware; but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98280">
     it was, in my imagination, that dismal night; and I thought Heathcliff
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98290">
     himself less guilty than I.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98310">
     At seven o'clock he came, and inquired if Miss Linton had risen.  She ran
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98320">
     to the door immediately, and answered, 'Yes.'  'Here, then,' he said,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98330">
     opening it, and pulling her out.  I rose to follow, but he turned the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98340">
     lock again.  I demanded my release.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98360">
     'Be patient,' he replied; 'I'll send up your breakfast in a while.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98380">
     I thumped on the panels, and rattled the latch angrily and Catherine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98390">
     asked why I was still shut up?  He answered, I must try to endure it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98400">
     another hour, and they went away.  I endured it two or three hours; at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98410">
     length, I heard a footstep: not Heathcliff's.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98430">
     'I've brought you something to eat,' said a voice; 'oppen t' door!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98450">
     Complying eagerly, I beheld Hareton, laden with food enough to last me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98460">
     all day.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98480">
     'Tak' it,' he added, thrusting the tray into my hand.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98500">
     'Stay one minute,' I began.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98520">
     'Nay,' cried he, and retired, regardless of any prayers I could pour
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98530">
     forth to detain him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98550">
     And there I remained enclosed the whole day, and the whole of the next
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98560">
     night; and another, and another.  Five nights and four days I remained,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98570">
     altogether, seeing nobody but Hareton once every morning; and he was a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98580">
     model of a jailor: surly, and dumb, and deaf to every attempt at moving
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98590">
     his sense of justice or compassion.

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98760">
     thin--you've not been so poorly, have you?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98780">
     'Your master is a true scoundrel!' I replied.  'But he shall answer for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98790">
     it.  He needn't have raised that tale: it shall all be laid bare!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98810">
     'What do you mean?' asked Zillah.  'It's not his tale: they tell that in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98820">
     the village--about your being lost in the marsh; and I calls to Earnshaw,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98830">
     when I come in--"Eh, they's queer things, Mr. Hareton, happened since I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98840">
     went off.  It's a sad pity of that likely young lass, and cant Nelly

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98850">
     Dean."  He stared.  I thought he had not heard aught, so I told him the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98860">
     rumour.  The master listened, and he just smiled to himself, and said,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98870">
     "If they have been in the marsh, they are out now, Zillah.  Nelly Dean is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98880">
     lodged, at this minute, in your room.  You can tell her to flit, when you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98890">
     go up; here is the key.  The bog-water got into her head, and she would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98900">
     have run home quite flighty; but I fixed her till she came round to her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98910">
     senses.  You can bid her go to the Grange at once, if she be able, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98920">
     carry a message from me, that her young lady will follow in time to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98930">
     attend the squire's funeral."'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98950">
     'Mr. Edgar is not dead?' I gasped.  'Oh! Zillah, Zillah!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98970">
     'No, no; sit you down, my good mistress,' she replied; 'you're right
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98980">
     sickly yet.  He's not dead; Doctor Kenneth thinks he may last another
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_98990">
     day.  I met him on the road and asked.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99010">
     Instead of sitting down, I snatched my outdoor things, and hastened
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99020">
     below, for the way was free.  On entering the house, I looked about for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99030">
     some one to give information of Catherine.  The place was filled with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99040">
     sunshine, and the door stood wide open; but nobody seemed at hand.  As I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99050">
     hesitated whether to go off at once, or return and seek my mistress, a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99060">
     slight cough drew my attention to the hearth.  Linton lay on the settle,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99070">
     sole tenant, sucking a stick of sugar-candy, and pursuing my movements
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99080">
     with apathetic eyes.  'Where is Miss Catherine?' I demanded sternly,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99090">
     supposing I could frighten him into giving intelligence, by catching him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99100">
     thus, alone.  He sucked on like an innocent.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99120">
     'Is she gone?' I said.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99140">
     'No,' he replied; 'she's upstairs: she's not to go; we won't let her.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99160">
     'You won't let her, little idiot!' I exclaimed.  'Direct me to her room
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99170">
     immediately, or I'll make you sing out sharply.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99190">
     'Papa would make you sing out, if you attempted to get there,' he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99200">
     answered.  'He says I'm not to be soft with Catherine: she's my wife, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99210">
     it's shameful that she should wish to leave me.  He says she hates me and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99220">
     wants me to die, that she may have my money; but she shan't have it: and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99230">
     she shan't go home!  She never shall!--she may cry, and be sick as much
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99240">
     as she pleases!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99260">
     He resumed his former occupation, closing his lids, as if he meant to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99270">
     drop asleep.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99290">
     'Master Heathcliff,' I resumed, 'have you forgotten all Catherine's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99300">
     kindness to you last winter, when you affirmed you loved her, and when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99310">
     she brought you books and sung you songs, and came many a time through
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99320">
     wind and snow to see you?  She wept to miss one evening, because you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99330">
     would be disappointed; and you felt then that she was a hundred times too
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99340">
     good to you: and now you believe the lies your father tells, though you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99350">
     know he detests you both.  And you join him against her.  That's fine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99360">
     gratitude, is it not?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99380">
     The corner of Linton's mouth fell, and he took the sugar-candy from his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99390">
     lips.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99410">
     'Did she come to Wuthering Heights because she hated you?' I continued.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99420">
     'Think for yourself!  As to your money, she does not even know that you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99430">
     will have any.  And you say she's sick; and yet you leave her alone, up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99440">
     there in a strange house!  You who have felt what it is to be so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99450">
     neglected!  You could pity your own sufferings; and she pitied them, too;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99460">
     but you won't pity hers!  I shed tears, Master Heathcliff, you see--an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99470">
     elderly woman, and a servant merely--and you, after pretending such
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99480">
     affection, and having reason to worship her almost, store every tear you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99490">
     have for yourself, and lie there quite at ease.  Ah! you're a heartless,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99500">
     selfish boy!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99520">
     'I can't stay with her,' he answered crossly.  'I'll not stay by myself.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99530">
     She cries so I can't bear it.  And she won't give over, though I say I'll
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99540">
     call my father.  I did call him once, and he threatened to strangle her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99550">
     if she was not quiet; but she began again the instant he left the room,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99560">
     moaning and grieving all night long, though I screamed for vexation that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99570">
     I couldn't sleep.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99590">
     'Is Mr. Heathcliff out?' I inquired, perceiving that the wretched
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99600">
     creature had no power to sympathize with his cousin's mental tortures.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99620">
     'He's in the court,' he replied, 'talking to Doctor Kenneth; who says
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99630">
     uncle is dying, truly, at last.  I'm glad, for I shall be master of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99640">
     Grange after him.  Catherine always spoke of it as her house.  It isn't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99650">
     hers!  It's mine: papa says everything she has is mine.  All her nice
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99660">
     books are mine; she offered to give me them, and her pretty birds, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99670">
     her pony Minny, if I would get the key of our room, and let her out; but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99680">
     I told her she had nothing to give, they were all, all mine.  And then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99690">
     she cried, and took a little picture from her neck, and said I should
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99700">
     have that; two pictures in a gold case, on one side her mother, and on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99710">
     the other uncle, when they were young.  That was yesterday--I said they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99720">
     were mine, too; and tried to get them from her.  The spiteful thing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99730">
     wouldn't let me: she pushed me off, and hurt me.  I shrieked out--that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99740">
     frightens her--she heard papa coming, and she broke the hinges and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99750">
     divided the case, and gave me her mother's portrait; the other she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99760">
     attempted to hide: but papa asked what was the matter, and I explained
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99770">
     it.  He took the one I had away, and ordered her to resign hers to me;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99780">
     she refused, and he--he struck her down, and wrenched it off the chain,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99790">
     and crushed it with his foot.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99810">
     'And were you pleased to see her struck?' I asked: having my designs in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99820">
     encouraging his talk.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99840">
     'I winked,' he answered: 'I wink to see my father strike a dog or a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99850">
     horse, he does it so hard.  Yet I was glad at first--she deserved
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99860">
     punishing for pushing me: but when papa was gone, she made me come to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99870">
     window and showed me her cheek cut on the inside, against her teeth, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99880">
     her mouth filling with blood; and then she gathered up the bits of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99890">
     picture, and went and sat down with her face to the wall, and she has
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99900">
     never spoken to me since: and I sometimes think she can't speak for pain.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99910">
     I don't like to think so; but she's a naughty thing for crying
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99920">
     continually; and she looks so pale and wild, I'm afraid of her.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99940">
     'And you can get the key if you choose?' I said.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99960">
     'Yes, when I am up-stairs,' he answered; 'but I can't walk up-stairs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99970">
     now.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_99990">
     'In what apartment is it?' I asked.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100010">
     'Oh,' he cried, 'I shan't tell _you_ where it is.  It is our secret.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100020">
     Nobody, neither Hareton nor Zillah, is to know.  There! you've tired
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100030">
     me--go away, go away!'  And he turned his face on to his arm, and shut
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100040">
     his eyes again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100060">
     I considered it best to depart without seeing Mr. Heathcliff, and bring a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100070">
     rescue for my young lady from the Grange.  On reaching it, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100080">
     astonishment of my fellow-servants to see me, and their joy also, was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100090">
     intense; and when they heard that their little mistress was safe, two or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100100">
     three were about to hurry up and shout the news at Mr. Edgar's door: but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100110">
     I bespoke the announcement of it myself.  How changed I found him, even
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100120">
     in those few days!  He lay an image of sadness and resignation awaiting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100130">
     his death.  Very young he looked: though his actual age was thirty-nine,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100140">
     one would have called him ten years younger, at least.  He thought of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100150">
     Catherine; for he murmured her name.  I touched his hand, and spoke.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100170">
     'Catherine is coming, dear master!' I whispered; 'she is alive and well;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100180">
     and will be here, I hope, to-night.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100200">
     I trembled at the first effects of this intelligence: he half rose up,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100210">
     looked eagerly round the apartment, and then sank back in a swoon.  As
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100220">
     soon as he recovered, I related our compulsory visit, and detention at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100230">
     the Heights.  I said Heathcliff forced me to go in: which was not quite
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100240">
     true.  I uttered as little as possible against Linton; nor did I describe
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100250">
     all his father's brutal conduct--my intentions being to add no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100260">
     bitterness, if I could help it, to his already over-flowing cup.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100280">
     He divined that one of his enemy's purposes was to secure the personal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100290">
     property, as well as the estate, to his son: or rather himself; yet why
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100300">
     he did not wait till his decease was a puzzle to my master, because
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100310">
     ignorant how nearly he and his nephew would quit the world together.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100320">
     However, he felt that his will had better be altered: instead of leaving
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100330">
     Catherine's fortune at her own disposal, he determined to put it in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100340">
     hands of trustees for her use during life, and for her children, if she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100350">
     had any, after her.  By that means, it could not fall to Mr. Heathcliff
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100360">
     should Linton die.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100380">
     Having received his orders, I despatched a man to fetch the attorney, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100390">
     four more, provided with serviceable weapons, to demand my young lady of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100400">
     her jailor.  Both parties were delayed very late.  The single servant
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100410">
     returned first.  He said Mr. Green, the lawyer, was out when he arrived
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100420">
     at his house, and he had to wait two hours for his re-entrance; and then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100430">
     Mr. Green told him he had a little business in the village that must be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100440">
     done; but he would be at Thrushcross Grange before morning.  The four men
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100450">
     came back unaccompanied also.  They brought word that Catherine was ill:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100460">
     too ill to quit her room; and Heathcliff would not suffer them to see
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100470">
     her.  I scolded the stupid fellows well for listening to that tale, which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100480">
     I would not carry to my master; resolving to take a whole bevy up to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100490">
     Heights, at day-light, and storm it literally, unless the prisoner were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100500">
     quietly surrendered to us.  Her father _shall_ see her, I vowed, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100510">
     vowed again, if that devil be killed on his own doorstones in trying to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100520">
     prevent it!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100540">
     Happily, I was spared the journey and the trouble.  I had gone
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100550">
     down-stairs at three o'clock to fetch a jug of water; and was passing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100560">
     through the hall with it in my hand, when a sharp knock at the front door
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100570">
     made me jump.  'Oh! it is Green,' I said, recollecting myself--'only
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100580">
     Green,' and I went on, intending to send somebody else to open it; but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100590">
     the knock was repeated: not loud, and still importunately.  I put the jug
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100600">
     on the banister and hastened to admit him myself.  The harvest moon shone
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100610">
     clear outside.  It was not the attorney.  My own sweet little mistress
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100620">
     sprang on my neck sobbing, 'Ellen, Ellen!  Is papa alive?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100640">
     'Yes,' I cried: 'yes, my angel, he is, God be thanked, you are safe with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100650">
     us again!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100670">
     She wanted to run, breathless as she was, up-stairs to Mr. Linton's room;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100680">
     but I compelled her to sit down on a chair, and made her drink, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100690">
     washed her pale face, chafing it into a faint colour with my apron.  Then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100700">
     I said I must go first, and tell of her arrival; imploring her to say,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100710">
     she should be happy with young Heathcliff.  She stared, but soon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100720">
     comprehending why I counselled her to utter the falsehood, she assured me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100730">
     she would not complain.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100750">
     I couldn't abide to be present at their meeting.  I stood outside the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100760">
     chamber-door a quarter of an hour, and hardly ventured near the bed,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100770">
     then.  All was composed, however: Catherine's despair was as silent as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100780">
     her father's joy.  She supported him calmly, in appearance; and he fixed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100790">
     on her features his raised eyes that seemed dilating with ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100810">
     He died blissfully, Mr. Lockwood: he died so.  Kissing her cheek, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100820">
     murmured,--'I am going to her; and you, darling child, shall come to us!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100830">
     and never stirred or spoke again; but continued that rapt, radiant gaze,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100840">
     till his pulse imperceptibly stopped and his soul departed.  None could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100850">
     have noticed the exact minute of his death, it was so entirely without a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100860">
     struggle.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100880">
     Whether Catherine had spent her tears, or whether the grief were too
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100890">
     weighty to let them flow, she sat there dry-eyed till the sun rose: she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100900">
     sat till noon, and would still have remained brooding over that deathbed,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100910">
     but I insisted on her coming away and taking some repose.  It was well I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100920">
     succeeded in removing her, for at dinner-time appeared the lawyer, having
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100930">
     called at Wuthering Heights to get his instructions how to behave.  He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100940">
     had sold himself to Mr. Heathcliff: that was the cause of his delay in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100950">
     obeying my master's summons.  Fortunately, no thought of worldly affairs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100960">
     crossed the latter's mind, to disturb him, after his daughter's arrival.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100980">
     Mr. Green took upon himself to order everything and everybody about the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_100990">
     place.  He gave all the servants but me, notice to quit.  He would have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101000">
     carried his delegated authority to the point of insisting that Edgar
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101010">
     Linton should not be buried beside his wife, but in the chapel, with his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101020">
     family.  There was the will, however, to hinder that, and my loud
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101030">
     protestations against any infringement of its directions.  The funeral
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101040">
     was hurried over; Catherine, Mrs. Linton Heathcliff now, was suffered to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101050">
     stay at the Grange till her father's corpse had quitted it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101070">
     She told me that her anguish had at last spurred Linton to incur the risk
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101080">
     of liberating her.  She heard the men I sent disputing at the door, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101090">
     she gathered the sense of Heathcliff's answer.  It drove her desperate.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101100">
     Linton who had been conveyed up to the little parlour soon after I left,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101110">
     was terrified into fetching the key before his father re-ascended.  He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101120">
     had the cunning to unlock and re-lock the door, without shutting it; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101130">
     when he should have gone to bed, he begged to sleep with Hareton, and his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101140">
     petition was granted for once.  Catherine stole out before break of day.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101150">
     She dared not try the doors lest the dogs should raise an alarm; she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101160">
     visited the empty chambers and examined their windows; and, luckily,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101170">
     lighting on her mother's, she got easily out of its lattice, and on to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101180">
     the ground, by means of the fir-tree close by.  Her accomplice suffered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101190">
     for his share in the escape, notwithstanding his timid contrivances.

     CHAPTER XXIX
    </head>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101260">
     The evening after the funeral, my young lady and I were seated in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101270">
     library; now musing mournfully--one of us despairingly--on our loss, now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101280">
     venturing conjectures as to the gloomy future.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101300">
     We had just agreed the best destiny which could await Catherine would be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101310">
     a permission to continue resident at the Grange; at least during Linton's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101320">
     life: he being allowed to join her there, and I to remain as housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101330">
     That seemed rather too favourable an arrangement to be hoped for; and yet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101340">
     I did hope, and began to cheer up under the prospect of retaining my home
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101350">
     and my employment, and, above all, my beloved young mistress; when a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101360">
     servant--one of the discarded ones, not yet departed--rushed hastily in,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101370">
     and said 'that devil Heathcliff' was coming through the court: should he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101380">
     fasten the door in his face?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101400">
     If we had been mad enough to order that proceeding, we had not time.  He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101410">
     made no ceremony of knocking or announcing his name: he was master, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101420">
     availed himself of the master's privilege to walk straight in, without
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101430">
     saying a word.  The sound of our informant's voice directed him to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101440">
     library; he entered and motioning him out, shut the door.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101460">
     It was the same room into which he had been ushered, as a guest, eighteen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101470">
     years before: the same moon shone through the window; and the same autumn
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101480">
     landscape lay outside.  We had not yet lighted a candle, but all the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101490">
     apartment was visible, even to the portraits on the wall: the splendid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101500">
     head of Mrs. Linton, and the graceful one of her husband.  Heathcliff
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101510">
     advanced to the hearth.  Time had little altered his person either.  There
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101520">
     was the same man: his dark face rather sallower and more composed, his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101530">
     frame a stone or two heavier, perhaps, and no other difference.  Catherine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101540">
     had risen with an impulse to dash out, when she saw him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101560">
     'Stop!' he said, arresting her by the arm.  'No more runnings away!  Where
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101570">
     would you go?  I'm come to fetch you home; and I hope you'll be a dutiful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101580">
     daughter and not encourage my son to further disobedience.  I was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101590">
     embarrassed how to punish him when I discovered his part in the business:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101600">
     he's such a cobweb, a pinch would annihilate him; but you'll see by his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101610">
     look that he has received his due!  I brought him down one evening, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101620">
     day before yesterday, and just set him in a chair, and never touched him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101630">
     afterwards.  I sent Hareton out, and we had the room to ourselves.  In
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101640">
     two hours, I called Joseph to carry him up again; and since then my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101650">
     presence is as potent on his nerves as a ghost; and I fancy he sees me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101660">
     often, though I am not near.  Hareton says he wakes and shrieks in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101670">
     night by the hour together, and calls you to protect him from me; and,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101680">
     whether you like your precious mate, or not, you must come: he's your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101690">
     concern now; I yield all my interest in him to you.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101710">
     'Why not let Catherine continue here,' I pleaded, 'and send Master Linton
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101720">
     to her?  As you hate them both, you'd not miss them: they can only be a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101730">
     daily plague to your unnatural heart.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101750">
     'I'm seeking a tenant for the Grange,' he answered; 'and I want my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101760">
     children about me, to be sure.  Besides, that lass owes me her services
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101770">
     for her bread.  I'm not going to nurture her in luxury and idleness after
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101780">
     Linton is gone.  Make haste and get ready, now; and don't oblige me to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101790">
     compel you.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101810">
     'I shall,' said Catherine.  'Linton is all I have to love in the world,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101820">
     and though you have done what you could to make him hateful to me, and me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101830">
     to him, you cannot make us hate each other.  And I defy you to hurt him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101840">
     when I am by, and I defy you to frighten me!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101860">
     'You are a boastful champion,' replied Heathcliff; 'but I don't like you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101870">
     well enough to hurt him: you shall get the full benefit of the torment,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101880">
     as long as it lasts.  It is not I who will make him hateful to you--it is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101890">
     his own sweet spirit.  He's as bitter as gall at your desertion and its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101900">
     consequences: don't expect thanks for this noble devotion.  I heard him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101910">
     draw a pleasant picture to Zillah of what he would do if he were as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101920">
     strong as I: the inclination is there, and his very weakness will sharpen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101930">
     his wits to find a substitute for strength.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101950">
     'I know he has a bad nature,' said Catherine: 'he's your son.  But I'm
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101960">
     glad I've a better, to forgive it; and I know he loves me, and for that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_101970">
     reason I love him.  Mr. Heathcliff _you_ have _nobody_ to love you; and,

     however miserable you make us, we shall still have the revenge of

     thinking that your cruelty arises from your greater misery.  You _are_
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102000">
     miserable, are you not?  Lonely, like the devil, and envious like him?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102010">
     _Nobody_ loves you--_nobody_ will cry for you when you die!  I wouldn't

     be you!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102040">
     Catherine spoke with a kind of dreary triumph: she seemed to have made up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102050">
     her mind to enter into the spirit of her future family, and draw pleasure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102060">
     from the griefs of her enemies.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102080">
     'You shall be sorry to be yourself presently,' said her father-in-law,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102090">
     'if you stand there another minute.  Begone, witch, and get your things!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102110">
     She scornfully withdrew.  In her absence I began to beg for Zillah's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102120">
     place at the Heights, offering to resign mine to her; but he would suffer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102130">
     it on no account.  He bid me be silent; and then, for the first time,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102140">
     allowed himself a glance round the room and a look at the pictures.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102150">
     Having studied Mrs. Linton's, he said--'I shall have that home.  Not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102160">
     because I need it, but--'  He turned abruptly to the fire, and continued,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102170">
     with what, for lack of a better word, I must call a smile--'I'll tell you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102180">
     what I did yesterday!  I got the sexton, who was digging Linton's grave,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102190">
     to remove the earth off her coffin lid, and I opened it.  I thought,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102200">
     once, I would have stayed there: when I saw her face again--it is hers
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102210">
     yet!--he had hard work to stir me; but he said it would change if the air
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102220">
     blew on it, and so I struck one side of the coffin loose, and covered it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102230">
     up: not Linton's side, damn him!  I wish he'd been soldered in lead.  And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102240">
     I bribed the sexton to pull it away when I'm laid there, and slide mine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102250">
     out too; I'll have it made so: and then by the time Linton gets to us
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102260">
     he'll not know which is which!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102280">
     'You were very wicked, Mr. Heathcliff!' I exclaimed; 'were you not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102290">
     ashamed to disturb the dead?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102310">
     'I disturbed nobody, Nelly,' he replied; 'and I gave some ease to myself.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102320">
     I shall be a great deal more comfortable now; and you'll have a better
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102330">
     chance of keeping me underground, when I get there.  Disturbed her?  No!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102340">
     she has disturbed me, night and day, through eighteen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102350">
     years--incessantly--remorselessly--till yesternight; and yesternight I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102360">
     was tranquil.  I dreamt I was sleeping the last sleep by that sleeper,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102370">
     with my heart stopped and my cheek frozen against hers.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102390">
     'And if she had been dissolved into earth, or worse, what would you have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102400">
     dreamt of then?' I said.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102420">
     'Of dissolving with her, and being more happy still!' he answered.  'Do
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102430">
     you suppose I dread any change of that sort?  I expected such a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102440">
     transformation on raising the lid--but I'm better pleased that it should
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102450">
     not commence till I share it.  Besides, unless I had received a distinct
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102460">
     impression of her passionless features, that strange feeling would hardly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102470">
     have been removed.  It began oddly.  You know I was wild after she died;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102480">
     and eternally, from dawn to dawn, praying her to return to me her spirit!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102490">
     I have a strong faith in ghosts: I have a conviction that they can, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102500">
     do, exist among us!  The day she was buried, there came a fall of snow.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102510">
     In the evening I went to the churchyard.  It blew bleak as winter--all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102520">
     round was solitary.  I didn't fear that her fool of a husband would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102530">
     wander up the glen so late; and no one else had business to bring them
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102540">
     there.  Being alone, and conscious two yards of loose earth was the sole
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102550">
     barrier between us, I said to myself--"I'll have her in my arms again!  If
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102560">
     she be cold, I'll think it is this north wind that chills _me_; and if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102570">
     she be motionless, it is sleep."  I got a spade from the tool-house, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102580">
     began to delve with all my might--it scraped the coffin; I fell to work
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102590">
     with my hands; the wood commenced cracking about the screws; I was on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102600">
     point of attaining my object, when it seemed that I heard a sigh from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102610">
     some one above, close at the edge of the grave, and bending down.  "If I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102620">
     can only get this off," I muttered, "I wish they may shovel in the earth
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102630">
     over us both!" and I wrenched at it more desperately still.  There was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102640">
     another sigh, close at my ear.  I appeared to feel the warm breath of it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102650">
     displacing the sleet-laden wind.  I knew no living thing in flesh and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102660">
     blood was by; but, as certainly as you perceive the approach to some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102670">
     substantial body in the dark, though it cannot be discerned, so certainly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102680">
     I felt that Cathy was there: not under me, but on the earth.  A sudden
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102690">
     sense of relief flowed from my heart through every limb.  I relinquished
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102700">
     my labour of agony, and turned consoled at once: unspeakably consoled.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102710">
     Her presence was with me: it remained while I re-filled the grave, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102720">
     led me home.  You may laugh, if you will; but I was sure I should see her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102730">
     there.  I was sure she was with me, and I could not help talking to her.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102740">
     Having reached the Heights, I rushed eagerly to the door.  It was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102750">
     fastened; and, I remember, that accursed Earnshaw and my wife opposed my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102760">
     entrance.  I remember stopping to kick the breath out of him, and then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102770">
     hurrying up-stairs, to my room and hers.  I looked round impatiently--I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102780">
     felt her by me--I could _almost_ see her, and yet I _could not_!  I ought
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102790">
     to have sweat blood then, from the anguish of my yearning--from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102800">
     fervour of my supplications to have but one glimpse!  I had not one.  She
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102810">
     showed herself, as she often was in life, a devil to me!  And, since
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102820">
     then, sometimes more and sometimes less, I've been the sport of that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102830">
     intolerable torture!  Infernal! keeping my nerves at such a stretch that,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102840">
     if they had not resembled catgut, they would long ago have relaxed to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102850">
     feebleness of Linton's.  When I sat in the house with Hareton, it seemed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102860">
     that on going out I should meet her; when I walked on the moors I should
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102870">
     meet her coming in.  When I went from home I hastened to return; she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102880">
     _must_ be somewhere at the Heights, I was certain!  And when I slept in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102890">
     her chamber--I was beaten out of that.  I couldn't lie there; for the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102900">
     moment I closed my eyes, she was either outside the window, or sliding
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102910">
     back the panels, or entering the room, or even resting her darling head
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102920">
     on the same pillow as she did when a child; and I must open my lids to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102930">
     see.  And so I opened and closed them a hundred times a night--to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102940">
     always disappointed!  It racked me!  I've often groaned aloud, till that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102950">
     old rascal Joseph no doubt believed that my conscience was playing the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102960">
     fiend inside of me.  Now, since I've seen her, I'm pacified--a little.  It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102970">
     was a strange way of killing: not by inches, but by fractions of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102980">
     hairbreadths, to beguile me with the spectre of a hope through eighteen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_102990">
     years!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103010">
     Mr. Heathcliff paused and wiped his forehead; his hair clung to it, wet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103020">
     with perspiration; his eyes were fixed on the red embers of the fire, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103030">
     brows not contracted, but raised next the temples; diminishing the grim
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103040">
     aspect of his countenance, but imparting a peculiar look of trouble, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103050">
     a painful appearance of mental tension towards one absorbing subject.  He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103060">
     only half addressed me, and I maintained silence.  I didn't like to hear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103070">
     him talk!  After a short period he resumed his meditation on the picture,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103080">
     took it down and leant it against the sofa to contemplate it at better
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103090">
     advantage; and while so occupied Catherine entered, announcing that she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103100">
     was ready, when her pony should be saddled.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103120">
     'Send that over to-morrow,' said Heathcliff to me; then turning to her,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103130">
     he added: 'You may do without your pony: it is a fine evening, and you'll
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103140">
     need no ponies at Wuthering Heights; for what journeys you take, your own
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103150">
     feet will serve you.  Come along.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103170">
     'Good-bye, Ellen!' whispered my dear little mistress.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103190">
     As she kissed me, her lips felt like ice.  'Come and see me, Ellen; don't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103200">
     forget.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103220">
     'Take care you do no such thing, Mrs. Dean!' said her new father.  'When
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103230">
     I wish to speak to you I'll come here.  I want none of your prying at my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103240">
     house!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103260">
     He signed her to precede him; and casting back a look that cut my heart,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103270">
     she obeyed.  I watched them, from the window, walk down the garden.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103280">
     Heathcliff fixed Catherine's arm under his: though she disputed the act
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103290">
     at first evidently; and with rapid strides he hurried her into the alley,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103300">
     whose trees concealed them.

     CHAPTER XXX
    </head>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103370">
     I have paid a visit to the Heights, but I have not seen her since she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103380">
     left: Joseph held the door in his hand when I called to ask after her,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103390">
     and wouldn't let me pass.  He said Mrs. Linton was 'thrang,' and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103400">
     master was not in.  Zillah has told me something of the way they go on,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103410">
     otherwise I should hardly know who was dead and who living.  She thinks
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103420">
     Catherine haughty, and does not like her, I can guess by her talk.  My
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103430">
     young lady asked some aid of her when she first came; but Mr. Heathcliff
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103440">
     told her to follow her own business, and let his daughter-in-law look
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103450">
     after herself; and Zillah willingly acquiesced, being a narrow-minded,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103460">
     selfish woman.  Catherine evinced a child's annoyance at this neglect;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103470">
     repaid it with contempt, and thus enlisted my informant among her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103480">
     enemies, as securely as if she had done her some great wrong.  I had a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103490">
     long talk with Zillah about six weeks ago, a little before you came, one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103500">
     day when we foregathered on the moor; and this is what she told me.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103520">
     'The first thing Mrs. Linton did,' she said, 'on her arrival at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103530">
     Heights, was to run up-stairs, without even wishing good-evening to me

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103540">
     and Joseph; she shut herself into Linton's room, and remained till
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103550">
     morning.  Then, while the master and Earnshaw were at breakfast, she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_103560">
     entered the house, and asked all in a quiver if the doctor might be sent

     for? her cousin was very ill.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_104510">
     heard Heathcliff's horse trot off, she made her appearance, donned in

     black, and her yellow curls combed back behind her ears as plain as a

     presentable; so, laughing, as I durst not laugh when the master is by, I

     offered to help him, if he would, and joked at his confusion.  He grew

     Hareton allowed Zillah to give him her aid; and she flattered him into a

     '"Oh! you are an exception," answered Mrs. Heathcliff.  "I never missed

     restrained himself from his Sunday occupations no longer.  He talked now,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_105500">
     freely enough; and she presently saw fit to retreat to her solitude: but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_105510">
     the frost had set in, and, in spite of her pride, she was forced to

     condescend to our company, more and more.  However, I took care there
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_105530">
     should be no further scorning at my good nature: ever since, I've been as

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_105540">
     stiff as herself; and she has no lover or liker among us: and she does
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_105550">
     not deserve one; for, let them say the least word to her, and she'll curl
    </p>

     back without respect of any one.  She'll snap at the master himself, and

     as good as dares him to thrash her; and the more hurt she gets, the more

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_105600">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_105820">
     Yesterday was bright, calm, and frosty.  I went to the Heights as I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_105830">
     proposed: my housekeeper entreated me to bear a little note from her to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_105840">
     her young lady, and I did not refuse, for the worthy woman was not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_105850">
     conscious of anything odd in her request.  The front door stood open, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_105860">
     the jealous gate was fastened, as at my last visit; I knocked and invoked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_105870">
     Earnshaw from among the garden-beds; he unchained it, and I entered.  The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_105880">
     fellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen.  I took particular notice
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_105890">
     of him this time; but then he does his best apparently to make the least
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_105900">
     of his advantages.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_105920">
     I asked if Mr. Heathcliff were at home?  He answered, No; but he would be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_105930">
     in at dinner-time.  It was eleven o'clock, and I announced my intention
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_105940">
     of going in and waiting for him; at which he immediately flung down his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_105950">
     tools and accompanied me, in the office of watchdog, not as a substitute
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_105960">
     for the host.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_105980">
     We entered together; Catherine was there, making herself useful in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_105990">
     preparing some vegetables for the approaching meal; she looked more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106000">
     sulky and less spirited than when I had seen her first. She hardly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106010">
     raised her eyes to notice me, and continued her employment with the same
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106020">
     disregard to common forms of politeness as before; never returning my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106030">
     bow and good-morning by the slightest acknowledgment.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106050">
     'She does not seem so amiable,' I thought, 'as Mrs. Dean would persuade
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106060">
     me to believe.  She's a beauty, it is true; but not an angel.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106080">
     Earnshaw surlily bid her remove her things to the kitchen.  'Remove them
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106090">
     yourself,' she said, pushing them from her as soon as she had done; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106100">
     retiring to a stool by the window, where she began to carve figures of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106110">
     birds and beasts out of the turnip-parings in her lap.  I approached her,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106120">
     pretending to desire a view of the garden; and, as I fancied, adroitly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106130">
     dropped Mrs. Dean's note on to her knee, unnoticed by Hareton--but she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106140">
     asked aloud, 'What is that?'  And chucked it off.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106160">
     'A letter from your old acquaintance, the housekeeper at the Grange,' I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106170">
     answered; annoyed at her exposing my kind deed, and fearful lest it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106180">
     should be imagined a missive of my own.  She would gladly have gathered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106190">
     it up at this information, but Hareton beat her; he seized and put it in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106200">
     his waistcoat, saying Mr. Heathcliff should look at it first.  Thereat,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106210">
     Catherine silently turned her face from us, and, very stealthily, drew
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106220">
     out her pocket-handkerchief and applied it to her eyes; and her cousin,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106230">
     after struggling awhile to keep down his softer feelings, pulled out the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106240">
     letter and flung it on the floor beside her, as ungraciously as he could.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106250">
     Catherine caught and perused it eagerly; then she put a few questions to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106260">
     me concerning the inmates, rational and irrational, of her former home;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106270">
     and gazing towards the hills, murmured in soliloquy:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106290">
     'I should like to be riding Minny down there!  I should like to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106300">
     climbing up there!  Oh!  I'm tired--I'm _stalled_, Hareton!'  And she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106310">
     leant her pretty head back against the sill, with half a yawn and half a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106320">
     sigh, and lapsed into an aspect of abstracted sadness: neither caring nor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106330">
     knowing whether we remarked her.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106350">
     'Mrs. Heathcliff,' I said, after sitting some time mute, 'you are not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106360">
     aware that I am an acquaintance of yours? so intimate that I think it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106370">
     strange you won't come and speak to me.  My housekeeper never wearies of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106380">
     talking about and praising you; and she'll be greatly disappointed if I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106390">
     return with no news of or from you, except that you received her letter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106400">
     and said nothing!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106420">
     She appeared to wonder at this speech, and asked,--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106440">
     'Does Ellen like you?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106460">
     'Yes, very well,' I replied, hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106480">
     'You must tell her,' she continued, 'that I would answer her letter, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106490">
     I have no materials for writing: not even a book from which I might tear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106500">
     a leaf.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106520">
     'No books!' I exclaimed.  'How do you contrive to live here without them?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106530">
     if I may take the liberty to inquire.  Though provided with a large
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106540">
     library, I'm frequently very dull at the Grange; take my books away, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106550">
     I should be desperate!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106570">
     'I was always reading, when I had them,' said Catherine; 'and Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106580">
     Heathcliff never reads; so he took it into his head to destroy my books.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106590">
     I have not had a glimpse of one for weeks.  Only once, I searched through
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106600">
     Joseph's store of theology, to his great irritation; and once, Hareton, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106610">
     came upon a secret stock in your room--some Latin and Greek, and some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106620">
     tales and poetry: all old friends.  I brought the last here--and you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106630">
     gathered them, as a magpie gathers silver spoons, for the mere love of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106640">
     stealing!  They are of no use to you; or else you concealed them in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106650">
     bad spirit that, as you cannot enjoy them, nobody else shall.  Perhaps
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106660">
     _your_ envy counselled Mr. Heathcliff to rob me of my treasures?  But
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106670">
     I've most of them written on my brain and printed in my heart, and you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106680">
     cannot deprive me of those!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106700">
     Earnshaw blushed crimson when his cousin made this revelation of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106710">
     private literary accumulations, and stammered an indignant denial of her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106720">
     accusations.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106740">
     'Mr. Hareton is desirous of increasing his amount of knowledge,' I said,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106750">
     coming to his rescue.  'He is not _envious_, but _emulous_ of your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106760">
     attainments.  He'll be a clever scholar in a few years.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106780">
     'And he wants me to sink into a dunce, meantime,' answered Catherine.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106790">
     'Yes, I hear him trying to spell and read to himself, and pretty blunders
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106800">
     he makes!  I wish you would repeat Chevy Chase as you did yesterday: it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106810">
     was extremely funny.  I heard you; and I heard you turning over the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106820">
     dictionary to seek out the hard words, and then cursing because you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106830">
     couldn't read their explanations!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106850">
     The young man evidently thought it too bad that he should be laughed at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106860">
     for his ignorance, and then laughed at for trying to remove it.  I had a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106870">
     similar notion; and, remembering Mrs. Dean's anecdote of his first
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106880">
     attempt at enlightening the darkness in which he had been reared, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106890">
     observed,--'But, Mrs. Heathcliff, we have each had a commencement, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106900">
     each stumbled and tottered on the threshold; had our teachers scorned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106910">
     instead of aiding us, we should stumble and totter yet.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106930">
     'Oh!' she replied, 'I don't wish to limit his acquirements: still, he has

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106940">
     no right to appropriate what is mine, and make it ridiculous to me with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106950">
     his vile mistakes and mispronunciations!  Those books, both prose and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106960">
     verse, are consecrated to me by other associations; and I hate to have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106970">
     them debased and profaned in his mouth!  Besides, of all, he has selected

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_106980">
     my favourite pieces that I love the most to repeat, as if out of

     deliberate malice.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107010">
     Hareton's chest heaved in silence a minute: he laboured under a severe
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107020">
     sense of mortification and wrath, which it was no easy task to suppress.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107030">
     I rose, and, from a gentlemanly idea of relieving his embarrassment, took
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107040">
     up my station in the doorway, surveying the external prospect as I stood.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107050">
     He followed my example, and left the room; but presently reappeared,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107060">
     bearing half a dozen volumes in his hands, which he threw into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107070">
     Catherine's lap, exclaiming,--'Take them!  I never want to hear, or read,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107080">
     or think of them again!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107100">
     'I won't have them now,' she answered.  'I shall connect them with you,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107110">
     and hate them.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107130">
     She opened one that had obviously been often turned over, and read a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107140">
     portion in the drawling tone of a beginner; then laughed, and threw it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107150">
     from her.  'And listen,' she continued, provokingly, commencing a verse
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107160">
     of an old ballad in the same fashion.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107180">
     But his self-love would endure no further torment: I heard, and not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107190">
     altogether disapprovingly, a manual check given to her saucy tongue.  The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107200">
     little wretch had done her utmost to hurt her cousin's sensitive though
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107210">
     uncultivated feelings, and a physical argument was the only mode he had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107220">
     of balancing the account, and repaying its effects on the inflictor.  He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107230">
     afterwards gathered the books and hurled them on the fire.  I read in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107240">
     countenance what anguish it was to offer that sacrifice to spleen.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107250">
     fancied that as they consumed, he recalled the pleasure they had already
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107260">
     imparted, and the triumph and ever-increasing pleasure he had anticipated
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107270">
     from them; and I fancied I guessed the incitement to his secret studies
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107280">
     also.  He had been content with daily labour and rough animal enjoyments,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107290">
     till Catherine crossed his path.  Shame at her scorn, and hope of her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107300">
     approval, were his first prompters to higher pursuits; and instead of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107310">
     guarding him from one and winning him to the other, his endeavours to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107320">
     raise himself had produced just the contrary result.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107340">
     'Yes that's all the good that such a brute as you can get from them!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107350">
     cried Catherine, sucking her damaged lip, and watching the conflagration
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107360">
     with indignant eyes.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107380">
     'You'd _better_ hold your tongue, now,' he answered fiercely.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107400">
     And his agitation precluded further speech; he advanced hastily to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107410">
     entrance, where I made way for him to pass.  But ere he had crossed the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107420">
     door-stones, Mr. Heathcliff, coming up the causeway, encountered him, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107430">
     laying hold of his shoulder asked,--'What's to do now, my lad?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107450">
     'Naught, naught,' he said, and broke away to enjoy his grief and anger in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107460">
     solitude.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107480">
     Heathcliff gazed after him, and sighed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107500">
     'It will be odd if I thwart myself,' he muttered, unconscious that I was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107510">
     behind him.  'But when I look for his father in his face, I find _her_
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107520">
     every day more!  How the devil is he so like?  I can hardly bear to see
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107530">
     him.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107550">
     He bent his eyes to the ground, and walked moodily in.  There was a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107560">
     restless, anxious expression in his countenance.  I had never remarked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107570">
     there before; and he looked sparer in person.  His daughter-in-law, on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107580">
     perceiving him through the window, immediately escaped to the kitchen, so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107590">
     that I remained alone.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107610">
     'I'm glad to see you out of doors again, Mr. Lockwood,' he said, in reply
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107620">
     to my greeting; 'from selfish motives partly: I don't think I could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107630">
     readily supply your loss in this desolation.  I've wondered more than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107640">
     once what brought you here.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107660">
     'An idle whim, I fear, sir,' was my answer; 'or else an idle whim is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107670">
     going to spirit me away.  I shall set out for London next week; and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107680">
     must give you warning that I feel no disposition to retain Thrushcross
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107690">
     Grange beyond the twelve months I agreed to rent it.  I believe I shall
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107700">
     not live there any more.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107720">
     'Oh, indeed; you're tired of being banished from the world, are you?' he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107730">
     said.  'But if you be coming to plead off paying for a place you won't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107740">
     occupy, your journey is useless: I never relent in exacting my due from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107750">
     any one.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107770">
     'I'm coming to plead off nothing about it,' I exclaimed, considerably
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107780">
     irritated.  'Should you wish it, I'll settle with you now,' and I drew my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107790">
     note-book from my pocket.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107810">
     'No, no,' he replied, coolly; 'you'll leave sufficient behind to cover
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107820">
     your debts, if you fail to return: I'm not in such a hurry.  Sit down and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107830">
     take your dinner with us; a guest that is safe from repeating his visit
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107840">
     can generally be made welcome.  Catherine! bring the things in: where are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107850">
     you?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107870">
     Catherine reappeared, bearing a tray of knives and forks.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107890">
     'You may get your dinner with Joseph,' muttered Heathcliff, aside, 'and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107900">
     remain in the kitchen till he is gone.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107920">
     She obeyed his directions very punctually: perhaps she had no temptation
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107930">
     to transgress.  Living among clowns and misanthropists, she probably
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107940">
     cannot appreciate a better class of people when she meets them.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107960">
     With Mr. Heathcliff, grim and saturnine, on the one hand, and Hareton,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107970">
     absolutely dumb, on the other, I made a somewhat cheerless meal, and bade
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107980">
     adieu early.  I would have departed by the back way, to get a last
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_107990">
     glimpse of Catherine and annoy old Joseph; but Hareton received orders to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108000">
     lead up my horse, and my host himself escorted me to the door, so I could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108010">
     not fulfil my wish.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108030">
     'How dreary life gets over in that house!' I reflected, while riding down
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108040">
     the road.  'What a realisation of something more romantic than a fairy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108050">
     tale it would have been for Mrs. Linton Heathcliff, had she and I struck
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108060">
     up an attachment, as her good nurse desired, and migrated together into

     the stirring atmosphere of the town!'

    </head>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108140">
     1802.--This September I was invited to devastate the moors of a friend in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108150">
     the north, and on my journey to his abode, I unexpectedly came within
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108160">
     fifteen miles of Gimmerton.  The ostler at a roadside public-house was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108170">
     holding a pail of water to refresh my horses, when a cart of very green
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108180">
     oats, newly reaped, passed by, and he remarked,--'Yon's frough Gimmerton,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108190">
     nah!  They're allas three wick' after other folk wi' ther harvest.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108210">
     'Gimmerton?' I repeated--my residence in that locality had already grown
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108220">
     dim and dreamy.  'Ah!  I know.  How far is it from this?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108240">
     'Happen fourteen mile o'er th' hills; and a rough road,' he answered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108260">
     A sudden impulse seized me to visit Thrushcross Grange.  It was scarcely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108270">
     noon, and I conceived that I might as well pass the night under my own
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108280">
     roof as in an inn.  Besides, I could spare a day easily to arrange
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108290">
     matters with my landlord, and thus save myself the trouble of invading
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108300">
     the neighbourhood again.  Having rested awhile, I directed my servant to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108310">
     inquire the way to the village; and, with great fatigue to our beasts, we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108320">
     managed the distance in some three hours.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108340">
     I left him there, and proceeded down the valley alone.  The grey church
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108350">
     looked greyer, and the lonely churchyard lonelier.  I distinguished a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108360">
     moor-sheep cropping the short turf on the graves.  It was sweet, warm
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108370">
     weather--too warm for travelling; but the heat did not hinder me from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108380">
     enjoying the delightful scenery above and below: had I seen it nearer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108390">
     August, I'm sure it would have tempted me to waste a month among its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108400">
     solitudes.  In winter nothing more dreary, in summer nothing more divine,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108410">
     than those glens shut in by hills, and those bluff, bold swells of heath.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108430">
     I reached the Grange before sunset, and knocked for admittance; but the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108440">
     family had retreated into the back premises, I judged, by one thin, blue
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108450">
     wreath, curling from the kitchen chimney, and they did not hear.  I rode
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108460">
     into the court.  Under the porch, a girl of nine or ten sat knitting, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108470">
     an old woman reclined on the housesteps, smoking a meditative pipe.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108490">
     'Is Mrs. Dean within?' I demanded of the dame.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108510">
     'Mistress Dean?  Nay!' she answered, 'she doesn't bide here: shoo's up at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108520">
     th' Heights.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108540">
     'Are you the housekeeper, then?' I continued.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108560">
     'Eea, aw keep th' hause,' she replied.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108580">
     'Well, I'm Mr. Lockwood, the master.  Are there any rooms to lodge me in,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108590">
     I wonder?  I wish to stay all night.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108610">
     'T' maister!' she cried in astonishment.  'Whet, whoiver knew yah wur

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108620">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108630">
     abaht t' place: nowt there isn't!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108650">
     She threw down her pipe and bustled in, the girl followed, and I entered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108660">
     too; soon perceiving that her report was true, and, moreover, that I had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108670">
     almost upset her wits by my unwelcome apparition, I bade her be composed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108680">
     I would go out for a walk; and, meantime she must try to prepare a corner
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108690">
     of a sitting-room for me to sup in, and a bedroom to sleep in.  No
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108700">
     sweeping and dusting, only good fire and dry sheets were necessary.  She
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108710">
     seemed willing to do her best; though she thrust the hearth-brush into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108720">
     the grates in mistake for the poker, and malappropriated several other
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108730">
     articles of her craft: but I retired, confiding in her energy for a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108740">
     resting-place against my return.  Wuthering Heights was the goal of my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108750">
     proposed excursion.  An afterthought brought me back, when I had quitted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108760">
     the court.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108780">
     'All well at the Heights?' I inquired of the woman.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108800">
     'Eea, f'r owt ee knaw!' she answered, skurrying away with a pan of hot
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108810">
     cinders.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108830">
     I would have asked why Mrs. Dean had deserted the Grange, but it was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108840">
     impossible to delay her at such a crisis, so I turned away and made my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108850">
     exit, rambling leisurely along, with the glow of a sinking sun behind,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108860">
     and the mild glory of a rising moon in front--one fading, and the other
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108870">
     brightening--as I quitted the park, and climbed the stony by-road
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108880">
     branching off to Mr. Heathcliff's dwelling.  Before I arrived in sight of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108890">
     it, all that remained of day was a beamless amber light along the west:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108900">
     but I could see every pebble on the path, and every blade of grass, by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108910">
     that splendid moon.  I had neither to climb the gate nor to knock--it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108920">
     yielded to my hand.  That is an improvement, I thought.  And I noticed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108930">
     another, by the aid of my nostrils; a fragrance of stocks and wallflowers
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108940">
     wafted on the air from amongst the homely fruit-trees.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108960">
     Both doors and lattices were open; and yet, as is usually the case in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108970">
     coal-district, a fine red fire illumined the chimney: the comfort which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108980">
     the eye derives from it renders the extra heat endurable.  But the house
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_108990">
     of Wuthering Heights is so large that the inmates have plenty of space
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109000">
     for withdrawing out of its influence; and accordingly what inmates there
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109010">
     were had stationed themselves not far from one of the windows.  I could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109020">
     both see them and hear them talk before I entered, and looked and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109030">
     listened in consequence; being moved thereto by a mingled sense of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109040">
     curiosity and envy, that grew as I lingered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109060">
     'Con-_trary_!' said a voice as sweet as a silver bell.  'That for the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109070">
     third time, you dunce!  I'm not going to tell you again. Recollect, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109080">
     I'll pull your hair!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109100">
     'Contrary, then,' answered another, in deep but softened tones. 'And now,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109110">
     kiss me, for minding so well.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109130">
     'No, read it over first correctly, without a single mistake.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109150">
     The male speaker began to read: he was a young man, respectably dressed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109160">
     and seated at a table, having a book before him.  His handsome features
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109170">
     glowed with pleasure, and his eyes kept impatiently wandering from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109180">
     page to a small white hand over his shoulder, which recalled him by a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109190">
     smart slap on the cheek, whenever its owner detected such signs of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109200">
     inattention.  Its owner stood behind; her light, shining ringlets
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109210">
     blending, at intervals, with his brown looks, as she bent to superintend
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109220">
     his studies; and her face--it was lucky he could not see her face, or he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109230">
     would never have been so steady.  I could; and I bit my lip in spite, at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109240">
     having thrown away the chance I might have had of doing something besides
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109250">
     staring at its smiting beauty.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109270">
     The task was done, not free from further blunders; but the pupil claimed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109280">
     a reward, and received at least five kisses; which, however, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109290">
     generously returned.  Then they came to the door, and from their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109300">
     conversation I judged they were about to issue out and have a walk on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109310">
     moors.  I supposed I should be condemned in Hareton Earnshaw's heart, if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109320">
     not by his mouth, to the lowest pit in the infernal regions if I showed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109330">
     my unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then; and feeling very mean
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109340">
     and malignant, I skulked round to seek refuge in the kitchen.  There was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109350">
     unobstructed admittance on that side also; and at the door sat my old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109360">
     friend Nelly Dean, sewing and singing a song; which was often interrupted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109370">
     from within by harsh words of scorn and intolerance, uttered in far from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109380">
     musical accents.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109400">
     'I'd rayther, by th' haulf, hev' 'em swearing i' my lugs fro'h morn to

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109420">
     answer to an unheard speech of Nelly's.  'It's a blazing shame, that I

     on't.  Oh, Lord, judge 'em, for there's norther law nor justice among wer

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109500">
     'No! or we should be sitting in flaming fagots, I suppose,' retorted the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109510">
     singer.  'But wisht, old man, and read your Bible like a Christian, and

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109520">
     never mind me.  This is "Fairy Annie's Wedding"--a bonny tune--it goes to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109530">
     a dance.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109550">
     Mrs. Dean was about to recommence, when I advanced; and recognising me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109560">
     directly, she jumped to her feet, crying--'Why, bless you, Mr. Lockwood!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109570">
     How could you think of returning in this way?  All's shut up at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109580">
     Thrushcross Grange.  You should have given us notice!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109600">
     'I've arranged to be accommodated there, for as long as I shall stay,' I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109610">
     answered.  'I depart again to-morrow.  And how are you transplanted here,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109620">
     Mrs. Dean? tell me that.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109640">
     'Zillah left, and Mr. Heathcliff wished me to come, soon after you went
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109650">
     to London, and stay till you returned.  But, step in, pray! Have you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109660">
     walked from Gimmerton this evening?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109680">
     'From the Grange,' I replied; 'and while they make me lodging room there,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109690">
     I want to finish my business with your master; because I don't think of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109700">
     having another opportunity in a hurry.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109720">
     'What business, sir?' said Nelly, conducting me into the house. 'He's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109730">
     gone out at present, and won't return soon.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109750">
     'About the rent,' I answered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109770">
     'Oh! then it is with Mrs. Heathcliff you must settle,' she observed; 'or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109780">
     rather with me.  She has not learnt to manage her affairs yet, and I act
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109790">
     for her: there's nobody else.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109810">
     I looked surprised.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109830">
     'Ah! you have not heard of Heathcliff's death, I see,' she continued.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109850">
     'Heathcliff dead!' I exclaimed, astonished.  'How long ago?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109870">
     'Three months since: but sit down, and let me take your hat, and I'll
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109880">
     tell you all about it.  Stop, you have had nothing to eat, have you?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109900">
     'I want nothing: I have ordered supper at home.  You sit down too. I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109910">
     never dreamt of his dying!  Let me hear how it came to pass.  You say you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109920">
     don't expect them back for some time--the young people?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109940">
     'No--I have to scold them every evening for their late rambles: but they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109950">
     don't care for me.  At least, have a drink of our old ale; it will do you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109960">
     good: you seem weary.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109980">
     She hastened to fetch it before I could refuse, and I heard Joseph asking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_109990">
     whether 'it warn't a crying scandal that she should have followers at her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110000">
     time of life?  And then, to get them jocks out o' t' maister's cellar!  He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110010">
     fair shaamed to 'bide still and see it.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110030">
     She did not stay to retaliate, but re-entered in a minute, bearing a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110040">
     reaming silver pint, whose contents I lauded with becoming earnestness.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110050">
     And afterwards she furnished me with the sequel of Heathcliff's history.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110060">
     He had a 'queer' end, as she expressed it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110080">
     I was summoned to Wuthering Heights, within a fortnight of your leaving
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110090">
     us, she said; and I obeyed joyfully, for Catherine's sake. My first
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110100">
     interview with her grieved and shocked me: she had altered so much since
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110110">
     our separation.  Mr. Heathcliff did not explain his reasons for taking a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110120">
     new mind about my coming here; he only told me he wanted me, and he was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110130">
     tired of seeing Catherine: I must make the little parlour my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110140">
     sitting-room, and keep her with me. It was enough if he were obliged to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110150">
     see her once or twice a day. She seemed pleased at this arrangement; and,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110160">
     by degrees, I smuggled over a great number of books, and other articles,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110170">
     that had formed her amusement at the Grange; and flattered myself we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110180">
     should get on in tolerable comfort.  The delusion did not last long.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110190">
     Catherine, contented at first, in a brief space grew irritable and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110200">
     restless. For one thing, she was forbidden to move out of the garden, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110210">
     it fretted her sadly to be confined to its narrow bounds as spring drew
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110220">
     on; for another, in following the house, I was forced to quit her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110230">
     frequently, and she complained of loneliness: she preferred quarrelling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110240">
     with Joseph in the kitchen to sitting at peace in her solitude.  I did
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110250">
     not mind their skirmishes: but Hareton was often obliged to seek the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110260">
     kitchen also, when the master wanted to have the house to himself! and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110270">
     though in the beginning she either left it at his approach, or quietly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110280">
     joined in my occupations, and shunned remarking or addressing him--and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110290">
     though he was always as sullen and silent as possible--after a while, she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110300">
     changed her behaviour, and became incapable of letting him alone: talking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110310">
     at him; commenting on his stupidity and idleness; expressing her wonder
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110320">
     how he could endure the life he lived--how he could sit a whole evening
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110330">
     staring into the fire, and dozing.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110350">
     'He's just like a dog, is he not, Ellen?' she once observed, 'or a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110360">
     cart-horse? He does his work, eats his food, and sleeps eternally! What
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110370">
     a blank, dreary mind he must have! Do you ever dream, Hareton? And, if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110380">
     you do, what is it about? But you can't speak to me!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110400">
     Then she looked at him; but he would neither open his mouth nor look
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110410">
     again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110430">
     'He's, perhaps, dreaming now,' she continued.  'He twitched his shoulder
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110440">
     as Juno twitches hers.  Ask him, Ellen.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110460">
     'Mr. Hareton will ask the master to send you up-stairs, if you don't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110470">
     behave!' I said.  He had not only twitched his shoulder but clenched his

     fist, as if tempted to use it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110500">
     'I know why Hareton never speaks, when I am in the kitchen,' she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110510">
     exclaimed, on another occasion.  'He is afraid I shall laugh at him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110520">
     Ellen, what do you think?  He began to teach himself to read once; and,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110530">
     because I laughed, he burned his books, and dropped it: was he not a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110540">
     fool?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110560">
     'Were not you naughty?' I said; 'answer me that.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110580">
     'Perhaps I was,' she went on; 'but I did not expect him to be so silly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110590">
     Hareton, if I gave you a book, would you take it now?  I'll try!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110610">
     She placed one she had been perusing on his hand; he flung it off, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110620">
     muttered, if she did not give over, he would break her neck.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110640">
     'Well, I shall put it here,' she said, 'in the table-drawer; and I'm
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110650">
     going to bed.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110670">
     Then she whispered me to watch whether he touched it, and departed.  But
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110680">
     he would not come near it; and so I informed her in the morning, to her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110690">
     great disappointment.  I saw she was sorry for his persevering sulkiness
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110700">
     and indolence: her conscience reproved her for frightening him off
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110710">
     improving himself: she had done it effectually.  But her ingenuity was at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110720">
     work to remedy the injury: while I ironed, or pursued other such
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110730">
     stationary employments as I could not well do in the parlour, she would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110740">
     bring some pleasant volume and read it aloud to me.  When Hareton was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110750">
     there, she generally paused in an interesting part, and left the book
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110760">
     lying about: that she did repeatedly; but he was as obstinate as a mule,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110770">
     and, instead of snatching at her bait, in wet weather he took to smoking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110780">
     with Joseph; and they sat like automatons, one on each side of the fire,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110790">
     the elder happily too deaf to understand her wicked nonsense, as he would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110800">
     have called it, the younger doing his best to seem to disregard it.  On
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110810">
     fine evenings the latter followed his shooting expeditions, and Catherine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110820">
     yawned and sighed, and teased me to talk to her, and ran off into the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110830">
     court or garden the moment I began; and, as a last resource, cried, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110840">
     said she was tired of living: her life was useless.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110860">
     Mr. Heathcliff, who grew more and more disinclined to society, had almost
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110870">
     banished Earnshaw from his apartment.  Owing to an accident at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110880">
     commencement of March, he became for some days a fixture in the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110890">
     His gun burst while out on the hills by himself; a splinter cut his arm,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110900">
     and he lost a good deal of blood before he could reach home.  The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110910">
     consequence was that, perforce, he was condemned to the fireside and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110920">
     tranquillity, till he made it up again.  It suited Catherine to have him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110930">
     there: at any rate, it made her hate her room up-stairs more than ever:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110940">
     and she would compel me to find out business below, that she might
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110950">
     accompany me.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110970">
     On Easter Monday, Joseph went to Gimmerton fair with some cattle; and, in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110980">
     the afternoon, I was busy getting up linen in the kitchen.  Earnshaw sat,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_110990">
     morose as usual, at the chimney corner, and my little mistress was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111000">
     beguiling an idle hour with drawing pictures on the window-panes, varying
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111010">
     her amusement by smothered bursts of songs, and whispered ejaculations,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111020">
     and quick glances of annoyance and impatience in the direction of her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111030">
     cousin, who steadfastly smoked, and looked into the grate.  At a notice
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111040">
     that I could do with her no longer intercepting my light, she removed to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111050">
     the hearthstone.  I bestowed little attention on her proceedings, but,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111060">
     presently, I heard her begin--'I've found out, Hareton, that I want--that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111070">
     I'm glad--that I should like you to be my cousin now, if you had not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111080">
     grown so cross to me, and so rough.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111100">
     Hareton returned no answer.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111120">
     'Hareton, Hareton, Hareton! do you hear?' she continued.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111140">
     'Get off wi' ye!' he growled, with uncompromising gruffness.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111160">
     'Let me take that pipe,' she said, cautiously advancing her hand and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111170">
     abstracting it from his mouth.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111190">
     Before he could attempt to recover it, it was broken, and behind the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111200">
     fire.  He swore at her and seized another.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111220">
     'Stop,' she cried, 'you must listen to me first; and I can't speak while
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111230">
     those clouds are floating in my face.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111250">
     'Will you go to the devil!' he exclaimed, ferociously, 'and let me be!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111270">
     'No,' she persisted, 'I won't: I can't tell what to do to make you talk
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111280">
     to me; and you are determined not to understand.  When I call you stupid,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111290">
     I don't mean anything: I don't mean that I despise you.  Come, you shall
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111300">
     take notice of me, Hareton: you are my cousin, and you shall own me.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111320">
     'I shall have naught to do wi' you and your mucky pride, and your damned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111330">
     mocking tricks!' he answered.  'I'll go to hell, body and soul, before I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111340">
     look sideways after you again.  Side out o' t' gate, now, this minute!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111360">
     Catherine frowned, and retreated to the window-seat chewing her lip, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111370">
     endeavouring, by humming an eccentric tune, to conceal a growing tendency
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111380">
     to sob.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111400">
     'You should be friends with your cousin, Mr. Hareton,' I interrupted,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111410">
     'since she repents of her sauciness.  It would do you a great deal of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111420">
     good: it would make you another man to have her for a companion.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111440">
     'A companion!' he cried; 'when she hates me, and does not think me fit to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111450">
     wipe her shoon!  Nay, if it made me a king, I'd not be scorned for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111460">
     seeking her good-will any more.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111480">
     'It is not I who hate you, it is you who hate me!' wept Cathy, no longer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111490">
     disguising her trouble.  'You hate me as much as Mr. Heathcliff does, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111500">
     more.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111520">
     'You're a damned liar,' began Earnshaw: 'why have I made him angry, by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111530">
     taking your part, then, a hundred times? and that when you sneered at and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111540">
     despised me, and--Go on plaguing me, and I'll step in yonder, and say you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111550">
     worried me out of the kitchen!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111570">
     'I didn't know you took my part,' she answered, drying her eyes; 'and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111580">
     was miserable and bitter at everybody; but now I thank you, and beg you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111590">
     to forgive me: what can I do besides?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111610">
     She returned to the hearth, and frankly extended her hand.  He blackened
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111620">
     and scowled like a thunder-cloud, and kept his fists resolutely clenched,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111630">
     and his gaze fixed on the ground.  Catherine, by instinct, must have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111640">
     divined it was obdurate perversity, and not dislike, that prompted this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111650">
     dogged conduct; for, after remaining an instant undecided, she stooped
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111660">
     and impressed on his cheek a gentle kiss.  The little rogue thought I had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111670">
     not seen her, and, drawing back, she took her former station by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111680">
     window, quite demurely.  I shook my head reprovingly, and then she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111690">
     blushed and whispered--'Well! what should I have done, Ellen?  He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111700">
     wouldn't shake hands, and he wouldn't look: I must show him some way that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111710">
     I like him--that I want to be friends.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111730">
     Whether the kiss convinced Hareton, I cannot tell: he was very careful,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111740">
     for some minutes, that his face should not be seen, and when he did raise
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111750">
     it, he was sadly puzzled where to turn his eyes.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111770">
     Catherine employed herself in wrapping a handsome book neatly in white
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111780">
     paper, and having tied it with a bit of ribbon, and addressed it to 'Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111790">
     Hareton Earnshaw,' she desired me to be her ambassadress, and convey the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111800">
     present to its destined recipient.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111820">
     'And tell him, if he'll take it, I'll come and teach him to read it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111830">
     right,' she said; 'and, if he refuse it, I'll go upstairs, and never
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111840">
     tease him again.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111860">
     I carried it, and repeated the message; anxiously watched by my employer.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111870">
     Hareton would not open his fingers, so I laid it on his knee.  He did not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111880">
     strike it off, either.  I returned to my work.  Catherine leaned her head
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111890">
     and arms on the table, till she heard the slight rustle of the covering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111900">
     being removed; then she stole away, and quietly seated herself beside her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111910">
     cousin.  He trembled, and his face glowed: all his rudeness and all his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111920">
     surly harshness had deserted him: he could not summon courage, at first,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111930">
     to utter a syllable in reply to her questioning look, and her murmured
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111940">
     petition.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111960">
     'Say you forgive me, Hareton, do.  You can make me so happy by speaking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111970">
     that little word.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_111990">
     He muttered something inaudible.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112010">
     'And you'll be my friend?' added Catherine, interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112030">
     'Nay, you'll be ashamed of me every day of your life,' he answered; 'and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112040">
     the more ashamed, the more you know me; and I cannot bide it.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112060">
     'So you won't be my friend?' she said, smiling as sweet as honey, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112070">
     creeping close up.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112090">
     I overheard no further distinguishable talk, but, on looking round again,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112100">
     I perceived two such radiant countenances bent over the page of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112110">
     accepted book, that I did not doubt the treaty had been ratified on both
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112120">
     sides; and the enemies were, thenceforth, sworn allies.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112140">
     The work they studied was full of costly pictures; and those and their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112150">
     position had charm enough to keep them unmoved till Joseph came home.  He,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112160">
     poor man, was perfectly aghast at the spectacle of Catherine seated on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112170">
     the same bench with Hareton Earnshaw, leaning her hand on his shoulder;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112180">
     and confounded at his favourite's endurance of her proximity: it affected
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112190">
     him too deeply to allow an observation on the subject that night.  His
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112200">
     emotion was only revealed by the immense sighs he drew, as he solemnly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112210">
     spread his large Bible on the table, and overlaid it with dirty
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112220">
     bank-notes from his pocket-book, the produce of the day's transactions.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112230">
     At length he summoned Hareton from his seat.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112250">
     'Tak' these in to t' maister, lad,' he said, 'and bide there.  I's gang
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112260">
     up to my own rahm.  This hoile's neither mensful nor seemly for us: we

     mun side out and seearch another.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112290">
     'Come, Catherine,' I said, 'we must "side out" too: I've done my ironing.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112300">
     Are you ready to go?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112320">
     'It is not eight o'clock!' she answered, rising unwillingly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112340">
     'Hareton, I'll leave this book upon the chimney-piece, and I'll bring
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112350">
     some more to-morrow.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112370">
     'Ony books that yah leave, I shall tak' into th' hahse,' said Joseph,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112380">
     'and it'll be mitch if yah find 'em agean; soa, yah may plase yerseln!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112400">
     Cathy threatened that his library should pay for hers; and, smiling as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112410">
     she passed Hareton, went singing up-stairs: lighter of heart, I venture
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112420">
     to say, than ever she had been under that roof before; except, perhaps,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112430">
     during her earliest visits to Linton.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112450">
     The intimacy thus commenced grew rapidly; though it encountered temporary
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112460">
     interruptions.  Earnshaw was not to be civilized with a wish, and my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112470">
     young lady was no philosopher, and no paragon of patience; but both their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112480">
     minds tending to the same point--one loving and desiring to esteem, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112490">
     the other loving and desiring to be esteemed--they contrived in the end
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112500">
     to reach it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112520">
     You see, Mr. Lockwood, it was easy enough to win Mrs. Heathcliff's heart.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112530">
     But now, I'm glad you did not try.  The crown of all my wishes will be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112540">
     the union of those two.  I shall envy no one on their wedding day: there

     CHAPTER XXXIII
    </head>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112620">
     On the morrow of that Monday, Earnshaw being still unable to follow his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112630">
     ordinary employments, and therefore remaining about the house, I speedily
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112640">
     found it would be impracticable to retain my charge beside me, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112650">
     heretofore.  She got downstairs before me, and out into the garden, where
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112660">
     she had seen her cousin performing some easy work; and when I went to bid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112670">
     them come to breakfast, I saw she had persuaded him to clear a large
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112680">
     space of ground from currant and gooseberry bushes, and they were busy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112690">
     planning together an importation of plants from the Grange.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112710">
     I was terrified at the devastation which had been accomplished in a brief
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112720">
     half-hour; the black-currant trees were the apple of Joseph's eye, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112730">
     she had just fixed her choice of a flower-bed in the midst of them.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112750">
     'There!  That will be all shown to the master,' I exclaimed, 'the minute
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112760">
     it is discovered.  And what excuse have you to offer for taking such
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112770">
     liberties with the garden?  We shall have a fine explosion on the head of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112780">
     it: see if we don't!  Mr. Hareton, I wonder you should have no more wit
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112790">
     than to go and make that mess at her bidding!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112810">
     'I'd forgotten they were Joseph's,' answered Earnshaw, rather puzzled;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112820">
     'but I'll tell him I did it.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112840">
     We always ate our meals with Mr. Heathcliff.  I held the mistress's post
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112850">
     in making tea and carving; so I was indispensable at table.  Catherine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112860">
     usually sat by me, but to-day she stole nearer to Hareton; and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112870">
     presently saw she would have no more discretion in her friendship than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112880">
     she had in her hostility.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112900">
     'Now, mind you don't talk with and notice your cousin too much,' were my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112910">
     whispered instructions as we entered the room.  'It will certainly annoy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112920">
     Mr. Heathcliff, and he'll be mad at you both.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112940">
     'I'm not going to,' she answered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112960">
     The minute after, she had sidled to him, and was sticking primroses in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112970">
     his plate of porridge.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_112990">
     He dared not speak to her there: he dared hardly look; and yet she went
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113000">
     on teasing, till he was twice on the point of being provoked to laugh.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113010">
     frowned, and then she glanced towards the master: whose mind was occupied
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113020">
     on other subjects than his company, as his countenance evinced; and she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113030">
     grew serious for an instant, scrutinizing him with deep gravity.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113040">
     Afterwards she turned, and recommenced her nonsense; at last, Hareton
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113050">
     uttered a smothered laugh.  Mr. Heathcliff started; his eye rapidly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113060">
     surveyed our faces, Catherine met it with her accustomed look of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113070">
     nervousness and yet defiance, which he abhorred.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113090">
     'It is well you are out of my reach,' he exclaimed.  'What fiend
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113100">
     possesses you to stare back at me, continually, with those infernal eyes?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113110">
     Down with them! and don't remind me of your existence again.  I thought I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113120">
     had cured you of laughing.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113140">
     'It was me,' muttered Hareton.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113160">
     'What do you say?' demanded the master.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113180">
     Hareton looked at his plate, and did not repeat the confession.  Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113190">
     Heathcliff looked at him a bit, and then silently resumed his breakfast
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113200">
     and his interrupted musing.  We had nearly finished, and the two young
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113210">
     people prudently shifted wider asunder, so I anticipated no further
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113220">
     disturbance during that sitting: when Joseph appeared at the door,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113230">
     revealing by his quivering lip and furious eyes that the outrage
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113240">
     committed on his precious shrubs was detected.  He must have seen Cathy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113250">
     and her cousin about the spot before he examined it, for while his jaws
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113260">
     worked like those of a cow chewing its cud, and rendered his speech
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113270">
     difficult to understand, he began:--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113290">
     'I mun hev' my wage, and I mun goa!  I _hed_ aimed to dee wheare I'd

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113380">
     'Now, now, idiot!' interrupted Heathcliff, 'cut it short!  What's your

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113390">
     grievance?  I'll interfere in no quarrels between you and Nelly.  She may

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113420">
     'It's noan Nelly!' answered Joseph.  'I sudn't shift for Nelly--nasty ill

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113490">
     lamented outright; unmanned by a sense of his bitter injuries, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113500">
     Earnshaw's ingratitude and dangerous condition.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113520">
     'Is the fool drunk?' asked Mr. Heathcliff.  'Hareton, is it you he's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113530">
     finding fault with?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113550">
     'I've pulled up two or three bushes,' replied the young man; 'but I'm
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113560">
     going to set 'em again.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113580">
     'And why have you pulled them up?' said the master.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113600">
     Catherine wisely put in her tongue.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113620">
     'We wanted to plant some flowers there,' she cried.  'I'm the only person
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113630">
     to blame, for I wished him to do it.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113650">
     'And who the devil gave _you_ leave to touch a stick about the place?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113660">
     demanded her father-in-law, much surprised.  'And who ordered _you_ to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113670">
     obey her?' he added, turning to Hareton.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113690">
     The latter was speechless; his cousin replied--'You shouldn't grudge a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113700">
     few yards of earth for me to ornament, when you have taken all my land!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113720">
     'Your land, insolent slut!  You never had any,' said Heathcliff.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113740">
     'And my money,' she continued; returning his angry glare, and meantime
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113750">
     biting a piece of crust, the remnant of her breakfast.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113770">
     'Silence!' he exclaimed.  'Get done, and begone!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113790">
     'And Hareton's land, and his money,' pursued the reckless thing.  'Hareton
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113800">
     and I are friends now; and I shall tell him all about you!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113820">
     The master seemed confounded a moment: he grew pale, and rose up, eyeing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113830">
     her all the while, with an expression of mortal hate.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113850">
     'If you strike me, Hareton will strike you,' she said; 'so you may as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113860">
     well sit down.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113880">
     'If Hareton does not turn you out of the room, I'll strike him to hell,'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113890">
     thundered Heathcliff.  'Damnable witch! dare you pretend to rouse him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113900">
     against me?  Off with her!  Do you hear?  Fling her into the kitchen!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113910">
     I'll kill her, Ellen Dean, if you let her come into my sight again!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113930">
     Hareton tried, under his breath, to persuade her to go.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113950">
     'Drag her away!' he cried, savagely.  'Are you staying to talk?'  And he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113960">
     approached to execute his own command.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113980">
     'He'll not obey you, wicked man, any more,' said Catherine; 'and he'll
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_113990">
     soon detest you as much as I do.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114010">
     'Wisht! wisht!' muttered the young man, reproachfully; 'I will not hear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114020">
     you speak so to him.  Have done.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114040">
     'But you won't let him strike me?' she cried.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114060">
     'Come, then,' he whispered earnestly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114080">
     It was too late: Heathcliff had caught hold of her.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114100">
     'Now, _you_ go!' he said to Earnshaw.  'Accursed witch! this time she has
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114110">
     provoked me when I could not bear it; and I'll make her repent it for

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114120">
     ever!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114140">
     He had his hand in her hair; Hareton attempted to release her locks,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114150">
     entreating him not to hurt her that once.  Heathcliff's black eyes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114160">
     flashed; he seemed ready to tear Catherine in pieces, and I was just
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114170">
     worked up to risk coming to the rescue, when of a sudden his fingers
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114180">
     relaxed; he shifted his grasp from her head to her arm, and gazed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114190">
     intently in her face.  Then he drew his hand over his eyes, stood a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114200">
     moment to collect himself apparently, and turning anew to Catherine,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114210">
     said, with assumed calmness--'You must learn to avoid putting me in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114220">
     passion, or I shall really murder you some time!  Go with Mrs. Dean, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114230">
     keep with her; and confine your insolence to her ears.  As to Hareton
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114240">
     Earnshaw, if I see him listen to you, I'll send him seeking his bread
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114250">
     where he can get it!  Your love will make him an outcast and a beggar.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114260">
     Nelly, take her; and leave me, all of you!  Leave me!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114280">
     I led my young lady out: she was too glad of her escape to resist; the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114290">
     other followed, and Mr. Heathcliff had the room to himself till dinner.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114300">
     had counselled Catherine to dine up-stairs; but, as soon as he perceived
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114310">
     her vacant seat, he sent me to call her.  He spoke to none of us, ate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114320">
     very little, and went out directly afterwards, intimating that he should
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114330">
     not return before evening.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114350">
     The two new friends established themselves in the house during his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114360">
     absence; where I heard Hareton sternly check his cousin, on her offering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114370">
     a revelation of her father-in-law's conduct to his father.  He said he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114380">
     wouldn't suffer a word to be uttered in his disparagement: if he were the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114390">
     devil, it didn't signify; he would stand by him; and he'd rather she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114400">
     would abuse himself, as she used to, than begin on Mr. Heathcliff.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114410">
     Catherine was waxing cross at this; but he found means to make her hold
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114420">
     her tongue, by asking how she would like _him_ to speak ill of her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114430">
     father?  Then she comprehended that Earnshaw took the master's reputation
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114440">
     home to himself; and was attached by ties stronger than reason could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114450">
     break--chains, forged by habit, which it would be cruel to attempt to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114460">
     loosen.  She showed a good heart, thenceforth, in avoiding both
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114470">
     complaints and expressions of antipathy concerning Heathcliff; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114480">
     confessed to me her sorrow that she had endeavoured to raise a bad spirit
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114490">
     between him and Hareton: indeed, I don't believe she has ever breathed a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114500">
     syllable, in the latter's hearing, against her oppressor since.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114520">
     When this slight disagreement was over, they were friends again, and as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114530">
     busy as possible in their several occupations of pupil and teacher.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114540">
     came in to sit with them, after I had done my work; and I felt so soothed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114550">
     and comforted to watch them, that I did not notice how time got on.  You
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114560">
     know, they both appeared in a measure my children: I had long been proud
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114570">
     of one; and now, I was sure, the other would be a source of equal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114580">
     satisfaction.  His honest, warm, and intelligent nature shook off rapidly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114590">
     the clouds of ignorance and degradation in which it had been bred; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114600">
     Catherine's sincere commendations acted as a spur to his industry.  His
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114610">
     brightening mind brightened his features, and added spirit and nobility
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114620">
     to their aspect: I could hardly fancy it the same individual I had beheld
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114630">
     on the day I discovered my little lady at Wuthering Heights, after her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114640">
     expedition to the Crags.  While I admired and they laboured, dusk drew
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114650">
     on, and with it returned the master.  He came upon us quite unexpectedly,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114660">
     entering by the front way, and had a full view of the whole three, ere we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114670">
     could raise our heads to glance at him.  Well, I reflected, there was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114680">
     never a pleasanter, or more harmless sight; and it will be a burning
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114690">
     shame to scold them.  The red fire-light glowed on their two bonny heads,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114700">
     and revealed their faces animated with the eager interest of children;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114710">
     for, though he was twenty-three and she eighteen, each had so much of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114720">
     novelty to feel and learn, that neither experienced nor evinced the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114730">
     sentiments of sober disenchanted maturity.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114750">
     They lifted their eyes together, to encounter Mr. Heathcliff: perhaps you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114760">
     have never remarked that their eyes are precisely similar, and they are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114770">
     those of Catherine Earnshaw.  The present Catherine has no other likeness
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114780">
     to her, except a breadth of forehead, and a certain arch of the nostril
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114790">
     that makes her appear rather haughty, whether she will or not.  With
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114800">
     Hareton the resemblance is carried farther: it is singular at all times,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114810">
     _then_ it was particularly striking; because his senses were alert, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114820">
     his mental faculties wakened to unwonted activity.  I suppose this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114830">
     resemblance disarmed Mr. Heathcliff: he walked to the hearth in evident
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114840">
     agitation; but it quickly subsided as he looked at the young man: or, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114850">
     should say, altered its character; for it was there yet.  He took the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114860">
     book from his hand, and glanced at the open page, then returned it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114870">
     without any observation; merely signing Catherine away: her companion
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114880">
     lingered very little behind her, and I was about to depart also, but he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114890">
     bid me sit still.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114910">
     'It is a poor conclusion, is it not?' he observed, having brooded awhile
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114920">
     on the scene he had just witnessed: 'an absurd termination to my violent
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114940">
     train myself to be capable of working like Hercules, and when everything
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114950">

     has vanished!  My old enemies have not beaten me; now would be the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114970">
     precise time to revenge myself on their representatives: I could do it;
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_114990">
     striking: I can't take the trouble to raise my hand!  That sounds as if I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115000">
     had been labouring the whole time only to exhibit a fine trait of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115010">
     magnanimity.  It is far from being the case: I have lost the faculty of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115020">
     enjoying their destruction, and I am too idle to destroy for nothing.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115040">
     'Nelly, there is a strange change approaching; I'm in its shadow at

     objects which retain a distinct material appearance to me; and that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115080">
     appearance causes me pain, amounting to agony.  About _her_ I won't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115090">
     speak; and I don't desire to think; but I earnestly wish she were
    </p>

     invisible: her presence invokes only maddening sensations.  _He_ moves me
    </p>

     differently: and yet if I could do it without seeming insane, I'd never

     see him again!  You'll perhaps think me rather inclined to become so,' he

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115130">
     added, making an effort to smile, 'if I try to describe the thousand
    </p>

     forms of past associations and ideas he awakens or embodies.  But you'll

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115150">
     not talk of what I tell you; and my mind is so eternally secluded in

     itself, it is tempting at last to turn it out to another.

     'Five minutes ago Hareton seemed a personification of my youth, not a

     human being; I felt to him in such a variety of ways, that it would have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115200">
     been impossible to have accosted him rationally.  In the first place, his
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115240">
     does not recall her?  I cannot look down to this floor, but her features

     at night, and caught by glimpses in every object by day--I am surrounded

     features--mock me with a resemblance.  The entire world is a dreadful

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115430">
     to his reason, from childhood he had a delight in dwelling on dark
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115440">
     things, and entertaining odd fancies.  He might have had a monomania on
    </p>

     the subject of his departed idol; but on every other point his wits were

     as sound as mine.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115480">
     'I shall not know that till it comes,' he said; 'I'm only half conscious

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115670">
     yearning to attain it.  They have yearned towards it so long, and so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115680">
     unwaveringly, that I'm convinced it will be reached--and soon--because it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115690">
     has devoured my existence: I am swallowed up in the anticipation of its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115700">
     fulfilment.  My confessions have not relieved me; but they may account
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115710">
     for some otherwise unaccountable phases of humour which I show.  O God!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115720">
     It is a long fight; I wish it were over!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115740">
     He began to pace the room, muttering terrible things to himself, till I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115750">
     was inclined to believe, as he said Joseph did, that conscience had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115760">
     turned his heart to an earthly hell.  I wondered greatly how it would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115770">
     end.  Though he seldom before had revealed this state of mind, even by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115780">
     looks, it was his habitual mood, I had no doubt: he asserted it himself;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115790">
     but not a soul, from his general bearing, would have conjectured the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115800">
     fact.  You did not when you saw him, Mr. Lockwood: and at the period of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115810">
     which I speak, he was just the same as then; only fonder of continued
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115820">
     solitude, and perhaps still more laconic in company.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115890">
     For some days after that evening Mr. Heathcliff shunned meeting us at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115900">
     meals; yet he would not consent formally to exclude Hareton and Cathy.  He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115910">
     had an aversion to yielding so completely to his feelings, choosing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115920">
     rather to absent himself; and eating once in twenty-four hours seemed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115930">
     sufficient sustenance for him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115950">
     One night, after the family were in bed, I heard him go downstairs, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115960">
     out at the front door.  I did not hear him re-enter, and in the morning I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115970">
     found he was still away.  We were in April then: the weather was sweet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115980">
     and warm, the grass as green as showers and sun could make it, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_115990">
     two dwarf apple-trees near the southern wall in full bloom.  After
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116000">
     breakfast, Catherine insisted on my bringing a chair and sitting with my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116010">
     work under the fir-trees at the end of the house; and she beguiled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116020">
     Hareton, who had perfectly recovered from his accident, to dig and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116030">
     arrange her little garden, which was shifted to that corner by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116040">
     influence of Joseph's complaints.  I was comfortably revelling in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116050">
     spring fragrance around, and the beautiful soft blue overhead, when my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116060">
     young lady, who had run down near the gate to procure some primrose roots
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116070">
     for a border, returned only half laden, and informed us that Mr.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116080">
     Heathcliff was coming in.  'And he spoke to me,' she added, with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116090">
     perplexed countenance.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116110">
     'What did he say?' asked Hareton.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116130">
     'He told me to begone as fast as I could,' she answered.  'But he looked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116140">
     so different from his usual look that I stopped a moment to stare at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116150">
     him.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116170">
     'How?' he inquired.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116190">
     'Why, almost bright and cheerful.  No, _almost_ nothing--_very much_
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116200">
     excited, and wild, and glad!' she replied.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116220">
     'Night-walking amuses him, then,' I remarked, affecting a careless
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116230">
     manner: in reality as surprised as she was, and anxious to ascertain the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116240">
     truth of her statement; for to see the master looking glad would not be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116250">
     an every-day spectacle.  I framed an excuse to go in.  Heathcliff stood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116260">
     at the open door; he was pale, and he trembled: yet, certainly, he had a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116270">
     strange joyful glitter in his eyes, that altered the aspect of his whole
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116280">
     face.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116300">
     'Will you have some breakfast?' I said.  'You must be hungry, rambling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116310">
     about all night!'  I wanted to discover where he had been, but I did not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116320">
     like to ask directly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116340">
     'No, I'm not hungry,' he answered, averting his head, and speaking rather
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116350">
     contemptuously, as if he guessed I was trying to divine the occasion of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116360">
     his good humour.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116380">
     I felt perplexed: I didn't know whether it were not a proper opportunity
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116390">
     to offer a bit of admonition.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116410">
     'I don't think it right to wander out of doors,' I observed, 'instead of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116420">
     being in bed: it is not wise, at any rate this moist season.  I daresay
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116430">
     you'll catch a bad cold or a fever: you have something the matter with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116440">
     you now!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116460">
     'Nothing but what I can bear,' he replied; 'and with the greatest
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116470">
     pleasure, provided you'll leave me alone: get in, and don't annoy me.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116490">
     I obeyed: and, in passing, I noticed he breathed as fast as a cat.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116510">
     'Yes!' I reflected to myself, 'we shall have a fit of illness.  I cannot
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116520">
     conceive what he has been doing.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116540">
     That noon he sat down to dinner with us, and received a heaped-up plate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116550">
     from my hands, as if he intended to make amends for previous fasting.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116570">
     'I've neither cold nor fever, Nelly,' he remarked, in allusion to my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116580">
     morning's speech; 'and I'm ready to do justice to the food you give me.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116600">
     He took his knife and fork, and was going to commence eating, when the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116610">
     inclination appeared to become suddenly extinct.  He laid them on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116620">
     table, looked eagerly towards the window, then rose and went out.  We saw
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116630">
     him walking to and fro in the garden while we concluded our meal, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116640">
     Earnshaw said he'd go and ask why he would not dine: he thought we had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116650">
     grieved him some way.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116670">
     'Well, is he coming?' cried Catherine, when her cousin returned.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116690">
     'Nay,' he answered; 'but he's not angry: he seemed rarely pleased indeed;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116700">
     only I made him impatient by speaking to him twice; and then he bid me be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116710">
     off to you: he wondered how I could want the company of anybody else.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116730">
     I set his plate to keep warm on the fender; and after an hour or two he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116740">
     re-entered, when the room was clear, in no degree calmer: the same
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116750">
     unnatural--it was unnatural--appearance of joy under his black brows; the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116760">
     same bloodless hue, and his teeth visible, now and then, in a kind of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116770">
     smile; his frame shivering, not as one shivers with chill or weakness,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116780">
     but as a tight-stretched cord vibrates--a strong thrilling, rather than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116790">
     trembling.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116810">
     I will ask what is the matter, I thought; or who should?  And I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116820">
     exclaimed--'Have you heard any good news, Mr. Heathcliff?  You look
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116830">
     uncommonly animated.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116850">
     'Where should good news come from to me?' he said.  'I'm animated with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116860">
     hunger; and, seemingly, I must not eat.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116880">
     'Your dinner is here,' I returned; 'why won't you get it?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116900">
     'I don't want it now,' he muttered, hastily: 'I'll wait till supper.  And,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116910">
     Nelly, once for all, let me beg you to warn Hareton and the other away
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116920">
     from me.  I wish to be troubled by nobody: I wish to have this place to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116930">
     myself.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116950">
     'Is there some new reason for this banishment?' I inquired.  'Tell me why
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116960">
     you are so queer, Mr. Heathcliff?  Where were you last night?  I'm not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116970">
     putting the question through idle curiosity, but--'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_116990">
     'You are putting the question through very idle curiosity,' he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117000">
     interrupted, with a laugh.  'Yet I'll answer it.  Last night I was on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117010">
     threshold of hell.  To-day, I am within sight of my heaven.  I have my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117020">
     eyes on it: hardly three feet to sever me!  And now you'd better go!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117030">
     You'll neither see nor hear anything to frighten you, if you refrain from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117040">
     prying.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117060">
     Having swept the hearth and wiped the table, I departed; more perplexed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117070">
     than ever.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117090">
     He did not quit the house again that afternoon, and no one intruded on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117100">
     his solitude; till, at eight o'clock, I deemed it proper, though
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117110">
     unsummoned, to carry a candle and his supper to him.  He was leaning
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117120">
     against the ledge of an open lattice, but not looking out: his face was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117130">
     turned to the interior gloom.  The fire had smouldered to ashes; the room
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117140">
     was filled with the damp, mild air of the cloudy evening; and so still,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117150">
     that not only the murmur of the beck down Gimmerton was distinguishable,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117160">
     but its ripples and its gurgling over the pebbles, or through the large
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117170">
     stones which it could not cover.  I uttered an ejaculation of discontent
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117180">
     at seeing the dismal grate, and commenced shutting the casements, one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117190">
     after another, till I came to his.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117210">
     'Must I close this?' I asked, in order to rouse him; for he would not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117220">
     stir.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117240">
     The light flashed on his features as I spoke.  Oh, Mr. Lockwood, I cannot
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117250">
     express what a terrible start I got by the momentary view!  Those deep
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117260">
     black eyes!  That smile, and ghastly paleness!  It appeared to me, not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117270">
     Mr. Heathcliff, but a goblin; and, in my terror, I let the candle bend
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117280">
     towards the wall, and it left me in darkness.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117300">
     'Yes, close it,' he replied, in his familiar voice.  'There, that is pure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117310">
     awkwardness!  Why did you hold the candle horizontally?  Be quick, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117320">
     bring another.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117340">
     I hurried out in a foolish state of dread, and said to Joseph--'The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117350">
     master wishes you to take him a light and rekindle the fire.'  For I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117360">
     dared not go in myself again just then.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117380">
     Joseph rattled some fire into the shovel, and went: but he brought it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117390">
     back immediately, with the supper-tray in his other hand, explaining that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117400">
     Mr. Heathcliff was going to bed, and he wanted nothing to eat till
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117410">
     morning.  We heard him mount the stairs directly; he did not proceed to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117420">
     his ordinary chamber, but turned into that with the panelled bed: its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117430">
     window, as I mentioned before, is wide enough for anybody to get through;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117440">
     and it struck me that he plotted another midnight excursion, of which he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117450">
     had rather we had no suspicion.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117470">
     'Is he a ghoul or a vampire?' I mused.  I had read of such hideous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117480">
     incarnate demons.  And then I set myself to reflect how I had tended him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117490">
     in infancy, and watched him grow to youth, and followed him almost
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117500">
     through his whole course; and what absurd nonsense it was to yield to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117510">
     that sense of horror.  'But where did he come from, the little dark
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117520">
     thing, harboured by a good man to his bane?' muttered Superstition, as I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117530">
     dozed into unconsciousness.  And I began, half dreaming, to weary myself
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117540">
     with imagining some fit parentage for him; and, repeating my waking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117550">
     meditations, I tracked his existence over again, with grim variations; at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117560">
     last, picturing his death and funeral: of which, all I can remember is,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117570">
     being exceedingly vexed at having the task of dictating an inscription
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117580">
     for his monument, and consulting the sexton about it; and, as he had no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117590">
     surname, and we could not tell his age, we were obliged to content
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117600">
     ourselves with the single word, 'Heathcliff.'  That came true: we were.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117610">
     If you enter the kirkyard, you'll read, on his headstone, only that, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117620">
     the date of his death.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117640">
     Dawn restored me to common sense.  I rose, and went into the garden, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117650">
     soon as I could see, to ascertain if there were any footmarks under his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117660">
     window.  There were none.  'He has stayed at home,' I thought, 'and he'll
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117670">
     be all right to-day.'  I prepared breakfast for the household, as was my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117680">
     usual custom, but told Hareton and Catherine to get theirs ere the master
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117690">
     came down, for he lay late.  They preferred taking it out of doors, under
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117700">
     the trees, and I set a little table to accommodate them.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117720">
     On my re-entrance, I found Mr. Heathcliff below.  He and Joseph were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117730">
     conversing about some farming business; he gave clear, minute directions
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117740">
     concerning the matter discussed, but he spoke rapidly, and turned his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117750">
     head continually aside, and had the same excited expression, even more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117760">
     exaggerated.  When Joseph quitted the room he took his seat in the place
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117770">
     he generally chose, and I put a basin of coffee before him.  He drew it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117780">
     nearer, and then rested his arms on the table, and looked at the opposite
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117790">
     wall, as I supposed, surveying one particular portion, up and down, with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117800">
     glittering, restless eyes, and with such eager interest that he stopped
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117810">
     breathing during half a minute together.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117830">
     'Come now,' I exclaimed, pushing some bread against his hand, 'eat and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117840">
     drink that, while it is hot: it has been waiting near an hour.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117860">
     He didn't notice me, and yet he smiled.  I'd rather have seen him gnash
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117870">
     his teeth than smile so.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117890">
     'Mr. Heathcliff! master!' I cried, 'don't, for God's sake, stare as if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117900">
     you saw an unearthly vision.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117920">
     'Don't, for God's sake, shout so loud,' he replied.  'Turn round, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117930">
     tell me, are we by ourselves?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117950">
     'Of course,' was my answer; 'of course we are.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117970">
     Still, I involuntarily obeyed him, as if I was not quite sure.  With a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117980">
     sweep of his hand he cleared a vacant space in front among the breakfast
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_117990">
     things, and leant forward to gaze more at his ease.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118010">
     Now, I perceived he was not looking at the wall; for when I regarded him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118020">
     alone, it seemed exactly that he gazed at something within two yards'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118030">
     distance.  And whatever it was, it communicated, apparently, both
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118040">
     pleasure and pain in exquisite extremes: at least the anguished, yet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118050">
     raptured, expression of his countenance suggested that idea.  The fancied
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118060">
     object was not fixed, either: his eyes pursued it with unwearied
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118070">
     diligence, and, even in speaking to me, were never weaned away.  I vainly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118080">
     reminded him of his protracted abstinence from food: if he stirred to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118090">
     touch anything in compliance with my entreaties, if he stretched his hand
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118100">
     out to get a piece of bread, his fingers clenched before they reached it,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118110">
     and remained on the table, forgetful of their aim.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118130">
     I sat, a model of patience, trying to attract his absorbed attention from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118140">
     its engrossing speculation; till he grew irritable, and got up, asking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118150">
     why I would not allow him to have his own time in taking his meals? and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118160">
     saying that on the next occasion I needn't wait: I might set the things
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118170">
     down and go.  Having uttered these words he left the house, slowly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118180">
     sauntered down the garden path, and disappeared through the gate.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118200">
     The hours crept anxiously by: another evening came.  I did not retire to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118210">
     rest till late, and when I did, I could not sleep.  He returned after
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118220">
     midnight, and, instead of going to bed, shut himself into the room
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118230">
     beneath.  I listened, and tossed about, and, finally, dressed and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118240">
     descended.  It was too irksome to lie there, harassing my brain with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118250">
     hundred idle misgivings.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118270">
     I distinguished Mr. Heathcliff's step, restlessly measuring the floor,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118280">
     and he frequently broke the silence by a deep inspiration, resembling a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118290">
     groan.  He muttered detached words also; the only one I could catch was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118300">
     the name of Catherine, coupled with some wild term of endearment or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118310">
     suffering; and spoken as one would speak to a person present; low and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118320">
     earnest, and wrung from the depth of his soul.  I had not courage to walk
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118330">
     straight into the apartment; but I desired to divert him from his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118340">
     reverie, and therefore fell foul of the kitchen fire, stirred it, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118350">
     began to scrape the cinders.  It drew him forth sooner than I expected.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118360">
     He opened the door immediately, and said--'Nelly, come here--is it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118370">
     morning?  Come in with your light.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118390">
     'It is striking four,' I answered.  'You want a candle to take up-stairs:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118400">
     you might have lit one at this fire.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118420">
     'No, I don't wish to go up-stairs,' he said.  'Come in, and kindle _me_ a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118430">
     fire, and do anything there is to do about the room.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118450">
     'I must blow the coals red first, before I can carry any,' I replied,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118460">
     getting a chair and the bellows.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118480">
     He roamed to and fro, meantime, in a state approaching distraction; his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118490">
     heavy sighs succeeding each other so thick as to leave no space for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118500">
     common breathing between.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118520">
     'When day breaks I'll send for Green,' he said; 'I wish to make some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118530">
     legal inquiries of him while I can bestow a thought on those matters, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118540">
     while I can act calmly.  I have not written my will yet; and how to leave
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118550">
     my property I cannot determine.  I wish I could annihilate it from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118560">
     face of the earth.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118580">
     'I would not talk so, Mr. Heathcliff,' I interposed. 'Let your will be a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118590">
     while: you'll be spared to repent of your many injustices yet! I never
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118600">
     expected that your nerves would be disordered: they are, at present,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118610">
     marvellously so, however; and almost entirely through your own fault.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118620">
     The way you've passed these three last days might knock up a Titan. Do
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118630">
     take some food, and some repose. You need only look at yourself in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118640">
     glass to see how you require both. Your cheeks are hollow, and your eyes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118650">
     blood-shot, like a person starving with hunger and going blind with loss
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118660">
     of sleep.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118680">
     'It is not my fault that I cannot eat or rest,' he replied.  'I assure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118690">
     you it is through no settled designs.  I'll do both, as soon as I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118700">
     possibly can.  But you might as well bid a man struggling in the water
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118710">
     rest within arms' length of the shore!  I must reach it first, and then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118720">
     I'll rest.  Well, never mind Mr. Green: as to repenting of my injustices,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118730">
     I've done no injustice, and I repent of nothing.  I'm too happy; and yet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118740">
     I'm not happy enough.  My soul's bliss kills my body, but does not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118750">
     satisfy itself.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118770">
     'Happy, master?' I cried.  'Strange happiness!  If you would hear me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118780">
     without being angry, I might offer some advice that would make you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118790">
     happier.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118810">
     'What is that?' he asked.  'Give it.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118830">
     'You are aware, Mr. Heathcliff,' I said, 'that from the time you were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118840">
     thirteen years old you have lived a selfish, unchristian life; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118850">
     probably hardly had a Bible in your hands during all that period.  You
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118860">
     must have forgotten the contents of the book, and you may not have space
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118870">
     to search it now.  Could it be hurtful to send for some one--some

     minister of any denomination, it does not matter which--to explain it,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118890">
     and show you how very far you have erred from its precepts; and how unfit

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118900">
     you will be for its heaven, unless a change takes place before you die?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118920">
     'I'm rather obliged than angry, Nelly,' he said, 'for you remind me of

     the manner in which I desire to be buried.  It is to be carried to the

     churchyard in the evening.  You and Hareton may, if you please, accompany

     me: and mind, particularly, to notice that the sexton obeys my directions

     concerning the two coffins!  No minister need come; nor need anything be

     said over me.--I tell you I have nearly attained _my_ heaven; and that of

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_118980">
     others is altogether unvalued and uncoveted by me.'

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119000">
     'And supposing you persevered in your obstinate fast, and died by that

     means, and they refused to bury you in the precincts of the kirk?' I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119020">
     said, shocked at his godless indifference.  'How would you like it?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119040">
     'They won't do that,' he replied: 'if they did, you must have me removed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119050">
     secretly; and if you neglect it you shall prove, practically, that the
    </p>

     dead are not annihilated!'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119080">
     As soon as he heard the other members of the family stirring he retired
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119090">
     to his den, and I breathed freer.  But in the afternoon, while Joseph and

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119100">
     Hareton were at their work, he came into the kitchen again, and, with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119110">
     wild look, bid me come and sit in the house: he wanted somebody with him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119120">
     I declined; telling him plainly that his strange talk and manner

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119130">
     frightened me, and I had neither the nerve nor the will to be his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119140">
     companion alone.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119160">
     'I believe you think me a fiend,' he said, with his dismal laugh:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119170">
     'something too horrible to live under a decent roof.'  Then turning to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119180">
     Catherine, who was there, and who drew behind me at his approach, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119190">
     added, half sneeringly,--'Will _you_ come, chuck?  I'll not hurt you.  No!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119200">
     to you I've made myself worse than the devil.  Well, there is _one_ who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119210">
     won't shrink from my company!  By God! she's relentless.  Oh, damn it!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119220">
     It's unutterably too much for flesh and blood to bear--even mine.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119240">
     He solicited the society of no one more.  At dusk he went into his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119250">
     chamber.  Through the whole night, and far into the morning, we heard him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119260">
     groaning and murmuring to himself.  Hareton was anxious to enter; but I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119270">
     bid him fetch Mr. Kenneth, and he should go in and see him.  When he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119280">
     came, and I requested admittance and tried to open the door, I found it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119290">
     locked; and Heathcliff bid us be damned.  He was better, and would be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119300">
     left alone; so the doctor went away.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119320">
     The following evening was very wet: indeed, it poured down till day-dawn;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119330">
     and, as I took my morning walk round the house, I observed the master's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119340">
     window swinging open, and the rain driving straight in.  He cannot be in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119350">
     bed, I thought: those showers would drench him through.  He must either
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119360">
     be up or out.  But I'll make no more ado, I'll go boldly and look.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119380">
     Having succeeded in obtaining entrance with another key, I ran to unclose
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119390">
     the panels, for the chamber was vacant; quickly pushing them aside, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119400">
     peeped in.  Mr. Heathcliff was there--laid on his back.  His eyes met
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119410">
     mine so keen and fierce, I started; and then he seemed to smile.  I could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119420">
     not think him dead: but his face and throat were washed with rain; the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119430">
     bed-clothes dripped, and he was perfectly still.  The lattice, flapping
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119440">
     to and fro, had grazed one hand that rested on the sill; no blood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119450">
     trickled from the broken skin, and when I put my fingers to it, I could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119460">
     doubt no more: he was dead and stark!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119480">
     I hasped the window; I combed his black long hair from his forehead; I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119490">
     tried to close his eyes: to extinguish, if possible, that frightful,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119500">
     life-like gaze of exultation before any one else beheld it. They would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119510">
     not shut: they seemed to sneer at my attempts; and his parted lips and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119520">
     sharp white teeth sneered too! Taken with another fit of cowardice, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119530">
     cried out for Joseph. Joseph shuffled up and made a noise, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119540">
     resolutely refused to meddle with him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119560">
     'Th' divil's harried off his soul,' he cried, 'and he may hev' his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119570">
     carcass into t' bargin, for aught I care!  Ech! what a wicked 'un he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119580">
     looks, girning at death!' and the old sinner grinned in mockery.  I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119590">
     thought he intended to cut a caper round the bed; but suddenly composing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119600">
     himself, he fell on his knees, and raised his hands, and returned thanks
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119610">
     that the lawful master and the ancient stock were restored to their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119620">
     rights.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119640">
     I felt stunned by the awful event; and my memory unavoidably recurred to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119650">
     former times with a sort of oppressive sadness.  But poor Hareton, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119660">
     most wronged, was the only one who really suffered much.  He sat by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119670">
     corpse all night, weeping in bitter earnest.  He pressed its hand, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119680">
     kissed the sarcastic, savage face that every one else shrank from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119690">
     contemplating; and bemoaned him with that strong grief which springs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119700">
     naturally from a generous heart, though it be tough as tempered steel.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119720">
     Mr. Kenneth was perplexed to pronounce of what disorder the master died.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119730">
     I concealed the fact of his having swallowed nothing for four days,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119740">
     fearing it might lead to trouble, and then, I am persuaded, he did not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119750">
     abstain on purpose: it was the consequence of his strange illness, not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119760">
     the cause.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119780">
     We buried him, to the scandal of the whole neighbourhood, as he wished.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119790">
     Earnshaw and I, the sexton, and six men to carry the coffin, comprehended
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119800">
     the whole attendance.  The six men departed when they had let it down
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119810">
     into the grave: we stayed to see it covered.  Hareton, with a streaming
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119820">
     face, dug green sods, and laid them over the brown mould himself: at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119830">
     present it is as smooth and verdant as its companion mounds--and I hope
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119840">
     its tenant sleeps as soundly.  But the country folks, if you ask them,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119850">
     would swear on the Bible that he _walks_: there are those who speak to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119860">
     having met him near the church, and on the moor, and even within this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119870">
     house.  Idle tales, you'll say, and so say I.  Yet that old man by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119880">
     kitchen fire affirms he has seen two on 'em looking out of his chamber
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119890">
     window on every rainy night since his death:--and an odd thing happened
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119900">
     to me about a month ago.  I was going to the Grange one evening--a dark
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119910">
     evening, threatening thunder--and, just at the turn of the Heights, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119920">
     encountered a little boy with a sheep and two lambs before him; he was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119930">
     crying terribly; and I supposed the lambs were skittish, and would not be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119940">
     guided.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119960">
     'What is the matter, my little man?' I asked.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119980">
     'There's Heathcliff and a woman yonder, under t' nab,' he blubbered, 'un'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_119990">
     I darnut pass 'em.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120010">
     I saw nothing; but neither the sheep nor he would go on so I bid him take
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120020">
     the road lower down.  He probably raised the phantoms from thinking, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120030">
     he traversed the moors alone, on the nonsense he had heard his parents
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120040">
     and companions repeat.  Yet, still, I don't like being out in the dark
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120050">
     now; and I don't like being left by myself in this grim house: I cannot
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120060">
     help it; I shall be glad when they leave it, and shift to the Grange.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120080">
     'They are going to the Grange, then?' I said.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120100">
     'Yes,' answered Mrs. Dean, 'as soon as they are married, and that will be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120110">
     on New Year's Day.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120130">
     'And who will live here then?'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120150">
     'Why, Joseph will take care of the house, and, perhaps, a lad to keep him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120160">
     company.  They will live in the kitchen, and the rest will be shut up.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120180">
     'For the use of such ghosts as choose to inhabit it?' I observed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120200">
     'No, Mr. Lockwood,' said Nelly, shaking her head.  'I believe the dead
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120210">
     are at peace: but it is not right to speak of them with levity.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120230">
     At that moment the garden gate swung to; the ramblers were returning.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120250">
     '_They_ are afraid of nothing,' I grumbled, watching their approach
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120260">
     through the window.  'Together, they would brave Satan and all his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120270">
     legions.'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120290">
     As they stepped on to the door-stones, and halted to take a last look at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120300">
     the moon--or, more correctly, at each other by her light--I felt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120310">
     irresistibly impelled to escape them again; and, pressing a remembrance
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120320">
     into the hand of Mrs. Dean, and disregarding her expostulations at my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120330">
     rudeness, I vanished through the kitchen as they opened the house-door;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120340">
     and so should have confirmed Joseph in his opinion of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120350">
     fellow-servant's gay indiscretions, had he not fortunately recognised me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120360">
     for a respectable character by the sweet ring of a sovereign at his feet.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120380">
     My walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of the kirk.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120390">
     When beneath its walls, I perceived decay had made progress, even in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120400">
     seven months: many a window showed black gaps deprived of glass; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120410">
     slates jutted off here and there, beyond the right line of the roof, to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120420">
     be gradually worked off in coming autumn storms.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120440">
     I sought, and soon discovered, the three headstones on the slope next the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120450">
     moor: the middle one grey, and half buried in the heath; Edgar Linton's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120460">
     only harmonized by the turf and moss creeping up its foot; Heathcliff's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120470">
     still bare.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120490">
     I lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120500">
     fluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120510">
     breathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever imagine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000026_120520">
     unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.
